T1  - The Effects of Migration on Evolutionary Dynamics in Natural Populations of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>
AN  - 2726454885
AB  - Understanding how major mechanisms of evolution, i.e. selection, gene flow, mutations, and genetic drift, shape natural populations is a major goal of evolutionary biology. Due to climate change, the environment and ranges of species are changing rapidly. Through rapid adaptation, populations can potentially respond to rapid environmental changes. Yet, how gene flow and rapid adaptation work together to shape natural populations is still an open question in biology. North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster provide a strong model to investigate this relationship as they exhibit latitudinal clines, low levels of variation, and rapid adaptation to environmental parameters that change rapidly with season.In this dissertation, I investigate the relationship between migration and rapid adaptation using D. melanogaster as a model system. I first demonstrate that migration may facilitate adaptation due to epistatic interactions through highly replicated laboratory and field experiments where evolutionarily realistic populations are manipulated to simulate a single migration event. I exposed populations to different temperature regimes and used parallelism in responses to determine the direction of the adaptive response. By comparing the responses of populations that received migration to controlled gene flow events and simulated expectations, I showed that migration events might facilitate adaptive responses. Finally, to demonstrate the ecological relevance of migration, I used population genetics and Bayesian inference methods to estimate the connectivity between geographically separate natural populations of D. melanogaster and I showed that mid- and long-range connectivity is likely.These results together demonstrate that migration can be an ecologically realistic mechanism that facilitates adaptive response in nature. The adaptive outcome depends on the genetic architecture of the fitness-associated traits that respond to dynamic selection pressures. This work integrates the phenotypes and their genotypic architectures to explain the evolutionary responses through highly replicated experiments in the laboratory and field. Together, this work represents a novel contribution to the analysis of evolutionary impacts of migration and gene flow in natural populations.

T1  - The Dissolution and Recovery of Critical Materials (Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and UF<sub>6</sub>) from Ionic Liquid
AN  - 2725631767
AB  - Lithium and uranium are critical materials in both the energy industry and for national security. Lithium is necessary for the next generation of batteries and 6Li is valuable for the production of tritium necessary for both fusion energy and to maintain our nuclear stockpiles. Uranium is a fuel source or precursor fuel source for commercially operating nuclear fission power. The monitoring of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) enrichment at foreign facilities is important for the monitoring of nuclear safeguards and enforcement of non-proliferation treaties. Recovery methods for lithium at the end of life of batteries are necessary to ensure abundance of the element for commercial use. The ionic liquid (IL), 1-methyl-1-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([MPPi][TFSI]) has an electrochemical window which encompasses the very negative (–3.04 V vs SHE) reduction potential of lithium. Pathways for direct and indirect dissolution of Li2CO3 into [MPPi][TFSI] were developed. The dissolved LiTFSI species was evaluated electrochemically. Two methods for recovery were explored. The first method consisted of holding the working electrode at one potential, and the second method pulsed the potential of the working electrode. Deposition was exhibited on both gold and several carbon electrodes. The recovered lithium was characterized using PXRD and SEM imaging. The f-elements also typically have negative reduction potentials that are difficult to achieve in aqueous systems and the metals are often produced in traditional molten salts. ILs have the potential to achieve recovery of f-elements without the need for molten salt systems which require high quantities of thermal energy and are corrosive. The direct dissolution of UF6 into [MPPi][TFSI] was completed. The characterization and stability of the dissolved species was evaluated. The UF6 was found to be stable in inert atmosphere in the [MPPi][TFSI]. Characterization was done using XAFS, UV-Vis, FT-IR, and Raman. Three routes for recovery of the uranium were completed. Two routes of recovery involved the precipitation of air and water stable uranium fluoride compounds. It was shown that uranium oxides could be obtained by heating the precipitates with available oxygen. The third route of recovery was electrochemically driven. This method achieved deposits of lithium hydride but was a low throughput method. Precipitates and deposits were evaluated through TGA, SEM-EDS, PXRD, UV-Vis, FT-IR, and Raman. Ultimately it was shown ILs could be used to stabilize the volatile UF6 for conversion to stable waste forms. It was also shown that UF6 in an IL could be shipped to another facility for recovery of the uranium for isotopic evaluation.

T1  - Copepods as a Model System for Exploring the Impacts of Climate Change on Marine Ectotherms
AN  - 2723566823
AB  - Marine ecosystems provide essential habitat to ecologically and economically impactful species and provide humans with a wealth of ecosystem services. With climate change, marine ecosystems are increasing in mean temperature and temperature variability. Marine ectotherms are vulnerable to this change and are important sentinels of warming, as their internal physiology is dependent on the external thermal environment.Copepods are marine ectotherms that play a critical role in trophic transfer and nutrient cycling. Importantly, copepods are relatively short-lived, allowing them to track ocean change as it happens. Together, these qualities make copepods a reliable model for understanding the impacts of global change on marine ectotherms. In this dissertation, I assess the impact of climate change on copepods through three strategies, 1) Examining the vulnerability of the nutrient rich copepod Neocalanus plumchrus to ocean warming, 2) Investigating the roles of plasticity and adaptation in copepod response to climate change stressors, 3) Testing the importance of latitude and life history stage in determining copepod thermal tolerance.My results reveal the nutrient rich copepod Neocalanus plumchrus and the numerically dominant copepod Acartia tonsa are potentially vulnerable to continued warming. Integrating ten years of plankton survey data with satellite temperature data, I find that thermal thresholds vary by copepod species and that the most nutrient rich species, Neocalanus plumchrus, has a relatively low upper thermal threshold for occurrence of 11.5°C. Additionally, results demonstrate that N. plumchrus abundance was reduced during the 2014-2016 marine heatwave. With experimental methods, I demonstrate that Acartia tonsa thermal tolerance is reduced after rapid salinity shock, indicating its susceptibility to simultaneous salinity and temperature change. Together these results indicate that copepods are vulnerable to continued climate change.My research also elucidates important determinants of thermal tolerance in the copepod Acartia tonsa. Using experimental evolution, I find that development at ocean warming conditions imparts the same level of thermal tolerance as >50 generations of ocean warming. Additionally, through field collections and two generations of common garden conditions, I find that thermal tolerance varies with latitude, with copepods from Maine having lower thermal tolerances than copepods collected in New York and Florida. Importantly, we also find that juvenile A. tonsa are more thermally tolerant than larvae and adults. These results highlight the importance of plasticity in defining thermal tolerance, emphasizing the importance of the developmental environment for marine ectotherms. Additionally, results reveal that thermal tolerance is specific to life history stage and latitude of collection.

T1  - Evolutionary Responses of Arthropods to the Novel Selective Pressures of Urbanization
AN  - 2720460596
AB  - Contemporary evolutionary change, once thought exceedingly rare, studied in the context of rapid urbanization and the novel selective pressures urbanization entails, provides a fortuitous albeit accidental, global experiment where evolutionary hypotheses can be tested with replication in real time. Cities are excellent venues to explore adaptation and evolution in response to novel selective pressures, and to examine the potential for rapid evolution along different dimensions of the phenotype. Here, I use common garden and reciprocal transplant approaches to examine evolved and plastic responses to urbanization in several focal traits for two arthropod taxa. Additionally, I assess whether evolutionary divergence between adjacent urban and rural populations has led to local adaptation and eco-evolutionary feedbacks. I focus on traits critical to persistence in the city?heat, cold, and desiccation tolerance, running speed, and body size interactions within several of these traits. I begin by examining body size in the acorn ant (<i>Temnothorax curvispinosus</i>) in relation to thermal tolerance, source population, and rearing temperature, finding that the evolution of heat tolerance and body size are decoupled in this system. I then examine the potential for evolution in heat and desiccation tolerance in response to urbanization in a terrestrial isopod (<i>Oniscus asellus</i>), finding support for the evolution of improved heat tolerance in urban populations, but no evidence for evolution in desiccation tolerance. Using this same isopod system, I next examine whether the urban populations? evolution in response to urbanization has conferred benefits in running speed (a trait critical for resource acquisition and predator avoidance) under chronic, stressfully hot rearing conditions. I find that the urban population has evolved higher running speed under stressful rearing temperatures. Lastly, I use a reciprocal transplant with the same isopod system to explore whether the urban populations? evolution is adaptive, and what ecological consequences this may have, finding evidence for local adaptation and countergradient evolution in feeding rate for the urban population. Overall, this work demonstrates the highly variable nature of traits in the face of novel selective pressures; despite strong selection, not all traits will evolve rapidly in response to novel selective pressures.

T1  - Behavioural Ecology and Population Dynamics of Freshwater Turtles in a Semi-Urban Landscape at Their Northern Range Limit
AN  - 2718814109
AB  - Species are faced with a variety of challenges in the environment, including natural challenges, such as variability in ambient temperature, and anthropogenic threats, such as habitat transformation associated with urbanisation. Understanding how animals respond to these kinds of challenges can advance the field of behavioural ecology and guide management decisions for wild species. Yet, we still have limited understanding of the extent of natural and human-caused impacts on animal behaviour and population dynamics, and lack robust assessment of behaviour in free-ranging animals. Using novel miniaturised biologging technologies, I characterised and validated behaviour in two freshwater turtle species: Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) and Painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). Further, I investigated how these two ectothermic species navigate a thermally heterogeneous landscape near their northern range limit, by comparing selected and available ambient temperatures. I showed that turtles preferred locations that were, on average, warmer and less variable in temperature than the available environment, and that this thermal sensitivity was greatest early in the year, and at fine spatial scales that likely matched the species' perception of the environment. Lastly, I assessed whether urban development was compatible with long-term viability of a Blanding's turtle population, by monitoring habitat change and turtle survival over one decade of ongoing residential and road development. I found that Blanding's turtle habitat quantity and connectivity declined in the area, which coincided with high road mortality and severe declines in turtle survival and population size, especially in adult females. I concluded that urban development and current road mortality rates are incompatible with the long-term viability of this at-risk turtle population. Overall, my findings demonstrate the importance of variation in the thermal environment and anthropogenic impacts on habitat in shaping the behaviour and population dynamics of this species-at-risk.

T1  - Investigating Interactions between Climate, Host Life History and Viral Diversity Across a Transhemishpheric Range of Marine Ecosystems
AN  - 2717980434
AB  - Marine infectious diseases and pathogens substantially impact the structure and function of marine communities by causing mortalities and altering host behaviors. The interactions between host and pathogen, determining the epidemiological outcomes are affected by many factors including climate, host life history, and human activities. Studies on marine disease epidemiology and ecology, including both natural and anthropogenic transmission pathways, are necessary for better understanding how these factors potentially influence the host-pathogen interactions. A significant proportion of marine pathogens are viruses; they cause severe infectious diseases and mortalities in many marine organisms, including crustaceans. Virus-related diseases and mortalities have been identified and reported in the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, for more than half a century. With a wide geographic distribution across both hemispheres and a temperature-dependent variable life history, blue crab and its pathogenic viruses constitute a well-suited pathosystem for investigating the potential influences of climate, seasonality, and host life history on viral disease emergence and spread in marine ecosystems.This dissertation applied the “blue crab-virus” pathosystem, to investigate factors that potentially influence the interactions between blue crab and its viral symbionts. The studies mainly focused on three objectives: 1) Investigate the influences of climate, seasonality, and host life history on the prevalence and disease ecology of a virus that is pathogenic to blue crab. 2) Assess the influences of climate, seasonality, and host life history on viral genetic diversity and genetic structures across a wide spatial and temporal range. 3) Characterize genome sequences and biological characteristics of newly identified viruses in blue crabs. The studies encompassed in this dissertation demonstrate, in a single host species, that climate, temperature, and host life history traits drive patterns of virus species diversity and genetic variation across the entire range of the host. One significant revelation was the evidence of long-distance movement of virus pathogen genotypes by human transport of infected blue crabs between states in the United States. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the potential for next-generation sequencing to discover and study the movement of known and newly discovered viruses in marine hosts.

T1  - The Role of Pre- and Post-Spawning Temperature Stress on Fertilization Dynamics Within Santa Barbara Channel Sea Urchin Species
AN  - 2716942211
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming an increasingly pervasive threat to marine ecosystems. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of future MHW events highlight the need to assess the adaptive capacity of marine organisms to such extreme events. While the massive mortality caused by MHWs is frequently observed, the sublethal consequences for reproduction and development serve as understudied areas of research. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism to change its physiology and/or morphology without alteration to the genome, presents an avenue in which the effects of MHWs can be transduced across life history stages. In this dissertation, I explored the impact of elevated temperatures associated with MHW events on the fertilization process and early development of two species of sea urchin found in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC).First, I used the purple urchin species, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to measure the effects of male thermal history on fertilization and early development. In the lab, male urchins were acclimated for one month to either non-MHW or MHW-like temperature conditions, as determined by temperature data collected in the SBC during past MHW events. Fertilization trials and offspring rearing were then conducted at both temperatures to assess sperm and developmental performance. While sperm appeared robust to elevated temperatures during fertilization, sperm produced by MHW-acclimated males had overall diminished fertilization capacity as compared to those acclimated to non-MHW temperatures. For early developmental stages, the effects of paternal temperature were masked by the influence of developmental thermal conditions, where elevated temperatures resulted in larger offspring. Alternatively, the thermal physiology of offspring was significantly influenced by the interaction of paternal and developmental temperatures. Here, offspring had a higher thermal tolerance when their developmental temperature matched that experienced by their sire, possibly hinting at an adaptive paternal effect. The influence of fertilization temperature on later developmental success was also explored in the summer-spawning sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus. For this experiment, fertilization trials were performed under one of three temperatures representing: ambient, current MHW, and future MHW temperature. The resulting embryos from each fertilization treatment were then split and raised under the three temperatures. Here, elevated temperatures during fertilization had largely negative effects on fertilization success and the performance of later developmental stages. The number of successfully hatched and gastrulated embryos, representing key stages of development in echinoderms, was significantly lower in embryos produced from fertilizations at both MHW conditions than those from fertilizations under ambient conditions. Overall, the results of this dissertation highlight the importance of the reproductive response to extreme events like MHWs. The carry-over effects within and across generations seen here, show that the stress response of individual life history stages should not be studied in isolation, and that the negative effects of MHW events may persist long after these events have passed.

T1  - Phenotypic Consequences of Adaptive Toxin Production and Resistance in Coevolutionary Partners
AN  - 2702876140
AB  - The effect that ecological interactions between species have on their evolution is an impactful but understudied area of research. The influence species have on each other’s evolution has taken on new relevance as anthropogenic change alters where, when, and how species interact. Partnered species that directly influence selection for traits in one another represent one such interaction where selection may be intense. In this case, evolutionary constraints and consequences are measurable in phenotypic traits that mediate the interaction. Antagonistic coevolution, which can arise between predator and prey, may influence traits directly responsible for survival and may favor the predator who only risks loss of a meal while their prey risk loss of life (e.g. life-dinner principle). When prey are dangerous, selection may be more balanced with both species exerting selective pressure on the other. This reciprocal selection can lead to rapid adaptation as predator and prey evolve to avoid deadly outcomes. However, specialized adaptations require a balance between cost and benefit. Evolutionary changes depend on existing genetic architecture and must maintain the function of essential traits. Thus, tradeoffs may arise, and they may limit the extent to which coevolutionary arms-race dynamics between predator and prey develop, determining which party will best the other.	In the western U.S., toxic Pacific newts (Taricha) are defended by a highly potent neurotoxin. This neurotoxin makes them too dangerous for nearly all vertebrates to consume. Taricha are defended by tetrodotoxin (TTX) which blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) and inhibits nerve activation and muscle function, typically leading to death by respiratory failure. Amazingly, multiple species of garter snakes (Thamnophis) have adapted to overcome this defense, harboring mutations that prevent TTX from binding to its target. These mutations, however, also decrease protein and muscle function, which suggests garter snakes may suffer evolutionary tradeoffs. Due to the severity of effects that sodium channel mutations cause in humans, we expect that altering a trait that is highly conserved across vertebrates would have similar costs in snakes. However, many specialized adaptations evolve repeatedly. For example, TTX resistance has evolved independently at least three or four times in Thamnophis, which suggests selection may favor specialization in specific environments. We first measured a key physiological process, standard metabolic rate, to investigate whether specialized adaptations in toxin-resistant garter snakes affect baseline energy expenditure. In snakes, skeletal muscles power ventilation which influences metabolism, so inefficiencies of sodium channels in these muscles might impact whole-animal energy expenditure. Because sodium channels are membrane-bound proteins, suboptimal temperatures may increase membrane rigidity, further altering sodium channel conformation and exacerbating inefficiencies of channel kinetics and performance. We measured standard metabolic rate in two species, Th. atratus and Th. sirtalis. Because these two species independently evolved tetrodotoxin resistance through unique mutations, we can treat them as natural replicates with distinct underlying genetics and potential physiological costs. Despite our expectations, neither resistance phenotype nor sodium channel genotype affected metabolism, and resistant snakes did not perform worse under suboptimal body temperature. Instead, Th. atratus and Th. sirtalis had nearly identical rates of mass-adjusted energy expenditure at both temperatures, despite differing eco-morphologies, life histories, and distant phylogenetic positions. We then examined whether biophysical tradeoffs in a gene of major importance impact whole-animal performance by measuring speed, endurance, and antipredator behavior in three Thamnophis species with an array of Nav genotypes and corresponding resistance phenotypes. We predicted that resistant snakes with weaker underlying skeletal muscles would be slower, with lower endurance, and they would rely on less energetically costly but riskier antipredator defensive behavior rather than attempting to flee. Contrary to our predictions, we found little evidence that protein and muscle costs impact sprint or endurance abilities. However, some TTX-resistant animals differed in time spent in evasive versus defensive behavior. Taken together, our results suggest that TTX-resistant snakes might exhibit compensatory mechanisms to offset the costs of mutations. Finally, we sought to understand how Pacific newts balance the cost of toxin production and maintenance, as well as foraging for carotenoid pigments to produce both TTX and warning coloration. When threatened, Taricha assume a specific defensive posture known as the ‘unken reflex’ in which they display bright orange bellies against a dark dorsal surface. Because newts are defended by TTX, this behavior is assumed to be an aposematic signal to warn predators that an attack would be unprofitable or even fatal. However, there have been no analyses of pacific newt coloration, so it is unknown whether coloration in Taricha is qualitatively honest (signaling toxic defense) or quantitatively honest (signaling toxin level). We measured ventral color and brightness as well as the contrast between ventrum and dorsum for two species (T. granulosa, T. sierrae) within and across populations. We predicted that contrasting body regions exposed during unken reflex would be visible to predators (qualitatively honesty) but would not correlate with toxin level (quantitatively dishonest). Using two color-capture methods (spectrometry and hyper-spectral imaging), we found support for a model of qualitative honesty but did not find quantitative honesty in the form of correlation between any colorimetric and toxin level at either the intra- or interpopulation level for either species. These three projects address if and how tradeoffs impose constraints on the pace and outcomes of adaptive evolution. Despite clear negative protein performance impacts stemming from a beneficial adaptation in toxin producing newts and their resistant garter snake predators, neither showed evidence of whole-animal tradeoffs. The geographic mosaic of coevolution between these species is comprised of populations where snakes are sufficiently resistant that they could survive eating any newt they encounter as well as populations in which newts could incapacitate and escape any garter snake. It may be that the existence of these extreme levels of toxin production and toxin resistance provides enough evidence that newts and snakes are able to compensate for underlying physiological costs before they impose tradeoffs at the whole-animal level, allowing the arms-race to continue.

T1  - Electrochemical and Thermal Chemistry of Carbon Species
AN  - 2702489531
AB  - In this work, the allotropes of carbon and biologically derived hydrocarbons are utilized as scaffolding for surface functionalization, as electron emitters, as feedstock for fuel production, and as inert anode material. The introduction of this thesis will discuss the relevant properties of carbon and its allotropes as well as the motivation for research into each of these applications. This will be followed by four more chapters, each detailing projects dedicated to exploring these applications in detail. For the first project, a method for grafting an organic spin-tag to diamond at a tunable distance from the surface for the development of spin-based chemical sensors is presented. This method involves the radical-initiated grafting of vinyl-terminated organic acids to hydrogen terminated diamond surfaces, followed by EDC-initiated crosslinking of 4-amino-TEMPO to form a stable amide linker. The diamond surfaces are characterized by dynamic light scattering(DLS) and Zeta-potential measurements, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The impact of air-annealing nanodiamond surfaces prior to functionalization is also presented, as well as a novel method for characterizing the density of spin-active tethered spin-probes on the nanodiamond surface. For the second project, a method for spectroscopically detecting solvated electrons emitted from a diamond surface is presented. The relevant operating parameters, limit of detection, and theoretical impacts of dissolved aqueous species are discussed. My contribution to this work was designing and fabricating a custom transient absorption spectrometer and sample mount, as well as collecting data on the voltage-dependance of solvated electron emission from diamond. For the third project, computational analysis and literature review is presented detailing a novel method for the generation of H2 and sulfur-enriched biochar from biomass. This process utilizes the unique property of elemental sulfur (Sx where x = 2 – 8) to dehydrogenate hydrocarbons leaving behind unreacted carbon biochar. The sulfur-dehydrogenation reaction of cellulose releases more theoretical energy than is needed to decompose the generated H2S into its elements at STP. The goal of this project is to develop a method that utilizes as much of the energy from the sulfur-dehydrogenation of biomass as possible to decompose H2S. There generated Sx may be recycled to make the process cyclic, while the H2 gas may be used as a carbon-negative source of fuel. The co-produced sulfur-enriched biochar may also be used as a soil amendment and fertilizer. This method starts with the dehydrogenation of woody biomass or municipal solid waste to form sulfur-enriched biochar and H2S, along with some CS2 and CO2depending on reaction conditions and feedstock. The H2S ((g) and CS2 ((g) are decomposed through reaction with SO2 ((g) (Claus process) to form elemental S (l) and H2S ((g). Some of the regenerated Sx is then oxidized into SO2 by refluxing sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The SO2 formed is then electrochemically oxidized to regenerated H2SO4 in a depolarized electrochemical cell for the generation of H2 gas. To the best of our knowledge, this this the first time that these chemical processes have been combined to produce H2 gas from biomass. In the fifth chapter, a novel method for the generation of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) from biomass and elemental nitrogen (N2) is presented. Instead of producing H2 like the last project, this project aims to use biomass derived H2S as a feedstock for NH3 production. This is achieved through a thermochemical looping cycle operating at atmospheric pressure. This cycle starts with the reduction of N2 gas by lithium (Li) to form lithium nitride (Li3N), which in turn reacts withH2S in a flux of molten salt at or above 475 °C to form NH3 and dissolved lithium sulfide (Li2S)ions. The sulfide ions generated by this process are oxidized on an anode of consumable steel or non-consumable graphite to generate Sx gas, which is then removed from the system. The H2Smay be generated through the dehydrogenation of biomass to form sulfur-enriched biochar, a potential soil-amendment and fertilizer. All chemical reactions in this cycle are both exergonic and exothermic except for the electrolysis of Li2S which has a theoretical decomposition voltage of 1.97 V at 475 °C. During electrolysis of Li2S, the formation of soluble polysulfide anions, which are reactive to elemental S, inhibit the removal of S from the melt and act to shuttle charge in the electrochemical cell. Future work will focus on methods to overcome these problems associated with the formation of polysulfides.

T1  - Evolutionary Dynamics of Rapid, Microgeographic Adaptation in an Amphibian Metapopulation
AN  - 2696106855
AB  - Wild organisms can rapidly adapt to changing environments, even at fine spatial scales. This fact prompts hope that contemporary local adaptation may buffer some of the negative anthropogenic impacts to ecosystems. However, there are limits to the pace of adaptation. Understanding the adaptive potential—and limitations—of individual species at fine-resolution is an important task if we hope to accurately predict the repercussions of future climate and landscape change on biodiversity. My dissertation takes advantage of an uncommonly long-observed and closely-studied system to paint a comprehensive picture of evolution over time in association with shifts in ecological contexts.In this dissertation, I show evidence of rapid, microgeographic evolution in response to climate within a metapopulation of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). Critically, I show that populations separated by tens to hundreds of meters—well within the dispersal ability of the species—exhibited considerable shifts in development rates over a period of two decades, or roughly 6-9 generations. Using historical climate data and new methods of assessing landscape change, I show that these changes were mainly a response to warming climates.The ecological contexts experienced by the metapopulation are associated with the evolution of physiological rates. Specifically, I show that climate change seems to have caused a counter-intuitive delay in spring breeding phenology while drought and warming later in the larval development period correspond with a shift toward earlier metamorphosis. The picture that emerges is of a contracting developmental window, which is expected to select for faster intrinsic development rates.Superimposed on the metapopulation-wide shift to faster development was a pattern of counter-gradient variation reflecting a similar pattern seen two decades prior. Furthermore, I empirically demonstrate a trade-off between faster development and a swimming performance trait that strongly contributes to fitness. This trade-off helps to explain why intrinsic development rates vary spatially with pond temperatures, but in the opposite direction of the relationship with temperature over time.Though the evidence for rapid adaptation to climate change presented in this dissertation reveals that evolution can buffer populations from extinction, it also entreats caution. There is a clear trend of demographic decline among wood frog populations that experienced greater magnitudes of environmental change. In fact, the three populations that suffered local extinctions over the 20-year course of observations inhabited ponds characterized by the greatest change in temperature or canopy.

T1  - Distinct Strategies of Temperature Compensation in Pattern Generating Neuronal Networks
AN  - 2694375124
AB  - Rapid temperature fluctuations are a major challenge to neuronal function. Among other effects, temperature changes cause an imbalance of ionic conductances that are key to neuronal and synaptic activity, leading to failure of neuronal function. This is a particular threat for ectothermic species that experience rapid environmental temperature fluctuations due to natural and climate change-induced extreme weather conditions. Thus, possessing physiological mechanisms to mitigate the effects of temperature changes is essential for survival. However, the limits within which neurons can respond adequately to temperature changes and the evolutionary pressures to temperature robustness are not well understood. 	I investigated temperature responses in the pyloric and gastric mill central pattern generators (CPGs) of the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS). These CPGs control aspects of feeding, serving a vital function in survival. Pattern generation in the pyloric CPG is achieved through an escape mechanism, where intrinsic properties allow the pacemaker neurons to escape an inhibited state. The gastric mill CPG activity resembles a release mechanism for pattern generation where network interactions allow the neuron to be released from an inhibited state. It is suggested that networks with different mechanisms for pattern generation are also differentially robust to temperature perturbation. If true, these network types may also have different strategies to mitigate temperature effects on network function.	In the pyloric CPG, models predict slow homeostatic and evolutionary processes may provide a way to prevent the imbalance of ion conductances through the regulation of ion channel expression in pyloric neurons to enable temperature robustness when environmental temperatures change. The same line of arguments also predicts that species that live in different habitat temperatures should show a distinct response to temperature changes. This thesis addresses the question if species' habitat temperatures affect neuronal temperature responses and robustness against failure. Using a comparative approach, I recorded the pyloric and gastric mill rhythms across temperatures in three related crab species that live in distinct habitats: Cancer borealis, Cancer magister, and Carcinus maenas. I investigated the temperature effects on cycle frequency, phase relationships, and overall robustness of the pyloric rhythm to temperature in each of the species. 	The pyloric rhythm of C. maenas, which experiences a larger range of habitat temperatures and higher maximum temperatures than C. borealis and C. magister, showed the smallest rate of increase of cycle frequency with temperature. Its pyloric phase relationships were stable until the rhythm crashed at high temperatures but were unstable at low temperatures. In contrast, in C. borealis and C. magister, the pyloric phase relationships stayed stable even at the lowest temperatures tested but varied at high temperature even before the rhythm crashed.  Finally, the pyloric rhythm in C. maenas remained functional up to 33.4 ± 1.3°C (N=10), while in C. borealis the rhythm crashed at 26.9 ± 1.4°C (N=10) and in C. magister at 24.9 ± 3.7°C (N=9). Thus, species experiencing larger ranges and overall warmer habitat temperatures showed reduced responses to temperature and appear more resilient to warm temperatures, but at a cost to resilience at cold temperatures. 	As the network was perturbated by increasing temperatures, the breakdown of the pyloric rhythms also revealed differences between individuals within a species as well as between species: Each preparation crashed in its own idiosyncratic way, with distinct neuronal crash activities. This supports the hypothesis that the pyloric circuit is "degenerate", i.e., that various combinations of circuit and intrinsic properties exist that produce a functional rhythm. This degeneracy is then revealed by the temperature perturbation. 	In contrast to the pyloric CPG, the gastric mill CPG is suggested to require extrinsic modulation to achieve temperature robustness. Specifically, previous findings have demonstrated that increased neuropeptide release from the modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) rescues the main gastric mill CPG neuron LG (lateral gastric neuron) from detrimental temperature effects. However, the activity of MCN1 and the role it plays in providing robustness against temperature changes to the gastric mill CPG remains unknown. I recorded LG and MCN1 activities across temperatures and analyzed their firing frequencies. My results show that MCN1 firing frequency increased with increasing temperatures with a particularly strong correlation when the soma of MCN1 was exposed to the temperature changes. I also found that independently of the temperature condition, MCN1 firing frequency and LG firing frequency correlated, i.e., with higher MCN1 firing frequencies, LG showed higher firing frequencies. Since MCN1 excites LG via a neuropeptidergic synapse, this suggests that increases in MCN1 firing frequency modulates LG to increase its activity and maintain the gastric mill rhythm at elevated temperatures. However, my results show that despite higher MCN1 firing frequencies at elevated temperature, there was no clear increase of the maximum temperature at which the gastric mill rhythm can function, contradicting this hypothesis. Ultimately, the results show that the pyloric CPG and gastric mill CPG, two networks with different mechanisms of pattern generation, also have different strategies for mitigating detrimental temperature effects on network function.

T1  - Future Ocean Warming and Acidification: Simultaneous Impacts on the Green Crab <i>Carcinus Maenas</i>
AN  - 2689287641
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is gradually provoking ocean warming and acidification, noticeable even at a small temporal scale. The available literature indicates varying responses of different species to the exposure levels indicated by climate predictions. Thus, perceiving the responses of key species to such climate changes is critical to determining how the marine environment may be affected in the future and develop measures to increase their resilience. This study investigated combined effects of predicted levels of ocean warming and acidification on some fitness-linked species traits and responses such as the mechanical properties of Carcinus maenas shell, crabs’ predatory behaviour, metabolic rates (O2 consumption) and activity of neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) and energy production (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH) enzymes. The crabs were exposed for 30 days to six treatments resulting from the combination of two pH levels (ambient: 8.02; low: 7.88) and three temperatures (18 ºC. 22 ºC and 26 ºC). The experimental pH and temperatures were selected according to the recent predictions of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). During exposure, the mortality, predatory behaviour and metabolic rates were assessed. Metabolic rate measurements focused on two conditions of O2 consumption: when animals were fed and when they were deprived from eating by 48h prior to the measurements. Predatory behaviour trials consisted in investigating the number of feeding attempts of C. maenas on Mytillus sp, from collected nocturnal videos using animals from each treatment, after 12, 18 and 24 days after exposure on the mesocosms. After exposure biological sampling was done: carapace was used to assess possible effects on the calcifying structure and organs and tissues were removed to determine the activities of AChE (ganglion and muscle), LDH (muscle) and IDH (muscle). Different interactions between pH and temperature were observed across measurements. Whereas significant effects of pH were observed in carapace hardness and width, temperature seems to have a preponderant effect on IDH activity and crab survival despite pH treatments. This study suggested synergistic negative effects of these climate change drivers on some of the responses, although on overall the resilience of this species is high probably enough to cope with the stress resulting from near future warming and acidification trends.
Alternate abstract:As alterações climáticas estão gradualmente a aumentar o aquecimento e acidificação da água do mar. A literatura disponível indica respostas variadas de diferentes espécies à exposição aos níveis indicados pelas previsões climáticas. Assim, perceber as respostas de espécies-chave às mudanças climáticas é fundamental para determinar como o ambiente marinho poderá ser afetado no futuro e planear possíveis medidas de proteção que aumentem a sua resiliência a estas alterações. No presente estudo foram investigados os efeitos combinados de níveis aquecimento e acidificação do oceano nas propriedades mecânicas da carapaça de Carcinus maenas e também no comportamento predatório dos caranguejos, na sua taxa metabólica (consumo de O2) e na atividade de enzimas relacionada com a neurotransmissão colinérgica (acetilcolinesterase, AChE) e a produção de energia (lactato desidrogenase, LDH, e isocitrato desidrogenase, IDH). Os caranguejos foram expostos por 30 dias a seis tratamentos resultantes da combinação de dois níveis de pH (ambiente: 8.02; baixo: 7.88) e três temperaturas (18 °C, 22 °C e 26 °C). Os níveis de pH e temperatura foram selecionados a partir das previsões recentes efetuadas pelo Painel Internacional sobre Mudanças Climáticas (IPCC). Durante a exposição, foram analisadas a mortalidade, o comportamento predatório e a taxa metabólica. A avaliação da taxa metabólica focou-se em duas condições de consumo de O2: quando os animais eram alimentados e quando eles eram privados de comer por 48h antes das medições de consumo. A avaliação do comportamento predatório consistiu em investigar o número de tentativas de alimentação de C. maenas sobre Mytillus sp, a partir de vídeos noturnos obtidos com animais de cada tratamento, após 12, 18 e 24 dias de exposição nos mesocosmos. Após a exposição, também foram recolhidas amostras biológicas: a carapaça foi usada para avaliar os efeitos na estrutura calcificante e os órgãos e tecidos foram removidos para determinar a atividade das enzimas AChE (em gânglio e músculo), LDH (músculo) e IDH (músculo). Os resultados obtidos revelaram efeitos significativos de diminuição de pH na dureza e no crescimento da carapaça, e diminuição na atividade da IDH e na sobrevivência do caranguejo. Este estudo revelou efeitos negativos sinergéticos em algumas das respostas devido a estes fatores de mudança climáticas. No entanto, em geral, a resiliência desta espécie será provavelmente alta o suficiente para lidar com o stress resultante de tendências de aquecimento e acidificação num futuro próximo.

T1  - Observed Genetic Diversity of Wild and Hatchery Propagated Chinook Salmon at Critical Genes of the Immune System
AN  - 2685022581
AB  - Genetic diversity plays a vital role in the adaptability of salmon to changing environmental conditions that can introduce new selective pressures on populations. Variability among local subpopulations may increase the chance that certain advantageous genes are passed down to future generations to mitigate susceptibility to novel diseases, warming oceans, loss of genetic stocks, and ocean acidification. Class I and II genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are crucial for fitness of Chinook salmon due to the role they play in disease and pathogen resistance. The objective of this study was to assess the DNA sequence variability among wild and hatchery populations of Alaskan Chinook salmon at the class I α1 and class II β1 exons of the MHC. We hypothesized the 96 wild samples taken from the Deshka River would display greater levels of observed heterozygosity (Ho) relative to expected heterozygosity (He) in suggesting that individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating patterns. Conversely, since no mate selection occurs in the William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish hatchery, we would not expect to see this discrepancy (He = Ho) in the 96-hatchery fish tested in this study. Alternatively, we hypothesize that post mating selection is driving higher levels of observed heterozygosity as opposed to mate selection. If this is the case, we will observe higher than expected levels of heterozygosity among hatchery salmon. Both populations displayed higher levels of observed heterozygosity than expected heterozygosity at the Class I and II loci but genetic differentiation between the spatially distinct communities was minimal. Class I sequences showed evidence of Balancing selection, despite high rates of non-synonymous substitutions observed, specifically at the peptide binding regions of both MHC genes.

AB  - The warming of our planet is unevenly distributed. In inherently hot and hyper-arid countries like Kuwait, temperatures are already soaring to unprecedented record-high levels and not a lot is known about what climate change could mean for populations in similar regions. While population health data from this region is lacking, climate change may push the limits of human adaptability as temperatures get hotter and hotter. Additionally, because of its desert climate, we also see dramatic dust storms very frequently in Kuwait to the point that the small country now ranks among the top countries in the world in terms of annual dust deposition rates. 
This dissertation generates critical information for local authorities in Kuwait and other similar hyper-arid hot regions that can guide many decisions on dust storms and climate change response by identifying and quantifying major sources of particulate pollution and exploring vulnerabilities to climate change from this part of the world. 
In the first paper, a comprehensive particulate pollution analysis was carried out in Kuwait. We found that regional pollution was a major contributor to fine particulate matter levels, followed by dust storms and resuspended road dust. We showed that, independent of dust storms, the sizeable regional anthropogenic particulate sources warrant national and regional mitigation strategies to ensure compliance with air quality standards. 
In the second paper, we showed that by 2060, the average temperature in Kuwait is predicted to increase by 1.80°C (moderate climate change scenario) to 2.57°C (extreme climate change scenario), compared to the first decade of this century (2000-2009). Climate change induced warming, even under more optimistic mitigation scenarios, will markedly increase heat related mortality in Kuwait. Those who are already vulnerable, like migrant workers, could borne a larger impact from climate change.
Across all borders, climate change, however, cannot be solely examined in one country. Global mortality burden, in general, is significantly driven by cardiovascular disease. It is the leading cause of death. Despite the abundance of historical mortality-specific data, we still do not know how ambient temperatures in many regions in the world (including inherently hot regions) affect specific causes of cardiovascular deaths.
This dissertation examines the relationship between extreme temperatures and specific causes of cardiovascular death such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure and arrythmia, using the largest ever assembled global dataset from 27 countries and 567 cities that include tens of millions of cardiovascular deaths with a wide geographical coverage and a range of climates.
In the third paper, we show that extreme heat and cold temperatures were associated with increased risk of dying from any cardiovascular cause, ischemic heart disease, stroke and heart failure. We estimate that for every 1,000 cardiovascular deaths, 2 and 9 excess deaths are attributed to extreme hot and cold days, respectively. Across that large, multinational sample, our results warrant public health and clinical attention in the present day and under a changing climate.

T1  - The Nature of Phenotypes: Provoking and Measuring the Dynamic Processes of Swarm Expansion, Predation, and Antibiotic Resistance in <em>Myxococcus xanthus</em>
AN  - 2678811314
AB  - The question of how genotype affects phenotype has fascinated and puzzled scientists for generations. Regardless of organism, the correlation between observation and underlying condition is necessary for scientists to understand the world around us. Myxococcus xanthus, a fascinating organism with a large genome (7,314 genes), is known for complex social behaviors and is an excellent model system for the study of this relationship. Upon starvation, M. xanthus cells condense into large multicellular aggregates to await renewed nutrient availability. M. xanthus cells swarm together on surfaces as a predatory biofilm, lysing and killing prey as a singular unit. During predation, swarms display dynamic multicellular patterns called ripples. Individual cells also retain the ability to move independently, leaving behind a slime trail for other cells to follow. This creates complex flare structures at the edge of multicellular swarms. The first part of this thesis addresses the problem of genotype-to-phenotype accuracy in complex organisms. Using 50 single gene knockout M. xanthus strains, I performed the traditional motility phenotype assay as well as a novel motility phenotype assay under magnification. Comparison of these results demonstrates not only that genes not related to motility machinery can induce a motility phenotype, but also that motility phenotypes are dynamic and can change over time. Additionally, I demonstrate that motility phenotype can change significantly when swarms move over prey, as opposed to simple agar surfaces. This more in-depth analysis allows for phenotypic classification of knockout strains previously thought to be without phenotype. The complexity of the M. xanthus genome is not only responsible for its incredibly complex multicellular phenotype, but for its potential use as a model for the study of antibiotic resistance and production of novel antibiotic compounds. The production of secondary metabolites like antibiotics is not ubiquitous in bacteria. The unique resources or “building blocks” required for their manufacture as well as their complicated molecular scaffolds restricts their production to more complex organisms like M. xanthus. The laboratory-friendly and non-pathogenic nature of M. xanthus adds another category to its list of interesting attributes. By sharing many qualities with pathogenic bacteria while remaining a biosafety level one organism, M. xanthus represents a unique opportunity to study how antibiotic resistance is obtained, maintained, and compensated for in a complex genome.	The second part of this thesis studies M. xanthus’ usefulness in the fight against antibiotic resistance. I created strains of M. xanthus resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics. Some were exposed to initially low concentrations slowly building over time while others experienced higher antibiotic concentrations over a shorter period. The creation of these strains, simulating the manner in which pathogenic bacteria may gain resistance to antibiotics in vivo, allowed for a laboratory-friendly study of phenotypes and fitness costs associated with varying levels of resistance. I also supply preliminary proof of antibiotic-resistant M. xanthus’ utility as a general heterologous host for novel antibiotics. Upon introduction of the oxytetracycline gene cluster, resistant strains were significantly more likely to retain the plasmid than WT. These results represent an important step in both understanding how and why antibiotic resistance arises in complex bacteria as well as a potential mechanism for novel antibiotic discovery.

T1  - The Effects of Spontaneous Mutation on the Response of <em>Caenorhabditis elegans </em>to Environmental Stimuli
AN  - 2675697028
AB  - Mutation is the main cause of genetic variation and one of the most important driving factors to evolution. Whether a new mutation is fixed or lost in a population depends on its effect on the organism’s fitness, or fitness related traits. Mutations are mostly deleterious that reduce fitness, neutral with no or very little effect, or beneficial that increases fitness and leads to the adaptation of its carriers. Yet, mutations are of limited interest without knowing about genetic variation in nature. Experimental estimates of changes in trait means and variances in MA lines and comparing them with their wild-type ancestors enable us to better understand mutational effects on these phenotypes and to infer the strength and direction of natural selection. In this dissertation, I investigate the effect of mutation and selection on three phenotypic values in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . The three phenotypic traits I evaluated are 1) The influence of mutation and selection on the temperature-sensitive mortal germline (Mrt) phenotype in the nematode C. elegans, 2) Mutation, selection, and quantitative genetic architecture of susceptibility to bacterial pathogens, and 3) The heterozygous effects of spontaneous mutations on fitness in C. elegans. In addition, I examined a head-to-head comparison of three experimental methods of quantifying competitive fitness in C. elegans. The three methods are (A) "by eye" from a saved image, (B) from the same image using CellProfiler image analysis software, and (C) with a large particle flow cytometer (a "worm sorter").

T1  - Condition Dependent Germline Maintenance in Seed Beetles
AN  - 2673659223
AB  - The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate how costly adaptations promoted by sexual selection affect fertility and offspring quality through changes in germline maintenance. Germline maintenance, comprising mechanisms maintaining DNA-integrity and homeostasis within germ cells, is known to be costly and, therefore, may trade-off with other costly reproductive traits that are under sexual selection. However, sexual selection may also act on condition dependent traits that reflect the overall genetic quality of its bearer, in which case sexual selection for high quality mates may lead to improved germline maintenance. Using experimental evolution lines of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, evolving under three different mating regimes that manipulated the opportunity for sexual and natural selection, I show evidence indicating that sexual selection can lead to improved germline maintenance through selection on condition dependent traits. However, I also found evidence for the alternative hypothesis, suggesting that when sexual selection is much stronger than natural selection it may lead to excessive investment into mating traits that trade-off with and reduce germline maintenance. We present an RNA expression analysis suggesting 18 candidate genes responding to DNA-damage and sociosexual interactions that may be involved in trade-offs between sexual selection and germline maintenance. I also found that the fertility of males and females that evolved under intense sexual selection was more sensitive to heat stress, and male sensitivity of fertility to heat stress was genetically correlated to sperm competitive ability. This suggests a trade-off between male postcopulatory reproductive success and the thermal sensitivity of fertility. The increased sensitivity to heat was also reflected in the fertility of females, suggesting that female heat tolerance may have evolved via genetic correlations with sexually selected male reproductive traits. The work presented in this thesis shows that sexual selection indeed affects germline maintenance. Sexual selection can increase germline maintenance through selection on condition dependent traits. But at the same time, traits under sexual selection can trade off with aspects of germline maintenance. If traits evolved under sexual selection and only weak constraints by natural selection, evolved allocation shifts in response to sexual selection can lead to deleterious repercussions when stressful environmental conditions increase demands on germline maintenance. The results presented in this thesis highlight important aspects of how sexual selection affects condition dependent germline maintenance with significant implications for the maintenance of genetic variation, adaptive processes, and mate choice processes in species under sexual selection.

T1  - Snow as Structural Habitat for Wolverines in a Changing Arctic
AN  - 2642421389
AB  - Arctic snowpack provides critical wintertime habitat for animals to facilitate thermoregulation and avoid predators. Wolverines (Gulo gulo) are iconic among such animals, relying on snow burrows for resting sites and reproductive dens. Most of the knowledge regarding this mesocarnivore’s association with snow, however, has so far originated in more southerly latitudes. In this dissertation, I investigated Arctic wolverines’ behaviors associated with snow, focusing on how specific snow properties influence resting, habitat selection, and avoiding predators. Motivated by the paucity of published descriptions of wolverine resting burrows and reproductive dens on tundra, I first described terrain features and architecture of such sites. I found that resting burrows typically consist of a single tunnel leading to a resting chamber, sometimes associated with non-snow structure such as stream cutbanks and river shelf ice. By contrast, reproductive dens typically consist of longer tunnels associated with snowdrift-forming terrain. Second, I used GPS collar data from 21 adult wolverines, coupled with snowpack information at 10 meter pixel resolution, to evaluate wolverine habitat selection and movement response to snow depth, density, and melt status. I found that wolverines select deeper, denser snow, except when snow is melting, likely reflecting resting site use. Third, I developed a machine learning model to classify wolverine behaviors using tri-axial accelerometers based on direct observations of three captive wolverines, and applied this model to free-living wolverines in Arctic Alaska. I found that the model performs better when allowed to predict behaviors as “unknown,” and that it accurately predicts resting, food handling, running, and scanning surroundings. Finally, based in part on this classification model, I evaluated the extent to which wolverines’ use of snow burrows and surface beds for resting sites is influenced by thermoregulatory needs versus predation avoidance. I found evidence in support of both demands driving resting behavior; wolverines trade thermoregulation off against predation avoidance by resting on the snow surface on warm, sunny days, but use snow burrows on cold, dark days to meet both demands simultaneously. Collectively, this dissertation demonstrates the importance of Arctic snowpack to wolverines, a topic of increasing importance as the snow season shortens with climate change, and serves as a model for investigating behavioral processes associated with snow among other species.

T1  - Alternative Reproductive Tactics Associated with Variable Sensory Biology and Thermal Physiology in Male <em>Centris pallida</em> (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Bees
AN  - 2642410230
AB  - Climate change is predicted to cause significant increases in global temperatures that will place many species under temperature-dependent selection. The consequences of climate change may be especially severe for ectothermic species, which rely heavily on their environment to maintain a non-lethal body temperature. Little attention has been paid to the potential effects of climate change on variable morphology, physiology, or behavior within a species. Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) occur when there is categorical variation in the mating-related behavior or morphology of individuals of one sex within a population, and are ideal for investigating the impacts of the thermal environment on behavioral, physiological, or morphological variation. Males of the Sonoran Desert bee Centris pallida use ARTs and are dimorphic in both behavior and morphology. Large-morph males use a fixed strategy that relies on scent to locate mates buried underground. Small-morph males are behaviorally flexible, generally using visual cues to locate females in the sky but sometimes using the scent-based strategy. First, I characterized variation in neuroanatomy between large and small morph C. pallida males, demonstrating that relative investment in visual and olfactory peripheral processing regions support the different mate-location tactics used by the morphs. Next, I demonstrated that small-morph males have increased relative investment in eye size and ommatidia density, but reduced total ommatidia numbers, eye surface areas, and visual acuities compared to large males. These data suggest that both allometric constraints associated with body size and mate location behaviors correlate with external visual investment. Finally, I investigated physiology and morphological adaptations to the microclimates used by the morphs: large-morph males use a hotter microclimate near the ground while small-morph males hover several feet above the surface. Small-morph males have increased thermal tolerance compared to large-morph males, despite a cooler microclimate, suggesting they use a physiological thermal adaptation to survive high environmental temperatures. Large-morph males have increased reflectance of solar radiation on their dorsal, but not ventral, surface as compared to small-morph males, representing a morphological thermal adaptation to the high solar radiation and ambient temperatures experienced in their microclimate. Together, these data suggest that individuals within a species may vary significantly in their adaptive potential under climate change. Variation in morphological/neuroanatomical systems may support different behaviors for individuals within the same species, sex, and population. Unique thermal adaptations, physiological or morphological, may cause differentiation in the intraspecific selective effects of climate change with important implications for range shifts, intraspecific behavioral diversity, and species’ survival.

T1  - Using Genetic Approaches to Study Local Adaptation and Reproductive Success in Snow Buntings (<em>Plectrophenax nivalis</em>)
AN  - 2641052799
AB  - Genetic analyses can facilitate effective and timely conservation and management actions. Arctic-migratory species in particular are in need of conservation genetic insights as they are experiencing substantial population pressures due to the impact of climate change (and other anthropogenic effects) on processes that affect their survival and reproduction. Therefore, identification of genetic mechanisms driving population divergence and variation in reproductive fitness in such species is critical. The goal of this thesis is to examine reproductive isolation among breeding populations of an Arctic-migratory passerine, the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) and determine factors that drive local adaptation and variation in reproductive success in this species. Using neutral and functional genetic markers, I show substantial population isolation among six globally distributed snow bunting breeding populations that is primarily driven by high levels of genetic drift and stabilizing selection, but with divergent selection acting at key functional loci. While there were no significant predictors of within-pair reproductive success, I identify key male quality traits such as body mass, testosterone levels, and breast plumage as important drivers of extra-pair reproductive success, which ultimately contribute to realized fitness in snow buntings. My work highlights the population-specific responses that reinforce the importance of genetic variability of individuals and their subsequent reproductive outcomes. The information contained in this thesis, combined with the methodological approaches, will help direct conservation efforts at the among- and within-population levels to maintain genetic diversity and adaptive potential as rapid environmental change continues to threaten Arctic-migratory species.

T1  - Changing Environmental Conditions and the Response and Potential Adaptability of Freshwater Whitefishes
AN  - 2598072425
AB  - Changes in winter conditions, such as increased temperatures and decreased ice coverage, have been observed worldwide. The responses of many lake fish populations to changing winters are projected to be inadequate to counter the speed and magnitude of climate change. Such environmental changes have been hypothesized to explain the low recruitment observed in freshwater whitefishes (Salmonidae Coregoninae). My research focused on measuring the impact changing winter conditions may have on coregonine reproductive phenology and developmental and morphological traits to better predict changes in coregonine populations as a result of climate change.I used experimental incubation methods and modeling to explore how climate-induced changes in water temperature and ice coverage may impact coregonine adults during spawning and early-life stages within and among species. First, I experimentally evaluated the response of embryonic development to increasing water temperature for cisco (Coregonus artedi) from lakes Superior and Ontario, and vendace (C. albula) and European whitefish (C. lavaretus) from Lake Southern Konnevesi, Finland. Embryo survival, incubation duration, and length-at-hatch were inversely related to temperature whereas yolk-sac volume increased with temperature within study groups. However, responses varied in magnitude among study groups suggesting differential levels of developmental plasticity. Next, I quantified how cisco embryos from lakes Superior and Ontario responded to simulated changes in incubation light conditions representing 0–10 (high light), 40–60 (medium light), and 90–100% (low light) ice coverage. Embryo survival was highest under medium light, and light intensity had no effect on incubation duration. Increasing light intensity decreased length-at-hatch in Lake Superior but had no effect in Lake Ontario. Yolk-sac volume was positively correlated with increasing light in Lake Superior and negatively correlated in Lake Ontario. Contrasting responses between lakes suggest populations’ response to light is flexible. Furthermore, I analyzed different embryo incubation temperatures on post-hatching survival, growth, and critical thermal maximum of larval cisco from lakes Superior and Ontario. Larval survival and critical thermal maximum were negatively related to temperature, and larval growth was positively related to temperature. The magnitude of change was greater in Lake Superior than Lake Ontario for all traits examined, suggesting Lake Superior larvae may possess a more limited ability to acclimate to and cope with environmental change. Lastly, I used simulation modeling to investigate changes in reproductive phenology under climatic-warming scenarios for coregonine populations across the Laurentian Great Lakes and Europe. Models predicted that climate-induced increases in water temperatures may cause delayed spawning, shorter embryo incubation lengths, and earlier larval hatching.I quantified how climate change could affect coregonine populations, including changes in embryo development traits, reduced physiological condition of larvae, and shifts in reproductive phenology. Climate-induced responses of coregonines to changing environmental conditions are likely to vary within and among species and with the magnitude of climate warming. Management strategies that maximize phenotypic variability could improve the ability of coregonines to cope with environmental change.

T1  - Determining the Effects of Exogenous Human Chorionic Gonadotropin and Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin on Plasma Testosterone, Testicular Volume, and Semen Production in Leopard Geckos (<i>Eublepharis Macularius</i>)
AN  - 2689288274
AB  - Planet earth has now entered into its sixth mass extinction as a result of expanding human populations, posing an unprecedented threat to biologic diversity. Climate change, habitat fragmentation, wildlife trade, pollution, and biological invasions are just a few consequences of human activities that have directly contributed to unprecedented species extinctions. While widespread amphibian declines have gained more recent attention, it has been proposed that reptiles may be in even greater danger of extinction worldwide. Unfortunately, many reptiles are destined to go extinct before many of their basic biologic traits, including reproductive methods, have even been determined.  In order to mitigate the substantial loss to biodiversity that the impending decline of reptiles represents, development and employing additional methods of in-situ and ex-situ conservation strategies will be paramount. Although assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have been developed and successfully utilized in a handful of wildlife and domestic species, these techniques have been historically underutilized in reptiles. ART will not only enhance our understanding of reptile reproductive biology and physiology, but will facilitate conservation efforts in these species to overcome reproductive barriers and by preserving genetic material to protect biodiversity in the future.  The goal of this research was to use exogenous hormones in the male leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) as a model for the development of ART in geckos and other endangered lizard species. The study was conducted from September-December in the Northern Hemisphere. Single injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at 50 IU or 100 IU were ineffective at increasing plasma testosterone concentrations within 24 hours of injection. Electrostimulation was successfully used to collect serial semen samples. Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) (20 IU, 50 IU) effectively increased testicular volume, spermatozoa concentration, motility, and the prevalence of morphologically normal sperm. Unilateral orchidectomies were successfully completed and allowed for histologic assessment of the testicles and epididymides without necropsy. PMSG was not successful at increasing circulating plasma testosterone concentrations. Ultimately, there is still time to prepare and slow the rate of global reptile declines. The development and refinement of ART in reptiles can aid in this mission to preserve biodiversity for future generations.

T1  - Environmental Tolerance, Spread, and Diversification of the Sea Anemone Genus <em>Metridium</em>
AN  - 2689211373
AB  - Members of the sea anemone genus Metridium are widespread through the circumboreal waters of the northern hemisphere. Multiple populations of Metridium senile have been introduced to South America and also South Africa, but these populations and the ability of M. senile to be transported long-distances is not well understood. As marine species commonly exhibit minimal morphological variation, molecular studies have been instrumental in identifying divergence and relationships. My research seeks to describe and understand the processes driving the current distribution of the species within Metridium.Beginning with Chapter 1, I give an in-depth introduction to Metridium. In Chapter 2, I test the temperature and salinity tolerance of M. senile in Japan. I find that the tolerance of M. senile is very broad, particularly for a cold-water sea anemone, but that asexual reproduction only takes place within the comfortable temperature and salinity range. The ability of M. senile to withstand temperature and salinity fluctuations as it applies to being a successful invader is further examined in Chapter 3 through broadly looking at several species of sea anemones. In this chapter, I review and consolidate information on the ten most well-known species of sea anemones that have been introduced outside of their native range, and elucidate specific characteristics that are common among these species. I pair these characteristics with vector potential and suggest how conditions both at the new location and in transit facilitate the introduction of each these species.In Chapters 4 & 5, I move into examining relationships both at the species and population level within Metridium to answer questions directly related to their current distribution. Genetic data has not recently been used to elucidate relationships within Metridium; thus, with the rapid evolution of genomic scale data as applied to biogeographic questions, we can now apply these data to worldwide datasets. In Chapter 4, I test multiple types of genetic data on small test datasets of Metridium to determine which method would be most efficient to use to answer my remaining questions, and I find that sequence capture data provides high resolution at both the species level and at the population level. I apply this knowledge in Chapter 5 to a scaled-up dataset of Metridium (n=236) that encompasses both the native range and several introduced populations in the southern hemisphere to confirm species boundaries, explore the dispersal history, and assess the influence of anthropogenic activities on the current distribution and genetic structure. I identify that there are multiple introductions to the southern hemisphere oceans, and that the introduced populations are spreading to new areas. Within the native range, there is admixture between oceans due to transport of the species, and hybridization between Metridium farcimen and M. senile occurs in human-disturbed habitat.

T1  - Dry Reforming of Methane Using Microwave Irradiated Metal Oxide/Coal Char Catalysts
AN  - 2665129701
AB  - This research focuses on the synthesis of both shaped and amorphous powder materials, the combination of these materials with dried Powder River Basin (PRB) coal char, and their reactionary properties with methane and carbon dioxide gasses with conventional and microwave (MW) heating. The first goal of this project was to synthesize shaped micro and nano sized particles with ideal dielectric properties for converting electromagnetic energy into heat and proven capabilities of activating methane. These particles were synthesized via solvothermal, hydrothermal, and co-preceptory treatments alone and onto the surface of dried PRB coal char. PRB is a sub-bituminous, low-ranking coal (LRC) containing impurities processing ideal properties for heating using microwave radiation. MW irradiation of metal oxides and char improved conversion of reforming gasses (CH4 and CO2), reacting at lower temperatures than typically used with conventional heating methods. Lower DRM temperature parameters translate into diminished energy requirements, optimizing cost minimalization for a manufacturer. Outlet stream gases were monitored to examine effects of altering a particle’s morphology, size, and shape, and the products that evolve from these reactor experiments. Additionally, varying the wt% of the catalysts on the dried PRB coal char were tested. Characterizations were completed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-controlled desorption (TPD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), gas chromatography (GC), and transmission line and free space method dielectric testing on all the materials synthesized. The purpose of this research was to improve understandings and the development of low-rank coal char to fuel synthesis, evaluate solid/gas interactions between Mo-based metal oxides, PRB coal char, and reforming gases, analyze the effects of MW irradiation use in these reactions compared to conventional heating methods, observe the effects of metal oxide particle sizes/morphologies and their effects on reforming reactions, and increase future viability and applicability of these processes.

T1  - Effects of Maternal Stress on Physiology and Morphology
AN  - 2652595880
AB  - Environmental perturbations, such as the introduction of invasive species, can impose novel selective pressures on a variety of taxa. This can result in changes in fitness-relevant traits within an individual’s lifetime or across multiple generations that allow the species to better cope with the stressor. One important physiological response to the presence of a stressor is the release of hormones, such as corticosterone (CORT). CORT can trigger adaptive behavioral and physiological responses to a stressor, but prolonged exposure to CORT can have negative effects on the organism. Elevated levels of CORT in gravid females can also affect their offspring. Such maternal stress effects are becoming an increasingly important topic in the biomedical and ecological fields. Since maternal CORT can modify offspring traits, this could prepare offspring for high stress environments or, as is typically assumed in humans, could have detrimental effects on their health and survival. In our ever-changing world, understanding within- and cross-generational effects of exposure to novel stressors is critical to predicting and managing their consequences. My dissertation research tested the effects of CORT on various life stages and across generations using a system of native fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) and invasive fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). This is a useful system for testing this as fire ants are a newly introduced predator and prey of the lizards and represent a natural stressor that varies across populations, maternal CORT concentrations can be manipulated non-invasively, and fitness-relevant (i.e., health and survival) outcomes for mothers and offspring can be quantified. The endocrine-axis is highly conserved across all vertebrates, so the results of my research are applicable to other vertebrates, including humans. By manipulating CORT of gravid females, mimicking a naturally stressful encounter (e.g., with predators or heat stress), daily until they laid eggs, I was able to test the effects of this physiological response on traits of mothers and their offspring. The results of my dissertation research have contributed to our understanding of the effects of maternal CORT in three main ways. First, I reveal that maternal CORT impacts the physiology of offspring both within the egg and at 1 week old but does not impact the mother’s physiology. Second, I found that maternal CORT can alter offspring traits and allocation of resources from mother to offspring in sex-specific ways. Third, I show that the influence of stress within an organism’s lifetime is not as important as stress experienced across multiple generations. Overall, my dissertation addresses a number of important gaps in our understanding of the effects of maternal stress. The results of my work reveal that CORT produced in response to a stressor can affect how mothers allocate resources to their offspring, prioritizing daughters over sons, and can affect physiology (i.e., heart rate) of offspring even while still in the egg, which can affect survival relevant traits after hatching. I show that stress experienced by an individual’s ancestors trumps the stress experienced within its own lifetime with respect to the individual’s health and survival. Together, my research furthers our understanding of the factors that influence the health and survival outcomes of stress, which may also prepare offspring for the stressful environments they will be born into.

TT  - Efecto de la Diversidad Genética en la Respuesta al Estrés por Temperatura de Poblaciones e Individuos de <em>Mastrus ridens</em> (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae)
AN  - 2642889872
AB  - Genetic variability can affect the response of insects to variable and stressful environmental conditions. In this work we study the effect of genetic variability on population growth and fitness of populations and individuals of endogamic and exogamic lines of M. ridens (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), an important parasitoid of the apple moth (Cydia pomonella), when exposed to optimum constant temperatures (OT = 25ºC) or variable extreme temperatures (VT = 1 h at 33ºC, 20 min at 25ºC, 1 h at 6ºC and the rest at 25ºC) throughout their life. The population experiments were observed for three generations, while those individual female experiments were one generation and the L39 line for two generations.In the results we found that genetic variability does affect in part the capacity of populations and individual females to respond to variable and stressful environmental conditions. The associated parameters were: the total number of individuals generated and the number of sons. On the other hand, the lack of effects on the sexual radius suggests that the sex determination mechanism would not be a relevant factor in the adequacy in conditions of variable and extreme temperatures. These results highlight the need to carry out more biological suitability studies against natural enemies in stressful environments due to the contingency of climate change.Alternate abstract:El control biológico clásico tiene como objetivo disminuir las plagas invasoras por medio de la introducción de enemigos naturales desde la zona de origen de estas (Wanget al., 2019) y es común que en su desarrollo las poblaciones de enemigos naturales pasen por cuellos de botella (Hufbauer, et al., 2004; Retamal et al., 2016). Esto tiene un efecto negativo al disminuir el tamaño poblacional y la variabilidad genética, lo que puede resultar en una disminución de la adecuación biológica de los organismos en esas poblaciones (Szucs et al., 2017). Adicionalmente, debido al tamaño limitado de las poblaciones mantenidas en laboratorio, es probable que en muchas ocasiones ocurra la endogamia (Pray et al., 1994), causando deriva genética y la posibilidad de fijación de alelos perjudiciales (Hedrick y Kalinowski, 2000; Frankham, 1995), reduciendo la aptitud de la descendencia producto del apareamiento consanguíneo (Armbruster y Reed, 2005).La endogamia puede tener un efecto negativo en el establecimiento, crecimiento y en la persistencia a largo plazo de las poblaciones, aumentando así la probabilidad de extinción local de la especie, a diferencia de los cruzamientos exogámicos, que generalmente aumentan la probabilidad de establecimiento y persistencia de las poblaciones en el tiempo (Szucs et al., 2017). La pérdida en adecuación biológica producto de la endogamia se denomina “depresión por endogamia” (Hildner et al., 2003; Lande, 1988; Plough, 2012), y se ha documentado por más de un siglo en diferentes especies de plantas y animales (Hedrick y Kalinowski, 2000; Armbruster y Reed, 2005; Charlesworth y Willis, 2009). Diferentes autores han afirmado que la depresión por endogamia aumenta en ambientes estresantes (Cheptou et al., 2001; Kristensen et al., 2003; Hayes et al., 2005; Fox y Reed, 2011), ya que la expresión génica cambia (Armbruster y Reed, 2005) y es en estas condiciones donde los genes que permiten sobrellevar las condiciones de estrés deben expresarse.La endogamia ilustra la sinergia entre: genética, demografía y comportamiento. Esto implica la reproducción entre individuos genéticamente relacionados, conduciendo así a una disminución de la heterocigosidad (Hansson y Westerberg, 2002). Cuando las poblaciones son sometidas a ambientes variables, existen dos posibles mecanismos de respuesta; el primero es la plasticidad fenotípica y el segundo es la respuesta evolutiva. La plasticidad fenotípica permite a un organismo responder rápidamente a nuevas condiciones, manteniendo su adecuación biológica y se refiere 
a cuánto es capaz el entorno de modificar a la expresión fenotípica de una especie, dependiendo si se aplica a individuos o a genotipos (Sgró, et al., 2016; Auld, et al., 2009). La respuesta evolutiva poblacional se expresa en un plazo mayor, ya que implica un cambio en la constitución genética de la población debido a la selección a través de las generaciones (Sgró, et al., 2016).Debido a que los insectos son ectotermos, la temperatura (Tº) del ambiente es un factor importante, influyendo en muchos aspectos de la ecología y el desarrollo de los insectos (Easterling et al., 2000; Hansen et al., 2000). Las temperaturas extremas son estresantes y tienen efectos perjudiciales en la sobrevivencia y reproducción de los insectos (Rinehart et al., 2000; Malmendal et al., 2006; Hance et al., 2007; Terblanche et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2012). Los cambios de Tº también pueden influir en la biología de especies interactuantes, provocando una desestabilización en las dinámicas poblacionales (Van der Putten et al., 2004).

T1  - Improving the Urban Resource Nexus Through Urban Agriculture Systems with Biowaste Utilisation and Renewable Energy
AN  - 2636117746
AB  - The food systems in developed societies face a host of challenges in the early 21st century; increasing urbanisation, supply chain shocks due to extreme climate events and pandemics, high impacts of air freight, nutrient run-off and animal farming, and tremendous amounts of wasted food and nutrients. A transformation to a more sustainable and resilient food system includes, among other pathways, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, a localisation of food production and the recovery of nutrients in urban organic waste. Urban agriculture thus receives emerging research interest, ranging from community gardens to high-tech indoor farming. Efforts so far have focused on socio-economic aspects and life-cycle assessments of individual case studies or have described the qualitative potential of integrating urban waste streams into urban farming. Significant gaps remain in the literature about the carbon and land intensity of different growing methods when scaled-up and the quantification of productivity and nutrient recovery potentials. On the city and regional level, the design of productive food systems integrated with biowaste management and renewable energy systems has found little attention so far. These gaps are addressed in this thesis through mathematical modelling and geospatial analysis at multiple scales, including the facility, the urban area, a metropolitan area, and the regional level. The match of supply and demand of a scaled-up urban food production system and their organic waste flow utilisation potential was assessed and compared for two urban areas, Glasgow and Lyon. Potentially convertible land and rooftop space were determined with geospatial processing, and monthly biowaste utilisation in those new farms was optimised based on nutrient requirements and CO2 emission savings. The results showed that high self-sufficiency came with significantly increased CO2 emissions for the productive urban food system in the colder climate due to high demand and carbon intensity of electricity for greenhouses, which also negated the benefits of utilising a large share of the biowaste. The next project thus investigated the interplay and logistics of local composting treatment combined with low-input local farming for 76 districts in Porto from waste system perspective. Existing fields, convertible greenspaces, and compost island requirements were obtained from geospatial analysis and waste collection pilots and distance scripts informed collection and transport requirements to central facilities. The results showed that more remote districts could benefit both in cost and climate impacts from having their own decentralised biowaste systems, although mainly from collection route reduction rather than a conversion of greenspaces. Focusing more on the contextual sustainability of high-intensive growing methods, the energy consumption of electrified greenhouses and vertical farm facilities was assessed for ten regions across the globe. A rigorous thermodynamic model for lighting and air conditioning requirements was optimised for minimum specific energy in relation to the outside climate on an hourly basis. The outcomes showed that significant energy reductions can be achieved in greenhouses with optimised climate control, while local climate conditions and design choices still have a strong impact. Vertical farms, or plant factories, had significantly higher energy consumptions, even in extreme climates. The final project applied the learnings from the energy optimisation to a land-use based assessment of regionalised vegetable supply with renewable energy generation for nine city-regions. Potentially available land for energy generation was assessed, and the selection and sizing of solar PV and wind farms were economically optimised for the required electrical load. The results show that although greenhouse production requires oversized renewable energy systems due to higher load fluctuations, its land footprint is lower than that of open-field and vertical farming. The land use relative to existing and available land contextualised this finding, but a full regionalised vegetable supply was feasible and desirable for most of the regions. The implications from the work are that to achieve increased food self-sufficiency and climate change mitigation, energy-efficient and low-carbon urban agriculture approaches are indispensable. Recommendations for specific urban growing systems are strongly context-dependent and many transferable aspects of relevance to decision-makers have been quantified in this work. Further, the integration of biowaste mainly provides benefits from a holistic waste management perspective and thus a multi-stakeholder approach and commitments will always be required.

T1  - Radio-Frequency Atomic Magnetometry with a Rubidium Bose-Einstein Condensate
AN  - 2636096458
AB  - This thesis details progress in radio-frequency atomic magnetometry with ultracold rubidium atoms. Motivations and context are first covered, before an introduction of the main concepts required to understand the underlying physics is given. At first, a cold atom magnetometer is designed, built and characterised. Consistent 20 µK atoms are produced. Radio-frequency (RF) atomic magnetometry (AM) is performed by placing the atoms in a bias magnetic field and generating coherent precession with an external AC field. A noise floor at 330 pT/√Hz defines the sensor's sensitivity, with a range of applications. RF-AM is then performed with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The 20 µK atoms are loaded into a magnetic trap, where RF evaporation increases their phase space density (PSD = nλ^3dB, n is the density and λdB is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the atoms). Next, atoms are transferred into a hybrid dipole trap, collecting in a dimple created at the intersect of two high power laser beams. Production and stabilisation of these beams is described, which are focused down to a 75 µm beam waist at the trap position with a total power of 7 W. Optimisation of the evaporation process in both traps leads to consistent BEC production. A pure condensate with 4x10^4 atoms at 25 nK is reported. Radio-frequency magnetometry is performed at various probe volumes. With systematic optimisation a best AC sensitivity of 24 pT/√Hz with 3.4 × 10^8 atoms in the magnetic trap before evaporation is achieved. This is extended to the BEC with 4 × 10^4 atoms, where an AC sensitivity of 84 nT/√Hz and DC sensitivity of 14 nT/√Hz is reported, bringing previously achieved atomic magnetometry into the micrometer regime. A trade-off must be considered due to reduction in sensitivity at lower probe volumes. Volumes between 1.4×10−7 m^3 and 1.6×10−14 m^3 can be accessed, highlighting the sensors adaptability and tunability for different applications. The results are contextualised in the background of previously achieved magnetometers of various types. Finally, proof-of-concept electromagnetic induction imaging (EMI) measurements are made to confirm the sensor's viability for high resolution imaging.

T1  - The Mechanisms Underlying Sigh Generation in the PreBötzinger Complex Are Dependent on Neuroglial Interactions
AN  - 2628313438
AB  - Rhythm generation is a vital component of life. Rhythmic activity regulates the circadian clock, which controls hormonal cycles, sleep wake states, blood pressure, body temperature, and reaction times. Rhythmogenesis underlies breathing and produces several behaviors -such as eupnea, sighs, and gasps- that are critical to everyday life. Moreover, rhythmic oscillations have emerged throughout the brain that link these coordinated activities together. Gaining a better understanding of rhythm generation and the underlying cell activities that make up these behaviors can help to provide a better understanding of many diseases which originate from the disruption of these cycles. The breathing networks in the medulla are a fantastic model system for studying rhythm generation. These areas maintain their intrinsic rhythm generating properties in vitro for extended periods of time, providing valuable insight into how individual cells and ion channels contribute to producing complex breathing behaviors. The preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) in the ventral-lateral medulla is one of these rhythmogenic circuits. Within this circuit, three behaviors necessary for normal breathing arise- normal breathing ‘eupnea’, sighing, and gasping. This thesis primarily focuses on the generation of the sigh rhythm. Sighing is a critical element of normal breathing that has vital physiological functions. Sighs are deep augmented breaths that are critical for survival as they prevent collapse of the lungs, clinically referred to as atelectasis, by re-inflating collapsed alveoli. Furthermore, during sleep, sighs trigger arousal to hypoxic conditions and are more common during REM sleep and transitions between different sleep states. Indeed, reduced sighing has been reported in infants who have died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Sighing is also linked to higher-order brain function and emotions such as love, stress, exasperation, and is clinically tied to several anxiety disorders. These ‘augmented breaths’ occur at a rate of ~12 per hour in adults and much more frequently in infants. Sighs often occur as a superimposed burst overlaying the ongoing eupneic burst, giving the sigh its characteristic biphasic shape. Eupnea consists of three primary phases: inspiration, postinspiration, and active expiration, each hypothesized to be generated by an excitatory rhythmogenic microcircuit in the ventral lateral medulla. Evidence suggests that eupneic inspiration, gasping, and sighing are generated by the same breathing circuit, the preBötC. Yet, how the same neural circuit gives rise to two distinct rhythmic activities with separate timing characteristics remains unknown. The primary directive of this thesis is to provide a novel hypothesis for sigh generation.

T1  - Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Based Photoelectrochemical Systems for Efficient Solar Hydrogen Generation
AN  - 2619214049
AB  - Direct solar hydrogen generation (DSTH) is a promising method for renewable hydrogen generation, where solar energy drives the generation of hydrogen and oxygen by molecular dissociation of water on a catalytic or semiconductor surface. Despite an enormous amount of work over the last few decades, DSTH has not yet been implemented on large scale due to low efficiency and high costs. Techno-economic analysis of different solar hydrogen generation systems has identified the solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency as an important parameter for cost reduction. The US Department of Energy has set a target of 20% STH efficiency by 2020, and an ultimate goal of 25% using low-cost materials to ensure the economic viability of direct solar hydrogen generation for large scale hydrogen production.This thesis investigates perovskite-silicon tandem photovoltaic (PV) and earth abundant catalysts-based systems for low-cost, high efficiency direct solar hydrogen generation. The thesis starts by developing a photoelectrochemical system based on perovskite PV and Si photocathodes in a tandem configuration. We demonstrate a high-performance Si photocathode, incorporating state-of-the-art charge selective passivation and earth abundant catalysts, with an applied bias to photon efficiency (ABPE) of over 10%. Earth abundant catalysts are fabricated by sputter deposition for direct integration with the silicon photocathode. Using a physical deposition method allows catalyst fabrication to be integrated easily with current PV manufacturing and allows the possibility of scaling up the system. Charge selective passivation layers improve the Si photocathode performance by roughly 70% compared to Si photocathode without any passivation, highlighting the importance of the efficiency loss due to recombination at the Si/catalyst interface. An overall water splitting efficiency of 17% is achieved for the photoelectrochemical system when combined with a previously reported Earth abundant OER catalyst and a wide bandgap perovskite solar cell in tandem.Next, we identify performance limitations and conceptualise practical device designs to improve the STH efficiency towards 20%, by developing a new theoretical framework to quantify and compare different loss mechanisms in PV based solar hydrogen generation systems and evaluate the potential of different loss mitigation techniques to improve the solar to hydrogen generation efficiency. Our analysis shows that the two largest losses in an ideal system are energy lost as heat in the photovoltaic component, and current and voltage mismatch between the PV and electrochemical (EC) components due to sub-optimal system configuration. Two different loss mitigation techniques are considered: decoupling the PV and EC system by introducing a power management unit, and thermal integration to improve the water splitting reaction kinetics by utilizing the heat losses from the PV component to increase the electrolyte temperature. Employing loss mitigation techniques targeting the two major efficiency losses results in predicted STH efficiencies above 20% for realistic perovskitesilicon tandem-based systems, without the need for further improvement of the photovoltaic devices or catalyst. These results identify where best to target interventions to mitigate losses and ensure maximum improvement in the performance.Next, we develop a system with perovskite-Si tandem PV and Ni based earth abundant catalysts with a record STH efficiency of 20%.

T1  - Towards Sustainable Fisheries Management; Addressing Evidence-Gaps in Baited-Pot Fisheries in the Irish Sea
AN  - 2611593906
AB  - Static-gear fisheries using baited pots are an increasingly valuable component of the fishing industry in the Irish Sea. Target species include Common whelk (Buccinum undatum), Edible crab (Cancer pagurus), European lobster (Homarus gammarus), and Common prawn (Palaemon serratus). Together, the harvest of these four species from the Irish Sea area (ICES division VIIa) by British vessels totalled 7,938 t in 2019 and were valued at £14.67 million at the point of first sale. However, there is an absence of evidence-based management applied to the fisheries as a consequence of data-poor status in key areas including biological and ecological understanding of life-histories, fisheries-dependent information on catch and effort, and scientific assessment methodologies for stock assessments. This thesis aims to address specific knowledge-gaps important for the sustainable management of baited pot fisheries in the Irish Sea.Despite its relatively small size, the common prawn fishery is an economically important seasonal fishery in areas such as Cardigan Bay, Wales. The stock is prosecuted by a regulated open access fishery with no biologically referenced harvest control rules. In response to fluctuations in landings the fishing industry have adopted a size-selective harvesting regime of 10 mm carapace length (CL). This thesis presents a baseline of evidence for this fishery, and pays particular attention to the biological implications of size-selective harvesting and reproductive biology. Peak spawning occurred during the spring, whilst functional maturity of females was estimated at a CL of 9.9 mm. The species is sexually dimorphic, with females attaining a greater size than males. Size-selective harvesting results in a sex bias in landings as even large mature males often fail to recruit into the fishery.Whilst whelk fishing activity covers large geographical areas of the Irish Sea, whelk populations are known to be vulnerable to localised overexploitation, and despite the prominence of common whelk fisheries in the Irish Sea, they remain relatively unrestricted. This thesis evaluates fundamental biological parameters within an environmental context, focussing in particular on reproductive biology and growth. Analyses highlight that, at the time of sampling, the majority of populations were not adequately protected by technical measures with size-at-maturity estimates being greater than the applicable minimum conservation reference size. Using previously validated ageing techniques, size-at-age relationships are presented for Irish Sea populations. L∞ showed a significant negative linear relationship with sea temperature. Other parameters, including maximum growth rates and the age at which growth rate begins to decrease, showed clear trends with sea-bottom temperature but linear modelling failed to detect significant relationships.Despite the growing call to utilise fishery-dependent data in lieu of scientific stock assessments for data-poor fisheries, the resolution of these data are often insufficient for accurate catch and effort analysis. By trialling an Enhanced Electronic Reporting System (EERS) in the ‘mixed’ edible crab and European lobster fisheries in the Irish Sea, which integrates gear-in gear-out and mobile technologies, fisheries-dependent data has been shown to be a viable method of assessment. Using generalised additive models to investigate a dataset of environmental and fishing activity data, non-linear predictors of commercial landings-per-unit-effort (LPUE) data are estimated, which can be used to ‘standardise’ data.

T1  - Insect Size and Shape Responses to Temperature : a Case Study of British Odonata and Chironomidae (Diptera)
AN  - 2607502600
AB  - This PhD project investigated the response of wing length (as a proxy of body size) of Odonata and Chironomidae, and wing shape of Odonata to temperature and latitude. Three complementary data sources were used: natural history collections, field data, and mesocosm experiments. While natural history collections are valuable resources of specimens collected over long historical time scales, field data provides a modern perspective and mesocosm experiments provide a window on the future, under a predicted climate warming scenario. This PhD project used 5,331 museum specimens of 14 British Odonata species representing different life cycle types to examine the potential drivers of body size and wing shape responses to latitude and temperature (Chapter II and V). To control for latitude a field survey was performed during the summer of 2018 at Edington, Somerset to compare modern wing length of three species with historical data based on museum specimens of the same species collected at the same locality (Chapter III).Furthermore, to investigate body size responses of chironomids under a future temperature scenario, 1,976 adult specimens of six chironomid species were collected from mesocosm experiments which comprised ponds at ambient temperature and ponds maintained at 4℃ higher than ambient (Chapter IV). The results of Chapters II, III and IV showed that species and suborder (within Odonata) were significant factors affecting the magnitude of the temperature-size responses in Odonata and Chironomidae. Wing lengths of Zygoptera (Odonata) and Chironomidae are more sensitive to temperature and collection date than Anisoptera (Odonata). Zygoptera and Chironomidae tend to get smaller with increasingt emperature, likely due to higher temperatures disproportionately increasing developmental rate, resulting in smaller adults. Anisoptera showed no significant correlation with temperature, possibly due to selection for larger individuals in Anisoptera which are strongly territorial species. Adults of Zygoptera and Chironomidae emerging towards the end of the summer tend to be smaller than those emerging earlier in the season, likely due to larval development being time-constrainedlater in the season and as a result, larvae accelerate their developmental rate which comes at the cost of a smaller adult body size. The results of Chapter V indicated non-significant correlations between environment and wing shape in Anisoptera, while there were significant influences of latitude and mean seasonal temperature on wing shape in Zygoptera species, with broader and shorter wings found at lower latitudes with warmer temperatures. This finding corresponds well with a result of Chapter II which found shorter wing length with increasing temperature in all zygopteran species in the study. Overall, the results of this PhD project show that there are different factors influencing the temperature-size responses of insects, including phylogenetic relationships, sex, behaviour and life cycle types. Although this study found no universal temperature size responses in the focal taxa, Zygoptera and Chironomidae tend to have stronger negative body size responses to warming temperature and emergence date than Anisoptera. In addition, the study shows that wing shape variation in Zygoptera is more sensitive and adaptive to latitude and temperature than in Anisoptera.

T1  - Cellular and Organismal Strategies for Heat Acclimation in a Thermally Variable Environment
AN  - 2598642049
AB  - Using mussels as an experimental system, I have challenged previous beliefs concerning how quickly animals gain and lose heat tolerance, and how this heat-adaptive strategy fits into the larger ecological context of animals' responses to climate change. I explore how the California mussel, Mytilus californianus, heat acclimates—physiologically adjusts to hotter temperatures—to a thermally variable environment. In the eight chapters that comprise my dissertation, I explore how mussels gain and lose heat acclimation (i.e., heat acclimation kinetics) to better understand how these heat-tolerant animals adjust to, and survive, in the intertidal zone—an environment where extreme and intermittent heat events frequently occur. Until now, it was unknown how quickly mussels could heat acclimate and then maintain this heat-acclimated state in the absence of further heat stress. Moreover, it was unclear whether the heat-acclimation temperature affected the rates of gain and loss of heat acclimation. To a large extent, it was also unknown what physiological mechanisms play a role in both the gain and loss of heat acclimation. Here, I address these important and closely interrelated questions by exploring how quickly mussels gain and lose heat acclimation, the various environmental components that shape this heat-adaptive strategy, and the cellular and organismal responses responsible for the heat-acclimation phenotype.In my first studies, which focused on whole-organism thermal responses, I show that the rate at which mussels are heated affects their thermal performance. I demonstrate that heating rate is a key component of heat acclimation that was previously not considered and therefore should be a part of predictive models that estimate animal survival with heat stress. On the converse side, I show that the absence of heat stress leads to a very slow decline in thermal performance, but only in mussels that experienced large temperature variability in the field. I thus reveal that heating rate is an important component of heat acclimation for animals living higher on the shore that experience large daily fluctuations in body temperature and fast heating rates.Next, I explore the kinetics of the heat acclimation response: the gain and loss of heat acclimation after a single heat-stress bout. I demonstrate that mussels can quickly heat acclimate (within 24-48 h) after a single heat-stress bout, and then maintain this improved heat tolerance for 2-3 weeks in the absence of additional heat stress. Importantly, the kinetics of the heat acclimation response are dependent on the heat-acclimation temperature, such that exposure to a hotter temperature leads to slower gain and loss of the heat-acclimation phenotype. I show that this adaptive strategy in the lab mirrors what animals experience in the field, where the majority of heat events are separated by 1-2 days, but up to one-third of heat events are still separated by up to 22 days. Thus, it is likely that mussels have evolved the heat-adaptive strategy in which they rapidly gain, and slowly lose, the heat-acclimation phenotype as a result of the frequency of extreme- and intermittent-heat events typical of their habitat.Next, I explored responses at the organ level, using performance of the heart—an extremely temperature-sensitive organ—to examine additional details of heat stress and acclimation.

T1  - Identification, Characterization, and Gene Expression Analysis of Thioester-Containing Proteins (TEPs), and the Host Response to Environmentally Evolved Bacteria in the Squid <em>Euprymna scolopes</em>
AN  - 2583923379
AB  - The squid Euprymna scolopes forms a mutualistic symbiotic association with the bioluminescent marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri. Various host and microbial factors regulate symbiotic associations and host immune components and are believed to play a crucial role in the establishment and maintenance of these symbiotic associations. E. scolopes is an invertebrate animal and does not contain a classical antibody dependent adaptive immune system. Thus, it relies only on its innate immune system, which has two major types of components: humoral and cellular. Among these components, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are a large group of first-line sensors that allow the host to recognize and distinguish foreign agents from self-molecules and are involved in both humoral and cellular immune responses. Thioester containing proteins (TEPs), are one of the most phylogenetically ancient innate immune PRRs molecules and found in both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. However, many of these molecules have not been well characterized and immune functions of these molecules in the animal-beneficial bacteria associations have not been well studied. The first objective of this study was to investigate the presence and diversity of TEP molecules in E. scolopes and their possible role in symbiosis. It was hypothesized that E. scolopes contains diverse TEP molecules and that these molecules are modulated in the presence of symbiotic bacteria to allow for efficient colonization and maintenance in the dynamics of symbiosis. In silico methods were used to identify and initially characterize the TEP molecules in E. scolopes. Transcriptome analysis resulted in the identification of eight different TEP molecules (A2M-1, A2M-2, C3-1, C3-2, TEP-1, TEP-2, TEP-3, and MCR-1) in E. scolopes that were categorized into four subfamilies. In this study, E. scolopes A2M and MCR molecules were identified for the first time. To verify the expression of TEP molecules, end point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify TEP transcripts in uncolonized and colonized juveniles, and in one adult tissue. Six out of the eight TEPs (A2M-1, A2M-2, C3-1, C3-2, TEP-1, TEP-2, and MCR-1) were successfully amplified in all three types of samples tested: whole body of uncolonized and colonized juveniles, and adult gill tissue. TEP-2 was not able to be amplified in any of the three samples, while TEP-3 was amplified only in 24 h-colonized juveniles and in adult gills. Real time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that three genes (C3-1, C3-2, and MCR-1) were downregulated, with statistical significance, in 48 h-colonized juveniles, supporting the hypothesis that exposure to V. fischeri bacteria results in the modulation of the squid host’s immune genes to allow for the symbiont colonization and persistence. The next phase of this research study focused on investigating the effects of environmentally evolved symbiotic V. fischeri on the development, survival, and health of the squid. The highly specific squid-Vibrio symbiotic association provides an experimental model to investigate the role of symbionts on the development of animal host tissues. In nature, E. scolopes acquires its symbiont V. fischeri horizontally from the surrounding seawater within few hours of hatching. Then, the bacteria will colonize the crypt spaces, a specialized region in the squid’s light organ (LO). Following colonization by V. fischeri, the juvenile LO undergoes multiple developmental changes, including the regression and apoptosis of the ciliated epithelial appendages (CEA). It was hypothesized that environmentally evolved V. fischeri strains that respond to environmental stressors such as temperature changes will adapt and have a better ability to colonize the squid’s LO compared to the ancestral strains. To test this hypothesis, two objectives were formulated: (1) to examine the timeline progression of morphological changes in the juvenile squid LO following colonization with temperature-evolved V. fischeri strains, and compare to that of their ancestral strains; and (2) to assess squid’s health and survival upon exposure to temperature evolved strains and compare to that of their ancestral strains. Analysis of regression of the appendages surface epithelium indicated that the temperature evolved strains of V. fischeri ES114 and EM17 showed faster morphological changes in the LO, suggesting that these temperature evolved strains could be more efficient in initiating the developmental process in the squid than their corresponding ancestral strains. Survival and health of juvenile squid were not affected by the colonization by temperature evolved strains. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the squid-Vibrio symbiosis can be adapted and sustained despite abiotic changes in their environment and provide a framework for future studies on the symbiosis between animals and environmentally adapted bacteria.

T1  - Adaptation and Plasticity Within and Across Generations
AN  - 2569695139
AB  - The environment is seldom stable but often changes from one state to another and in order to survive and reproduce organisms need to respond to those changes. If the change is fast, genetic adaptations may not evolve quickly enough and organisms must adopt other strategies, such as phenotypic plasticity. As there are different types of environmental variations, the optimal type of plasticity also differs. However, plasticity is not always adaptive but can sometimes result in phenotype further away from the optimum. In the thesis I investigate how different types of environmental variation influence adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. I used experimental evolution approaches (Paper I, II) and RNA interference, (Paper III) in Caenorhabditis remanei (Paper I, II) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Paper III). In Paper IV I tested whether trade-offs with lifespan are caused by energy allocation, and if there are trans-generational fitness effects. In Paper I I show that the evolution of life histories, indeed, depends on whether organisms evolve in stable, fluctuating or variable temperatures. I also show, that the plastic response to temperature is in line with the temperature-size rule and that this response is adaptive. In Paper II I look closer on the evolutionary response to highly variable environments. I show that worms respond to fast changes in temperature by increasing the degree of phenotypic plasticity, rather than using bet-hedging. I again confirmed that plasticity in size follows the temperature size rule and that it is adaptive. In Paper III I examine how organisms respond to temperature changes that occur within their lifetime. I found that after initial decrease in growth rate as a response to cold temperatures, once temperature increases worms exhibit increased growth rate, which corresponds to the compensatory growth plasticity. Interestingly, the worms didn’t pay any cost in longevity or reproduction but had higher fitness. In addition, I show that temperature-induced compensatory growth is regulated by TRPA-1 ion channel (trpa-1gene). Finally, in Paper IV, I show that optimization of gene expression by down-regulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling via daf-2 RNAi from sexual maturity in C. elegans can more than double longevity without imposing any cost on reproduction. This is not expected if investment in lifespan and reproduction compete for the same energy pool. Importantly, I also showed that the positive effects for the parents did not come at a trans-generational cost for the offspring, since they exhibited increased reproduction and fitness.

T1  - Coral Reefs in the Anthropocene Ocean: Novel Insights from Skeletal Proxies of Climate Change, Impacts, and Resilience
AN  - 2568261670
AB  - Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are driving rapid changes in ocean conditions. Shallow-water coral reefs are experiencing the brunt of these changes, including intensifying marine heatwaves (MHWs) and rapid ocean acidification (OA). Consequently, coral reefs are in broad-scale decline, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. Ensuring survival of coral reefs in the 21st century will thus require a new management approach that incorporates robust understanding of reef-scale climate change, the mechanisms by which these changes impact corals, and their potential for adaptation. In this thesis, I extract information from within coral skeletons to 1) Quantify the climate changes occurring on coral reefs and the effects on coral growth, 2) Identify differences in the sensitivity of coral reefs to these changes, and 3) Evaluate the adaptation potential of the keystone reef-building coral, Porites. First, I develop a mechanistic Porites growth model and reveal the physicochemical link between OA and skeletal formation. I show that the thickening (densification) of coral skeletal framework is most vulnerable to OA and that, under 21st century climate model projections, OA will reduce Porites skeletal density globally, with greatest impact in the Coral Triangle. Second, I develop an improved metric of thermal stress, and use a skeletal bleaching proxy to quantify coral responses to intensifying heatwaves in the central equatorial Pacific (CEP) since 1982. My work reveals a long history of bleaching in the CEP, and reef-specific differences in thermal tolerance linked to past heatwave exposure implying that, over time, reef communities have adapted to tolerate their unique thermal regimes. Third, I refine the Sr-U paleo-thermometer to enable monthly-resolved sea surface temperatures (SST) generation using laser ablation ICPMS. I show that laser Sr-U accurately captures CEP SST, including the frequency and amplitude of MHWs. Finally, I apply laser Sr-U to reconstruct the past 100 years of SST at Jarvis Island in the CEP, and evaluate my proxy record of bleaching severity in this context. I determine that Porites coral populations on Jarvis Island have not yet adapted to the pace of anthropogenic climate change.

T1  - Musculoskeletal Pain and Postural Discomfort Experienced by the Marble Cutting Workers in the Marble Industry
AN  - 2562490095
AB  - The marble industry in Kishangarh comprises of more than 500 marble industries. The area has employed a large number of direct and indirect labourers. It has more than thousand persons employed in marble cutting units. The marble industry is emerging as an important industry for the construction agencies. The marble cutting in tiles is done on marble cutting workstation. For better functioning of the industry health of the worker is important because it affects the efficiency and the production of the industry worker but at the same time affects the total production of the industry. The loss of human resource is the loss to the economy of the nation.While performing the marble cutting activity, body segments are manipulated in the space available resulting in changes to posture. The industrial working environment, the environmental factors like illumination, noise, humidity, temperature affect the productivity of the worker.Stone quarrying, cutting and masonry is one of the many industries which involve moderate to heavy manual work. Due to the nature of manual work and use of tools, stonecutting job may potentially cause work-related upper limb musculoskeletal disorders.The anthropometric data of the marble cutters involved in marble industry, their working environment, physiological cost of work, their posture analysis and occupational related disorders experienced by them is yet to be explored. Thus, the present study is conceptualized. The present research aims to assess the musculoskeletal pain and postural discomfort experienced by the marble cutting workers in the marble industry.The research design of the study was descriptive because information regarding the musculoskeletal pain experienced by the marble cutting workers, physiological cost of work and fatigue experienced by the respondents was also collected. The sample comprised of 220 marble cutting workers working on the marble tile cutting workstation in the marble industry. Purposive sampling design was utilized for selecting the sample. An interview schedule cum observation sheet was resorted to gather the data. The interview schedule cum observation sheet comprised of five sections. The interview schedule cum observation sheet contained six sections namely Demographic profile, Anthropometric data and Workstation Dimensions of the respondents, Perceived Musculoskeletal Information on Perceived Musculoskeletal Pain, Postural Discomfort for which The Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) checklist was used Environment of the Workplace, Physiological Cost of Work and Perceived Fatigue which was measured by the researcher through prevalidated FACIT Scale. The content validity was established. An ergonomic intervention programme for the selected owners and marble cutting workers to improve the environment of the workplace and maintaining appropriate work postures during the work was designed. Brochures and posters were prepared in English and Hindi Language and distributed among the industrial owners. The posters were displayed at the workstation for the respondents to remember the information.The mean age of the respondents was 36.77 years. Less than one half of the respondents belonged to the age group of 35- 40 years. More than one-third of the respondents had educational qualification up to Primary Education (up to 5th standard). The mean years of experience was 12.26 years. Slightly less than on half of the respondents had experience of working since 11-15 years in the marble industry. Slightly more than two-third of the respondents had a less than or equal to 5 years of working experience in the present industry. Majority of the respondents were right handed. More than one-half of the respondents were found to be feeling “Very Good” regarding their physical wellness before the start of their work as compared to during work and after work.The mean anthropometric measurements of the respondents were calculated in the present study. The mean height of the respondents was logged as 67.09 inches. The height of the workstation was measured 34.5 inches. The width of the workstation was 43 inches. The length of the workstation was 77 inches. Shoulder was ranked first followed by elbows and back in perceived musculoskeletal pain since past 7 days. The perceived musculoskeletal pain in the past 12 months revealed that back was ranked highest followed by palms and shoulder. Majority of the respondents were at ‘high risk’ of Musculoskeletal Disorder requiring further investigation and changes on an immediate basis. Less than two third of the industries had light below recommended levels (1000 lux). The analysis of the perceived comfort level of the respondents revealed that slightly more than one half respondents perceived that the lighting was “comfortable”. Slightly less than one-half of the industries had Very High noise level 107- 112 dB. The lowest humidity recorded was 33% and highest humidity recorded while the respondents were working was 46%. Slightly less than two third of industries were having temperature ranging from 36-38 °C. The vibration produced by the marble cutting workstation was 46.67 Hertz.Majority of the respondents were not provided any training for vibration and posture. It was also observed that slightly less than on-half of the respondents were provided training for avoiding repetition of work. Majority of the respondents were not provided any rest breaks to relieve stress from repetitive motions. The use of any protection of hands was not found to be a practice by majority of the respondents. Majority of the respondents were not found to be using ear plugs for protection from excessive noise. Almost half of the respondents were found to be severely fatigued and slightly less than one half of the respondents experienced “Less Fatigue”. Slightly less than two third of the respondents had “Moderately Heavy” physiological workload of the task performed by them.A significant variation was found in the Perceived Musculoskeletal Pain of the marble cutting workers in various parts of the body with their Perceived Health Status during work. The F values were not found to be significant for the Physiological Cost of Work of the respondents with their Age, Years of Working Experience and Perceived Health Status (during work) and (after work). The results showed a significant relationship with the physiological cost of work and the Noise level. The results showed a significant variation in the Perceived Fatigue experienced by the respondents with their Health Status before and after work. The results revealed there was a significant positive relationship between the Perceived Fatigue and Perceived Musculoskeletal Pain experienced by the respondents.An ergonomic intervention programme was organized for the selected marble industry respondents and marble cutting workers. A brochure was prepared with detailed description on the use, benefits and availability of the protective aids. The owners were sensitized by the researcher by giving brochures which included the benefits of providing protective aids to the workers. Posters were also developed and designed for the workers in Hindi language as they did not have a command on English. The intervention programme was packed with knowledge and a discussion was conducted with the owners and the marble cutting workers.The study reflected clear implications for the need to educate the stakeholders regarding Ergonomic Practices in Marble Industry. An ergonomic intervention programme can be used to create awareness and promote training to the employees and using protective aids while working in the industry. The Kishangarh Marble Industry, labour laws need to meet the challenges faced by the daily wage workers in unorganized sector.

T1  - Rising Oxygen Concentrations as a Driver of Macroevolutionary Trends in Marine Communities
AN  - 2557416359
AB  - The onset of the Phanerozoic (541 Ma to present) marks a transition point in the evolution of life on Earth. The evolutionary dynamics of this period and its linkages to the physical environment have long been the focus of paleontologists. In this dissertation, I investigate the role of changing oxygen concentrations on the long-term evolutionary trends in Phanerozoic oceans. In particular, I focus on the Mesozoic Marine Revolution, a period of rapid evolutionary transition towards increasingly active communities. In contrast to canonical model reconstructions of atmospheric oxygen during Phanerozoic which show little correlation to evolutionary trends in the marine fossil record, the data presented here suggest an important role for oxygen. I first construct a record of carbonate sediment color to track redox state at the sediment-water interface through time and demonstrate that, despite persistently high levels of atmospheric oxygen, benthic environments may have been poorly oxygenated until 200 million years ago. This record opens up the possibility that shallow marine communities faced selective pressures from oxygen-limited environments until about the time of the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. Building on the sedimentary evidence for a Mesozoic rise in ocean oxygenation, my second chapter builds a quantitative record of metabolic rates in marine communities using modern metabolic rates combined with molecular clock and fossil record ages. This record illustrates that pronounced shifts in metabolic demand occurred during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution from increasing body size and oxygen availability in shallow marine environments. I expand upon this finding by quantifying temperature and oxygen state spaces of living organisms to show that taxa from clades with Paleozoic origins occupy a lower temperature and dissolved oxygen space than clades evolved in the Mesozoic or later. This suggests temperature and oxygen conditions of the deep-sea may act as a barrier against Mesozoic clades and provide refugia for formerly shallow marine Paleozoic communities. In summary, the data presented from this thesis suggest that low oxygen concentrations acted as a limiting variable in the evolution of metabolically active fauna. The data also suggest Paleozoic deep-water communities experienced dissolved oxygen concentrations that varied significantly from equilibrium with the atmosphere.

T1  - How Eco-Evolutionary Interactions Mitigate Climate Risk: A Theoretical Perspective
AN  - 2557201999
AB  - Accelerated rates of climate change are expected to either lead to adaptation and persistence, or extinction. Traditionally, ecological models predict extinction risk based on how environmental change alters a population’s intrinsic growth rate (r). However, these predictions often ignore the potential for evolutionary rescue, whereby populations avoid extinction via adaptive evolution. This dissertation sets out to address what allows rapid evolution to rescue natural populations in the face of environmental change. Our current lack of understanding of the role of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and their combined effect on population responses to climate change, demands further theoretical and experimental work to investigate these processes. I utilize theoretical modeling approaches to investigate the dynamics of small populations that have been reduced due to environmental change, and what allows them to rebound and avoid extinction.(1) Successful evolutionary tracking depends on how selection acts on key life history traits. The environment may impose selective pressure on specific demographic rates (birth and death) rather than directly on r (the difference between the birth and death rates). Therefore, when considering the potential for evolutionary rescue, populations with the same r can have different abilities to persist amidst environmental change. We cannot adequately understand evolutionary rescue without accounting for demography, and interactions between density dependence and environmental change. Using stochastic birth-death population models, I found evolutionary rescue to be more likely when environmental change alters the birth rather than death rate. Furthermore, species that evolve via density-dependent selection are less vulnerable to extinction than species that undergo selection independent of population density. Resolving the key demographic factors affected by environmental change can lead to an understanding of how populations evolve to avoid extinction. By incorporating these considerations into our models we can better predict how species will respond to climate change.(2) Propensity for evolutionary rescue varies in complex environments. Natural populations may experience a diversity of selection pressures across space and time due to differences in spatial and temporal environments, as well as in the competition they are subject to. I develop a spatially explicit individual based model to determine how the slope, spatial heterogeneity and patchiness of an environmental gradient as well as the dispersal ability of individuals will alter population extinction risk across a landscape due to environmental change. We find that as expected, the larger the magnitude of environmental change, the more likely a population will go extinct. Furthermore, there is a complex interplay between the spatial scenarios of gradient steepness, patchiness, and heterogeneity. Components that tend to encourage genetic diversity via local adaption to spatially diverse landscapes tended to allow for persistence. But, there are notable exceptions to this general rule. Too much heterogeneity leads populations to being maladapted to their local environment. In this case, landscape patchiness can serve to allow for environmental refugia. Thus we show that the spatial landscape significantly alters probability of evolutionary rescue, highlighting the importance of spatial realism in predictive models.(3) Resource scarcity plays a vital role in thermal performance amidst changing temperatures. Consumers and resources both have characteristic responses to temperature change, but how these temperature responses interact in the context of consumer-resource dynamics and adaptive evolution has not been well established. We utilize a consumer resource model to assess how communities will respond to temperature change. Our models demonstrate that within the consumer thermal niche, performance and equilibrium biomass differ. This implies that estimates of thermal stress and extinction risk based solely upon the individual thermal performance is problematic. We find that as consumers reduce a resource, there is adaptive pressure for that resource to grow successfully at lower temperatures where the consumer uptake rate is lower. Lastly we assess the importance of thermal asymmetry of the consumer and resource. If the resource’s thermal performance shifts to warmer temperatures, the consumer’s persistence in low temperatures decreases to reflect the effect of resource limitation at low temperatures. Likewise if the resource’s thermal performance shifts to colder temperatures, the consumer’s ability to persist in the hottest temperatures also decreases. Thus we must consider the dynamic interplay between temperature and interacting species as this can determine species response to temperature.Overall, we find that the assumptions we make when modeling environmental change in the life history of individuals, species interactions, and their spatial landscape have significant effects on species ability to survive environmental change. We provide generalizable frameworks to improve our ability to understand and predict how natural populations will respond to climate change.

T1  - The Coincidental Evolution Hypothesis: Examining the Factors that Affect Virulence in an Opportunistic Pathogen
AN  - 2555139677
AB  - The coincidental evolution hypothesis proposes that virulence in an opportunistic bacterial pathogen arises in response to selection from predators in the outside-host environment. Opportunistic pathogens, unlike obligate pathogens, do not need a host for survival, and exist in multiple environments where they face selective pressure from eukaryotic predators. This results in a population of bacteria with the best defenses against predation—mechanisms which “coincidentally” cause harm during host infection. Few studies have examined the coincidental evolution hypothesis, and those that have present conflicting results.Here, we investigated the validity of the coincidental evolution hypothesis by subjecting the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens to three different scenarios: (1) co-culture with the ciliate predator Tetrahymena thermophila, (2) growth in the absence of predators alone in media, and (3) growth within the guts of germ-free honey bees. We hypothesized that strains evolved in the presence of a predator would display increased virulence and strains evolved in the absence of predators or within a host would exhibit decreased virulence.Our study revealed that evolution in the presence of a predator resulted in increased virulence of S. marcescens. When compared to the media-evolved isolate, all predator-evolved lines exhibited increased pathogenicity in honey bees. However, when investigating how within-host evolution impacts virulence, we observed little to no change in virulence in host-evolved lines. We hypothesize that the lack of attenuated virulence in within-host-evolved strains is due to lack of selective pressure due to S. marcescens already being found at low levels in the bee gut.Overall, our findings indicate that predation plays a role in the evolution of virulence in opportunistic pathogens and thus support the coincidental evolution hypothesis. We were also able to identify mutations and genes potentially associated with virulence. This study sheds light of the factors that impact virulence and drive the evolution of opportunistic pathogens.

T1  - Nanoparticle Treatment Modalities for Mitigating Pathogenic Bacteria and Biofilms
AN  - 2553527609
AB  - Biofilms pose a significant clinical problem in skin and soft tissue infections. Despite clinical standards for treating these virulent microbial structures, biofilms remain extremely common and difficult to eradicate. Their inherent resistance to treatment (like antibiotic exposure) has spurred investigations into alternative treatment modalities. Nanoparticle-mediated photothermal ablation has become a novel modality for application in fighting pathogenic biofilms. Organic donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNP) may be more efficient and stable than metal and more biocompatiblethan carbon. Here, we present a formulation of D-A CPNPs called PolyDOTS for rapid, near-infrared photothermal ablation (NIR-PTA) and combined antibiotic treatment against pathogenic bacteria and biofilms. We show that PolyDOTS absorb in the near-infrared range (NIR) for heat generation and fluorescence under visible light stimulation. Herein, we demonstrate how PolyDOTS have good photothermal conversion efficiency and exhibit exceptional heat generation. We show that PolyDOTS NIR-PTA can eradicate bacterial populations and reduce biofilm bacterial viability by more than 4- log (> 99.99%), after exposure to 60 seconds of focal hyperthermia, between 50.6 and 57.3°C.Reductions were confirmed via LIVE/DEAD confocal analysis, which suggested that the treatment may have caused bacterial inactivation within the biofilms. COMSTAT analysis indicated that PolyDOTS PTA resulted in reductions in biofilm biomass, while confocal analysis of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) suggested that the treatment did not significantly reduce polysaccharides. SEM imaging revealed increasingly pronounced aggregation, and previously unobserved structural changes to the ECM after PolyDOTS PTA. S. aureus biofilms challenged with 100 µg/mL of PolyDOTS (PD-100) and theminimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of clindamycin, resulted in up to ~ 3-log decrease in bacterial viability compared to untreated biofilms and those administered PD-100 PTA only, and up to ~ 2- log compared to biofilms administered only MBEC treatment. SEM imaging of the treatments indicated that morphological and structural changes induced by PolyDOTS PTA might be reversible, but regrowth is limited after treatment. This study provides evidence that polymer nanoparticle PTA can successfully mitigate biofilm infection and improve existing treatment by enhancing antimicrobial efficacy.

T1  - Evolution of Development and Gene Expression in <em>Drosophila</em>
AN  - 2536519170
AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) is the study of trait evolution through variation in development. As early as the modern synthesis, it was recognized that to an understanding of the function of genes during development was critical to understanding evolution as a whole. To that end, modern evo-devo leverages advances in next-generation sequencing to study both the molecular changes that produce interspecific differences in development, as well as the molecular changes associated with evolution in life-history. 
In this thesis, I use lab-adapted populations selected for early (Fast) and late-life (Slow) fertility to better understand how life-history selection has led to changes in development and gene expression. These replicated selection lines provide a microevolutionary lens of development time and associated changes in gene expression, both at the transcriptome and the individual gene level.
I found development time to be highly diverged between Fast and Slow selection treatments, though the differences are not proportionate throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, development was highly convergent, with replicate Fast/Slow lines exhibiting highly similar development time. Preliminary transcriptome analysis through RNA-seq suggests the difference in development could be at least partially due to differential ecdysone regulation. Overall, differences in the developmental transcriptome between Fast and Slow were driven by trans-regulatory divergence – a result consistent with strong selection on a microevolutionary timescale. Lastly, I found no clear evidence that Fast and Slow flies differ greatly in their molecular response to stress, suggesting the heat-shock stress response does not trade-off with divergent life-history in this system.
In this thesis, I have shown that the developmental transcriptome can change dramatically on a microevolutionary time-scale. Furthermore, I showed some evidence that developmental evolution can be highly convergent at the phenotypic and global transcriptome level. However, this is not necessarily the case when looking at specific pathways. Overall, my research adds to the growing body of literature on gene expression evolution and provides a foundation for further research into the molecular dynamics of evo-devo changes on microevolutionary time-scales.

T1  - Between a Hot and a Hypoxic Place: Does Reduced Oxygen Limit Lizard Thermal Limits and Performance as Predicted by the Hierarchical Mechanisms of Thermal Limitation Hypothesis?
AN  - 2531171412
AB  - Although the effect of temperature on organismal performance is well characterized for ectotherms like lizards, how temperature interacts with other abiotic factors to impact fitness is relatively poorly understood. One such abiotic factor is oxygen, which is increasingly recognized for its effect on organisms’ aerobic scope – the capacity for aerobically powered work like growth, reproduction, and movement. The Hierarchical Mechanisms of Thermal Limitation (HMTL) hypothesis proposes that the interaction between temperature and oxygen shapes ectotherm performance and drive thermal limits. I tested a prediction of HMTL that thermal limits become oxygendependent when an organism’s metabolic demand for oxygen exceeds the oxygen available. Sceloporus occidentalis selected lower body temperatures under hypoxia and high metabolic demand, supporting the mechanistic prediction of HMTL. To further test predictions of HMTL, I measured the aerobic scope of Elgaria multicarinata under various oxygen-by-temperature treatments and used a novel framework to directly quantify the interactive effect of temperature and oxygen on performance. Elgaria thermal optima and peak performances were sensitive to oxygen. This sensitivity did not differ among recently-diverged clades, suggesting oxygen sensitivity is somewhat evolutionarily constrained. However, Elgaria oxygen sensitivity differed from preliminary Podarcis muralis data, suggesting oxygen sensitivities may be more evolutionarily labile on longer timescales.

T1  - Environmental Drivers and Evolutionary Consequences of Horizontal Gene Transfer in Soil Bacteria
AN  - 2528875576
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a driving force in bacterial evolution and could drive rapid adaptation in bacterial communities. Natural transformation is one mechanism of HGT that allows bacteria to pick up extracellular DNA (eDNA) from the environment and integrate it into their genome. But the rate of HGT in natural environments, and the role this process plays in facilitating rapid adaptation remains unknown. As climate change threatens the stability of environments worldwide, understanding how quickly bacteria can adapt to novel environments is essential. My dissertation research characterizes the environmental drivers and evolutionary consequences of natural transformation in a highly transformable model soil bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri.Despite decades of research on understanding HGT at the molecular level, less is known about the ecological drivers of HGT. To understand the soil conditions relevant for transformation, I first measured eDNA in the field over a short-term drying rewetting disturbance (Ch. 2). I found that eDNA increased in response to the rewetting disturbance but quickly disappeared from soil, suggesting a small portion of this eDNA could be transformed by bacterial cells recovering from the disturbance. To test the efficiency of transformation under the conditions in which eDNA disappeared, I created a novel microcosm system for quantifying transformation in soil (Ch. 3). Here, I inoculated soil with live antibiotic-susceptible, and dead antibiotic-resistant P. stutzeri. I then tracked the evolution of antibiotic resistance over a range of soil conditions and eDNA concentrations. Transformation drove the evolution of antibiotic resistance across a wide range of soil moistures and increased in response to larger inputs of dead cells (eDNA source), with antibiotic resistance repeatedly appearing in antibiotic free soil. Despite the prevalence of transformation across bacterial species, the evolutionary origins and consequences of transformation are still largely unknown. Transformation presumably provides a fitness benefit in stressful or continuously changing environments, but few studies have quantified changes in transformation in response to adaptive evolution. Here, I evolved P. stutzeri at different salinities and tested how the growth rate and transformation efficiency changed in response to salt adaptation (Ch. 4). Overall, the growth rate increased in response to adaptation, but the transformation efficiency declined, with only ~50% of the evolved populations transforming eDNA at the end of experiment – as opposed to 100% of ancestral populations transforming eDNA. Overall, my dissertation research elucidates the factors driving transformation in soil, setting the stage for future experiments to scale up estimates of transformation to the whole community level. I find that transformation occurs under most soil conditions and allows genetic variants to arise at low frequencies in the absence of selection. I also report novel experimental evidence that transformation efficiency can change dramatically, and in a highly variable manner, over just ~330 generations. Taken together, this body of research highlights a role for transformation in many natural systems of ecological significance, and points to dead cells as an important but often overlooked source of genetic diversity.

T1  - Energetic Drivers of Behavior and Body Size in Bats
AN  - 2524861039
AB  - Body temperatures outside narrow ranges can disrupt physiological processes, so animals frequently alter their behavior and other aspects of their ecology to avoid suboptimal thermal environments. During my dissertation research, I conducted three studies on how thermal environments shape the behavior and ecology of bats. In Chapter 1, I demonstrated that male northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) selected roost trees that were larger in diameter, more decayed, and under denser canopy than other trees available on the landscape—characteristics that might influence roosts’ thermal properties were unimportant. This research will inform forest management in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. In Chapter 2, I showed that male fringed myotis (Myotis thysanodes) did not select roosts with specific thermal characteristics, nor did ambient temperature alter patterns of roost selection. Bats can likely modulate use of torpor to maintain a consistent level of energy expenditure over the course of a day, irrespective of ambient temperature, a finding that can inform studies of the influence of temperature on habitat selection by other heterotherms. In Chapter 3, I tested four competing hypotheses for spatio-temporal variation in body size within bat species. Spatial variation in body mass was most correlated with mean annual temperature (the mechanism historically believed to underlie Bergmann’s Rule), while temporal variation in body mass was most correlated with net primary productivity. Climate change is believed to be causing reductions in body size for animals, but reductions in body size will likely be more complex than has been appreciated.

T1  - Evolutionary Consequences of Sex-Specific Selection
AN  - 2509375985
AB  - Sex-specific selection is widespread, evident by the evolution of sexual dimorphism in many traits in sexually reproducing taxa. The reason why the sexes may experience selection that differs in direction or magnitude is often linked to the reproductive strategies associated with the sex-specific reproductive physiology. Competition for mates or fertilisations creates conditions where selection is sex-specific and may overall be stronger on the sex experiencing more competition. However, the sexes share a majority of their genome and consequently many traits may be genetically correlated between the sexes, constraining sex-specific adaptation. In paper I, II and III, I investigate the consequences of exposure to altered strength of sex-specific selection in the laboratory through 30 generations of experimental evolution with skewed sex ratios, using the sexually reproducing nematode Caenorhabditis remanei as a model organism. I created female-biased (FB) and male-biased (MB) treatments. In paper I, I investigated the phenotypic response to selection in three life history traits (body size, fitness and heat shock resistance as a proxy for somatic maintenance). I found a sex-specific response to the evolutionary treatments for body size and fitness, while somatic maintenance was similarly affected by the treatments in the sexes. Subsequently, in paper II, I examined sex-specific patterns of additive genetic variance (VA) for reproductive fitness, and estimated the intersexual genetic correlation (rmf) of fitness. Results show low levels of VA for fitness, and no changes in response to treatments. Values of rmf are associated with large uncertainties, highlighting the difficulties in estimating and interpreting rmf for fitness. In paper III, I used a multivariate approach to investigate the sex-specific genetic variance-covariance matrices (GF and GM), and the between-sex genetic covariance matrix (B) in the three life history traits. Results show no genetic covariances between the traits, and no covariances between the sexes in these traits. The sex-specific G-matrices also remained stable in response to the treatments. These results therefore suggest that the genetic architecture of the traits studied here does not constrain the independent evolution in the sexes. In paper IV, using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus as the model, I find that experimentally induced mutations have stronger negative effects on male than female fitness, suggesting overall stronger selection on males. The results support the theory that strong sexual selection on males have the potential to purge deleterious mutations from a population.

T1  - Development of a Hybrid Solar Photovoltaic and Heat Pump System for Domestic Heating and Electricity Generation
AN  - 2508915051
AB  - This research investigates a hybrid photovoltaic thermal heat pump system that uses an indirect expansion method. It combines multiple solar photovoltaic thermal panels that convert solar energy to heat and electricity with a water-to-water heat pump. This allows for the generation of heat and electricity on the domestic level from sunlight. The technical feasibility of the system is examined through experimental and mathematical analyses whilst the economic viability of the system is assessed through techno-economic analysis in the UK. The research also studies the effect of short cycling phenomenon on the performance of a hybrid photovoltaic thermal heat pump system in partial load. The system's response to variations in solar irradiance, water tank volume and the water flow rate through the PVT are analysed. The system is modelled deploying quasi-steady state heat transfer and thermodynamic equations and validated by the experimental data. The analysis takes incremental time steps to solve for the fluid's temperature changes from the heat pump and the solar PVT panels. The model is used to conduct a parametric study of the system with changes in solar irradiance, size of the water tank and the water flow rate in the PVT pipes (laminar and turbulent) on the performance of the system are analysed. The techno-economic analysis of the hybrid system is studied, taking into account the effect of government policy on renewable energy such as the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) and Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). The thesis concludes that the hybrid photovoltaic thermal heat pump system works and is both technically and economically viable in the UK. The research demonstrates that the system is cost competitive with gas and electrical systems both independently and under UK renewable energy policy.

T1  - The Population History of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> and the Evolution of Ethanol Tolerance and Body Size, Adaptive Traits
AN  - 2507709967
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster is a great model to use in untangling the evolutionary process of a novel trait. There are abundant molecular techniques, extensive genomic data, they have short generation time, and stocks can be maintained in the lab with relative ease. This dissertation uses these advantages to investigate the population history of D. melanogaster and the genetic basis of adaptive traits. First, I create a robust demographic model of D. melanogaster expansion throughout Africa and into Europe. Estimates from this analysis has this expansion throughout Africa starting ~13,000 years ago and crossing the Sahara relatively soon after and into Europe ~1,800 years ago. Second, I explore the genetic architecture of ethanol resistance found in multiple populations of D. melanogaster. Findings from this study include elevated ethanol resistance in three different populations and that ethanol and cold resistance may have a partially shared genetic basis. We also find that the genetic architecture of ethanol resistance evolution differs substantially not only between our three resistant populations, but also between two crosses involving the same European population. Finally, I investigate the evolution of two adaptive traits, thorax and wing size, found in a highland Ethiopia population. The results from this study show that genes with moderate to large and small effect contribute to both phenotypes and standing variation may have helped this population adapt to the novel habitat. We have also found there to variability in the genetic architecture within this population.

T1  - Using Quantitative Approaches to Estimate Space-Use, Population Dynamics, Behavior, and Climate Change Adaptive Potential for the Red-Backed Salamander <em>Plethodon cinereus</em>
AN  - 2717713578
AB  - The red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus, is a common woodland amphibian that is found throughout much of eastern North America. The species is important to forest ecological processes, and changes in their population density are often used to measure the impacts of forest management, pollution, and environmental change. Therefore, consistent methods of density estimation are required. In the first chapter, I review spatial capture-recapture, a modern modeling tool that incorporates spatial information to reliably estimate population density without the need for the ad-hoc methods that render other density estimates incomparable. It can also be used to make inferences on space-use, population dynamics, and connectivity. I then demonstrate the versatility of spatial capture-recapture using P. cinereus mark-recapture data collected from my study sites in central Pennsylvania. For the second chapter of this thesis, I use spatial capture-recapture and other modeling approaches to test hypotheses about P. cinereus climate change adaptive capacity. This salamander is a convenient model for understanding dispersal-limited species, so I tested eight hypotheses to see how behavioral plasticity and fitness were affected by climate variability. Based on previous evidence, I also tested whether a common color polymorphism is a useful visual cue for predicting within-population variation in climate tolerances. Using four years of mark-recapture information from Maryland, I found the color morph is not a useful indicator, but overall, the population did show strong climate preferences, indicating that population persistence could be threatened by warmer and drier conditions predicted in the future.

T1  - Epigenetics of Marine Stickleback: Gene Expression Across a Latitudinal Gradient
AN  - 2675222377
AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity can be an important factor in the survival of a fish species through a changing climate or in migrating to a new habitat. The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is found throughout the northern hemisphere and can adapt via genetic change in relatively few generations to new environments. Epigenetic mechanisms work faster than genetic change, and have the potential to be passed on to future generations, possibly leading to population-wide changes in gene expression and phenotypic variation. To study genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms in stickleback, populations were selected for sampling between Northern Germany and northern Norway. Eleven populations of stickleback were successfully sampled across this latitudinal gradient, and four evenly distributed populations were selected for gene expression analyses in this research. Collected samples were dissected for gonads and pectoral fin muscle (in addition to other organs) and brought to the Alfred Wegener Institute where RNA was extracted. After converting RNA into cDNA, a targeted qPCR approach was performed to test for expression levels of a number of epigenetic actors; DNMT1, DNMT3ab, TET1, TET3, MacroH2A, and Sirtuin2. DNMTs are involved in promoting methylation, TETs actively demethylate cytosine, and MacroH2A and Sirtuin2 are actively involved in cold acclimation.Results from the fieldwork sampling found that stickleback body size (measured as standard length) decreased as latitude increased, in opposition to Bergmann’s rule of species increasing in size toward the poles. Additionally, there was evidence for slight sexual dimorphism in which males were significantly smaller than females across all populations. Furthermore, gravid females were found to be significantly larger than non-gravid females. Results from the target gene qPCR testing found Sirtuin2 to be more expressed in female gonads of northern populations than in southern populations. This is in line with Sirtuin´s role in cold acclimation which would be more beneficial to northern than southern populations. Male gonads showed higher expression of DNMTs and TETs, possibly indicating greater plasticity of epigenetic actors capable of change. This thesis project is the first to study epigenetic differences in fish populations across a latitudinal gradient. Future research could benefit from increasing the sample size (number of individuals and populations) and/or investigating alternative organs that may also show differential gene expression of epigenetic actors.Overall, epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be differentially expressed depending on factors of organ, sex, population, and local environmental factors, all of which can potentially allow greater adaptive potential under climate change.Alternate abstract:O stickleback de três espinhos é um peixe teleósteo encontrado circunglobalmente e é uma espécie modelo em ecologia evolutiva, pois é conhecido por se adaptar em poucas gerações em relação a outras espécies de peixes. Um dos mecanismos usados para se adaptar a ambientes em mudança é através da plasticidade fenotípica por mecanismos epigenéticos. A adição de um grupo metilo à citosina é conhecida como metilação do ADN, e tem o potencial de causar mudanças rápidas em resposta a estímulos ambientais, tais como mudanças na temperatura ou salinidade. A metilação pode ser transmitida aos descendentes, dando a este mecanismo o potencial para produzir mudanças em toda a população de gerações sucessivas. A metilação pode ser criada por metiltransferases de DNA como DNMT1 e DNMT3ab, e removida por proteínas de translocação Ten-eleven como TET1 e TET3. A aclimatação a frio é a capacidade de um organismo de se adaptar a baixas temperaturas, uma característica particularmente útil na sobrevivência em altas latitudes, caracterizadas por temperaturas de água mais baixas. Os genes potencialmente envolvidos na aclimatação a frio incluem MacroH2A e Sirtuin2 que, além desta função, desempenham outras como a modificação da histona e o metabolismo regulador. A aclimatação térmica e a capacidade de um organismo de regular a temperatura é interessante porque cenários futuros de mudança climática prevêem aquecimento, e a capacidade de um organismo para se adaptar a esta mudança pode determinar a sobrevivência de uma população.Para estudar o papel potencial dos mecanismos epigenéticos na adaptação local das populações de três espinhos de stickleback, foi realizado um trabalho de campo para recolher amostras de tecido de stickleback em 11 locais diferentes ao longo das costas do Mar do Norte e da Noruega. A primeira metade do trabalho de campo foi um "loop sul" que ocorreu entre 6 e 28 de Maio de 2019, partindo e regressando ao Instituto Alfred Wegener em List auf Sylt, Alemanha. A rota seguida foi, sucessivamente: de List auf Sylt, Alemanha para Marianger, Dinamarca; Oslofjord, Haugesund, Bergen, Ålesund, Trondheim, Noruega; e finalmente de volta para List auf Sylt, Alemanha. O Stickleback foi capturado com sucesso por rede de cerco em Oslofjord, Haugesund, Bergen e Trondheim na Noruega, por armadilhas do tipo covo em Mariangerfjord, Dinamarca, e por puça em List auf Sylt, Alemanha. A segunda metade do trabalho de campo foi o "loop norte" que ocorreu entre 3 e 20 de junho de 2019, saindo e retornando da Universidade Nord em Bodø, Noruega. A rota geral seguida foi: de Bodø para Vesterålen, Tromsø, Alta, Mo i Rana (NO), e de volta para Bodø. O Stickleback foi capturado com sucesso por armadilhas do tipo covo em Bodø e Vesterålen, e por puça em Alta e Mo i Rana. Por último, foi feita uma curta viagem até Limfjord, Dinamarca, para amostragem de uma população de stickleback com rede de cerco. Finalmente, 305 indivíduos foram capturados, em 11 populações separadas, com cerca de 30 indivíduos capturados em cada local. O stickleback mostrou ser abundante no Atlântico nordeste e apenas dois dos locais, Ålesund e Tromsø, não computaram stickleback. Os resultados da amostragem de stickleback apresentaram uma tendência de diminuição do comprimento padrão com o aumento da latitude. Esta situação é contrária à regra de Bergmann, que afirma que os organismos aumentam de tamanho em altas latitudes.

T1  - Investigation into the Viability of Using Pervious Pavements in Storm Water Management to Reduce Flooding in Townships
AN  - 2595134246
AB  - South Africa like many other countries worldwide has been facing a growing problem of urbanization; increasing the population living in urban areas. One immediate implication is the need for increase in impervious pavements/surfaces being built to have good un-interrupted road transport network among other things. Traditionally, the roads are designed and constructed with impervious material to withstand untimely failure due to fatigue and extreme weather conditions. However, these impervious surfaced pavements cause damages to the environment through storm water runoff which cause peak flow flooding. This is because their surfaces are constructed to be water tight to prevent ingress of water into the road pavement structure. This practice is not environmentally sustainable, causes heat island effect and causes peak flow flooding which is detrimental to the municipal infrastructure and human life. To prevent these detrimental effects, there is a need to use more environmentally friendly and sustainable pavements/surfaces which are pervious in nature. The aim of this study was to address the above challenge through scientific investigation of the suitability of pervious pavements in storm water management to reduce peak flow flooding in townships. The investigation was to establish what type of pervious pavement is more suitable for township development to effectively reduce storm water runoff and peak flow flooding. Three types of pervious pavements were investigated namely, Interlocking pavers, concrete and asphalt. Diepsloot Township which is situated in the Western Region of Johannesburg was used as the study area.
Field research to determine critical factors in pervious pavement installation were conducted. The critical factors researched in this study are; topography/terrain of the area, existing street sizes, houses proximity to the streets, available open space & land use and contamination potentials of storm water run-off. After the field research had been completed, a total of 30 streets randomly selected were measured. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the filtration rates of each of the three pervious pavement samples collected from commercial suppliers. A total of 16 replicate filtration rate laboratory experiments using clean water for each pervious pavement sample were conducted under same laboratory conditions. Furthermore, clogging tests for each pervious pavement sample was conducted using sand and silt contaminated water. A total of 12 replicate tests were conducted. The laboratory test results obtained for each type of pervious pavement sample were compared in order to determine the most effective pervious pavement in terms of filtration rate with clean water and contaminated water (clogging test). The infiltration rate results using clean water indicate that pervious asphalt was most effective with an average infiltration rate of 0.282 l/s followed by pervious interlocking pavers with 0.265 l/s. Pervious concrete was last with 0.145 l/s. The clogging test results indicate that pervious asphalt still was more effective. It recorded less infiltration rate reduction having reduced by 17.38% followed by pervious interlocking pavers having reduced by 36.73%. Pervious concrete was the worst with 45.52% reduction in infiltration rate. 
In order to establish which pervious pavement type was more suitable for township development to mitigate peak flow flooding and social economic challenges experienced, field research results were taken into account. Asphalt was favourable in terms of infiltration rate while interlocking pavers were favourable in terms of addressing some of social economic challenges of the township communities such as un-employment. It was concluded that interlocking pavers are more suitable in this regard to address peak flow flooding and social economic challenges in township development.

T1  - Estimating the Heritability of Plasticity of Thermal Tolerance and Its Application in the Restoration of Endangered Caribbean Coral
AN  - 2577808417
AB  - Rising surface temperature poses a threat to the world’s coral reefs and has been the cause of many mass bleaching events. Since coral colonies are sessile, survival of individual colonies may require them to acclimate to elevated water temperatures. Phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of an individual to express different phenotypes to survive in different environments, has been suggested as a critical first step that can buy a population time to evolve important adaptations. This chapter investigated two questions related to plasticity in high temperature tolerance in the endangered Caribbean coral, Acropora cervicornis: 1) Are coral colonies capable of acclimating to elevated water temperatures? 2) Do coral genotypes differ in their ability to acclimate to thermal stress (phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance)? We subjected A. cervicornis clones to different acclimation temperatures to identify the presence of plasticity in thermal tolerance, and estimated the broad (H 2 ) and narrow-sense (h 2 ) heritability of both thermal tolerance and plasticity of thermal tolerance. The study found that colonies exposed to a previous, short-term heat stress survived a long-term heat stress significantly longer (141 hours) than those that were acclimated at ambient temperatures. The amount of plasticity was found to depend on genotype, but not necessarily to additive effects of genotype, with H 2 = 0.19 and h 2 = 0. This suggests A. cervicornis lacks the capacity to evolve greater plasticity in thermal tolerance over a short period of time. However, our estimates may underrepresent the true h 2 in this population, and there are other factors such as epigenetic response and holobiont composition that may play a significant role in plasticity of thermal tolerance.

T1  - Thermal Adaptation in a Model Pest Insect
AN  - 2569373166
AB  - Climate change is one of the key issues of our time, causing rapid changes to habitats worldwide and exerting novel pressures on natural populations. Central to understanding species responses to climate change is the process of thermal adaptation, whereby populations adapt to increased or changing temperatures. However, we do not understand how important thermal adaptation is in nature, nor the phenotypes that underpin it. Understanding thermal adaptation in insect species is of particular interest, as they provide many ecosystem services (e.g. pollination, pest control and recycling of organic matter), and are particularly vulnerable to temperature changes due to their inability to thermoregulate. Additionally, several pervasive pest species are insects, so understanding how they will respond to climate change will have major impacts on food security. Here, I investigate thermal adaptation using Tribolium castaneum, which is the model beetle and a globally important pest of stored products. I use experimentally evolved populations exposed to control temperature (30°C) or stressful high temperature (38°C) for over 50 generations, to investigate how thermal adaptation occurs and the effects of population demographics and life history on this. I found that high temperature lines had lower overall reproductive output compared to control lines, even when reproduction occurred at high temperatures. I then experimentally increased population size and induced migration into the high temperature lines for 10 generations, to increase levels of genetic diversity, but found that this did not result in increased reproductive output or survival. However, when the experimental populations underwent development at high temperature, I found markedly reduced reproductive output in the control lines, but not the high temperature lines. Development at high temperature affected the fecundity of adult females and the fertility of adult males, and I identified morphological differences in the ovaries and testes of beetles following development at 38°C or 30°C. Furthermore, this adaptation appears to occur rapidly, with observable signals of change in reproductive morphology and increased reproductive output within just five generations. This thesis highlights that there is potential for rapid adaptation in insects, which suggests that there is a chance they may cope with climate change. However, it also demonstrated the complexity of thermal adaptation, and more in-depth understanding is required to accurately predict the outcomes of changes in temperature.

T1  - The Implications of Prezygotic Isolation, Variable Performance, and Competition for Secondary Contact Between Alewife Life History Forms
AN  - 2544548960
AB  - Secondary contact occurs when two previously isolated lineages come back into contact after generations of independent selection and evolution. The processes that occur at the onset of secondary contact determine whether populations fuse, form a stable hybrid zone, or undergo speciation. Research on secondary contact has been restricted to studying gene flow in long-standing stable hybrid zones, providing little insight into the ecological processes that occur at the very onset of secondary contact or how these processes interact with gene flow to shape the evolutionary trajectory of a species. The degree of morphological and ecological divergence between populations prior to contact likely determines the strength of their interactions and probability of experiencing introgression during secondary contact.Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) is a species of river herring consisting of two life history forms, an ancestral migratory (anadromous) form and a recently diverged freshwater resident (landlocked) form. Fish passage projects aimed at restoring habitat connectivity and access to spawning sites for anadromous alewife are also bringing them into contact with landlocked alewife for the first time in centuries. Anadromous and landlocked alewife have divergent morphology, physiology, life cycles, and behavior, which has resulted in cascading ecological and evolutionary effects on lake communities. The degree of divergence between alewife life history forms has the potential to generate complex ecological interactions during secondary contact. I examined the implications of spawning time variability, intraspecific variation in growth and resource allocation, asymmetric competition, and changes in anadromous alewife migratory timing for secondary contact between anadromous and landlocked alewife.I found that anadromous and landlocked alewife would experience low, but variable levels of hybridization during secondary contact due to differences in spawning time. Anadromous alewife spawned earlier and over a shorter duration than landlocked alewife, and spawning time was consistent from year to year. Landlocked alewife spawned later and over a longer duration than anadromous alewife. I found considerable interannual and interpopulation variation in the timing of the initiation of spawning by landlocked alewife, which would likely be the primary cause of interannual variation in hybridization between forms during secondary contact.Anadromous and landlocked alewife exhibited interform variation in their growth patterns, resource allocation, and foraging behavior, which resulted in asymmetric competition between forms during secondary contact. I found that anadromous alewife were very sensitive to prey availability, growing rapidly when prey were abundant and losing weight when prey were scarce. Landlocked alewife were less reactive to changes in prey availability and maintained their weight, or grew slowly, regardless of prey availability. Landlocked alewife also invested more in lipid than anadromous alewife, an adaptation to surviving periods of prey scarcity and extreme winter temperatures in lakes.The adaptations of landlocked alewife to forage on small prey and survive periods of food scarcity may have provided them with an advantage when competing with anadromous alewife for pelagic prey. However, I found that anadromous alewife increased their individual diet specialization and utilized a private resource, littoral prey, in ways that buffered them from competition with landlocked alewife. In anadromous alewife, the timing of juvenile migration to the ocean was sensitive to pelagic zooplankton abundance. The low density of pelagic zooplankton in lakes containing landlocked alewife and competition for zooplankton between life history forms may cause anadromous alewife to migrate earlier and at a smaller size than anadromous alewife in lakes without landlocked alewife. Changes in anadromous alewife migratory behavior may have implications for the long-term outcome of secondary contact between life history forms. Variation in prezygotic isolation through time, asymmetric competition, and the uncertainty of hybrid fitness in this system make predicting the long-term outcome of secondary contact between alewife life history forms difficult. The results I present here demonstrate that secondary contact has the potential to generate complex ecological interactions at the initiation of contact, and it can provide the opportunity to test fundamental ecological theories related to the origin and maintenance of biological diversity.

T1  - Understanding Sources of Variation in Advertisement Call Attributes in Spring Peepers (<i>Pseudacris crucifer</i>)
AN  - 2528810748
AB  - The mate recognition system is the foundation of biological speciation in frogs and toads. Sexual selection has been suggested to cause male call evolution, population divergence, and ultimately reproductive isolation. It is generally assumed that a significant fraction of variation in male call has an underlying genetic basis and that there is a link between call attributes and fitness. Yet these are largely unproved assertions in anurans, with many other factors contributing to diversity of calls within a male chorus. Anuran advertisement calls are important in studies of sexual selection, speciation, community acoustic partitioning, as well as phenological studies. In all of these, understanding heritability of calls is prerequisite to understanding evolutionary patterns and potential responses to selection. However, few studies have examined the heritability of advertisement calls in anurans. In general, we know that key aspects of anuran calls, including both temporal and spatial attributes, vary with body size, age, abiotic factors such as temperature and habitat type, and social context, including inter-male competition. In my thesis, I attempt to estimate the heritability of call attributes within a calling assemblage of a temperate treefrog, Pseudacris crucifer, and to quantify the relative contributions of different factors: body size, age, calling temperature and genetics. I used sonographic analysis to assess call variation, skeletochronology to estimate age, and a dataset comprising single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate the relatedness of calling males. I used the animal model to evaluate those factors that may affect call variation. I found that body temperature to be the most important factor, influencing all six call attributes, and that body size predicted variation in some call attributes. I had insufficient power to derive robust estimates of heritability. By investigating the genetic basis as well as environmental components of variation in advertisement calls, I gained insights on within-population variation and how selection might impact the evolution of anuran calls.

T1  - Post-Combustion Carbon Capture for Combined Cycle Gas Turbines
AN  - 2509021897
AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have conveyed in their fifth assessment report that anthropogenic emissions and endeavours are responsible for approximately 100 % of global warming since 1950 [1] and electricity and heat generation account for 41 % of the 32.8 billion tons of global CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion in 2017 [2]. There is thus a sense of urgency to capture CO2 from large point sources of fossil fuel combustion to limit global temperature rise. Natural gas combustion is envisaged to play a fundamental role towards a zero-carbon economy as opposed to coal and oil due to its low carbon content. However, capturing CO2 from natural gas combustion, which emits about 6.7 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2017 is challenging as it, bestows a parasitic energy penalty on Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plants. This is due to the low partial pressure of CO2 in the flue gas of gas turbines, which necessitate that substantial reboiler heat duty is employed for solvent regeneration. To address the aforementioned impasse, pertinent experimental campaigns at the UKCCSRC- PACT National Core Facility were carried out to simulate Selective-Exhaust Gas Recirculation (S- EGR) under the influence of 40 wt(%) of Monoethanolamine (MEA). This was to enhance the driving force behind CO2 capture and to reduce the Specific Reboiler Duty (SRD), consequently counterweigh against the forfeit on the power plant’s productivity. Furthermore, the impact of varying Pressurized Hot Water (PHW) temperature at the inlet of reboiler was studied. The influence of oxidative degradation of the amine solvent at 15 vol(%) of O2 and 5 vol(%) of CO2 has been experimentally investigated. Results from these studies have demonstrated that Selective Exhaust Gas Recirculation (S-EGR) is favourable in reducing the solvent regeneration energy requirement by about 25 % at CO2 concentration of 6.6 vol(%) prior to flue gas introduction in the Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC) system. PHW temperature at 125 °C was identified to give the lowest SRD by 6 % against the baseline SRD. Detection of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) peaks was observed as water from the water-wash column was transferred to the absorber column which may have a possible impact on the oxidative degradation of the amine solvent in the PCC system. The concentration of the Iron in the amine solvent, which is a key indicator of the solvent decay increased by approximately 10 times from 3.68 to 36.20 mg/l over a course of 545 hours of experimental operation. Results and recommendations from these studies will potentially reduce the solvent regeneration energy requirement of the next generation PCC technologies and facilitate the global deployment of such technologies towards decarbonisation of the fossil fuel combustion industries and strengthening the efforts of limiting global temperature increase.

T1  - Charge-Carrier Dynamics in Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskites for Next-Generation Solar Cells
AN  - 2508816532
AB  - Hybrid metal halide perovskites have emerged over the last decade as highly promising materials for use in solar cells. Their advantages include low production costs, and rapidly increasing efficiencies to compete with those of commercially dominant silicon cells. Recently, increasing attention has been devoted to the use of perovskites in next-generation photovoltaic devices in order to overcome the efficiency limit for conventional single-junction cells. Work is still needed to identify the most promising perovskite materials for these applications, and to fully understand their relevant properties. This thesis contributes to both goals. The challenge of identifying the true timescale of charge-carrier cooling in metal halide perovskites, and whether certain compositions in fact show exceptionally slow cooling, is addressed. This is central to assessing the viability of hot-carrier extraction in perovskite solar cells. Key sources of error in previous approaches to determine charge-carrier temperature, which have produced an orders-of-magnitude range of reported cooling times, are identified. An improved model, which accounts for the full photoluminescence lineshape and enables a consistent approach that can be applied to studies across different perovskite compositions, is then described. Applying this improved model, charge-carrier cooling in FASnI3 is studied, revealing that observations of a secondary regime of slow charge-carrier cooling are in fact attributable to electronic relaxation, state-filling and recombination in this energetically disordered material. This result highlights that careful analysis of charge-carrier cooling dynamics is vital to assessing the realistic prospects for hot-carrier solar cells. Photoluminescence polarisation memory in FASnI3 is also examined, finding no persistent polarisation anisotropy within 270 fs. This points to a need for further study to identify the factors that lead such memory to arise from structural changes in certain perovskite compositions. Finally, the effects of the SnF2 additive commonly used to improve material quality of tin-containing perovskites are explored for FA0.83Cs0.17SnxPb1-xI3 across the lead-tin range. Significant beneficial effects from the suppression of tin oxidation and associated background hole doping, including reduced energetic disorder and increased charge-carrier mobilities and lifetimes, are found with as little as 1 mol% SnF2 added. The larger amounts of additive that have commonly been used are found to contribute to detrimental non-radiative recombination. These results, unravelling the impacts of SnF2 on both structural and optoelectronic properties, provide a foundation for control over the properties of mixed tin-lead perovskites for use as low-bandgap absorbers in all-perovskite tandem cells.

T1  - Transcriptional Dynamics of a Large Family of Surface Protein Genes in <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>
AN  - 2493470172
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a eukaryotic intracellular parasite that has evolved numerous large, paralogous gene families. These families are critical for supporting Toxoplasma's unparalleled host range which consists of nearly any nucleated cell in almost any warm-blooded animal. The SRS (SAG1-related sequence) gene family encodes over 100 surface proteins, some of which are involved in parasite attachment and evading the immune response of a host. For most SRS genes, however, little is understood about their function and expression profile. Additionally, Toxoplasma undergoes a complex and poorly understood developmental process that is critical for establishing a chronic infection in its intermediate hosts. In chapter 1, I review the current literature on the SRS family and present novel analyses on how SRS gene expression changes across the life stages of Toxoplasma. In chapter 2, I describe efforts to apply single-cell RNA-sequencing to Toxoplasma parasites to create a comprehensive atlas of cell cycle and asexual development based on data from over 5,400 parasites. This data reveals unexpected heterogeneity in SRS gene expression among individual parasites: in a population of the rapidly growing tachyzoite stage nearly all > 100+ SRS genes are detected despite only an average of 7 SRS genes being "on" in any individual tachyzoite at a given time. From this dataset, AP2IX-1 is identified as a parasite transcription factor that triggers downregulation of SAG1, a ubiquitous surface antigen and SRS, and upregulation of transcripts typically only expressed in the sexual stages of Toxoplasma's lifecycle. In chapter 3, I describe efforts to determine whether heterogeneous SRS expression signatures are inherited over generations of parasite replication by comparing transcriptomics from clonally derived parasites. Preliminary data from these studies suggests that SRS expression patterns are not strongly inherited by progeny and that heterogeneity of SRS expression arises within 10 generations between subcloned parasites. In chapter 4, I present work that identified new parasite factors involved in the secretion of Toxoplasma effector proteins into the host cell during infection. In chapter 5, I conclude with remarks on future directions for the study of the SRS gene family and understanding heterogeneity in expression patterns in Toxoplasma.

T1  - Resilience and Sensitivity to Changing Environments in North American River Otters (<em>Lontra canadensis</em>)
AN  - 2488594143
AB  - The North American river otter is a semiaquatic carnivore that occupies freshwater habitats across most of North America, and is a conservation symbol across most of its range. It is used as an indicator species, a keystone species, an umbrella species, and an example of conservation success. The broad distribution of river otters suggests a broad range of habitat tolerances, but they appear to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations. This apparently conflicting robustness across habitat types and sensitivity to habitat change has baffled researchers for decades. Using morphometric, modeling, and synthetic approaches I explored how otters relate to their environment on a broad scale to gain a better understanding of the conditions to which they are robust, the conditions to which they are sensitive, and the mechanisms by which they adapt to varying environments. Using Maximum Entropy species distribution models I determined that river otter distributions are not strongly affected by climate or macro-environmental variables. Using geometric morphometric methods to examine how cranial shape varies across geographic and ecological space, I determined that morphological variation which may affect feeding and locomotion occurs more intensely at local than broad scales, indicating local morphological adaptation is not strong in this species. Finally, a review of the phylogeography and ecology of river otters and related species indicated that this species evolved from a low-speciation lineage that tends to produce species that can occupy a wide variety of environments without undergoing evolutionary change. Overall I determined that river otters do indeed have a broad ecological niche, and do not respond strongly to climatic or environmental differences or changes across their habitats through altering their distributions or locally adapting. Evidence suggests that river otters may respond strongly to anthropogenic alterations of their habitats because anthropogenically-induced habitat alterations tend to have strong consequences for aquatic food chains, and otters may be more reliant on robust food webs than they are on other aspects of their habitats. These findings have implications for how we think of otter conservation and the conservation of species and ecosystems that are strongly affected by otter presence, as well as what otters indicate about their habitat quality. Additionally, these results may shed light on the ecologies of other mustelid carnivores.In the first chapter of my dissertation I conducted a review of the phylogenetics and biogeography of North and South American river otters to investigate how geography and environmental change have driven river otter evolution in the Americas, and how this informs the ecology of the modern species. I focused first on reviewing the biogeography and evolutionary history of Lontra and Pteronura, and then on the modern ecology, threats, and conservations status of each of the four modern species of Lontra and the single extant species of Pteronura. I chose to review these species because they overlap in geographic and environmental space, and because their shared history provides means for an evolutionarily-grounded examination of relative rarity, specialization, and level of conservation concern. I found that speciation between American otters primarily occurs allopatrically, and there is little functional differentiation in response to allopatric speciation, though they do appear to have the ability to adapt in response to extreme conditions when necessary. Additionally, allopatric speciation primarily occurs in response to changes in waterway connectivity, which is also responsible for changes in population connectivity within the modern species. Most otters have less specific habitat requirements than previously thought, as all species of Lontra persist across a wide variety of climates and semi-aquatic environments, and most of them do so without exhibiting a strong evolutionary response. All American river otters exhibit a strong sensitivity to anthropogenic habitat destruction, though several of them have also shown some ability to coexist with humans. Evidence from this study provides strong indication that this has to do with how human activities near waterways affect food webs, and more generally that on closer examination many habitat components previously thought to be requirements for otters may be better interpreted as indicators of food availability.In the second chapter of my dissertation I use species distribution modeling to examine river otter associations with climate and environment across their range to explore their apparently conflicting robustness to habitat change and sensitivity to human presence. Specifically, I examined the climate and landcover variables that constrain the geographic distribution of otters. I obtained otter occurrences from GBIF and BISON biodiversity databases, climate variables from BIOCLIM, and environmental layers from NASA’s SEDAC program. I built Maximum Entropy species distribution models at 80 and 150 km spatial thinning and varying numbers of background points. The combined model at 80 km spatial thinning and default number of background points produced the highest quality models. Six climatic and landcover variables explained over 10% of otter distributions each: open shrubland, net primary productivity, urban/built, water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter. Of these variables I determined that water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter likely have biological significance. However, the predicted range map generated by these models do not match river otter distributions generated by the IUCN and NatureServe. This is likely due to incomplete occurrence data because of low reporting in parts of the species range. I conclude based on these data that river otters have broad climatic and habitat tolerances (as there are six weakly predictive variables as opposed to 1–2 strongly controlling variables) and that local habitat factors, such as intact-ness of riverine food webs, may have greater impact on otter distributions than broad regional variables. Additionally, I call for improved monitoring and reporting of this and other broadly-distributed species to ensure we can adequately track their habitat requirements and conservation status.In the third chapter of my dissertation I use geometric morphometrics to explore the role of cranial morphological variation in otter persistence across the array of otter habitats. I address two research questions: 1. Is there morphological variation and structure in river otters across subspecies? 2. Is morphological variation in river otters best explained by a pattern of isolation by distance or isolation by ecology? I obtained 100 river otter crania from across the species range from museums. I 3-D scanned them using a Geomagic 3-D scanner and landmarked them using the IDAV Landmark program. To answer Q1 I conducted discriminant function analyses Procrustes ANOVAs and a Principal Components Analysis. None of these tests revealed strong morphological patterning, indicating there is not morphological differentiation across subspecies in cranial shape. T address Q2 I conducted Mantel tests and a Multiple Matrix Regression with Randomization (MMRR) on the relationship between morphological distance and geographic, climatic, and environmental distance. Both the Mantel test and the MMRR results indicated no significant relationship between morphological distance and climatic or environmental distance in otter crania. Both indicated a weak but negative relationship between morphological distance and geographic distance, indicating morphological variation is greater at short geographic distances and lower at broad geographic distances. I conclude that there is significant cranial variation between individuals, but little definable structure in this variation. The weak but significant (and potentially complex) relationship between geographic and morphological distance indicates the possibility that diversifying selection across smaller spatial scales may be more important than differentiation across broader populations, possibly indicating individual specialization within a generalist population.

T1  - Adaptability and Composition of Natural Regeneration in <em>Pinus resinosa</em> (Red Pine)-Dominated Forests following Climate Adaptation Treatments
AN  - 2480684570
AB  - As climate changes around the globe, forest ecosystem management must change as well. Future climate in north central Minnesota is expected to include higher seasonal temperatures, longer growing seasons, decreases in growing season precipitation and increases in frequency and severity of drought. Additionally, altered disturbance regimes, the introduction of exotic pests and pathogens, habitat fragmentation, and landscape homogenization have left forest stands vulnerable to undesirable state shifts in which an ecosystem transitions from a desirable state with high ecosystem productivity and service provision to a less desirable and less productive condition. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was first established in a Pinus resinosa Ait. (red pine)-dominated forest, which is an economically and ecologically important forest type in the region in order to examine the impacts and effectiveness of three climate adaptation strategies (resistance, resilience, and transition) in an experimental, operational-scale setting. Designed around resisting the effects of climate change, resistance treatments aim to improve the health and defenses of forest stands, while resilience treatments were intended to create conditions that allow for change to occur but ensure an eventual return to a desired reference state. Transition treatments were designed to actively assist stands in transitioning to future climate and encouraging greater adaptive capacity within them. Using data collected during the fifth growing season since the site was treated, this study explores the short-term effects of adaptation strategies on biodiversity in the understory woody community as well as predicted future adaptability of historically P. resinosa-dominated forests based on the natural regeneration that has established up to five years post-treatment.Field data, consisting largely of shrub and tree identification, density, and diameter measurements, were collected between May and August of 2019. Following field sampling, aboveground woody stem biomass estimates were calculated using species-specific allometric equations. The relative importance of each species was then calculated based on biomass estimates, stem densities, and frequency of observation across each stand, providing a measure of abundance which then enabled calculation of species biodiversity and future relative adaptability. Species diversity and richness of woody stems was highest within the resilience treatments and lowest within unharvested control treatments. Species richness of natural tree regeneration was also highest within the resilience treatments. Importance of Prunus serotina Ehrh (black cherry), a species considered better suited to anticipated future climate, was highest within transition treatments. An analysis of the community-weighted mean for future adaptability (based on published species adaptability scores) indicates that the change in adaptability of natural regeneration relative to untreated controls is greater within transition treatments than within resistance and resilience treatments. These results demonstrate early success in improving and increasing stand-scale species biodiversity and, potentially, future adaptability through silvicultural treatments. Silvicultural manipulation also shows promise for increasing the density and relative importance of individual species considered better suited for future climate. While these are only short-term results, they demonstrate the ability to influence ecosystem diversity and adaptability through harvest and provide insight to managing forests in a time of changing climatic conditions and uncertainty.

T1  - Morphology and Physiology of Larval Color Variation in the White-Lined Sphinx Moth, <em>Hyles lineata</em>
AN  - 2479082933
AB  - Animal color patterns occur for a variety of reasons and can have a broad impact on fitness. Additionally, the presence of multiple color phenotypes in a species can be ecologically advantageous. One must first understand the physiological mechanism behind color patterning and variable morphs to understand how this variation affects fitness or provides an ecological advantage. Multiple phenotypes produced by one genotype, including multiple color morphs, can be genetic or plastic and may evolve very quickly as an adaptive response to changing environments. Phenotypes that are genetically based, called polymorphisms, can be controlled by one to many genes, are heritable and may have genetic links to other traits. Multiple color morphs may also be determined by environmental conditions, such as temperature and photoperiod, or phenotypic plasticity. Here, I sought to determine the physiological mechanisms underlying the multiple color phenotypes of an abundant and widespread lepidopteran larva. Hyles lineata has a primary, basal coloration of yellow and green that can be observed throughout the larval body, most noticeably during the final instar. Also, this larva may have dark lateral dorsal stripes that vary in thickness during the juvenile stage. These stripes can be as minimal as a thin dotted line or so thick that the entire larval body appears black. The variation in both basal coloration and dorsal striping can be observed in the field and in the laboratory and seem to be independent of each other. I designed a series of experiments to determine which, if any, of these color patterns is genetically controlled and which, if any, is phenotypically plastic. To do so, I conducted several single-pair inheritance crosses to document the yellow to green larval color ratios expressed by their offspring. From these crosses, I was able to determine that the yellow and green coloration observed in larval H. lineata is, indeed, genetically based. Further, this trait is controlled by a single two-allele gene, green allele dominant, with contributions from modifier genes. A series of experiments testing variations in environments was also conducted. This included conditions of variable temperatures, photoperiod and combinations of the two. Larvae were exposed to these conditions from the second instar and the appearance of the dark dorsal patterning was noted upon the fifth instar. This patterning was found to be phenotypically plastic. While there was no variation in this trait observed under varying temperature conditions, there was an increase in stripe thickness with decreased photoperiod as well as with combinations of photoperiod and temperature. To identify and measure this variation in pigmentation, various methods were employed, from visual scoring and histological observation to chemical extraction. These methods were described and reviewed. The dark, plastic patterning observed as dorsal stripes in H. lineata was determined to be produced by the pigment melanin. Further, larvae that visually appeared to have greater dark patterning also had a higher percentage darkness when quantified with image analysis as well as a higher volume of extracted melanin, identified and quantified with the use of spectrophotometry. The mechanisms of the color variation observed in H. lineata are now better understood; this organism has a basal yellow/green coloration genetic polymorphism as well as a phenotypically plastic melanic dorsal lateral patterning. As it is known that both of these forms of phenotype variation can be linked to fitness and/or be advantageous, future research can focus on the potential adaptive consequences of these traits.

T1  - Population Dynamics in the Rocky Intertidal Zone: Acclimation and Adaptation to Extreme Abiotic Conditions in the Copepod <em>Tigriopus californicus</em>
AN  - 2479027561
AB  - Understanding how organisms endure abiotic challenges across scales, in both space and time, is a major goal of ecologists. Rocky intertidal zones, where terrestrial and marine ecosystems meet, are among the most harsh and dynamic habitats on Earth. The goal of my dissertation was to characterize how evolutionary and ecological forces shape population dynamics in intertidal zones, using the splashpool copepod Tigriopus californicus as a model system. Multiple lines of evidence (laboratory experiments, field surveys, population genomics) were compiled and analyzed to test whether populations have distinct capacities to acclimate and adapt to multiple environmental stressors. In two long-term studies, I exposed four populations to a range of pH treatments across three generations and quantified fecundity, development, and survivorship. Copepod cultures had lower survivorship and delayed development after extended exposure to higher pH treatments (pH 7.5 and 8.0), whereas cultures maintained in lower pH (7.0) displayed stable population growth over time. Reciprocal transplants among treatments demonstrated that these effects were reversible. All populations had higher fitness in lower average pH conditions than those that occur in the open ocean, which has rarely been observed in other marine invertebrates. To test for local adaptation among populations, I exposed common garden-reared copepods to factorial combinations of salinity and temperature treatments with different amplitudes of diel variability. This experiment revealed strong effects of temperature on life history responses, but these effects and their interactions with salinity treatments were not the same among populations. Differences in abiotic variability among field sites did not seem to explain population differences observed in the lab. Therefore, differentiation of these isolated populations might be more strongly driven by genetic drift, rather than divergent selective pressures. Using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach, I found that populations with the most divergent phenotypes also displayed the highest genomic differentiation from other populations. Across experiments, I characterized copepod morphology and found sex-specific body size responses to environmental stressors. Together my results contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary capacity and vulnerability of marine invertebrate populations in the context of global environmental change.

AN  - 2478041018
AB  - El objeto de esta tesis es estudiar la actividad del plasma frío a presión atmosférica o ANTP (Atmospheric Non Thermal Plasma) sobre el biofilm y las células planctónicas de Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa y Candida albicans.El plasma constituye el cuarto estado de agregación de la materia, tras los sólidos, líquidos y gases. Se produce al ionizar total o parcialmente un gas, pudiendo utilizar cualquier fuente de energía para su generación (eléctrica, térmica, óptica o radiación electromagnética ionizante). Al producirse cargas eléctricas libres (electrones e iones) el plasma es un buen conductor de la electricidad.El estado de plasma se alcanza cuando buena parte de las partículas que componen el gas alcanzan tanta energía como para que sea posible su ionización liberando una alta densidad de electrones. Los electrones producidos y sus colisiones posteriores con los átomos y moléculas del gas generan las especies reactivas que interaccionarán con el entorno.El plasma se puede clasificar según los niveles energéticos relativos de los electrones y partículas pesadas (iones y neutras) en plasma térmico y en plasma no térmico, también llamado plasma de no equilibrio o plasma frío.En el plasma térmico la alta temperatura implica que todas las especies químicas se encuentran en estado de equilibrio termodinámico (Te ≈ Ti ≈ Tg). En los plasmas no térmicos, el enfriamiento de los iones y las moléculas sin carga es más efectivo que la transferencia de energía de los electrones en las colisiones, no alcanzándose el equilibrio térmico y permaneciendo el gas a baja temperatura (Te>>Ti≈Tg ) por lo que es conocido como plasma frío. Los plasmas fríos son capaces de destruir, a temperatura ambiente, microorganismos con un mínimo o nulo daño al entorno por calor. Los plasmas fríos se pueden generar en cámaras de vacío, denominándose plasmas de baja presión, o a presión atmosférica denominándose plasmas a presión atmosférica. En los generados a bajas presiones de gas, la frecuencia de colisión de los electrones es baja por lo que las energías de los electrones seguirán siendo altas en comparación con las energías de las partículas pesadas (iones y neutras) representando un estado de no equilibrio térmico.A presiones atmosféricas la frecuencia de las colisiones de los electrones es más alta, por lo que disminuirá la diferencia entre la Te y la temperatura de las partículas pesadas y, por lo tanto, el estado del plasma estará más cerca del estado de equilibrio térmico. Esta condición se puede evitar suministrando una baja densidad de potencia de alimentación o una potencia pulsada, lo que lleva a la formación de plasma frío o de no equilibrio.La necesidad de descontaminar biológicamente material sensible o de esterilizar material en quirófanos, ha hecho que durante años se estudien diversas técnicas de descontaminación. Existen diversas técnicas empleadas en la actualidad como son el calor seco, calor húmedo, radiación ultravioleta, peróxido de hidrógeno o líquidos con diversas composiciones químicas, pero ninguna se puede aplicar sobre tejidos vivos o materiales especialmente sensibles.El uso del plasma frío a presión atmosférica surge como una técnica relativamente nueva que permite descontaminar a temperatura ambiente y presión atmosférica, tejidos vivos o materiales especialmente sensibles. Parece ser un buen candidato para la inactivación microbiana en el biofilm o la destrucción de la estructura de una manera ecológica y rentable. El estrés oxidativo producido por los reactivos de la química del plasma es el responsable de los efectos que se producen.Dado que mi actividad profesional está dedicada al tratamiento de la infección protésica articular y de la osteomielitis crónica del adulto, donde el biofilm es la causa de la cronicidad y dificultad de curación de estas enfermedades, la posible aplicación del plasma frío para descontaminar o esterilizar tejidos vivos y material protésico motivó mi interés por el tema y el desarrollo de esta tesis doctoral. Para el desarrollo del trabajo experimental empleamos un prototipo denominado cámara de plasma a presión atmosférica - plasma no térmico que se caracteriza por usar aire como gas, trabajar a temperatura ambiente y a presión atmosférica para la producción de plasma, convirtiéndola en un posible candidato para poder ser utilizada de forma económica en multitud de situaciones, entre ellas en el campo de la cirugía séptica del aparato locomotor. La calibración del equipo ya fue realizada por el Dr. Guillermo Baeza Oliete en su tesis “Contribución a la generación de plasma frío mediante electrodos SMD y JET”.Para poder demostrar la capacidad antimicrobiana de la cámara de generación de plasma sobre el biofilm de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans formada en discos de titanio comercialmente puro (grado 3) y politetrafluoroetileno (PTFE/Teflón) y sobre sus respectivas células planctónicas, desarrollamos cuatro diseños experimentales.En los dos primeros diseños experimentales se valora la actividad del plasma frío sobre el biofilm de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans formado sobre discos de titanio comercialmente puro y PTFE y sobre sus respectivas células planctónicas. En el tercer diseño experimental se analiza la capacidad del plasma frío para actuar sobre el medio de cultivo e impedir el crecimiento posterior de microorganismos. En el último diseño experimental se evalúa cualitativamente, mediante microscopía confocal laser, la viabilidad del biofilm de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans tras su exposición al plasma frío.La letalidad media producida sobre el biofilm de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans, formadas durante 48 horas sobre discos de titanio, después de 60 minutos de exposición al plasma frío fue del 99,7%, 99,9% y 99,6%, respectivamente. En el caso de los discos de PTFE fue del 99,1%, 95,9% y 94,4%, respectivamente.La letalidad global media de las células planctónicas de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans después de la exposición del plasma frío durante 90 minutos fue del 99,87%. La exposición del medio de cultivo BHI al plasma frío durante 90 minutos generó un medio de cultivo activado por plasma (PAM) que impidió el posterior crecimiento de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans.Mediante microscopía confocal de exploración láser se constató, que la exposición al plasma frío durante 60 minutos de discos de cristal, sobre los que previamente se había formado un biofilm de 48 horas de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans se produjo una destrucción completa del biofilm.Alternate abstract:The purpose of this thesis is to study the activity of cold plasma or Atmospheric No thermal plasma (ANTP) on biofilm and the planktonic forms of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.Plasma constitutes the fourth state of aggregation of matter, after solids, liquids and gases. It is produced by completely or partially ionizing a gas, being able to use any source of energy for its generation (electrical, thermal, optical or ionizing electromagnetic radiation). When free electrical charges (electrons and positive ions) occur, plasma is a good conductor of electricity.The plasma state is reached when a large part of the particles that make up the gas reach enough energy to allow its ionization to release a high electron density. The produced electrons and their subsequent collisions with the atoms and molecules of the gas generate the reactive species that will interact with the environment.Plasma can be classified according to the relative energy levels of electrons and heavy particles (ions and neutrals) in thermal plasma and non-thermal plasma also called non-equilibrium plasma or cold plasma.In thermal plasma, high temperature implies that all chemical species (Te≈Ti≈Tg ) are in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In non-thermal plasma, the cooling of ions and molecules without charge, is more effective than the transfer of energy of electrons in collisions, the thermal equilibrium is not achieved and the gas remains at low temperature (Te>>Ti≈Tg ) so is known as cold plasma. Cold plasmas are capable of destroying, at room temperature, microorganisms with minimal or no heat damage.Cold plasmas can be generated in vacuum chambers, called low pressure plasmas, or at atmospheric pressure called atmospheric pressure plasmas. In those generated at low gas pressures, the frequency of collision of the electrons is low, so that the energies of the electrons will remain high compared to the energies of the heavy particles (ions and neutrals) representing a state of non-equilibrium plasma.At atmospheric pressures the frequency of collisions of electrons is higher, so the difference between Te and the temperature of the heavy particles will decrease and therefore, the state of the plasma will be closer to the state of thermal equilibrium. This condition can be avoided by providing a low power supply density or a pulsed power, which leads to the formation of cold or non-equilibrium plasma.The need to biologically decontaminate sensitive material or to sterilize material in operating rooms has made for years that various decontamination techniques are studied. There are various techniques used today such as dry heat, wet heat, ultraviolet radiation, hydrogen peroxide or liquids with various chemical compositions, but none can be applied to living tissues or especially sensitive materials.The use of cold plasma at atmospheric pressure emerges as a relatively new technique that allows decontamination at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, living tissues or especially sensitive materials. It seems to be a good candidate for microbial inactivation in biofilms or the destruction of the structure in an ecological and cost-effective manner. The oxidative stress produced by plasma chemistry reagents is responsible for the effects that occur.Since my professional activity is dedicated to the treatment of prosthetic joint infection and chronic osteomyelitis in adults, where biofilm is the cause of chronicity and difficulty in curing these diseases, the possible application of cold plasma to decontaminate or sterilize living tissues and prosthetic material motivated my interest in the subject and the development of this doctoral thesis.For the development of the of the experimental work we used a device called the Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Chamber - Non-Thermal Plasma (APPC-NTP) characterized by using air as a gas, working at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for plasma production, making it a possible candidate to be used economically in a multitude of situations, including in the field of septic surgery of the musculoskeletal system. The calibration of the equipment was already carried out by PhD. Guillermo Baeza Oliete in his thesis “Contribution to the generation of cold plasma using SMD and JET electrodes”.In order to demonstrate the antimicrobial capacity of the plasma generation chamber on biofilms from S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans formed on commercially pure titanium (grade 3) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE / Teflon) discs and on their respective cells planktonic, we developed four experimental designs.In the first two experimental designs, we evaluated the activity of cold plasma on the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans formed on commercially pure titanium disks and PTFE and on their respective plankton cells. In the third experimental design, the ability of cold plasma to act on the culture medium and prevent the subsequent growth of microorganisms is analyzed. In the last experimental design, the viability of the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans was evaluated qualitatively using laser confocal microscopy after exposure to cold plasma.The average lethality produced on the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans, formed during 48 hours on titanium discs, after 60 minutes of exposure to cold plasma was 99.7%, 99.9% and 99.6%, respectively. In the case of PTFE discs, it was 99.1%, 95.9% and 94.4%, respectively.The mean lethality of the planktonic cells of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans after exposure of cold plasma for 90 minutes was 99.87%.Exposure of the BHI culture medium to cold plasma for 90 minutes generates a plasma activated culture medium (PAM) that prevents subsequent growth of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans.We verified, by confocal microscopy of laser exploration, that after exposure to cold plasma for 60 minutes of glass disks on which a 48-hour biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans had previously formed, produced a complete destruction of the biofilm.

T1  - The Adaptive Potential of Lifetime Fitness Increases Under a Future Climate Change Scenario in a Population of Brassica Rapa
AN  - 2471529443
AB  - The persistence of any declining population in the face of an environmental perturbation may depend on how fast natural selection restores fitness, a process called “evolutionary rescue”. Evolutionary rescue depends on the adaptive potential for fitness: the additive genetic variance for fitness (VA(W)) divided by mean fitness (W ̅). I conducted an outdoor warming experiment to estimate the change in VA(W) and W ̅ in the annual Brassica rapa using a predicted 2100 temperature regime. Surprisingly, plants exposed to a warmer climate exhibited greater W ̅, suggesting plasticity may enable population persistence to climate change, but could also hinder the adaptive potential by increasing denominator W ̅. Nevertheless, the magnitude of VA(W) expressed under heated conditions was considerably higher, thereby a greater adaptive potential was observed. My findings suggest that standing genetic variation in B. rapa may be sufficient to buffer and facilitate rapid adaptive evolution to warmer temperatures imposed by climate change.

T1  - Growth and Transgenerational Acclimatization of Juvenile <em>Pocillopora damicornis</em>
AN  - 2466064554
AB  - Global carbon emissions and associated increase in ocean temperatures are understood to be the main driving force in the degradation of coral reefs. Elevated temperatures impact various life stages of scleractinian corals, from the free-floating planulae of brooding corals to older, sexually viable individuals. With global warming, questions have arisen over whether organismal adaptation will be enough to keep up with the pace of environmental change. Researchers have pursued investigations of whether or not rapid acclimatization, through transgenerational plasticity, can help protect populations until genetic adaptation occurs. Acclimatization in corals has been widely studied in all life stages of corals, with the important exception of recently settled juveniles. In this study, I built upon past research by exposing adult Pocillopora damicornis colonies to elevated (28.5ºC) or ambient (25.5ºC) temperatures and examining the settlement ability and growth of their planulae ex situ. Juveniles from preconditioned parents fared better in higher temperatures compared to their naïve counterparts. Lunar timing of planula release between treatments peaked at different times in the lunar cycle. Peak planula release occurred on lunar day 23 for prestressed corals and on lunar day 7 for corals from ambient temperature seawaters. While future projects should follow up on these preliminary trials with in situ experiments to assess this phenomenon in the field, this study represents an important step in understanding how corals may be able to acclimatize and eventually adapt to climate change.

T1  - Fostering Climate Change Resilience: A Socio-Ecological Forest Systems Approach
AN  - 2458033720
AB  - As climate change continues to impact socio-ecological systems, those that rely on natural resources are highly sensitive to climatic changes. Maine’s forest industry provides for the economic and social well-being of many residents and is especially vulnerable to climate change impacts. Changes in growing season length and timing, forest health threats imposed by insects and pathogens, extreme weather events, shifting forest composition, and changes in natural disturbance severity and frequency have already begun, and are projected to continue, to impact forest systems in the Northeastern U.S. While climate change presents a threat to forest systems, opportunities also arise due to longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures. Socioeconomic pressures and biophysical impacts necessitate the implementation of adaptation strategies among forest managers to maintain and enhance healthy and resilient forest systems in Maine, as well as overcome threats and take advantage of opportunities. Identifying impacts, assessing vulnerabilities, and determining appropriate adaptation strategies are critical first steps in implementing effective adaptive management across the state. The goal of this study was to develop and implement an integrated framework to assess the vulnerability and enhance the resilience, via increased climate change adaptation, of Maine’s forest socio-ecological systems to climate change. The thesis uses a sequential mixed-methods approach to combine qualitative and quantitative data, to (1) understand stakeholder perceptions of climate change impacts and adaptation, and (2) to map biophysical and social vulnerability of Maine’s forest industry to climate change. Forest stakeholders in Maine generally have high perceptions of risk regarding climate change impacts, and identified and prioritized the following climate change impacts as having the greatest and most likely impact on the forest industry: forest health threats imposed by insects and pathogens, extreme precipitation events, shifts in forest composition, invasive species, and changes in forest productivity. The results of the vulnerability assessment also highlight the unique combinations of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to climate change among Maine counties. Management strategies that address prioritized and experienced impacts are widely accepted among stakeholders; however, stakeholders are less willing to formally incorporate climate change into the forest management planning process given barriers and limited access to incentives. Integration of research results indicate the persistence of uncertainty and complexity involved in climate change adaptation and present a challenge to increasing implementation of adaptation strategies among forest stakeholders. However, promoting opportunities for learning and enhancing management flexibility via communications that appeal to stakeholders’ perceptions, social norms, experiences, and values can increase the ability of Maine’s forest socio-ecological system to respond to change. The framework presented in this thesis can have widespread application elsewhere, given its theoretical and methodological groundings and its novel multi-method approach to study forest industry vulnerability and the potential for adaptation.

T1  - Epigenetic Contributions to Early Life History Variation in Chinook Salmon
AN  - 2455887941
AB  - DNA methylation has been proposed as an epigenetic, evolutionary mechanism for acclimation, transgenerational plasticity, and local adaptation without changes in DNA sequence. In this thesis, I assess the highly targeted evolutionary nature of DNA methylation in Chinook salmon from the tissue to the population level, with important implications for organism survival and evolution.
First, I developed a PCR-based bisulfite assay for Next-Generation sequencing for genes involved in growth, development, immune function, stress response, and metabolism (Chapter 2). Locus- and tissue-specific methylation was assessed in inbred and outbred Chinook salmon at two developmental stages (fry and yearling). This chapter established DNA methylation as a mechanism targeted to specific loci, tissues, levels of inbreeding, and developmental stages/environmental contexts.
I assessed the role of DNA methylation in the propagation of maternal effects at three early developmental stages (egg, alevin, and fry; Chapter 3). Two 6x6 fully factorial Chinook salmon breeding crosses were used to estimate maternal effects. DNA methylation was assessed using bisulfite sequencing and both locus-specific and CpG-specific maternal effects were identified. This chapter established DNA methylation as a potential mechanism for the transmission of maternal effects, which can have important influences on offspring development and fitness.
I quantified the effects of early environment on the genetic architecture of DNA methylation using 6x6 factorial crosses reared in two environments: a hatchery and a semi-natural channel (Chapter 4). Additive, non-additive, and maternal variance components, combined with environmental and GxE effects for DNA methylation were calculated. Rearing environment caused gene-specific plasticity in methylation, as well as differences in the genetic architecture of methylation. This chapter identified the importance of both genetic and environmental variation in controlling methylation, with important implications for methylation as an acclimation or adaptive mechanism.
Finally, I characterized differences in locus-specific methylation among eight populations of Chinook salmon (Chapter 5). The significant population differences in locus-specific methylation were tested for correlation with environmental variables from natal streams, and pairwise FST estimates (microsatellite and SNP data). I identified no effects of rearing environment, but a weak among-population correlation between methylation and microsatellite FST indicating that genetic drift is influencing methylation. Population-level differences in DNA methylation suggest methylation may contribute to local adaptation and is certainly an important additional source of phenotypic variation.
In conclusion, my doctoral research evaluated the role of DNA methylation from the tissue to the population level. My results support DNA methylation as a novel, potentially adaptive mechanism, contributing to normal organism function, transgenerational plasticity through maternal effects, plasticity, and population-level acclimation or adaptation.

T1  - Inter-Individual Variation Within Social Groups: How Metabolic Rate Shapes the Pace of Life
AN  - 2452123937
AB  - Metabolic rate (MR) is often cited as the fundamental rate which determines the rate of all biological processes by shaping energetic availability for the various physiological, behavioral, and life-history traits that contribute to performance. Furthermore, the metabolic theory of ecology posits that performance at any level of biological organization is a function of the MR of its constituent units. It has therefore been suggested that MR drives the widely observed covariance among these different levels of phenotypic traits. However, much of the work on this topic has relied on pairwise correlational analysis on a handful of traits at a time, leaving an important gap in our understanding regarding the functional links that shape this phenotypic covariance, often referred to as pace-of-life. Furthermore, at a collective level, this has led to significant attention regarding how MR scales across group size, but considerably less attention has been paid to how heterogeneity in MR among constituent units shapes collective outputs.
Using honeybees as a model, we measured a large number of behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits in individual bees and used a path analysis to demonstrate that variation in metabolic rate plays a fundamental proximate role in driving the covariance among these traits. We combined this with a factor analysis in a structural equation model framework to characterize the overall phenotypic covariance or the pace-of-life axis in honeybees. We discuss the importance of these findings in the context of how interindividual variation in terms of slow–fast phenotypes
may drive the phenotype of a group and the functional role metabolic rate might play in shaping division of labor and social evolution.
Building on this work, we leveraged the well-characterized differences in MR associated with ‘F’ (‘fast’) and ‘S’ (‘slow’) malate dehydrogenase (MDH) alleles to breed homozygous genotypes of bees expressing high (FF) and low (SS) MR in addition to heterozygotes (SF), thought to express an intermediate phenotype. We then mixed progeny from these lines to create experimental groups with four different phenotype compositions: monomorphic FF, monomorphic SS, monomorphic SF, and a polymorphic group type at a 1 FF: 1 SS ratio. We then measured MR, energetic intake, thermoregulation in cold and heat stress, and survival of these groups in a high and low resource environment. Monomorphic fast groups outperformed monomorphic slow and polymorphic groups, which performed worse than expected on most traits. We quantified the effect of heterogeneity on polymorphic group performance using the ‘diversity effect,’ an analytical technique often used in ecosystem ecology to compare the productivity of diverse ecosystem assemblages to null expectations set by the constituent species when living alone. Diversity effects can be partitioned selection and complementarity effects and understand the mechanisms through which biodiversity acts on ecosystem productivity. We applied this technique in a novel way to show how each group-level performance trait is influenced by MR morph diversity through different processes. We also found that MR was strongly correlated to the other traits, especially in the low resource environment. We discuss these results in the context of how MR plays an important role in shaping division of labor and social evolution.
These studies provide empirical support for the theoretical idea that metabolic rate acts as a proximate driver of phenotypic covariance among a number of physiological, behavioral, and life-history traits at the individual level, and that behavior acts as a mediator for how metabolic rate affects life history. In addition, using honeybees as an experimental model for these studies establishes a framework for asking questions regarding how these individual-level phenotypic covariance patterns lead to observed phenotypic covariance patterns at the colony level that have functional consequences for division of labor and social evolution. The results of these studies therefore contribute toward a better understanding of the rules of life that shape processes across different levels of biological organization. Our use of different structural equation modeling approaches for inferring heuristics and proximate causal relationships among multiple phenotypic traits also informs future research efforts on this topic. We also present a novel approach to experiments that explore functional group level performance traits through partitioning the effects of inter-individual heterogeneity.

T1  - From Molecules to Whole Organisms: Insect Responses to Climate Change
AN  - 2451304406
AB  - Global atmospheric temperatures are rising at accelerated rates, exposing organisms to novel and potentially unsuitable changes in their environment. In order to survive changes in their thermal environments, organisms can employ physiological plasticity on short time scales or species can adapt over evolutionary time. Species may utilize one or both of these strategies to ensure survival; however, if they are incapable of responding to change, they may face extinction. Insect species may be some of the most vulnerable organisms experiencing climate change-induced alterations in their thermal environments because, as ectotherms, temperature influences nearly all of their physiological processes. By characterizing physiological responses to global change, we can begin to understand how organisms are currently responding to climate change and predict how organisms may respond in the future. My research aims to elucidate how insects respond to changes in their thermal environment by examining multiple physiological responses to winter warming in diapausing Pieris rapae butterflies, and the evolution of transcriptomic responses to heat shock in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Winter warming caused P. rapae butterflies to have compromised supercooling points, lowered cryoprotectant abundances, shifted metabolomes, more variable metabolic rates, and switches in energy fuel usage. While heat shock caused thermally sensitive early D. melanogaster embryos to exhibit changes in the abundance of thousands of gene transcripts, regardless of the region of origin. But, D. melanogaster embryos with higher thermal tolerance from tropical populations had higher abundance of key transcripts that encode proteins involved in the oxidative stress response. My results suggest that insects endure a broad suite of physiological consequences when the temperature increases. Will these species survive climate change? My work suggests that diapausing P. rapae may be threatened by winter warming, but also shows that some individuals can recover from winter warming. My work also demonstrates that the evolutionary genetic basis of heat tolerance in early D. melanogaster embryos is mediated at the level of the transcriptome, and suggests that D. melanogaster has the potential for adaptation to heat shock temperatures. However, to what extent these species will be challenged by future warming patterns, and if they will continue to evolve and adapt at a rate suitable for survival, needs to be further studied.

T1  - Extrinsic Incubation Temperature Impacts on Zika Virus Evolution and Vector Competence During Systemic <em>Aedes </em>Infection
AN  - 2445471116
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are distinctive in that they are required to constantly replicate in different hosts and in a wide range of temperatures for their perpetuation in nature. Vertebrate hosts tend to maintain temperatures of approximately 37°C - 40°C, but arthropods hosts are poikilotherms and subject to ambient temperatures which can have a daily temperature fluctuation of > 10°C.Invertebrate host genus, species, and strain in combination with arbovirus strain and preparation methods are known to have large impacts on vector competence and vectorial capacity. Seemingly small differences in host geographic isolation, virus strain, and preparation methods can have significant impacts on vector competence studies. The role of temperature on the ability of an arthropod vector to acquire, maintain, and transmit a pathogen has been investigated for numerous arboviruses. Changing the extrinsic incubation temperature between distinct constant temperatures has been shown to alter arbovirus vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival, in which moderate temperatures of 28°C-32°C are optimal and temperatures higher and lower have deleterious effects. The mean and range of daily temperature fluctuations (diurnal temperature) have likewise been shown to influence arbovirus perpetuation and vector competence, in which large daily temperature fluctuations negatively affect mosquito development, survival, and vector competence. However, little is known as to how temperature alters arbovirus genetic diversity during systemic mosquito infection or how differences in arbovirus hosts and viral strains impact arbovirus genetic diversity in relationship to temperature.Therefore in the study completed in chapter two, we characterized the impact that constant temperatures of 25°C, 28°C, 32°C, and 35°C, and the diurnal fluctuation from 25°C to 35°C during extrinsic incubation periods have on the Puerto Rican isolate of Zika virus (ZIKV) vector competence and population dynamics within Aedes aegypti (Poza Rica) and Aedes albopictus (Florida) mosquitoes. To characterize the impact that temperature has on ZIKV population diversity in different host species and viral isolates, in the study completed in chapter three, we used a Tapachula, Mexico Aedes aegypti line and a Chiapas, Mexico ZIKV isolate to assess ZIKV population dynamics during 20°C, 24°C, 28°C, 32°C, 34°C, and 36°C constant extrinsic incubation temperatures.We found that vector competence varied in a unimodal manner for constant temperatures peaking between 28°C and 32°C for both Aedes species, while transmission peaked at 10 days post-infection for Aedes aegypti and 14 days post-infection in Aedes albopictus. The diurnal temperature group is not predicted by the constant temperature distribution. Instead, when using the mean daily temperature of the diurnal group as a predicter, its VC lies between the moderate (28°C and 32°C) and extreme (25°C and 35°C) temperature group VCs. Using RNA-seq to characterize ZIKV population structure, we identified that temperature alters the ZIKV selective environment during infection. During mosquito infection, constant temperatures more often elicited positive selection whereas diurnal temperatures led to strong purifying selection in both Aedes species.These findings demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on ZIKV biology within mosquitoes and has distinct effects on the selective environment within mosquitoes. Additionally, the selective pressures induced by temperature are consistent across host species and viral strain and have similar impacts on shaping the viral population structure. However, input viral populations are still a driving factor of diversity and expansion during systemic mosquito infection. While our findings and those of others suggest that vector competence is impacted unimodally regardless of temperature, this is only applicable for constant temperatures. Future work assessing daily temperature fluctuation range and mean are needed to have a clear understanding of the role extrinsic incubation temperature plays on vector competence.

T1  - Investigations into Effects of Environmental Stressors on Lake Sturgeon Physiology, Behavior, and Survival During Early Ontogeny
AN  - 2444376021
AB  - Environmental stressors experienced by wildlife can have profound impacts on behavior and physiology that may have consequences for survival.  My dissertation investigates how early life stress influences physiology, behavior, and survival in lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), an ancient chondrostean fish species.  Lake sturgeon are regionally threatened, and therefore exploring the mechanisms by which stressors influence fitness is important in informing conservation efforts.  My dissertation examines behavioral and physiological outcomes of four potential stressors encountered by lake sturgeon larvae: high temperature, maternal-offspring environmental mismatch, captive rearing, and predator interaction.  
In Chapter 1, I examined effects of temperature by comparing lake sturgeon reared at 10℃ (low stress) and 18℃ (high stress).  During the free embryo stage, individuals reared at 18C exhibited a smaller cortisol elevation in response to an acute stressor, indicating lower physiological reactivity to stress.  At the larval stage, individuals reared at 18C had higher levels of swimming activity and higher survival rates when exposed to a crayfish predator.  Findings suggest that physiological and behavioral phenotypes induced by early life stress may be adaptive during subsequent life stages in high-stress contexts such as exposure to predators
In Chapter 2, I further explored the adaptive potential of stress-related phenotypes.  Since stressed females can provision eggs with elevated cortisol that potentially prepares offspring for high-stress conditions, I investigated outcomes of a match or mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels.  Individuals that experienced both high egg cortisol and high stress had reduced cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor, but only in one of two families.  Results suggest that family (genetic) effects may mediate the interaction of maternal and offspring stress experiences.  The largest differences in swimming activity occurred between the “mismatch” treatments, indicating that the combination of egg cortisol and offspring stress is more important in determining offspring behavior than is egg cortisol or offspring stress alone.  
In Chapter 3, I evaluated the role of stress in conservation programs by comparing stress levels, behavior, and predation rates for hatchery-produced and wild-caught lake sturgeon larvae.  Cortisol levels did not indicate that hatchery-produced individuals were more stressed, but cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor disappeared for both hatchery-produced and wild-caught larvae after 9 days in the hatchery.  Predation rates increased over time for larvae from both treatments, suggesting that the hatchery environment may inhibit survival even though individuals do not exhibit high stress.  Results highlight that effects of captive rearing become evident after only a short duration spent in captivity during early ontogeny.   
In Chapter 4, I investigated stress-related effects of encounters with aquatic insects commonly found in stream substrate during the free embryo stage.  Lake sturgeon experienced stress proportional to the amount of predation risk experienced.  Individuals that encountered Perlidae (obligate predators) had high mortality as well as elevated cortisol and cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor.  Individuals that encountered Isonychiidae (facultative predators) had slightly elevated mortality compared to individuals that encountered no insects, and had slightly elevated cortisol levels and cortisol reactivity.  Results indicate early life stress as a mechanism by which nonlethal predator interactions impact lake sturgeon, indicating the importance of community-level ecological context in predicting outcomes for species of conservation concern.

T1  - Search for Selection: Genomic, Transcriptomic, and Phenotypic Investigations of Spotted Seatrout (Cynoscion Nebulosus)
AN  - 2443415249
AB  - Climate change has resulted in both increased mean water temperature and higher frequencies of extreme water temperatures in coastal areas. These new thermal regimes exert strong selective pressure on the thermal physiology of coastal aquatic species. Phenotypic plasticity (the ability of one genotype to display multiple phenotypes) and local adaptation (increased fitness to local environment due to natural selection) dictate both short-term (from hours to days to weeks) and long-term (from years to decades) resilience of a species. To better predict how a species will respond to the negative impacts of climate change, one first needs to know the current levels of variation in plasticity and local adaptation. Marginal populations are especially critical for the persistence of a species, as those populations can harbor unique genetic variation and the interaction between plasticity and local adaptation determines the boundaries of future distributional ranges. This dissertation focuses on the northern marginal population of spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), an estuarine-dependent fish, and compares them with those from the core region of the distribution to elucidate the physiological, transcriptomic and genetic mechanisms of plasticity and adaptation. I discovered significant differences between fish from different areas at all three levels of biological organization: Chapter 1 shows different whole-organism metabolic physiology of fish sampled from distinct populations and the northern population is consistent with cold-adaptation, given the pressure of natural selection from more severe and frequent winter kills in the region. Chapter 2 presents functional genetic evidence that the cold-adapted northern spotted seatrout are more vulnerable to heat stress than the warm-adapted southern spotted seatrout, suggesting that differential gene expression is contributing to observed differences in thermal tolerance. A liver transcriptome is de novo assembled and serves as a valuable resource for future genetic studies of spotted seatrout. Chapter 3 discovers signatures of selection based on over 15,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The pattern of genetic variation is consistent with thermal adaptation along the US east coast. Genes involved in metabolic pathways and transcriptional regulation are the main targets of natural selection. In summary, spotted seatrout are relatively resilient to the thermal effects of climate change due to a wide range of metabolic plasticity and adaptive potential in climate-related genetic variation. Range expansion at the leading edge, however, is largely constrained by the species’ cold tolerance limit. The northern and southern population will likely respond to climate change differently and this should be taken into consideration in future conservation management of this species.

T1  - Larval Transport on Windy Coasts
AN  - 2442590965
AB  - Most marine animals reproduce via a dispersing planktonic larval phase. Tiny, poorly swimming larvae develop at sea as they are transported by ocean currents. Whether they reach suitable habitat for settlement and adulthood and which population of their conspecifics they might join depends on their ability to exploit variation in currents to control their trajectories. Larvae exhibit swimming behaviors that affect their vertical position in the water, which alters the currents to which they are exposed. These behaviors can vary across taxa, larval developmental stages, and diel or tidal cycles.The interaction between large-scale mean currents and the seafloor generates a multitude of circulation mechanisms on the inner continental shelf, where larvae are produced. The strength and direction of flow varies with time and space, including with depth, so larvae may interact with a variety of transport mechanism whose impact on their travel depends on their depth position. Indeed numerous such mechanisms have been documented in recent decades, including surface waves, internal waves, fronts, and eddies. Enumerating these flow mechanisms in space and time, paired with broadening our understanding of larval behavior and phenology, are key to understanding the role of the larval phase in marine population and community dynamics, genetic exchange, adaptive potential, and fisheries management.I sought to elucidate in new detail the operation of two nearshore circulation mechanisms and their role in larval transport. In Chapter 1, I describe internal wave generation at Bahia Todos Santos, Mexico, where they are known to bring larvae and nutrient pulses shoreward. Internal waves are vertical excursions of the density field, as opposed to surface waves, which are vertical excursions of sea-level height. They occur during stratified conditions in all major bodies of water and can be major contributors to the movement of water, nutrients, and particles. Internal waves themselves are variable, though, and their capacity to transport larvae depends on their physical characteristics. Using an array of instruments to measure temperature and currents, I showed that internal wave characteristics may be modified by other concurrent processes, specifically wind-driven currents.Wind-driven coastal upwelling brings dense bottom waters toward the surface and, as long as the water column remains stratified, this results in modified conditions through which internal waves propagate. The water that is transported shoreward by internal waves is cooler and holds less oxygen and more nutrients than in the absence of recent wind. Additionally, wind-driven currents in the direction of wave propagation enhance the particle transport potential of the waves, increasing the likelihood of particles being entrained and the distance that they travel.Chapters 2 and 3 focus on wind-driven currents in the persistent coastal upwelling system around Bodega Bay in central California. In Chapter 2, I explore the physics of flow separation and eddy formation around the headland that comprises the northern and windward promontory delineating the downstream bay. Using an array of current profilers and thermistors, I found that headland wake dynamics in this system were atypical because wind was not fully blocked by the headland. This resulted in strong wind-driven surface currents in the bay itself that moved in opposition to the flow separation eddy that would be expected in similar systems with well-protected bays. While vertically sheared flow and eddy recirculation occurred, they were transient and confined to a bottom layer. Under the strongest of coastal upwelling conditions, eddy recirculation in the bay was undetectable. It was replaced by a local, within-bay upwelling cell fed by return flow in a bottom layer and at the windward margin of the bay. This circulation mode and the complex dynamics in response to strengthening wind forcing in this system present novel considerations in the nearshore processes that affect transport.Chapter 3 examines the impact of the circulation modes discovered in Bodega Bay on the local taxa by enumerating larval abundance and settlement around the headland and bay system. I collected larval abundance samples at two depths in each of six locations on a bi-weekly basis, giving a snapshot of larval concentrations inside of the bay, at the seaward margin of the bay, and outside of the bay. Simultaneously, I conducted bi-weekly censuses of larval settlement using ceramic tiles and plastic scrubbers placed in high and low depth strata at six mooring and four intertidal locations.Larval abundance varied greatly with depth, location, and environmental conditions. In the deeper layer, upwelling conditions had little effect on total larval abundance at most location, but drove higher abundance at the location behind the headland most protected from wind. In the shallow layer, most locations at the bay margin or inside the bay showed a weak negative relationship between coastal upwelling conditions and larval abundance. At the farthest location inside the bay, however, the strongest wind forcing caused an increase in larvae as the local bay upwelling cell forced larvae up from depth.A taxon-specific analysis showed that indeed many taxa peaked in abundance inside the bay under moderate coastal upwelling or relaxation conditions. Some responded positively to these conditions throughout the system, though, and others responded negatively throughout the system. All taxa responded in the reverse in one depth stratum compared with the other in at least one location. Taxa fit into one of five response categories. The four categories that contained multiple taxa had representatives from three phyla and multiple ecological guilds.The similarities in the response of larval abundance to oceanographic conditions were driven by the co-occurrence of larvae across taxa at similar depths and times, highlighting the importance of larval swimming behaviors and the phenology of larval production for determining transport trajectories. Additionally, hindcasts of larval abundance using historical wind data demonstrated the importance of environmental variability, as some years favored certain taxa while other years were broadly positive or negative across groups. I found that settlement was often positively correlated with larval abundance at mooring sites and in the depth strata where a given taxa was more common. The two were often uncorrelated or even negatively correlated at intertidal sites, though these relationships varied by taxa and location. Additional time or circulation mechanisms may be required to couple the two processes more closely or else post-settlement mortality and sampling bias may have affected intertidal sites more strongly than mooring sites.This work demonstrated both the complexity and the tractability of nearshore circulation and transport dynamics. Internal waves were modified by coastal upwelling and wind-driven circulation in a predictable interaction with quantifiable effect on transport. Similarly, while headland wake dynamics were made more complex by local wind stress, coherent circulation scenarios emerged with patterned effects on larval abundance in the system. Despite the great deal of complexity involved in larval transport, it is possible to downscale from regional conditions to local dynamics with enough understanding of nearshore circulation mechanisms and larval behavior. An improved ability to predict these dynamics will aid our ability to effectively manage sensitive and exploited species as well as better understand the population and evolutionary dynamics of life in the sea.

T1  - Habitat Selection Across a Temperature and Nutrient Gradient by Cope’s Grey Treefrog (<em>Hyla Chrysoscelis</em>) and the Mosquito, <em>Culex Restuans</em>
AN  - 2441596576
AB  - Habitat selection by pond breeding amphibians and insects is often critical for larval survival, performance, and resulting parental fitness, since there is typically little parental care beyond oviposition site choice. Numerous axes of patch quality have been identified and quantified, but species with varied life histories may differently shift perception of habitat quality as changes in global climate increase water temperatures and rates of eutrophication. Three outdoor mesocosm experiments were conducted using two species with complex life cycles and very different life histories; Hyla chrysoscelis, or Cope’s Gray tree frog, and the mosquito (Culex restuans). Two mesocosm experiments were conducted to test the oviposition preference of each species by establishing gradients of temperature and nutrients in a completely crossed design. Additionally, a third mesocosm experiment testing larval performance of H. chrysoscelis was conducted by measuring frog metamorph body metrics of individuals reared in each temperature and nutrient combination. The temperature and nutrient treatments showed no significant effect in any of the three experiments, but each experiment had significant covariate predictors. The temperature difference from control pools in each block had a significant positive linear relationship with the number of H. chrysoscelis eggs laid per mesocosm, and metamorph mass increased with higher nitrate levels. C. restuans laid more egg rafts in mesocosms with higher levels of nitrate, and nitrate was driven significantly by temperature. Both species choose to oviposit in treatments that may ultimately benefit their offspring through increase rate of development and survival. The environmental variables that influence oviposition choice and offspring performance are crucial to understanding species distributions, abundances, and community structure as global warming and eutrophication affect the quality of freshwater systems.

T1  - The Effect of Temperature Throughout Intracapsular Development and Adult Life of the European Sting Winkle, Ocenebra Erinaceus (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Global Warming Contex
AN  - 2440355133
AB  - Climate change is shifting temperature regimes across Earth, which will result in impacts on the physiology, ecology and distribution patterns of organisms, especially for ectotherms species were nearly all-physiological and behavioural traits are sensitive to temperature. Many predictions assume that each population of a particular species has the same environmental niche; however, these predictions do not consider that across species’ geographic distributions, species exhibit intraspecific differences among populations. This could be more pronounced for species that undergo direct development, with restricted connectivity and low gene flow, which increase the potential for individuals to evolve local adaptations to native environmental conditions. This thesis aimed to understand the effect of temperature during the early and adult stages in two populations with different thermal histories of the European winkle Ocenebra erinaceus (Linnaeus, 1758). The results showed that O. erinaceus exhibits intraspecific differences during early development in terms of its thermal tolerance and physiological response. Embryos from the warm water population showed a wide, eurythermal tolerance range, exhibiting metabolic adjustment to increased temperatures. On the contrary, embryos from the cold water population showed narrow thermal tolerance windows, showing limited metabolic compensation to high temperatures. The thermal tolerance variation among populations of O. erinaceus might be a result of physiological adaptations to local thermal conditions. Moreover, local adaptation during early stages can persists in later ontogenetic stages. Adults from the thermal sensitive population (i.e. cold water) exposed to future ocean conditions showed a partial acclimation and cessation of reproductive investment. This study demonstrated that the impact of global warming will depend on the physiological adaptation of embryos as well as adults to local environmental conditions. O. erinaceus exhibits intraspecific differences at population-scale in its optimal temperatures and thermal limits. In warming scenarios, local extinctions will be expected in northern populations with the potential of the expansion of the distribution range of southern populations to fill the niche space left empty by northern populations.

T1  - Selection and Plasticity: Novel Phenotypic Trajectories in the Era of Climate Change
AN  - 2440095121
AB  - Rising temperatures across the planet are exposing populations to environmental conditions previously unexperienced by these lineages, and the responses to these changes are myriad. Depending on the species and population, responses to changing climates can encompass shifts in geographic ranges, rapid genetic adaptation, or new phenotypic distributions caused by plasticity. In the case where populations are unable to exhibit one of the aforementioned responses, extinction is the inevitable outcome. Scientists have recognized this issue and have worked tirelessly over the last 30 years to determine which species are vulnerable, how populations are responding to rapid environmental changes, and how to best conserve the most at-risk lineages. However, the efforts to predict how populations and species will persist after a century of consistent and strong climate change tend to ignore how these changes affect contemporary populations, and thus we risk missing the critical phenotypic trajectories that lead to rapid adaptation, range shifts, or extinction, which could provide both a platform for informing species conservation, but also enhance our knowledge of biodiversity. This dissertation explores how environmental variation over a variety of spatial and temporal scales impacts the selective environment in which species live, as well as the multiple plastic responses populations can exhibit in response to changing environmental conditions. First, the relationship between declining food availability and rising environmental temperatures is quantified. Food availability exacerbates organismal performance and reduces the availability of populations to mount adaptive phenotypic changes in response to changing environments. Second, the relationship between thermoregulatory behavior and individual fitness is quantified. Fitness is increased when lizards exhibit warmer preferred temperatures and can sprint faster to enhance their thermoregulatory ability. Third, the efficacy of short-term plasticity in response to heat waves is quantified. Heat waves induce “hardening responses” which are stress-induced physiological mechanisms of surviving short-term and deleterious environmental fluctuations. Indeed, when these responses are elicited, other phenotypic traits suffer which trade-off with an individual’s ability to exploit the adaptive nature of plasticity. Last, population-level variation is quantified in climate-relevant traits for populations across an elevational gradient. Breaking from other studies, I find strong local adaptation consistent with the environmental differences across populations. Together, these findings provide new insights on the co-evolution of behavior and physiology, how traits respond to environmental variability, and the efficacy of different phenotypic response options that species can use to buffer the effects of climate warming.

T1  - Essays in Macroeconomics
AN  - 2437781241
AB  - This dissertation consists of three chapters, each of them containing an essay in macroeconomics, inequality, and/or labor markets.The first chapter, "Sources of Lifetime Inequality Revisited", develops a theory to assess the importance of differences in early stages in life, before entering the labor market, in lifetime earnings, wealth and welfare. Factors established early in life can be key determinants of the lifetime value of earnings, consumption, and wealth. Furthermore, some of these variables are determined by parental background (ability, human capital) or passed on directly from parents (wealth). In this paper, I study a life cycle - overlapping generations economy with borrowing constraints and costly human capital acquisition, in which initial conditions are determined by parental background. The cost of human capital may prevent constrained agents to optimally acquire human capital and intergenerational transmission of wealth may alleviate this effect for wealthy households. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), I document statistics of the evolution of cohort inequality and the importance of parental transfer to attend college. I find that initial conditions can explain about 10% of the variation in lifetime income and wealth. Relaxing borrowing increases college enrollment and decreases inequality. The intergenerational correlation of abilities explains more than half of the intergenerational income elasticity, suggesting an important role for the parental background.The second chapter, "Avoiding Layoffs: On-the-job Search and Partial Insurance'', coauthored with Benjamin Villena, is motivated by two important facts: (i) A sizable amount of the employment-employment are done by workers who accept wage cuts, and (ii) conditional on doing on-the-job search, the probability of experiencing an employment-unemployment transition is higher. We interpret these pieces of evidence as if workers search on-the-job to prevent a layoff in the near future. We conceptualize this behavior as a self-insurance mechanism obtained by exerting effort. We formalize these intuitions by constructing an economy with idiosyncratic dismissal shocks and costly on-the-job search. Workers may use on-the-job search not only as a mechanism to climb the wage ladder, but also to avoid future bad shocks and hence, on-the-job search acts as an insurance mechanism. We show that consumption evolves according to a standard Euler equation in which current effort impacts the income distribution tomorrow. Using data from the Sources of Consumer Expectations, we estimate an idiosyncratic process of layoff probability. We also show that agents exert more effort when they face higher risk and that they are willing to accept lower wages. We solve and calibrate the model to account for these facts. We measure the insurance that this mechanism provides by computing the extra consumption that an agent has to receive to be indifferent with respect to an economy where they do not have the extensive margin of effort. Our calculations suggest that there is on average an increase in 15% in consumption due to the presence of this mechanism.In the third chapter, "Taxes, wealth inequality and mobility'', I develop a theory to study the impact of taxation on wealth inequality and wealth mobility across generations. I propose a model in which agents are heterogeneous in their labor productivity and entrepreneurship ability, and agents have warm glow-bequest functions. Wealth inequality and mobility are determined by heterogeneous returns to entrepreneurship and bequests. The government changes the incentives to wealth accumulation and transmission with the tax schedule. I consider progressive income taxes, corporate taxes, and estate taxes. The model is calibrated to replicate empirical social mobility observed in the data, as well as wealth inequality. I use the model to estimate the impact of taxes on wealth inequality and wealth mobility. The counterfactual exercise suggests that rising estate taxes and corporate taxes can have a large effect in reducing inequality with a minimum cost in terms of output.

T1  - The Spatiotemporal Ecology of the Bonnethead, <em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>: Migration, Parturition and Magnetic-Based Navigation
AN  - 2434033064
AB  - Elasmobranch fishes are a highly vagile group that often cross state, regional or international boundaries. Delineating migratory patterns that cross jurisdictional boundaries is essential for effective management, especially when confronted with fishing pressures and regulations that vary over space and time. In addition to migrating individuals, studying critical life stages, such as neonates, is important for fisheries management. The broad goal of this dissertation was to develop a robust understanding of the spatiotemporal ecology of the bonnethead, Sphyrna tiburo. Our objectives were to quantify migration metrics (duration, distance, etc.) and assess the effects of ocean temperature on these metrics, to delineate the species’ pupping grounds and to determine if the bonnethead uses magnetic-based navigation.We used passive acoustic telemetry to track the migrations of 44 bonnetheads for up to 1506 days across ~ 1070 km of Southeastern United States Atlantic coastline. Bonnetheads are a widely distributed small coastal shark in the western hemisphere. The majority of these sharks exhibited strong site fidelity to the North Edisto River in South Carolina and returned annually, residing in the estuary from April to November. Climatic migrations then occurred and overwintering habitats were located throughout Georgia and mid-Florida waters. We present the interannual effects of varying ocean temperature on the seasonal migrations of individual sharks. We found that interannual variations in sea surface temperature had significant effects on the migration distance, duration, and date of arrival to overwintering habitats of individual sharks. An electivity analysis suggested that overwintering locations are selected based upon ocean temperature and not physical location. Given the significant effects of sea surface temperature on migration, future migrations may be altered due to climate change and warming seas. Given the degree of site fidelity observed, our work also has robust implications for the management of this species, as animals with strong ties to specific locations are put at high risks of localized extirpation. The data generated from this study can be used to generate predictive models that can estimate overwintering areas based upon sea surface temperature. These areas can then be protected during migration should the stock become imperiled.While monitoring the residency of S. tiburo in the North Edisto River (NER) we noticed a repeated absence of acoustic detections that aligned with the temporal span when parturition occurs. This absence from the NER suggested they may be giving birth outside of the estuarine waters. We used acoustic telemetry to track pregnant females and found they left the NER for ~2 weeks every year. During this time, they underwent a migration down the coast of the United States into the coastal waters of southern South Carolina and Georgia. We also analyzed fishery-independent surveys and found neonates began to appear in nearshore trawls during this same time period. The mature females caught in these surveys also lost ~1 kg of total body weight from summer to early fall, which we suspect indicates a birthing event. Additionally, an independent study from the same region demonstrated that bonnetheads were post-partum in September. Collectively these data illustrate that bonnetheads emigrate from the NER while pregnant, migrate down the coast, give birth and return to the NER. These data are important for the management of the bonnethead because their primary source of mortality is as bycatch in the shrimp fishery, which has spatiotemporal overlap in these nearshore waters.In our first two research chapters, we highlighted the migratory behavior of the bonnethead and demonstrated that they are capable of migrating over 1,000 km and successfully returning to a target location. In order for these movements to be possible, having a map sense may be important, and the earth’s magnetic field appears to be an important component of this behavior for other taxa. Whilst sharks have been at the forefront of sensory physiology research on sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, whether they use Earth's magnetic field for navigation is unresolved. Here we use a “magnetic displacement” experiment to show that sharks can use the map-like information from earth’s magnetic field to orient. Bonnethead sharks captured along the panhandle of Florida and exposed to a magnetic field mimicking a southern latitude within their range in the Gulf of Mexico oriented homeward, whereas orientation was random when exposed to a field that mimicked a northern latitude outside of their range (in the continental U.S.A.). Likewise, orientation was random when sharks were exposed to a field that controlled for nonspecific effects of the testing procedure. Given that sharks have prior experience of more southern magnetic fields than the control site, but never of more northern fields, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that sharks learn magnetic features for navigational tasks. The apparent ability of sharks to discriminate position using magnetic cues may also explain the sensory basis by which genetic structure of shark populations are maintained and how cryptic speciation can occur - despite no geographic barriers among reproductive locations.

T1  - A Survey of Different Materials as Heterogeneous Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis
AN  - 2430804592
AB  - The Haber–Bosch Process which was developed in the early 1900’s, was a landmark achievement of the 20th Century. Today the process produces over 174 million tonnes of ammonia annually, establishing an accessible route to produce over 450 million tonnes of synthetic fertilizer which maintains food production for 40 % of the global population. The Haber–Bosch Process involves combining pure H2 and N2 feed streams directly over a promoted iron catalyst at temperatures of around 400–500°C and reaction pressures of over 100 atmospheres. The reaction is exothermic and is equilibrium limited, thus it is thermodynamically favoured at lower reaction temperatures. Despite this, the temperature of operation is dictated by the requirement to achieve acceptable process kinetics. The Haber–Bosch Process is generally conducted at large scale and the process and the generation of feedstock for the reaction are energy intensive using 1–2 % of the world’s manmade energy and contributing 1.6 % of manmade CO2 emissions. The development of small-scale ammonia plants that function using renewable feed stock and sustainable electricity, can lessen such disadvantages towards the environment and can further offer financial benefits. As a result, the development of catalysts suitable for small-scale ammonia plants using less harsh reaction conditions are of interest. Supported catalysts have been extensively studied and are well known for catalysing a wide variety of reactions. There are some low surface area catalysts that have been reported to be highly active in ammonia synthesis and using a suitable support, the catalytic phase can be dispersed, thus possibly further improving ammonia synthesis activity. In this work, a series of supported molybdenum, cobalt and cobalt-rhenium based catalysts were synthesised and tested for ammonia synthesis. Oxide supports with contrasting properties such as SiO2, α–Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, CaO and MgO were applied and the active phases were added to the supports via a wetness impregnation based procedure. A comparison of the ammonia synthesis activities of the catalysts with their respective supports are surveyed in this thesis. The different catalyst systems possessed different characteristics that influenced ammonia synthesis activities. Supported molybdenum catalysts were mainly influenced by the presence of different molybdenum species, while the supported cobalt and cobalt-rhenium catalysts were influenced by the support used. The CoRe/MgO catalyst was found to possess the highest activity in this work under the reaction conditions applied.

T1  - Design of High-Performance Triboelectric Nanogenerators (Tengs) for Energy Harvesting Applications
AN  - 2430651538
AB  - The growing concerns around the long-term viability of the fossil fuel-based energy and its associated environmental cost are necessitating new research paradigms for energy generation and harvesting. An attractive and effective way to respond to the current energy crisis is through the harvesting of ambient mechanical energy from our environment. The conventional mechanical energy harvesting technologies are highly dependent on either the use of rare earth magnetic materials, high precision microfabrication techniques or composed of brittle materials, which are required to be driven at very high resonant frequencies, not frequently encountered beyond an industrial setting. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), based on the triboelectrification and electrostatic induction effects, have been demonstrated as a novel harvesting technique to collect and transform ambient mechanical energy into electric power. Unlike the other mechanical energy harvesters, the low-cost TENGs fabricated using commodity polymers and facile fabrication techniques, operate at low frequencies (1-10 Hz) with a high energy conversion efficiency. One of the key areas in TENG research is the enhancement of their electrical output to make them suitable for either making a self-powered system viable or powering small portable electronics directly. Except for the judicious use of tribo-materials or the tribo-layer architecture optimisation, the rest of the methods for enhancing the TENG output are reliant on expensive equipment and complicated processing, that undermine the advantages of TENGs and may not provide the required stability and reliability. This PhD study aims to establish novel strategies to enhance output performance of TENG by developing new tribo-materials and phenomena such as coupling of tribo-piezoelectric effects to showcase potential applications of the TENG devices. The research work conducted and the achievements are summarized as follows. Firstly, a novel output performance improvement strategy of utilising stress-induced polarization effect of the piezoelectric materials was proposed. An interfacial layer of piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheets was deposited to generate additional piezoelectric charge induced by the vertical contact-separate generation cycle. This extra piezoelectric charge is injected into the upper polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tribo-negative layer for the enhancement of the surface charge density from ~110 μC.m-2 to ~225.7 μC.m-2. The introduction of the ZnO and Zn-Al:Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH), as charge injection layer and anionic clay, enhanced the instantaneous power output from ~11 W.m-2 to 47 W.m-2. Subsequently, based on a similar principle, a novel composite of lead-free perovskite, zinc stannate (ZnSnO3), and a fluoropolymer, poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, was proposed for the stress-polarisation tribo-negative behaviour with a simplified structure. The PVDF-ZnSnO3 composite membranes were realised through a facile phase-inversion technique leading to higher piezoelectric constant (76.3 pm.V-1) and β-phase (72%) for the composites. When applied to the TENG devices, the PVDF-ZnSnO3 membranes allowed spontaneous polarisation effects which led to significant enhancement of the electrical outputs, with maximum peak-to-peak voltage and effective transferred current density of ~600 V and ~206 μC.m-2, respectively. The surface charge enhancement and distribution of the composite membrane were also probed and demonstrated through the electrostatic force (EFM) and piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). To overcome the difficulty in processing of the currently known most tribo-negative material, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), an emulsion electrospinning technique incorporating polyethene oxide (PEO) was introduced. It was observed that the subsequent thermal removal of PEO led to a significant degradation in the surface charge density of the obtained PTFE nanofibrous membranes, which was overcome using a facile negative ion-injection process. The measured electrical outputs, with a maximum peak-to-peak voltage output of ~900 V and charge density of ∼149 μC.m−2, demonstrated the excellent effect of the enhanced contact area to the improvement of the outputs. The work eliminates the demonstrated need for surface micro structuring using reactive ion etching of PTFE surfaces by introducing a relatively simple, costeffective, and environmentally friendly technique for fabricating fibrous fluoropolymers tribonegative layer for the energy harvesting applications. Finally, a unique mouldable material, aniline formaldehyde resin (AFR) was synthesised and characterised. The synthesised AFR, as a resinous polymer with significant amine (-NH2) groups acquires the most surface positive charge, is applied as a tribo-positive material. The heatpressed AFR thin-film based TENG was subsequently tested to demonstrate its outstanding performance serving as a tribo-positive layer compared to the Polyamide 6 (PA6) and polyethene oxide (PEO), as one of the most common used tribo-positive materials. In addition, a Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) was subsequently employed to study the surface potential of the produced AFR layer and the surface potential change of the contact layers during the energy generation cycles. All of the produced high-performance TENGs (power output ranging from 9 - 47 W.m-2) have the potential to be utilised further in enabling self-powered systems and can serve as a new alternative energy harvesting source of great significance.

T1  - Identifying Opportunities for Resilience in Reef-Building Corals as Ocean Warming Continues
AN  - 2430382200
AB  - Identifying and harnessing processes that promote coral recovery and resilience is crucial. The declining status of coral-reef ecosystems has led to proposed interventions to selectively propagate thermally resistant corals, aiming to increase coral resilience under ocean warming and intensified bleaching events. Using a combination of field and laboratory studies, this research assesses fundamental biological traits, with an emphasis on reproduction, of Porites astreoides along the Florida Keys Reef Tract (FRT) and Montipora capitata within Kāneʻohe Bay, Hawaiʻi during and after the 2015 global coral bleaching event. By assessing two coral species considered ecological “winners” in U.S. coral reef ecosystems, I highlight limitations and potential challenges associated with coral restoration efforts considering “exceptional” reef selection, selective breeding, and thermal conditioning. First, I compared seasonal and spatial patterns in the biological function of P. astreoides at sites located along the FRT to determine trade-offs during and after bleaching. Second, I assessed the impacts of differential bleaching susceptibility (bleached and recovered vs. nonbleached) of Montipora capitata on sexual reproduction and selectively bred offspring in subsequent spawning seasons. Third, I examined the parental effects of M. capitata associated with bleaching history and thermal conditioning on sexual reproduction and offspring performance. My results demonstrate that despite a severe bleaching event, (i) there is an exceptional site in the FRT where corals are not limited by trade-offs but the environmental and biological drivers remain unknown, (ii) sexual reproduction in Hawaiʻi appears to be robust regardless of bleaching response; however, there were delayed beneficial maternal effects in bleaching resistant colonies on offspring survivorship, and (iii) high thermal conditioning reduces reproductive output regardless of parental bleaching susceptibility and parental effects did not elicit lasting thermal resistance. Further research is required to determine the risks, benefits, efficacy, and scalability of human interventions to preserve resilient reefs in conjunction with action to reduce the use of fossil fuels that significantly contribute to ocean warming.

T1  - Captive Rearing and Semiochemcial Ecology of <em>Trichogramma papilionis</em> (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)
AN  - 2429042204
AB  - This study addressed aspects of mass rearing of Trichogramma papilionis (Hymenoptera; Trichogrammatidae), including the effects of varied colony founder size on wasp fitness, and the exploitation of the wasps to locate egg hosts in which to deposit thereof progeny. Effects of initial founder female number of T. papilionis were investigated using fitness parameters (emergency rate, sex ratio and fecundity) to quantify the effects of a severe bottleneck (single founder female) on 10 subsequent generations. Results showed that no significant difference for eggs laid per female over ten generations, suggesting that the imposed bottleneck did not result in reduced female fecundity for any founder population size. However, founder numbers did affect both the emergence rate and sex ratio of T. papilionis. Further investigation of the impacts of inbreeding on field performance of the wasps was discontinued as extremely limited host finding ability of the wasps was observed in some habitats. The emphasis of the work was thus shifted to elucidating the searching behaviors of T. papilionis in relation to chemical cues. The hypothesis that T. papilionis are attracted to host habitat by host plant or egg-associated volatile chemicals was tested.The response of T. papilionis females to olfactory cues from host eggs, host plants and induced plant volatiles were studied. The response of T. papilionis females to different info-chemical cues was tested in Y-tube olfactory assays. Wasps made a positive response to odors from corn earworm (CEW) eggs Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) compared with blank air, while there was a negative response to Ephestia kuehniella eggs (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) compared blank air: T. papilionis females thus preferred odors from corn earworm eggs over the Mediterranean flour moth eggs. Further, the wasps were attracted to volatile emissions from sunn hemp Crotalaria juncea (L.) over maize Zea mays (L.), despite both plants infested with H. zea eggs. No preference was observed for plants not infested with H. zea eggs, suggesting T. papilionis showed a positive response to stimuli from sunn hemp plants that might be induced by H. zea oviposition. Chemical volatile collection and headspace analysis was conducted. Headspace analysis and thermal desorption and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GCMS) was used to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively determine the difference in plant volatile organic components (VOCs) from Helicoverpa zea egg infested sunn hemp plants compared with intact sunn hemp plants and H. zea eggs only. TD is used as a preconcentration technique of VOCs for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), making it useful to detect low-concentration analytes that would otherwise be undetectable. Results demonstrated that sunn hemp plants released 55 chemical volatiles with five compounds that were unique, or were emitted in higher concentrations, for plants infested with CEW eggs. These volatile compounds were consistent with linear alkanes, aldehydes, aromatics, polyterpene-related compounds, naphthalene derivatives, and ester-related compounds. High concentrations of anisole, β-myrcene, cis-butyric acid, trans-isoeugenol, and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were found in infested sunn hemp. The majority of GCMS peaks detected from H. zea eggs were consistent with phosphates, pheromone-related compounds, various natural products, a series of glycol-related compounds, and a series of fatty acid ester-related compounds. Several compounds were shared in sunn hemp samples and corn earworm eggs: anisole, β-myrcene, and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, but were detected in higher concentrations from the plants with H. zea eggs.Evaluation of the response and the performance of T. papilionis females in y-tube olfactory bioassays to single compounds, and blends of synthetic chemical showed that the wasps were significantly attracted to only two of the assayed chemical volatiles (anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate). Some concentrations of anisole and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were attractant to the wasps, whereas some concentrations of the other tested chemical compounds repelled the wasps. Wasps were attracted to a blend of anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (25μL /100μL ratio) which is similar to the ratio of anisole to bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate detected in the (GC-DMS) chromatograph for C. juncea plants infested with H. zea eggs. No significant attraction to any other blend ratios of anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was observed.Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to determine whether the patterns observed in the y-olfactometer were consistent under less constrained conditions. The optimal blend identified above was initially tested in a greenhouse, and later in closed-canopy environments (under trees) and open habitat with no trees. The parasitism rate by T. papilionis wasps was significantly increased when the wasps were exposed to anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate blend in both greenhouse and outdoor trials (covered habitat), at least over short distance (up to 2m from the volatile sources).The findings presented in this dissertation underscore the importance of improving our understanding of how tri-trophic interactions (natural enemies- herbivores and host plants) interact to influence insect behavior, as well as the impact of variable environments, impact parasitoid wasps. The results may also contribute to finding a way to improve natural enemy efficacy in augmentative and conservation biocontrol efforts. Semiochemical cues can positively or negatively affect the response of parasitic wasps. This may provide an understanding of ecology that could facilitate achieving successful field parasitism and thus enhanced pest management.

T1  - Variational Principles in Statistical Mechanics and Their Application in Biology and Evolution
AN  - 2428584577
AB  - The Maximum Entropy Principle (Max Ent) was introduced by E.T. Jaynes in 1957 as a method to infer the most likely probability distribution given some known partial information about data. This principle was given a theoretical grounding by Shore and Johnson in 1980, who framed it in terms of self-consistency conditions on the laws of probability themselves. They showed how the concept of entropy and its maximization is not limited to equilibrium thermal systems. More recently, it has been extended to non-thermal systems at equilibrium as well as dynamical systems. After a brief overview of the principle itself, and its dynamical form (known as Maximum Caliber principle, or Max Cal) I will discuss some applications of it to systems of physical and biological relevance. In the first part of the dissertation I will show how it is possible to apply Max Ent to the protein’s sequence space, in order to determine the features of the time scales of protein evolution, adaptation to different environment and the action of other protein machinery known as chaperones. Making use of the largely accepted idea that proteins physical features are what determines the fitness of a cell, I will show how it is possible to relate the speed of adaptation and evolution to features like a proteins stability and its tendency to aggregate, as well as the concentration of chaperones. In the second part, I will show an application of Max Cal to non-equilibrium, steady state systems, which is of pivotal importance since it represents a class of systems which is among the most studied in the field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. I will show how the proper set of constraints resolves some doubts regarding the application of Max Cal to systems which exhibit specific symmetries under space reflection and time reversal. I will conclude the dissertation by showing that Max Cal can be used in a more systematic fashion when some conservation law applies to dynamical quantities, like linear and angular momentum; in such cases the choice of constraints is less arbitrary than in others.

T1  - Summer Temperature and Photoperiod Induce Physiological, Life History, and Gene Expression Changes in <em>Drosophila mojavensis</em>
AN  - 2428053202
AB  - Seasonal environmental changes act as a selective force. Across insects, there are many adaptations to unfavorable seasons. Aestivation is one such adaptation that allows insects to survive hot and dry periods experienced in summer seasons. Drosophila mojavensis is a cactophilic Drosophila species that inhabits the Sonoran Desert. Much work has been done on understanding their ecology, and their taxonomic closeness to the model system Drosophila melanogaster allows us to easily use established molecular tools. In this study, a laboratory-generated population of D. mojavensis was established and raised for four generations in conditions mimicking the field conditions of spring and summer in its natural habitat. Currently, it is unknown what physiological, behavioral and/or metabolic mechanisms allow D. mojavensis to over-summer in this hot desert environment. Collecting individuals in this region during the summer months is rare. Generating a lab raised population allowed me to manipulate temperature and photoperiod and observe changes over multiple generations in a controlled setting. Physiological changes over the generations approaching summer showed increases in heat and desiccation resistance, and overall lower activity levels. Drosophila mojavensis continued to lay eggs during the summer generations, but died much earlier than individuals from spring generations. mRNA expression data revealed sets of genes that were overrepresented in categories such as chaperones, heat response, metabolic processes, and protein synthesis/degradation. Genes that control high energy costing processes were highlighted in this study. This is the first study that systematically attempted to investigate the physiological, life history, behavioral and molecular basis of summer survival in D. mojavensis, and although the mechanism of survival appears complex, it has provided a better understanding of seasonal responses, such as continued egg production and lowered longevity, in this Sonoran Desert endemic species.

T1  - Study of Neutron Induced Reaction Cross Sections Up to 18 MeV for Advanced Reactor Design
AN  - 2423806565
AB  - There is current interest worldwide to develop new concepts of nuclear power generation and major efforts are on to realize this. Among them, accelerator driven subcritical system (ADSs), fast reactor, compact and high temperature reactors and advanced heavy water reactor (AHWR) are the most important for power production. Besides power production, ADSs is important for incineration of the long-lived actinides and transmutation of the long-lived fission products. For the design of such reactors nuclear data such as reaction and fission cross-section of structural and cladding material and fuel elements with medium to fast neutron energies are important. The nuclear waste disposal is certainly an urgent and important challenge to be tackled to ensure future sustainable growth of nuclear power. The fuel cycle based on Thorium (Th) can address both these issues owing to a number of favorable neutronics and material characteristics which makes thorium a better fertile host.Accelerator driven sub-critical reactor system (ADSs) demonstrated that a commercial nuclear power plant of adequate power can also be built around a sub critical reactor, provided it can be fed externally with required intensity of accelerator produced neutrons. The ADSs have attractive features for the elimination of troublesome long lived minor actinides and fission products of the spent fuel as well as for nuclear energy generation utilizing thorium as fuel. From India’s perspective, which has abundant reserves of thorium, ADSs is relevant because one can also exploit its potential to design hybrid reactor systems that can produce nuclear power with the use of thorium as the main fuel. ADSs based thorium burners may need only small and limited quantities of thorium and AHWR needs small amount of uranium and plutonium to serve as starter seeds. In general, the additional degree of freedom provided by the external source in ADSs can enable one to design reactor system which primarily burn thorium fuel as well as make a more efficient use of natural uranium fuel. Therefore, ADSs seems to have the potential to provide an additional route, an efficient and economic nuclear power generation with the available thorium resources. In ADSs, the high energy neutrons were produced from the spallation reaction by bombarding the GeV energy of proton from accelerator on heavy metal target like Pb and Bi. Structural Materials used in reactors, need to fulfill two objectives. 1. They should retain their mechanical properties even after irradiation with intense neutron fluxes. 2. Neutron-induced activation should not lead to the production of long- lived radioactive waste.In view of this, it is important to study the fast neutron induced reaction/fission crosssections of long-lived minor actinides (Th and U), spallation target (Pb, Bi), structural and cladding materials (e.g. Zr, Nb, Fe, Cr, Mn, Ni, Y and Ag) and neutron flux monitors (e.g. Au). Because of their very low absorption cross-sections for thermal neutrons and resistance to corrosion, these materials are frequently used as cladding of fuel rods and pipe lines of secondary coolant circuit in nuclear reactors. But its cross-sections database especially for neutron threshold reactions is rather scarce. Neutron cross-section data is required for design of different components of advanced reactor. i.e., shielding design, waste estimation, estimation of radiation damage, nuclear heating, transmutation effects, radiation dose.

T1  - Macroevolution of Microhabitat, Climate, and Morphology in Lungless Salamanders (Family: Plethodontidae)
AN  - 2421313509
AB  - Biologists have long sought to understand how ecological selective pressures drive evolutionary responses. Defining how morphology, life history, and abiotic conditions interact across deep time can reveal the selective pressures responsible for shaping various axes of biodiversity. I used this three-pronged framework to investigate the macroevolution of the family of lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), well-known for its impressive ecological and geographic diversity while exhibiting little apparent morphological diversity. Employing ancestral state estimation methods, geometric morphometrics, and various phylogenetic comparative approaches, I first investigated the macroevolutionary responses of functional morphology to microhabitat-use across the clade’s history. From these analyses, I estimated at least five independent transitions towards arboreality and over 60 transitions away from arboreality across the plethodontid tree of life. This suggests that arboreality may represent an evolutionarily transitory state for lungless salamanders, with a high tendency to abandon arboreal habitats to return to the ancestral terrestrial habitat. I also found no evidence of morphologically distinct body shapes or foot shapes in arboreal species, suggesting that it is unlikely that the tendency to occupy or abandon arboreal microhabitats is driven by biomechanical constraints. I next explored the relationship between microhabitat use and abiotic conditions, revealing that arboreal species occupy warmer, wetter climates than terrestrial species as measured by coarse environmental data summarized across entire species’ ranges. This pattern was explicated using phylogenetic comparative methods and corroborated with a novel implementation of ecological niche modeling. From this analysis, I concluded that the availability of arboreal microhabitats is largely determined by the abiotic conditions of the species range. Finally, following our discovery of the importance of climate in determining these species’ ecological patterns, I investigated the macroevolution of the morphological trait, surface area to volume ratios (SA:V), across the family with respect to climatic variation. SA:V is particularly relevant for climatic conditions as lungless salamanders display little cutaneous resistance to water-loss and are thus prone to environmentally-induced desiccation. I developed a method to estimate SA:V which strongly outperformed traditional estimates of SA:V and revealed that salamanders in less-desiccation prone climates exhibit higher and more disparate SA:Vs. This is consistent with our hypothesis that drier climates restrict the evolution of body forms conferring high SA:Vs. Altogether, these results reveal that broad climatic patterns may be the most important ecological selective pressure in shaping the macroevolution of morphology and microhabitat use for plethodontids.

T1  - “Is Garlic a Promising Dietary Agent against Cancer? Results from Experimental Studies, an Observational Study, and a Clinical Trial”
AN  - 2417470540
AB  - Background and Aims: It is estimated that approximately one-third of all cancer deaths in the United States could be avoided through appropriate dietary modification. In the last few decades, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown anti-cancer properties of garlic (Allium sativum), in organs including stomach, liver, colon, prostate, skin, bladder, breast, and lung. Although results are inconsistent and far from conclusive, epidemiologic studies have shown an association between dietary garlic intake and reduced risk of cancers including stomach, colon, breast, lung, and esophagus. Very few or no studies exist for other types of cancers. Most studies have been conducted in Europe and Asia and not in the U.S. Garlic consumption patterns vary greatly in different areas of the world. The potential benefits of garlic could also differ by the form consumed. Not all forms of garlic contain the same crucial elements and garlic consumption (both form and quantity) varies by region. Therefore, the current study aimed to address these gaps in knowledge by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the association between garlic consumption and supplement use and risk of total cancer incidence and mortality in general and at specific cancer sites using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Trial (PLCO); 2) quantify and compare the effective antioxidant components and anti-proliferative properties for several forms of garlic (raw crushed, garlic powder, cooked, black garlic and two garlic supplements) in two different solutions (alcohol and water); and 3) explore garlic supplement effects on biomarkers of antioxidant activity in a pilot randomized control crossover trial.Methods: Aim 1: Using data from the PLCO trial we prospectively assessed the association between garlic intake and risk of cancer incidence and mortality in the US population. Participants were followed for a median for 12.4 years with information on cancer diagnoses and death up until December 31, 2009. Data on garlic consumption was collected at baseline from the participants in the intervention arm only using a dietary health questionnaire (DQX) (n = 57,997). Data on garlic supplement use was introduced in 1998 and collected from the participants in both arms using the diet history questionnaire (DHQ) (n = 88,973). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard risks and 95% confidence intervals [HR (95% CI)] after controlling for age, gender, smoking and other relevant covariates. Follow-up time was calculated from the participant age when the dietary questionnaire was completed until the occurrence of either: cancer diagnosis event, death, or end of the follow-up.Aim 2: The different types of garlic were purchased in Buffalo, NY. Aqueous and methanol extracts of seven garlic forms were investigated for their antioxidant and antiproliferative activity: raw garlic, raw garlic set aside for 10 minutes, garlic powder, cooked garlic, black garlic, and two garlic supplements (Garlicin and Kyolic). Antioxidant activity was evaluated utilizing the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) assay, superoxide assay, and hydroxyl assay. Antioxidant activity was calculated in terms of gram equivalents of ascorbic acid per gram of sample. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays were conducted to assess the antiproliferative effects of treatment for 48 hours with the extracts in cell lines selected to represent common cancer histologic and molecular lung cancer subtypes. Two-fold dilution concentrations of garlic extract were used ranging from 0.08% to 2.5% and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated from dose-response curves. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used at P < 0.05 to compare the means. Post-hoc tests were used to compare pairwise differences.Aim 3: We investigated the effects of garlic supplementation on serum antioxidant parameters in a pilot, randomized, single-blinded, crossover study. Participants were recruited from the University at Buffalo and randomized into either the intervention group, who received two Garlicin pills every day for 14 days, or the control group, who received placebo pills. This treatment was followed by a two-week washout period before crossing over into the other arm for another two weeks. Blood, urine, and anthropometric measures were taken at baseline and at three follow-up visits every two weeks. For between group comparisons, linear mixed-effects models of variance were used to estimate the overall mean, the treatment effects, the period effects, and carryover effects.Results: Aim 1 study: Garlic intake ≥ 3 times/week compared with never < 1 month was not associated with total cancer incidence nor cancer mortality after adjustment for age, gender, pack-years of cigarettes, and smoking status (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.02 and HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.03, respectively). Garlic supplement use for 3+ years was associated with an 8% decrease in total cancer incidence (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.98), after adjustment for age, gender, pack-years, smoking status, and study arm compared to never users. Garlic supplement use was not related to total cancer mortality even after adjustment for potential confounders (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.85, 1.11). No associations were found for garlic and site-specific cancer incidence and mortality.Aim 2 study: Across all radical scavenging assays, Garlicin, which contains mainly allicin, showed high antioxidative activity in water and alcohol extracts across the DPPH (2.02 g AAE/g garlic and 3.53 mg AAE/g garlic, respectively) and superoxide assays (6.73 mg AAE/g garlic and 7.13 mg AAE/g garlic, respectively). Garlicin inhibited proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma cells (H1975 and A549) and lung squamous cells (H520) more strongly compared to other garlic forms including raw garlic, heated garlic, black garlic garlic powder, and Kyolic supplement.Aim 3 study: Mean glutathione-S-transferase (GST) levels for the 40 subjects increased significantly by 0.90 U/L from baseline to follow-up within the Garlicin group (within the period change) (p = 0.01). Compared to the placebo group, the change in GST enzyme levels was 0.84 U/L higher when participants took Garlicin supplements (change between periods) for 2 weeks (p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in changes in GPx, GR, DBP, and DBP between Garlicin and placebo groups (P > 0.05).Conclusion: Our findings suggest that garlic supplement use might be protective against cancer. The various garlic forms tested differed in anticancer activity; the Garlicin supplements showed the highest antioxidant and potent antiproliferative activity. Furthermore, these data suggest that garlic, used as an oral dietary supplementation, may be tolerated and beneficial in increasing the antioxidant biomarkers in the body, at least in the short run. Garlic, a major source of organosulfur compounds, represents a promising source for a number of anti-cancer agents with potential pharmacological applications in larger clinical trials.

T1  - Transgenerational Effects on the Microbiome of Chinook Salmon <em>(Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)</em>
AN  - 2416856092
AB  - A critical emerging factor in the fitness of individuals is their microbiome, defined as the community of microorganisms found in and on the body of an individual. Despite the rapidly accumulating evidence of the significant role of the microbiome to host health and disease, there is a lack of studies partitioning microbiome variation into explanatory source components in fish, especially those relating to host genetics. To address this knowledge gap, this thesis made several contributions to estimate the transgenerational effects on the microbiome of an ecologically, economically and culturally important salmonid – Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). To achieve this goal, breeding designs were utilized to estimate various genetic architecture components, including additive among- population variance, additive genetic variance and maternal effects. DNA was extracted from hindgut contents of saltwater juveniles, the surface of eyed eggs, and maternally sourced gut content and ovarian fluids. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were conducted to amplify and metabarcode the 16S rRNA encoding gene, and high throughput sequencing was then used to generate millions of sequences based on amplified PCR products. Taxonomic operational units (OTUs) were generated to measure microbiome diversity and allow for microbial community profiling. Using a combination of parametric and non-parametric modelling, significant hybrid-cross and sire were found on the gut microbiome at the juvenile saltwater stage, respectively indicative of population and additive genetic effects. Further, significant maternal effects were found on the surface of eyed eggs. Although no correlations were found between the ovarian fluid and the eyed eggs, a surprising and significant similarity was found between the microbiomes of the dam-sourced ovarian fluid and hindgut samples. Together, the findings presented in this thesis contribute to the characterization of the genetic architecture underlying microbiome variation in Chinook salmon and to its adaptive potential. The results presented in this thesis will have critical consequences for fisheries and conservation efforts and lead the way to exciting microbiome research with the ultimate goal of selecting for microbiomes associated with improved survivability and performance.

T1  - Soybean Response to Water: Trait Identification and Prediction
AN  - 2390121864
AB  - The rising demand for soybean [Glycine Max (L.) Merrill] taken in consideration with current climatic trends accentuates the importance of improving soybean seed yield response per unit water (WP). To further our understanding of the quantitative WP trait, a multi-omic approach was implemented for improved trait identification and predictive modeling opportunities. Through the evaluation of two recombinant inbred line populations jointly totaling 439 lines subjected to contrasting irrigation treatments, informative agronomic, phenomic, and genomic associations were identified. Across both populations, relationships were identified between lodging at maturity (r = -0.58, H = 0.86), canopy to air temperature differential at the V5 growth stage (r = -0.31, H = 0.39), the SR680 spectral index collected at the R5 growth stage, (r = 0.62, H = 0.39), and a quantitative trait loci at approximately 30 centimorgans on chromosome 19 (r = 0.27) to WP. Through the integration of significant agronomic, phenomic, and genomic traits, predictive models of WP were developed across environments on an entry mean basis (r = 0.72, RMSE = 0.67 kg ha-1 mm-1) and on a per plot basis (r = 0.95, RMSE = 0.39 kg ha-1 mm-1) using machine learning algorithms. Our results highlight the value of integrating multiple dataset types to study and model quantitative traits. Through the application of our findings, soybean breeders can potentially deploy multi-omic selection models in early generation screening stages to increase the rate of genetic gain in relation to soybean WP.

T1  - <em>Daphnia pulicaria </em>Responses to Temperature and Nutrients Stress: What Happens when the Heat Is On?
AN  - 2384487038
AB  - Warming climates have had various consequences on terrestrial and aquatic food webs that are expected to persist. There is evidence suggesting that certain organisms are better equipped to handle changing climates compared to others. Therefore, the purpose of my thesis was to study the adaptability of Daphnia under temperature stress and nutrient limitation. First, to examine the effects of dietary phosphorus limitation and temperature on daphniid life-history and population growth, a series of experiments were conducted in the laboratory. In general, I found that Daphnia body growth rates and life-history traits to food carbon to phosphorus (C:P) ratios change with temperature. Next, I identified a protocol to limit the genomic DNA (gDNA) from ribonucleic acid (RNA) extractions. I found that using a modified phenol-chloroform extraction protocol was the most effective way to remove gDNA from extracted Daphnia RNA samples. Overall, results from this study show that temperature and food quality interactions are more complicated than previously thought. Furthermore, the RNA extraction protocol developed will be useful in future studies examining gene expression responses in Daphnia.

T1  - Establishing a Novel Beneficial Association Using a Nematode-Bacterium Model Through Experimental Evolution
AN  - 2382790114
AB  - Microbes confer many benefits to their hosts, from nutrient provisioning to protection from enemies. These microbial symbioses are ubiquitous in nature, many of which evolved millions of years ago. However, it is unclear how these associations arise. My dissertation explores the roles of environmental and evolutionary contexts in the evolution of novel beneficial associations. I use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the bacterium Bacillus subtilis as a model system to investigate these questions by experimentally evolving them under different conditions. Before experimental evolution, I find that B. subtilis protects C. elegans from heat shock by increasing host fecundity compared to the C. elegans standard diet, E. coli. To examine how B. subtilis influence C. elegans adaptation, I evolve nematodes in the presence or absence of ancestral B. subtilis with or without heat stress. Hosts evolving with ancestral B. subtilis under stress evolve the greatest fitness gain compared to in the absence of heat stress or in the absence of B. subtilis. These results show that association with novel beneficial microbes can help hosts adapt to stress under the right context. To determine how microbial evolutionary history affects host fitness, I passage B. subtilis through ancestral nematodes, in the absence of nematodes, or through co-passaged nematodes. I find that B. subtilis passaged through ancestral hosts evolve to benefit these hosts, but host adaptation is not necessary since bacteria passaged in the absence of hosts also increase host fitness. Finally, because co-passaged bacteria do not improve ancestral host fitness to the same level as bacteria passaged through ancestral hosts, I further investigate co-passaging by examining the fitness of co-passaged hosts. Co-passaged bacteria reduce fitness of their co-passaged hosts but not hosts that evolved with ancestral B. subtilis, suggesting that coevolution may impede the establishment of novel symbioses. By leveraging experimental evolution and a tractable model system, this work illuminates how environmental and evolutionary contexts shape the evolution of host-microbe associations.

T1  - Genetic Adaptation and Speciation in Darwin's Finches and Atlantic Herring
AN  - 2352144243
AB  - Natural selection acts on existing genetic variation to drive genetic adaptation of organisms to various ecological niches. Interaction between closely related populations, through processes such as competition and hybridization, may either lead to their divergence or population fusion, which has consequences for adaptation and the formation of species. This thesis aims to use two natural populations, Darwin’s finches and Atlantic herring, as models to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying ecological adaptation and speciation.
The ecological adaptation of Darwin’s finches across the Galápagos Islands is primarily reflected by variation in beak morphology. Using whole-genome re-sequencing of all Darwin’s finch species, we discover that a locus, HMGA2, is highly associated with variation in beak size. Data collected before and after a severe drought show that this locus plays a critical role for ecological character displacement in large ground finches Geospiza magnirostris and medium ground finches G. fortis.
Genomic islands of divergence refer to genomic regions of elevated divergence when comparing the genomes of closely related taxa. Establishment of these genomic islands can reflect a role in reproductive isolation or be related to ecological adaptation or background selection. Investigating their properties can shed light on how new species evolve. We study the landscape of genomic islands in Darwin’s finches, and find that the most pronounced genomic islands are likely ancient balanced polymorphisms, which govern adaptive variation in beak morphology.
Hybridization is increasingly recognized as an important evolutionary process which may lead to speciation. We study two cases of hybridization in Darwin’s finches. In the first case, a new lineage of Darwin’s finches was founded through hybridization between a resident medium ground finch G. fortis and an immigrant Española cactus finch G. conirostris. In the second case, female-biased introgression occurred predominantly from medium ground finches G. fortis to common cactus finches G. scandens. Our genetic analysis on the mosaic genomes of hybrid finches show that non-random mating and natural selection primarily determine the outcome of hybridization.
We generate a chromosome-level assembly of the Atlantic herring with a total size of 726 Mb, which coincides with a high-resolution linkage map and an LD-based recombination map. This facilitates the identification of an ~8Mb inversion, which is likely to be associated with ecological adaptation in herring to differences in water temperature. The contiguity of the assembly sorts placement of loci under selection that were identified based on a previous, highly fragmented draft assembly of the herring genome.

T1  - Evolution of a Specialized Herbivore Community: Biogeography, Speciation, and Balancing Selection in North American Deserts
AN  - 2656806978
AB  - The many facets of diversity are an enduring source of fascination for biologists. In my dissertation, I present three case studies exploring how species interactions affect the generation, distribution, and maintenance of biological diversity.My work centers on a guild of specialized herbivores that consume creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in the warm deserts of North America. The nominal species L. tridentata comprises three insipient species that arose through autopolyploidy (whole genome duplication without hybridization). Speciation by polyploidy can have manifold consequences for plants. One common outcome is that cytotypes (plants of different ploidy level) geographically segregate. Indeed, the diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid cytotypes of creosote bush are parapatrically distributed in the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mojave Deserts, respectively. A second outcome is that the phenotypic changes accompanying polyploidy alter interactions with other species, including mutualists, competitors, and consumers. My first two chapters consider how the consequences of polyploidy affect the biogeography and genetic divergence of specialized herbivores.In Chapter 1, I surveyed the diversity of gall midges in the genus Asphondylia across the full distribution of creosote bush (>2,300 km extent). I found that many gall species (6/17, including two new species) are specialized on either diploid or polyploid host plants. These species preferentially attack just one host cytotype even where diploid and tetraploid creosote bush commingle. The contact zone between creosote bush cytotypes is thus a biotically-mediated dispersal barrier, irrespective of abiotic factors or physical distance. Because more gall midges species specialize on polyploid host plants than on diploids, the distribution of creosote bush cytotypes structures a gradient in gall midge richness across the North American deserts.I next addressed the hypothesis that adaptation to alternative host plant cytotypes drives reproductive isolation between herbivore populations. In Chapter 2, my investigation focused on two ecologically similar herbivores, the creosote bush grasshopper (Bootettix argentatus) and the creosote bush katydid (Insara covilleae). I first used RADcap sequencing to genotype hundreds of individuals from across the full distribution of each species. I then inferred range-wide population structure and modeled spatial variation in gene flow across the species’ range. To discern the relative role of ecology vs. geography in structuring insect populations, I then compared regions of reduced gene flow to physical barriers as well as creosote bush contact zones. My findings differed markedly between species. Bootettix comprises three major lineages, each associated with a different creosote bush cytotype. Two Bootettix lineages meet in a short hybrid zone that is coincident with the contact zone between tetraploid and hexaploid creosote bush, and gene flow was more restricted at this contact zone that across any physical barriers (e.g., mountain ranges, rivers). In contrast, Insara shows minimal population structure across most of its distribution. Although I found moderate subdivision across the Madrean Archipelago, evidence for host-associated genetic divergence was weak. This work shows that there are not necessarily uniform effects of host plant polyploidy even on ecologically similar herbivores.In Chapter 3, I consider the forces that maintain adaptive genetic and phenotypic variation within populations. Two discrete color morphs of the desert clicker grasshopper (Ligurotettix coquilletti) coexist across the species’ range: a uniform morph with homogeneous color, and a banded morph with strong light-dark contrast. This patterning likely affects the efficacy of crypsis to avoid predation, raising the question of why polymorphism persists, and why the proportion of each morph varies across sites. One possibility lies in life history differences between sexes: while territorial males are exposed to predation only on creosote bush stems, females are most vulnerable while laying eggs on the ground. I hypothesized that selection may thus favor different cryptic phenotypes in each sex (sexually antagonistic selection), thereby maintaining crypsis polymorphism within populations. With quantitative analysis of crypsis and the visual environments used by male and female grasshoppers, I found that different phenotypes are favored in each sex. I then used RADcap sequencing and association mapping to identify a single autosomal locus strongly associated with pattern polymorphism. Surprisingly, the divergent alleles at this locus are also found in a sister species, suggesting that sexually antagonistic selection may preserve ancient genetic variation.

T1  - Assessing Migrations and Habitat Connectivity for Two Anadromous Species Following a Major Restoration Effort in the Penobscot River, Maine
AN  - 2637958651
AB  - The construction of industrial dams across major rivers in New England began in the early 1800s with textile mills in Massachusetts. Because of its legacy of mill dams and log driving dams, New England has the highest density of dams anywhere in North America, averaging one dam for every 44 km2 of drainage area. By the early 1900s, these dams drastically limited migrations by diadromous fishes, resulting in declines in populations of migratory fishes, including Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and American shad Alosa sapidissima. Since that time, different fishway designs and river management plans have been tried around the region in an attempt to balance hydropower generation, water storage, flood control, and fish passage.The Penobscot River, in Maine, USA, is the second largest river in New England, with a drainage area of 22,000 km2 , and presents an ideal opportunity for understanding fish passage and migratory movements in a heavily-modified river system. Historically, the river contained runs of eleven species of diadromous fishes including alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, American shad, blueback herring A. aestivalis, Atlantic salmon, sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, American eel Anguilla rostrata, rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, Atlantic tomcod Microgadus tomcod, striped bass Morone saxatilis, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus, and Shortnose Sturgeon A. brevirostrum, many of which supported subsistence and commercial fisheries prior to dam construction. The Penobscot River Restoration project (initiated in 2004), decommissioned three hydroelectric dams, upgraded fish passage at four dams, and increased generation capacity at three dams, theoretically opening much of the watershed to migratory fishes. We used a combination of telemetry methods, historic data, and modeling to assess the potential for fishways to select for certain traits with enough power to cause evolutionary change in migratory fish populations and evaluate the ability of migratory fish to use newly available habitat in the Penobscot River watershed.The primary fishway design used in New England for many years was the Denil fishway, which uses angled baffles to reduce water velocity while maintaining high volume and thus, high attraction flow. In order to reach their spawning grounds in the headwaters of the Penobscot River watershed, in-migrating Atlantic salmon have had to navigate between five and seven (mostly Denil) fishways at different dams. Six years of PIT telemetry data were used to evaluate passage success at fishways on the second, third, and fourth dams in the system (Great Works Dam, Milford Dam, and either Howland Dam or West Enfield Dam, depending on path choice) as a function of water temperature, flow, migratory timing, and fish length. At the lower two fishways (Great Works and Milford Dams), fish length was a significant predictor of passage success, with a 91‐cm salmon 21%–27% and 12%–16% less likely to pass than a 45‐cm salmon, at Great Works and Milford Dams, respectively. Additionally, we analyzed thirty-four years of escapement data and found that the slow-maturing and iteroparous individuals that represented the largest salmon size classes were essentially lost from the population during that time, and that Penobscot River fish have shorter fork lengths at maturity (45 – 91 cm) than Atlantic salmon in undammed systems (45 – 110 cm).

T1  - Effects of Temperature on Ecology, Behavior, and Physiology in Desert-Dwelling Jumping Spiders
AN  - 2595152858
AB  - Temperature affects ectotherms in a variety of ways that are critical to fitness. This work focuses on how temperature impacts the behavior, physiology, species distribution, and ecology of jumping spiders to better understand their evolution and natural history. As my study system, I used spiders in the genus Habronattus, mostly H. clypeatus. I chose to study these animals because they live in the desert, an extremely thermally-variable habitat. Habronattus are also ecologically-important mid-level predators and have striking complex courtship signals.My first chapter assessed how temperature influences sexual behavior. Temperature has been known to affect behavior in different ectotherm species. The effects on sexual behavior can be especially complex, as different sexes may be affected differently by temperature. I examined this in Habronattus clypeatus. In this species, males court females using visual and vibratory signals. I tested whether key intersexual behaviors would change with temperature in similar, predictable ways across males and females. I first measured temperature and apparent activity of individuals in H. clypeatus habitat across the day. I found that H. clypeatus are active across a wide range of temperatures (11-56 °C) and are most active at times of day when temperature ranges from 13-46 °C. Next, I performed mating experiments across behaviorally relevant temperatures. Females were more likely to allow males to progress to later stages of courtship and had higher mating rates at higher temperatures. Male visual and vibratory courtship behaviors generally became faster, higher-pitched and lower in amplitude at higher temperatures. This relationship between temperature and signal aspects generally attained a roughly curvilinear shape, with an asymptote around 40 °C. Intriguingly, mating rates in the lab were highest at temperatures potentially above those during peak spider activity in the field. My results suggest that temperature’s effects on behavior are complex and can affect males and females differently. This work emphasizes that understanding temperature effects on mating is critical to understanding sexual selection patterns particularly in species which use complex signals.There is evidence of environmental temperature influencing species distributions. However, despite the importance of a broad understanding of an animal’s thermal biology, few studies incorporate more than one of these metrics of thermal biology. I explored how temperature influences species distributions in six different species of Habronattus distributed along an elevational cline. I measured several different aspects of their thermal biology including thermal limits (CTmin, CTmax), thermal preference, V̇CO2 as proxy for metabolic rate, locomotor behavior, and warming tolerance. I used these data to test whether thermal biology helped explain how species were distributed across elevation. Habronattus had very high CTmax values (~ 52°C), which did not differ among species across the elevational gradient. The highest-elevation species had a lower CTmin than any other species. All species had a strong thermal preference around 37°C. With respect to performance, one of the middle elevation species was significantly less temperature-sensitive in metabolic rate. Differences between species with respect to locomotion (jump distance) were likely driven by differences in mass, with no differences in thermal performance across elevation. I suggest that Habronattus distributions follow Brett’s Rule, a macrophysiological principle that predicts more geographical variation in cold tolerance than heat. Additionally, I suggest that physiological tolerances interact with biotic factors, particularly those related to courtship and mate choice to influence species distributions. Habronattus also had very high warming tolerance values (<20°C, on average). Taken together, these data suggest that Habronattus are resilient in the face of climate-change related shifts in temperature.The most common studies of thermal biology are undertaken with lab experiments. Far less work has been done to understand natural thermal environments, particularly on the spatial and temporal scales relevant to the animal in question. In my final chapter, I sought to put into context the various laboratory measurements I had taken in the previous two chapters, specifically for H. clypeatus. I conducted a study to assess (1) the variability of thermal environments, (2) the ability of animals to thermoregulate and (3) substrate usage. I used a number of thermal ecology methods, including focal observations and a variety of different habitat temperature measurements (thermal cameras, ambient temperature loggers, and operative temperature models). I first found that males and females differed in their thermal preferences in the lab. Although spiders were able to thermoregulate remarkably well in the field, the differences between males and females disappeared. I suggest that this is primarily because males search for and follow females through the habitat, and females therefore decide where courtship occurs. This was corroborated by data that showed that adult makes move farther than any other age-sex class. Spider thermal habitats are also extremely thermally variable. This is mostly due to variability in substrates, rather than air temperature. Spiders also used these substrates in non-random ways. This could have important implications for thermoregulation and mate choice. Behavioral differences between the sexes hint at additional potential for conflict between the sexes. Females are active earlier in the day than males. These earlier times correspond to habitat temperatures at which females are less receptive. We also found that males spent more time hiding, which possibly relates to tradeoffs associated with greater activity and exposure to predators. Overall, this chapter study suggests that habitat temperature interacts with animals in complex ways, providing the potential for tradeoffs that could be under selection. Understanding thermal biology in the context of natural environments is therefore key to gaining a wholistic view of how animals interact with temperature.Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of an integrative view of thermal biology. Temperature affects animals on many different levels, and one must reach across disciplines to gain the full picture. These studies also suggest that temperatures’ effects can be subtle. Attention to detail is key, and one must have a thorough understanding of the habitats in which animals live in order to understand how selection acts. In this way, we can make predictions about how individuals, populations, and species might respond in response to changes in climate.

T1  - The Influence of Incubation Temperature on Development, Morphology, and Behavior in the Wolf Spider, <em>Hogna antelucana</em>
AN  - 2566290975
AB  - Temperature is a major environmental factor shaping offspring phenotype in ectotherms. The temperatures experienced during development can influence a suite of life history and behavioral traits, including developmental time, size, growth rate, locomotor performance and survival. Consequently, phenotypic variation caused by the thermal conditions experienced during embryonic development may have a direct impact on fitness. This dissertation investigates how incubation temperature impacts life history and behavior in the wolf spider, Hogna antelucana. Female wolf spiders carry their egg sacs throughout the incubation period, which allows them to move developing embryos between different thermal conditions. First, I investigate temperature preference and movement behavior of brooding and non-brooding females to determine whether reproductive state influences thermoregulatory behavior. I find that brooding females thermoregulate with greater precision and at lower average temperatures than non-brooding females. Brooding females also move more and have longer movement bouts compared to non-brooding females. Second, I examine whether incubation temperature affects offspring survival and developmental rate. I find that spiders incubated at cooler temperatures had high survival rates through the egg stage but lower survival rates across all other stages examined. Spiders incubated at cooler temperatures also took longer to complete the egg and post-embryonic stages, but survivors subsequently took the same amount of time to reach maturity as those incubated at warm temperatures. Upon reaching maturity, female spiders incubated at cooler temperatures survived fewer days after reaching maturity. Third, I explore whether incubation temperature affects morphology and sprint performance in H. antelucana. I find that spiders incubated at warmer temperatures are larger, and larger spiders are faster than smaller conspecifics at the fifth instar. However, females that survived to adulthood did not exhibit any size differences at maturity, and those incubated at cooler temperatures were faster than those incubated at warm temperatures. I conclude that incubation temperature impacts both life history and behavioral traits throughout the life of H. antelucana. My observations suggest that cooler incubation temperatures negatively impact survival, growth rate, longevity, size, and behavior. My findings support the hypothesis that wolf spiders carry egg sacs to preferentially select temperatures for optimal egg development.

T1  - Long-Term Evolution of the Complex Eukaryote<em> Tetrahymena Thermophila</em>
AN  - 2478100915
AB  - Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand what factors affect the rate and repeatability of adaptive outcomes. To better understand the role of temperature in determining adaptive trajectories, we evolved populations of different genotypes, including populations that just had sex and populations that hadn’t, of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila at two temperatures and followed changes in growth rate over 1000s of generations. As expected, growth rate increased with a decelerating rate for all populations; however, there were differences in the patterns of evolution at warmer and colder temperatures. Initial differences in growth rates between the genotypes decreased as evolution proceeded at both temperatures, but this convergence was quicker at the higher temperature. Likewise, we found greater repeatability of evolution among replicate populations of the same genotype at the higher temperature. We also found no evidence of trade-offs in fitness between temperatures, but did observe asymmetry in the correlated responses, whereby evolution in a warmer temperature increases growth rate at the lower temperature significantly more than the reverse. We also find the populations founded from a single newly produced sexual progeny are more evolvable than their parents who have not had sex in many generations. These results demonstrate the importance of genotype and the environment in determining evolutionary trajectories.

T1  - The Evolution of Sex Determination Mechanisms and Sex Chromosomes in House Fly, <em>Musca domestica</em> L.
AN  - 2471440024
AB  - Sex determination (SD) evolves fast, often due to changes in master regulatory SD genes. SD genes are found on sex chromosomes, and evolution of SD can also drive evolutionary turnover of sex chromosomes. As a consequence, young (proto) sex chromosomes are generated, in which the X and Y are minimally diverged from each other. Multiple young sex chromosomes can coexist in species with multiple (polygenic) SD master regulators. Species with polygenic SD are informative of the factors driving the early evolution of sex chromosomes. The house fly, Musca domestica, is a well-suited model to those ends because natural populations have polygenic SD and young sex chromosomes. Natural selection appears to maintain polygenic SD, but the targets of selection are elusive. To address this, I examined the effects of two house fly proto-Y chromosomes (YM and IIIM) on gene expression. I find that the proto-Y chromosomes have minor effects on gene expression, which is paradoxical given that natural selection likely maintains polygenic SD in house fly. I identified evidence for disproportionate effects of the proto-Y chromosomes on sex-biased expression. These few expression differences could be targets upon which natural selection acts to maintain polygenic SD. The frequencies of YM and IIIM vary along latitudinal clines, and I tested whether temperature could explain these clines by examining the expression of SD pathway genes at different developmental temperatures. I did not find differences in expression of the sex-determining genes between YM and IIIM males consistent with the clines. I also found that one house fly proto-Y chromosome is differentiated from its homologous proto-X in the sequences of many genes, but gene expression divergence between the proto-X and proto-Y is limited to a subset of genes. This suggests that subtle gene expression differentiation constitutes the earliest stages of X-Y differentiation. Lastly, I tried constructing a stable line that has females carrying the dominant female-determining Md-traD allele. In this line, all females and males would carry two copies of IIIM. However, I could not create a stable line because males homozygous for IIIM could have low fitness or deleterious effects.

T1  - Development and Application of Coupled K-Feldspar Pb Isotopic and <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar Methods to Reconstruct Late Cretaceous/Cenozoic Deformation of the California Margin
AN  - 2467646033
AB  - The evolving plate boundary along the California margin over the last 100 m.y. has dramatically impacted the geologic evolution of the western United States. Laramide flat-slab subduction extinguished Sierra Nevada arc magmatism as trench-derived sediments (i.e., Rand and related schists) were underthrust and accreted at 25-30 km depth beneath the southernmost Sierra Nevada and NW Mojave Desert (SSN/MD) during the Late Cretaceous. During this time, the southern California forearc margin was severely disrupted. Breachment of the mid-Cretaceous batholith in the southern California region ultimately permitted depositional systems to extend eastward and permit extraregional sediment from the continental interior to reach the margin during the Eocene. Subsequently, between 30-25 Ma, the North American and Pacific plate boundary was established. The resulting development of a northwest-propagating transform margin produced "slab gaps" beneath the SSN/MD that triggered mantle upwelling, volcanism, and extension of the crust.Each of these significant changes has imprinted a thermal history record in the SSN/MD crust that can be interrogated through integrated detrital and basement thermochronology. Modal detrital phases such as K-feldspar can yield significant thermal history and provenance information but have been under-utilized. The beneﬁts of using K-feldspar in detrital studies are twofold: K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar has shown promise as both a basement and detrital thermochronometer. Moreover, its propensity to incorporate common Pb into its crystal structure allows its Pb isotope composition to be used as a provenance tool. The well-established extreme variation in Pb isotopic values and thermal fingerprints of tectonic processes across the western United States can be exploited to reconstructing the southern California margin.In this dissertation, I develop and apply basement and detrital K-feldspar coupled 40Ar/39Ar and Pb isotopic analysis to evaluate the Late Cretaceous/Cenozoic evolution of the California margin. In Chapter 1, I demonstrate viability of K-feldspar coupled 40Ar/39Ar and Pb isotopic analysis by quantitatively investigating the eﬀects of laser fusion during 40Ar/39Ar analyses of K-feldspar upon subsequent LA-ICP-MS measurement of Pb isotopic ratios. I also show the feasibility of using LA-ICP-MS to generate statistically significant datasets. In Chapter 2, I describe how I have developed a regionally extensive database of new Pb isotopic values in K-feldspar for the southwestern United States basement. I furthermore evaluate the utility of this database by demonstrating how it can be applied to evaluate paleodrainage evolution during the early Eocene to early Miocene along the SSN/MD margin. In Chapter 3, I develop a database of new 40Ar/39Ar thermal history results from mid-Cretaceous plutonic rocks throughout the SSN/MD region. I also develop single-crystal incremental heating methods to detrital K-feldspar from derivative Eocene-Miocene strata. Coupled interpretation of the basement and detrital results is used to assess the Late Cretaceous thermal evolution of the SSN/MD region. Collectively, these results constrain the magnitude and timing of Laramide subduction refrigeration of the southern California margin. Unimodal and identical detrital K-feldspar age distributions and thermal histories from the forearc strata confirm subduction refrigeration extended into the shallow crust and affected a broad region of the Mojave Desert province. Final exhumation of the deepest rocks in the western Mojave in the early Miocene was ultimately due to northwestward migration of the Mendocino triple junction along the California margin.Collectively, these case studies demonstrate how these new analytical and interpretative methods can be profitably applied to future regional deformation and tectonically driven re-organization of drainage patterns.

AB  - Life history traits determine the growth, reproduction, and persistence of populations via changes in organismal fitness. How life history trait evolution and plasticity will respond to global change, specifically to increases in temperature, is an emerging area of research that involves scaling individual organismal physiology to the population level. However, changes in populations also affect species interactions at community and ecosystem levels. Integrating across these scales of biological organization reveals important connections for the generation, maintenance, and consequences of biodiversity. In this dissertation, I explored how interactions among life history, physiology, and temperature affect two dominant zooplankton groups, Daphnia and Epischura and the subsequent effects they have for population, community, and ecosystem ecology.First, I examined the evolution of life history traits and their thermal plasticity in Daphnia by taking a phylogenetic approach to separate the respective contributions of lineage-specific (phylogeny) and latitudinal (climate) constraints. The mode of evolution among life history traits varied but the thermal response in life history traits most often followed a random walk model of evolution (Brownian motion). I compared species-level to population-level data to further understand the effects of local environment. Daphnia life history traits did not exhibit a strong species-specific signal but are ecogeographically distinct, underscoring that Daphnia life history evolution should be understood at the population-level rather than the species-level.Second, I tested the ability of RNA:DNA ratios to predict juvenile and population growth rates in Daphnia. I used common gardens in the laboratory to explore the predictive power of RNA:DNA ratios to explain the variation in growth rates across temperature and resource availability gradients. I then tested for correlations between RNA:DNA ratios and ecosystem metabolism in situ. RNA:DNA ratio has limited utility as a life history proxy for Daphnia and its usefulness for capturing ecological phenomena needs further exploration.Third, I combined empirical and theoretical approaches to examine the interactions between invasive species and climate change in Lake Baikal. I collected current species assemblage and abiotic data from Chivyrkuy Bay where nonnative Daphnia longispina has established yet remained locally-contained. D. longispina potentially poses a hazard to Lake Baikal’s fragile ecosystem of endemics, particularly Epischura baikalensis, a critically threatened dominant zooplankter. I parameterized and tested several models with combinations of temperature, dispersal, and competition estimates from Lake Baikal. Temperature and dispersal currently constrain D. longispina to Chivyrkuy Bay. I then used water temperature increase projections to predict future species assemblages and critical thermal points that allow D. longispina to invade Lake Baikal’s main basin. In the next century, D. longispina will invade Lake Baikal’s main basin and, if temperature increases by 8 °C, may completely supplant E. baikalensis.Fourth, I combined molecular genetics and continuous, quantitative morphological data to reveal the evolutionary history of the Epischura (Copepoda: Calanoida), a species-depauperate lineage of conservation concern. I generated the first time-calibrated, molecular phylogeny for Epischura by sequencing three ribosomal DNA loci for the entire genus. I combined the molecular data with in-depth measurements of the mandibles of each species to aid in the placement of a recently extinct species, Epischura massachusettsensis. Epischura is a paraphyletic group; the North American species diverged from the Eastern Siberian species around the late-Miocene cooling events. I proposed the resurrection of Epischurella (Smirnov 1936) to describe the Eastern Siberian copepod species.
