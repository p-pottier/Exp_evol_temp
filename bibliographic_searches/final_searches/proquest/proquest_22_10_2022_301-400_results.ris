AN  - 2675223082
AB  - Esta tese teve o intuito de estudar o efeito de três tipos de alimento diferentes em duas densidades diferentes para seleccionar um regime de alimentação ideal para o crescimento, a sobrevivência, os parâmetros plasmáticos, e para a composição lipídica do músculo e fígado dos juvenis de Seriola dumerili (Risso 1810) de maneira a cobrir todas as necessidades nutricionais e optimizar o custo-produção. A esse respeito, um total de 145 juvenis de Seriola dumerili com um peso médio de 117.54 ± 54.98 g, foram distribuídos aleatoriamente em três grupos de 15 peixes / tanque (densidade baixa, LD) e 3 grupos de 25 peixes / tanque (alta densidade, HD) e alimentados com três diferentes tipos de alimentos: ração comercial para Sparidae, Alfa Biomar dieta (SP), ração comercial para S. dumerili (Skretting) (SE) e cavala congelada (MA). O estudo foi conduzido por 86 dias. As variáveis estudadas foram o tipo de regime alimentar e a densidade de produção.A sobrevivência foi distinta e maior nos grupos alimentados com SE, enquanto que a Taxa de Crescimento Específico (SGR) não mostrou estatisticamente nenhuma diferença (P> 0,05) entre os grupos. Os grupos alimentados com a dieta MA tiveram os maiores valores de Ingestão Diária de Alimento (DFI), durante o estudo (9,59 ± 3,56 g / peixe em HD e 8,46 ± 5,00 g / peixe em LD), que embora com uma maior Taxa de Conversão de Alimento (FCR) (9,59% em LD e 8,46% em HD), aparentemente não conseguiram transformar eficientemente a ingestão em biomassa, demonstrado pelo respectivos valores de B% de 0,18% em LD e - 0,35% em HD, sendo menor do que os grupos alimentados com SE a LD (0,41%).No presente estudo, a composição bioquímica do S.dumerili foi semelhante à relatada em trabalhos anteriores. Quanto maior o teor de humidade, menor o teor de lípidos. Apesar de a dieta à base de MA ter um maior conteúdo de gordura em bruto (38,11%) que todas as outras dietas, os grupos alimentados com dieta MA, em ambas as densidades, apresentaram um menor valor total de lípido.O Total de Lípidos Polares (TPL) e o Total de Lípidos Neutros (TNL) não mostraram quaisquer diferenças significativas (P <0.05) entre dietas em ambos os tecidos (P>0.05). Entre as classes de TNL, apesar de DAG, CHO e FFA terem sido significativamente diferentes (P <0.05), TAG foi a classe de lípido mais abundante, e onde nenhuma diferença significativa (P>0.05) entre os diferentes grupos foi encontrada.Relativamente à composição de ácidos gordos, nomeadamente ao 18:1n-9, os grupos alimentados com MA foram os únicos significativamente diferentes (P<0.05), e obtiveram os mais baixos valores (P<0.05), mesmo tendo em consideração que na natureza a dieta do S. dumerili é composta principalmente por vários peixes ósseos ricos em 18:1n-9. Pode-se deduzir que, ou houve uma degradação da qualidade do MA, enquanto armazenado para a respectiva alimentação dos grupos, que afectou directamente a qualidade e quantidade de 18:1n-9 acumulado nos seus tecidos.Alternate abstract:This thesis intended to study the effect of three different types of food and two different densities, on growth, survival, plasmatic parameters and lipid composition of muscle and liver of Seriola dumerili (Risso 1810) juveniles, in order to select an optimal feeding regime for growth, covering the nutritional requirements, and optimizing the commercial cost-effectiveness of the production. Regarding this, a total of 145 juvenile of Seriola dumerili with and average weight of 117.54 ± 54.98 g, were randomly distributed in 3 groups of 15 fish / tank (low stocking density LD) and 3 groups of 25 fish / tank (high stocking density HD) and fed with three different types of food: commercial pellets for Sparidae, the Alpha Biomar diet (SP), commercial pellets for S. dumerili (Skretting) (SE) and frozen Mackerel (MA). The study was conducted for 86 days. The study variables were the feeding regime and stocking density.The survival rates were higher in the groups fed with SE, while the Specific Growth Rate (SGR) showed no statistical differences (P>0.05) between groups. The groups fed with MA diet had the higher amounts of Daily Food Ingested (DFI), (9.59±3.56 g/fish at HD and 8.46±5.00 g/fish at LD) during the study, although with a higher Food Conversion Rate (FCR), (9.59 % at LD and 8.46 % at HD), not efficiently turn that ingestion in biomass, as for example the value of B% at groups fed with MA at LD (0.18 %) and at HD (-0.35%) show, being lower than the groups fed with SE at LD (0.41%).The biochemical composition of the fish in the present study was similar to the one reported in previous works, explaining that the more moisture content in the tissue, the less lipid it has in it.The Total Polar Lipids (TPL) and Total Neutral Lipids (TNL) did not show any significant differences (P<0.05) between different diets in both tissues (p>0.05). Among the total neutral lipids (TNL), despite DAG, CHO and FFA were significantly different (P<0.05), TAG was the most abundant lipid class, which is generally the major lipid class in the diet of marine fish, and there was no significant differences (P<0.05) between the different groups.Regarding fatty acid composition, namely 18:1n-9, the groups fed with MA were the only significantly different (P<0.05), and the lowest amounts in this study (P<0.05), even taking in consideration that, in the wild, the S. dumerili diet is composed mainly by several finfish rich in 18:1n-9. We can deduce that or there was a degradation of the quality of the MA while stored to be fed to the groups, which affected directly the quality and quantity of the 18:1n-9.The fact that 18:2n-6 had its lower amounts in groups fed with MA, and the higher amounts in groups fed with SE (P<0.05),

T1  - Population genetics of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in relation to climate
AN  - 2476551686
AB  - The overall aim of this thesis was to assess population-level relationships with climate, in order to make predictions regarding susceptibility to a changing climate, focussing on R. temporaria in Scotland. In Chapter 2, I inferred colonisation patterns within Europe following the last glacial maximum by combining new and previously compiled mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences. I found that the mitochondrial DNA sequences from my Scottish samples were identical to, or clustered with, the common haplotype previously identified from Western Europe. This clade showed very low mitochondrial genetic variation, consistent with a leptokurtic model of range expansion, where low numbers of long-distance dispersers cause multiple founder events. Second, I assessed fine-scale genetic variation in relation to current temperature gradients using microsatellites. No population structure was found within or between altitudinal gradients at any scale (3-50km; average FST= 0.02), despite a mean annual temperature difference of 4.5 C between low- and high-altitude sites. Levels of genetic diversity and heterozygosity were considerable but did not vary by site, altitude or temperature. In Chapter 3, common temperature treatments were used to assess phenotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity variation in relation to altitude in terms of larval fitness traits. Local adaptation to altitude was assessed using QST-FST analyses and adaptive phenotypic divergence was then related to environmental parameters using Mantel tests, to look for drivers of selection. I found that R. temporaria showed evidence of local adaptation in all larval fitness traits measured. However, only variation in larval period and growth rate was consistent with adaptation to altitude. Moreover, this was only evident in the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (at least 900m). Adaptive divergence in traits that were locally adapted to altitude was correlated with spring temperature, suggesting that temperature acts as a strong environmental selection pressure influencing local adaptation even in the face of high gene flow. In Chapter 4, the physiological and behavioural responses that facilitate survival in high-altitude environments were evaluated, in terms of routine metabolic rate and freeze tolerance in tadpoles, and breeding temperature in adults. I found that routine metabolic rate was lower for individuals sampled from high- than low-altitude sites but only from the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (at least 900m). Glucose accumulation during freezing was not significantly different based on altitude. However, individuals from low-altitude survived freezing significantly better than those from high-altitude, across all mountains. Breeding did not occur below 5 C at any site and there was no significant difference in breeding temperature between high- and low-altitude sites, leading to high-altitude individuals spawning 30 days later than those at low-altitude. My results suggest that tadpoles are adapted physiologically to surviving at high-altitude via reduced routine metabolic rate, but only at the highest breeding sites. Finally, in Chapter 5, I assessed the spatial variation in species presence and composition of parasitic water moulds in the genus Saprolegnia found on R. temporaria eggs. Thirteen samples isolated from four sites were identified as members of the Saprolegniaceae. Four putative species of Saprolegnia were isolated overall, multiple Saprolegnia water moulds were isolated from within sites, and species composition varied between sites. Acidity was significantly lower at sites where Saprolegniaceae were present, but genetic distance between samples was not correlated with environmental or geographic distance. These findings question the previous focus on S. ferax as the primary agent of Saprolegnia infection in amphibians and suggest that future studies of virulence need to consider the synergistic effect of multiple Saprolegnia species. In conclusion, R. temporaria show the potential for evasion, evolution and plastic responses to a changing climate and my results suggest that the outlook is positive for survival of the common frog in Scotland.

T1  - Catalytic behaviour of nickel-based catalysts operating on simulated biogas: optimisation through oxygen addition, temperature variation and catalyst modification
AN  - 1985573857
AB  - The use of catalytic systems operating on waste products such as biogas offers a potentially attractive alternative for renewable and sustainable energy generation. To investigate the potential viability of such catalytic systems for operation on biogas, a detailed study of nickel-based catalysts for the reforming of simulated biogas (methane:carbon dioxide = 2) to synthesis gas has been undertaken. The influence of oxygen addition in varied concentrations to the simulated biogas mixture has been investigated with regards to catalyst activity, selectivity and stability. This influence has been studied over an extended temperature range from room temperature to 1000 °C. Additionally, the effect of H2S within the simulated biogas mixture on the catalyst activity, selectivity and stability has been studied. Also, the influence of ceria-doping of the nickel catalyst on catalytic behaviour has been investigated. Temperature programmed and conventional catalytic reaction measurements have been used to analyse the catalytic behaviour and long term stability of the catalyst system over a full range of reaction temperatures. Carbon deposits from the simulated biogas reforming were analysed using post-reaction temperature programmed oxidation to assess the extent and nature of carbon deposition. The addition of oxygen significantly increases catalyst activity and shows a variation in product selectivity with temperature. Increased catalyst stability through reduced carbon deposition and increased sulfur tolerance is also observed with oxygen addition. Doping of the nickel catalyst with ceria enhances the influence of oxygen, apart from at high oxygen levels where total oxidation of methane is prevalent. Catalyst regeneration from sulfur poisoning has also been shown through oxygen addition to the simulated biogas mixture and ceria-doping of the nickel catalyst. Fuel cell studies have shown the successful operation of solid oxide fuel cells on simulated biogas and the substantial improvements in electrical performance through addition of oxygen and increased temperature.

T1  - Decapod crustacean larval developmental plasticity and the evolution of lecithotrophy and abbreviated development
AN  - 1654747882
AB  - Within the marine environment, the diverse development modes among marine invertebrate taxa follow a macro-ecological pattern across latitude. Generally, across the latitudinal gradient from the tropics to the poles, larval development becomes increasingly independent of external food resources. Low latitude species are fecund and produce relatively poorly provisioned eggs, which develop into swimming and feeding larvae. This mode of development becomes increasingly scarce with increasing latitude, whilst development from large eggs (produced in low numbers) into larvae, which are non-feeding, becomes increasingly prevalent. From the tropics to the poles, there is an increasing mismatch between the longer periods required for larval development (resulting from increasing cold) and the shorter periods of food availability (resulting from increasing seasonality). This macro-ecological trend in development modes results from the convergent evolution of diverse taxa, which have adapted to high latitude environments in much the same way: through producing larvae which develop independently of external food resources. Developmental plasticity during the larval phase is a mechanism by which larvae are able to cope better with unfavourable conditions or variations in their environment. Critically, the interaction between per offspring investment (POI; the quantity and quality of resources allocated to offspring) and developmental plasticity, and the role of this interaction in the evolution of larval development modes, is little considered or studied. Experiments comprising this thesis assess the potential role of this interaction in the evolution of abbreviated and lecithotrophic development within decapod crustaceans, and the establishing of the macro-ecological trend in development outlined above. Experiments used the palaemonine shrimp, Palaemonetes varians, which inhabits temperate, salt marsh, and peripheral brackish water, as a study species. Palaemonine Abstract ii shrimp originated from a tropical marine clade and extant species are found in marine, brackish, and fresh water environments. The evolutionary transition from marine to fresh water has involved life history adaptations in development mode within this group. As species occupy differing habitats along this environmental gradient, this group has been used to study evolutionary adaptations along the environmental gradient from marine to fresh water. Sampling of a wild population of P. varians from Lymington salt marsh (Hampshire, UK) revealed the highly variable environment that this species inhabits. POI within this population varied inter- and intra-annually, though these variations could not be correlated with variations in environmental temperatures. Larvae hatch with significant yolk reserves and can be considered facultative lecithotrophic in the first and second larval instar, and planktotrophic from the third larval instar. Larval development was successful at temperatures between 15 and 30 °C and temperature-mediated developmental plasticity was observed; at higher temperatures, larvae increasingly developed through fewer larval instars. Development through fewer larval instars resulted in more rapid development, but development to a lesser juvenile dry weight at settlement. Consequently, this developmental plasticity may have ecological implications. Developmental plasticity was also influenced by the energy content of larvae at hatching (as proxy for POI). Larvae with greater energy content developed through fewer larval instars at all temperatures, indicating that higher POI buffers larvae against poor conditions during development. Greater energy content also enabled larvae to tolerate starvation for longer and to develop to more advanced larval stages in the absence of food. Developmental plasticity within decapod crustaceans enables larvae to tolerate unfavourable conditions during development. Interestingly, it maximises the potential fitness benefits provided by POI by enabling larvae to settle as juveniles earlier, though at a smaller size. The interaction between POI and developmental plasticity forms a ‘pre-adaptation’ for the evolution of abbreviated development. The results presented in this thesis indicate that, indeed, the evolutionary transition to abbreviated development and lecithotrophy is based on selection for increasing POI. The abbreviation of development associated with increasing POI arises through developmental plasticity in larval instar number.

T1  - Effects of thermal stress on the brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens (stal)
AN  - 1512397982
AB  - This study investigated the effects of heat stress on the survival, mobility, acclimation ability, development, reproduction and feeding behaviour of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. The critical information derived from the heat tolerance studies indicate that some first instar nymphs become immobilized by heat stress at around 30°C and among the more heat tolerant adult stage, no insects were capable of coordinated movement at 38°C. There was no recovery after entry into heat coma, at temperatures around 38°C for nymphs and 42-43°C for adults. At 41.8° and 42.5oC respectively, approximately 50% of nymphs and adults are killed. In a comparison of the acclimation responses between nymphs and adults reared at 23°C and acclimated at either 15 or 30°C, the data indicate that increases in cold tolerance were greater than heat tolerance, and that acclimation over a generation compared with a single life stage increases tolerance across the thermal spectrum. The temperatures that kill around 50% of nymphs and adults also exert negative effects on development and longevity. The same exposures also lower fecundity and extend egg development time through a combination of mating groups, in which the greatest effects occur when both males and females have experienced sub-lethal heat stress. Likewise, exposure to their ULT50 reduced feeding activity in both life stages of N. lugens. The amount of honeydew excreted by females and males in the treated nymph and adult groups were 3-4x and 2-3x lower than in the equivalent control groups. Overall, sub-lethal heat stress extended egg development time, inhibited nymphal development, lowered fecundity and reduced feeding activity.

T1  - The effects of climate change on stream invertebrates in their role as biological indicators and responders to disturbance
AN  - 1466272471
AB  - This dissertation analyzes four regionally distributed state biomonitoring data sets to inform on 1) how biological indicators respond to the effects of climate change, 2) what climate-specific indicators may be available to detect effects, 3) how well current sampling detects climate-driven changes, and 4) how program designs can continue to detect impairment. In addition, responses were examined of stream invertebrates to a particular extreme event, wildfire, which is expected to increase in the future with climate change.    In general, we found that temperature trait groups (cold- and warm-water preference taxa), as well as several taxonomically-defined invertebrate metrics and indicator groups, show responses consistent with expectation to long-term increases in temperature, although the climate responsiveness of these trait groups varied among states and ecoregions. Temperature sensitivity of taxa and their sensitivity to organic pollution were moderately but significantly correlated. Therefore, metrics selected for condition assessments because taxa are sensitive to disturbance or to conventional pollutants also were sensitive to changes in temperature. We explored the feasibility of modifying metrics by partitioning components based on temperature sensitivity to reduce the likelihood that responses to climate change would confound the interpretation of responses to impairment from other causes and to facilitate tracking of climate-change-related taxon losses and replacements. Difficulties arise in categorizing unique indicators of global changes, because of similarities in some of the temperature and hydrologic effects resulting from climate change, land use changes, and water removal. Nevertheless, the utilization of climate-sensitive traits to modify traditional biomonitoring metrics is promising in the context of using a weight-of-evidence approach for interpreting bioassessment results. Observed invertebrate responses to climate change also impair the condition of reference stations. Combined with our projection that encroachment of developed land uses over time will negatively impact up to a third or more of currently established reference sites by the end of the century, these responses suggest the importance of accounting for reference condition drift through implementation of an objective scale for condition characterization, as well as the need for reference station protection.   These results can be used to identify methods that assist with detecting climate-related effects and highlight steps that can be taken to ensure that programs continue to meet resource protection goals. However, we also must recognize that many aspects of global changes are not tractable at the local to regional scales at which bioassessment is applied in support of water quality management, suggesting the need for a shift in the scale of approach from a narrow focus in the process of water resource quality protection and restoration to one that encompasses broader adaption strategies to address and manage global change impacts.   Overall, we found the response of stream benthic invertebrates to a major wildfire were not devastating, with minimal responses found in total abundance or taxa richness. However, numerous taxa responded to post-fire flow and water quality disturbances either positively, negatively, negatively with recovery, or neutrally, with responses well captured by selected habit and feeding type traits. Post-fire benthic responses reflected three categories, vulnerability, resistance, and resilience, with different groups of organisms and different trait characteristics comprising each. Vulnerability was observed to both direct physical disturbance, mediated by the flow pulses that followed the fire; and to trophic impacts, themselves a response to loss of food resources due to those same flow pulses and associated water quality effects. Resistance to the post-fire physical disturbance of the stream environment was exhibited by a subset of invertebrates with habit traits that conferred the ability to withstand dislodgement and displacement that would otherwise be expected from the post-fire flow pulses. Resilience, or ability to recover in the short term following cessation of the most prominent post-fire flow events, was conferred mainly by opportunistic life-history traits. This suite of responses suggest the mechanisms through which benthic communities may be altered in the long-term, through suppression of some vulnerable taxa, partial if not temporary (short-term) suppression of some trophic resources, and possibly incomplete recovery (relative to pre-fire conditions) based on the reproductive life-history characteristics of component taxa.

T1  - Adaptive responses to aquatic pollution: Dispersal, physiological acclimation, genetic adaptation in the brown bullhead (<i>Ameiurus nebulosus</i>)
AN  - 1465052072
AB  - Organisms are likely to display adaptive responses to their local environment, it may be local adaptation or physiological acclimation, and both improve performance (increase fitness) in stressful habitats. In this dissertation, I explore adaptive responses to pollution stress in the brown bullhead ( Ameiurus nebulosus) from the Detroit River, as a model for integration of evolutionary and ecotoxicologial analyses.   I develop a systematic hierarchical scheme to investigate the role of adaptive processes in response to stressful environments. My literature-based review suggests initial investigation of dispersal as confounding adaptive response to degraded local environment. If there is low dispersal I suggest variation in gene transcription as a biomarker for accurate and repeatable measures of the response to pollution stress, as gene transcription is a very early response to contaminant stress. Following my proposed approach, I examined dispersal and molecular adaptive responses in brown bullhead and developed tools for the analyses: population genetic markers, a custom microarray and transcriptome libraries. The population genetic study demonstrates high population structure FST = 0.095 indicating limited long-term gene flow but contemporary dispersal associated with high contaminant levels (37% dispersals within each region). My initial transcriptome characterisation was done with next generation sequencing (NGS) on challenged and control individuals from two sites (degraded and clean). The NGS transcriptome characterisation was resulted in 3.4 million assembled reads and identified 5515 transcribed genes across clean and polluted background populations. Many gene transcription patterns were as expected as part of an adaptive response; however, some expected transcription induction was not observed. Thus I used a 128 gene custom ecotoxicology response microarray to quantify dose and temporal response of selected genes in brown bullhead exposed to B[a]P. This identified 5 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated gene responses: up-regulation included a variety of response profiles, while down-regulation was simple gene repression.   All forms of adaptive responses in contaminant indicator species have the potential to confound our interpretation of toxicity in natural and lab environments. This may have important management and legislative implications. Of equal interest, my thesis research highlights some behavioural and molecular mechanisms for adaptive responses in Detroit River brown bullhead.

T1  - Dna damage, repair & replication using <i>E. coli</i> model systems
AN  - 1461757226
AB  - DNA encodes the genetic material that makes life possible but it is semi labile and prone to damage. In part, what makes DNA such a reliable genetic storage material is that organisms have developed extensive methods in order to repair damaged DNA and to preserve its integrity. Paradoxically though, genetic instability is essential for survival and one of the major causes of genetic instability is DNA damage sustained through endogenous and exogenous means. Without genetic instability, speciation, evolution, adaptation, and some aspects of aging would not occur. Unfortunately genetic instability does have negative aspects as well such as genetic diseases, cancer, and death. Therefore the interplay between DNA damage and repair is truly a double-edged sword.      E. coli is a valuable model organism for studying DNA damage, repair and replication due to its fast generation time and genetic malleability. Chapters 2-4 of my dissertation widely differ in their scope and aims but all the chapters take advantage of different E. coli  genetic and complementation systems in order to answer various questions about DNA damage, DNA repair proteins, or DNA replication.    One particular form of DNA damage used extensively by chemotherapeutic agents is known as reactive DNA methylation. Reactive DNA methylation is defined, in its simplest form, as the non-enzymatic addition of methyl groups (-CH3) to various positions on DNA nucleotides (2). Reactive DNA methylation lesions can either be innocuous, cytotoxic, or mutagenic depending on exactly where on the nucleobase the lesion occurs. O6-MeG (methyl-guanine) lesions are particularly cytotoxic to humans and the only protein in the entire human body that directly repairs these lesions is called O6 Methyl Guanine Methyl Transferase (MGMT) (3). In Chapter 2 of my thesis I take advantage of an E. coli  genetic system that is deficient in its ability to repair O 6-MeG lesions and determine the repair abilities of all ten non-synonymous MGMT mutants detected in the human population. The results display the O 6-MeG repair profile of all ten non-synonymous MGMT mutants as well as give new insight into the structure of the MGMT protein.  During the first step of a DNA repair process known as Base Excision Repair (BER) DNA repair enzymes known as glycosylases recognize and remove damaged nucleotides. Base excision repair is not a perfect repair process because at high concentrations glycosylases have been known to remove undamaged bases and, in addition, the resulting abasic site can become problematic if not processed quickly by other enzymes (4). Glycosylases can be divided into two categories: those that are constitutively expressed and those that are inducible. In Chapter 3 of my thesis I utilize an E. coli strain that is devoid of reactive methylation specific glycosylases to understand why organisms have evolved both constitutively expressed and inducible glycosylases. The results show that the activity levels towards substrates in constitutively expressed glycosylases are limited so as not to have a negative effect on the fitness of the organism.    DNA polymerase I (Pol I) is one of two replicative polymerases in  E. coli. ColE1 plasmids are used extensively in molecular biology. During ColE1 plasmid replication Pol I initiates leading strand synthesis and also processes Okazaki fragments, Pol III replicates the rest of the plasmid. In Chapter 4 of my thesis I utilize an E. coli strain with a temperature sensitive endogenous Pol I complemented with an error-prone Pol I in order to determine, with high resolution, where on ColE1 plasmids Pol I is replicating (1). The results show exactly where the switch between Pol I and Pol III occurs as well as the sites of Okazaki processing on the lagging strand. In addition the results show that a small fraction of plasmids are replicated exclusively by Pol I and that Pol I plays a far greater role in replication termination than previously thought. These latter results support earlier reports showing a functional redundancy between Pol I and Pol III and bring up interesting questions regarding the role of Pol I during chromosomal replication.

T1  - Population genetics of the common frog (rana temporaria) in relation to climate
AN  - 1442478268
AB  - Ecological responses to a changing climate have been well documented in a broad range of species, predominantly in terms of range movements and phenological changes. When faced with a changing environment, species survival will depend on the ability to: 1) evade changes in climate, via dispersal; 2) evolve, via natural selection; and/or 3) plastically change their phenotype, without underlying genetic changes. The potential for an organism to evade, evolve or plastically respond to a changing environment can be predicted by inferring relationships with current climatic conditions. Altitudinal gradients have been proposed as being particularly suitable for environmental change studies due to the rapid variation in climate even over short geographical distances. Species that inhabit altitudinal gradients experience a range of climatic conditions across their range and are thus subject to varying selection pressures. Changes in temperature are predicted to particularly influence ectotherms due to the direct effect on physiological processes. The common frog (Rana temporaria) occurs from zero to over a thousand metres along altitudinal gradients in Scotland, offering the opportunity to assess the influence of temperature on organism responses. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess population-level relationships with climate, in order to make predictions regarding susceptibility to a changing climate, focussing on R. temporaria in Scotland. In Chapter 2, I inferred colonisation patterns within Europe following the last glacial maximum by combining new and previously compiled mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences. I found that the mitochondrial DNA sequences from my Scottish samples were identical to, or clustered with, the common haplotype previously identified from Western Europe. This clade showed very low mitochondrial genetic variation, consistent with a leptokurtic model of range expansion, where low numbers of long-distance dispersers cause multiple founder events. Second, I assessed fine-scale genetic variation in relation to current temperature gradients using microsatellites. No population structure was found within or between altitudinal gradients at any scale (3-50km; average FST= 0.02), despite a mean annual temperature difference of 4.5°C between low- and high-altitude sites. Levels of genetic diversity and heterozygosity were considerable but did not vary by site, altitude or temperature. In Chapter 3, common temperature treatments were used to assess phenotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity variation in relation to altitude in terms of larval fitness traits. Local adaptation to altitude was assessed using QST-FST analyses and adaptive phenotypic divergence was then related to environmental parameters using Mantel tests, to look for drivers of selection. I found that R. temporaria showed evidence of local adaptation in all larval fitness traits measured. However, only variation in larval period and growth rate was consistent with adaptation to altitude. Moreover, this was only evident in the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (at least 900m). Adaptive divergence in traits that were locally adapted to altitude was correlated with spring temperature, suggesting that temperature acts as a strong environmental selection pressure influencing local adaptation even in the face of high gene flow. In Chapter 4, the physiological and behavioural responses that facilitate survival in high-altitude environments were evaluated, in terms of routine metabolic rate and freeze tolerance in tadpoles, and breeding temperature in adults. I found that routine metabolic rate was lower for individuals sampled from high- than low-altitude sites but only from the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (at least 900m). Glucose accumulation during freezing was not significantly different based on altitude. However, individuals from low-altitude survived freezing significantly better than those from high-altitude, across all mountains. Breeding did not occur below 5˚C at any site and there was no significant difference in breeding temperature between high- and low-altitude sites, leading to high-altitude individuals spawning 30 days later than those at low-altitude. My results suggest that tadpoles are adapted physiologically to surviving at high-altitude via reduced routine metabolic rate, but only at the highest breeding sites. Finally, in Chapter 5, I assessed the spatial variation in species presence and composition of parasitic water moulds in the genus Saprolegnia found on R. temporaria eggs. Thirteen samples isolated from four sites were identified as members of the Saprolegniaceae. Four putative species of Saprolegnia were isolated overall, multiple Saprolegnia water moulds were isolated from within sites, and species composition varied between sites. Acidity was significantly lower at sites where 4 Saprolegniaceae were present, but genetic distance between samples was not correlated with environmental or geographic distance. These findings question the previous focus on S. ferax as the primary agent of Saprolegnia infection in amphibians and suggest that future studies of virulence need to consider the synergistic effect of multiple Saprolegnia species. In conclusion, R. temporaria show the potential for evasion, evolution and plastic responses to a changing climate and my results suggest that the outlook is positive for survival of the common frog in Scotland.

T1  - Born to Run? Integrating Individual Behavior, Physiology, and Life Histories in Partially Migratory Steelhead and Rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>)
AN  - 1442202920
AB  - Steelhead and rainbow trout are common names for marine-migratory (anadromous) and freshwater-resident forms of Oncorhynchus mykiss, a partially migratory salmonid fish. Anadromous and resident forms are sympatric and can produce offspring with a life history different from their own (i.e., steelhead parents can produce rainbow trout offspring and vice versa). The expression of these alternative life histories is a plastic response to individual patterns of energy acquisition, assimilation, and allocation during juvenile life stages. Individual performance during early stream life is of particular interest because of potential carry-over effects on subsequent growth and developmental trajectories. In a series of experiments in laboratory streams, I determined the influence of individual variation in energy metabolism on behavior, growth, and life-history expression in O. mykiss. Individual variation in energy metabolism was a strong predictor of feeding territory acquisition by juvenile fish during the transition from dependence on maternal provisioning of egg yolk reserves to independent feeding. Feeding territory acquisition was positively associated with standard metabolic rate (SMR) under conditions of an abundant and predictable food supply. When the density of intraspecific competitors was manipulated, the association between SMR and territory acquisition was strongest at intermediate stocking densities, moderate at the highest stocking densities, and weakest at the lowest stocking densities. However, reducing the spatial predictability of food resources within streams reversed the influence of SMR on competitive outcomes. These experiments determined that variation in ecological conditions during early life stages imposes different selection regimes on juvenile O. mykiss and results in physiological divergence among cohorts. Subsequent rearing experiments determined that behavioral dominance influences rates of anadromy and freshwater maturation, most likely through the association between SMR and territory acquisition. In addition to the effects of behavioral dominance, I observed a significant influence of sex, rearing temperature, and individual growth trajectories on the expression of anadromy and freshwater maturation. Partially migratory populations of  O. mykiss maintain an exceptionally diverse portfolio of life-history strategies. Results from this work lend insight into a suite of behavioral and physiological processes influencing individual life histories.

T1  - Transcriptional variation among populations of salmon: The genetic architecture of local adaptation
AN  - 1413306702
AB  - Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) life history provides an excellent opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms of selective divergence. I analyzed gene transcription in Chinook salmon that were created in a replicated North Carolina II breeding design to estimate quantitative genetic parameters that contributed to among-population variation in gene expression. Following Fischer’s fundamental theorem, transcriptional variation of many genes was due to additive effects. However, a surprising number of genes exhibited non-additive genetic and maternal effects on transcription, and these effects may explain the high potential for rapid population-level evolution in salmon. Indeed, populations differed substantially in gene transcription. Pervasive non-additive gene expression raises concerns for conservation strategies that result in intraspecific hybridization. I document extensive amounts of reciprocal hybrid disagreement in gene transcription, indicative of breakdown of gene expression regulation complexes that are likely co-adapted. Anomalous hybrid gene transcription warrants caution for conservation strategies that employ mixing natural stocks.

T1  - Evolutionary and functional analysis of the Drosphila <i>bag of marbles</i> gene
AN  - 1317660954
AB  - Reproduction is fundamentally important for organismal fitness. While it is critical that each step in reproduction proceed correctly, many of the genes that regulate these processes are adaptively evolving in response to both internal and external selective pressures. We have previously shown that the bag of marbles (bam) and benign gonial cell neoplasm (bgcn) genes are evolving under rapid, adaptive evolution in D. melanogaster and  D. simulans. These genes act at the earliest stages of reproduction, germline stem cell (GSC) regulation.   In the first study, I expand population genetic analyses to genes that play a role in GSC regulation and/or genetically interact with bam.  I find that multiple GSC regulatory genes show evidence of rapid, adaptive evolution in D. melanogaster and/or D. simulans.  These genes play very different roles in the regulation of GSCs, and their diverse functions and expression patterns suggest that multiple selective pressures are acting to drive the evolution of GSC regulatory genes.    In a second study, I focused on bam to determine the functional consequences of bam’s sequence divergence. I developed a transgenesis assay to determine the ability of a bam  orthologs from D. melanogaster and D. simulans  to rescue the male and female sterility of a D. melanogaster bam mutation. I found that while D. simulans can rescue D. melanogaster bam male sterility, it fails to fully rescue female sterility suggesting that the selective pressure driving the evolution of bam is present in the female germline.   In the final study, I investigated the hypothesis that the bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia pipientis, is driving the adaptive evolution of bam. I found that Wolbachia and bam genetically interact by showing that Wolbachia  can rescue the fertility defects of a bam hypomorph. I found that D. melanogaster-specific Wolbachia is unable to accumulate as well in the presence of a D. simulans bam  ortholog which is consistent with a model that Wolbachia  is co-evolving with bam and supports the hypothesis that Wolbachia is driving the adaptive evolution of  bam.

T1  - The Use of Ionic Liquid for the Pretreatment of Energy Cane Bagasse
AN  - 2674875003
AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass appears to be a prospective renewable resource that can be used for the generation of biofuels and bioproducts. The major concern in lignocellulose conversion is overcoming biomass recalcitrance through pretreatment while still maintaining a green, energy efficient and cost-effective process. Energy cane is a promising energy crop with high fiber content, cold tolerance, and less fertilizer and water input requirements as compared to conventional sugarcane. Ionic liquids (ILs) are promising solvents for the pretreatment of lignocellulose as they are thermally stable, environmentally friendly, recyclable, and have low volatility. This study assessed the use of ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]) as a solvent during the pretreatment of energy cane bagasse (ECB) and its effect on the chemical composition, surface morphology, cellulose crystallinity, and enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated biomass.IL-treated ECB resulted in significant lignin removal (32.1%) with slight glucan and xylan losses (8.8% and 14.0%, respectively), and exhibited much higher cellulose and hemicellulose enzymatic digestibilities (87.0%, 64.3%) than untreated (5.5%, 2.8%) or water-treated (4.0%, 2.1%) ECB, respectively. The enhanced digestibilities of IL-treated biomass can be attributed to delignification and reduction of cellulose crystallinity as confirmed by FTIR and XRD analysis. When pretreating ECB with recycled IL, enzymatic digestibility decreased as the number of pretreatment recycles increased. Decreasing the pretreatment temperature from 120 °C to 100 °C and extending the residence time from 30 min to 2 h brought significant improvement to the pretreatment efficiency of recycled [EMIM][OAc] on ECB. However, response surface methodology model indicated that a higher glucose yield of IL-treated biomass could be obtained at higher pretreatment temperatures with shorter residence times. The optimal processing conditions were pretreatment of ECB at 131.9 °C for 28.1 min at 8.4% solids loading resulting in a final glucose yield of 35.96 g glucose per 100 g of native biomass.The results presented in this thesis demonstrated that [EMIM][OAc] can be used as a potential solvent for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass such as ECB. Furthermore, the sugar yields obtained post pretreatment have great potential as building blocks in the production of renewable fuels and chemicals.

T1  - Biosynthesis of Human Membrane-Bound Catechol-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase: Optimization Using Plackett-Burman and Central Composite Design
AN  - 2586429967
AB  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT, EC 2.1.1.6) is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of catechol substrates (catecholamines, catecholestrogens). Physiologically, it is responsible for the elimination of biologically active or toxic catechols, making it a protein with great clinical relevance as therapeutic target in serious disorders, like schizophrenia and Parkinson´s disease. To fulfill pharmaceuticals requirements, new strategies of optimization and large-scale production of COMT enzyme are crucial. Statistical optimization approaches have demonstrated their enormous value in laboratory and industrial scale, namely in biotechnological production processes, in which an incremental enhancement can be a perpetual improvement.In this work, we aimed the optimization of recombinant human membrane-bound COMT (hMBCOMT) enzymatic activity yields following a statistical optimization as a solving approach. Plackett-Burman design was used as a first optimization step to identify which factors have a significant effect in hMBCOMT productivity and activity levels, and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), by a Central Composite Design (CCD), to optimize the process.We applied Brevibacillus choshinensis cells for the biosynthesis of hMBCOMT and a semi-defined medium for cell growth. This medium was subjected to a first screening using the Plackett–Burman design to evaluate the influence of the culture parameters (chemicals and physicals) in hMBCOMT enzymatic activity levels. Enzymatic activity were measured in a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a coulochemical detector. Among the eleven variables tested, polypeptone, ammonium sulfate, glucose and temperature were selected owing to their significant effect on human MBCOMT enzymatic activity. The biological human MBCOMT activity obtained with the semi-defined medium in Plackett-Burman design were very promising, while were higher than the obtained with 2SYNm medium, a traditional growth medium for Brevibacillus cells of this work. Typically, we obtained values of 93nmol/h for hMBCOMT total enzymatic activity and 30 nmol/h/mg of specific activity with protein in its native form, without the use of any kind of detergents on protein solubilization step. Based on the results of Plackett–Burman design, a CCD was adopted to define optimal components concentration and temperature in order to maximize our response. The CCD model presented a multiple correlation coefficient value of 0.635 and a significant lack of fit, showing the lack aptness of the model to the process optimization and the failure to attain the optimal concentration of each variable.Alternate abstract:Catecol-O-metiltransferase (COMT, CE 2.1.1.6) é uma enzima metiltransferase dependente de S-adenosil-L-metionina (SAM) que catalisa a metilação de substratos catecóis (catecolaminas, catecolestrogénios). Fisiologicamente, é responsável pela eliminação de catecóis biologicamente activos ou tóxicos, tornando-a uma proteína de elevado interesse clínico e utilizada como alvo terapêutico em doenças graves, como a esquizofrenia e a doença de Parkinson. Para suprir as necessidades farmacêuticas, novas estratégias de otimização e produção em larga escala desta enzima são fundamentais. Abordagens de otimização estatística têm demonstrado o seu enorme valor à escala laboratorial e industrial, nomeadamente nos processos de produção biotecnológicos, em que um pequeno detalhe melhorado pode significar um grande passo para o sucesso.Neste trabalho, objetivou-se a otimização do nível de atividade enzimática da proteína recombinante COMT, na sua forma membranar, através do recurso a modelos de otimização estatística como uma abordagem resolutiva. Numa primeira fase de otimização e de seleção dos fatores mais significativos para a atividade enzimática da proteína em estudo foi utilizada a técnica de desenho experimental Plackett-Burman. Após esta seleção foi aplicada a
Metodologia de Superfície de Resposta (RSM), através de desenho composto central (DCC), para otimização da concentração dos fatores que revelaram ser mais significativos e, consequentemente, do processo.Foi utilizado o sistema de expressão Brevibacillus choshinensis para a biossíntese da proteína membranar COMT e um meio semi-definido para o seu crescimento. Este meio foi submetido a uma primeira triagem através do desenho experimental Plackett-Burman, avaliando-se desta forma a influência dos parâmetros de cultura (produtos químicos e físicos) nos níveis de actividade enzimática da COMT membranar. Os níveis de actividade enzimática foram medidos num sistema de cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência acoplado a um detector amperométrico. Entre as onze variáveis testadas, a polipeptona, sulfato de amónio, glucose e temperatura foram as variáveis selecionadas dado o seu significativo efeito na actividade enzimática da COMT membranar. Os níveis de atividade enzimática obtidos nesta primeira triagem revelaram-se bastante promissores, sendo mais elevados do que os obtidos com o meio 2SYNm, meio de crescimento mais comum para as células usadas neste trabalho. Foram obtidos valores de 93nmol/h para a actividade enzimática total e cerca 30 nmol/h/mg de
actividade enzimática específica com a proteína na sua forma nativa, sem o uso de qualquer tipo de detergentes no processo de solubilização. Com base nos resultados do desenho Plackett Burman foi aplicado o desenho Composto Central para a otimização dos quatro fatores em causa a fim de maximizar a nossa resposta. Este apresentou um valor do coeficiente de correlação múltipla de 0,635 e uma falta de ajuste significativa, demonstrando a falta de adequação do modelo para a otimização do processo.

T1  - Adapt, Move or Perish: The Interaction of Genetics and Demography in Fragmented Populations Under Climate Change
AN  - 2564455292
AB  - Habitat loss and degradation, and human-induced climate change are two of the main current threats to biodiversity. While the impacts of these pressures separately on species survival are being investigated extensively, we have only just begun to unravel the combined impact of these two pressures on species. The combination of range shifts and local adaptation has been suggested to increase species survival under climate change. Habitat fragmentation may increase the rate of local adaptation due to reduced genetic variation as a result of declined population sizes, but also enhances the impact of stochastic processes such as founder effects. A quantification of each of these processes and their combined outcome is therefore necessary to assess the chances of species survival and fitness under different conditions. In this thesis I have used a spatially explicit, individual-based eco-evolutionary model to investigate the interaction of founder events and local adaptation throughout a range of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus medius) in fragmented habitat under climate change. This is a species with an average performance regarding dispersal distance and population growth rate. In Chapter 2 I show that consecutive founder effects occur at all projected levels of temperature increase, in time causing range-wide loss of neutral genetic diversity. In Chapter 3 I demonstrate that increased habitat area prolongs the conservation of neutral genetic variation under range shift but does not prevent the depletion of the genetic variation in the populations that are newly established. Founder events thus have important consequences for the level and distribution of neutral genetic variation in species of average dispersal capacity. In Chapter 4 I show that the founder effect is also a major component of the evolutionary process during a range shift of a species that features genetic differences between central and marginal populations in fragmented habitat. This eventually leads to maladaptation in the range centre and to a decrease of the species’ survival probability. In Chapter 5 I demonstrate that founder effects greatly enhance local adaptation towards increased dispersal in new populations at the expanding range margin. When the selection pressure in these populations changes at a later stage, the local depletion of functional genetic variation caused by the founder event results in delayed adaptation and thus decreased survival probability of the metapopulation. This finding indicates that it is of great importance to assess the relative contribution of founder effects in evolutionary processes in populations established beyond the original range limit under range shift, especially in fragmented habitat. While founder effects have been clearly associated with the patterns in neutral genetic diversity observed after range expansions, studies showing trait evolution under range shifts have thus far not investigated the potential role of founder effects. I advocate the further development of realistic, species-specific eco-evolutionary models to increase both understanding and predictive power of the interaction of demographic and genetic responses of species to combined pressures of habitat fragmentation and climate change. I further recommend that empirical studies combine the investigation of changes in adaptive traits with the assessment of signatures of founder effects, which can be uncovered using neutral markers, both in the same individuals. If local adaptation shows to be enhanced by founder effects, the long-term adverse effects of reduced genetic diversity should be quantified and taken into consideration.

T1  - Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Metallic Membranes for CO<sub>2</sub> Capture
AN  - 2454650057
AB  - Approximately 85% of the global energy demand for electricity generation is supplied from fossil fuel resources, mainly from coal-fired power plants, which accounts for approximately 40% of the total CO2 emissions. Due to the environmental impact and recent proposed EPA regulations on CO2 emissions, it becomes clear that carbon capture technologies must be advanced for carbon capture and storage (or utilization) to be an economically viable strategy for mitigating CO2. Carbon capture may be applied through two different approaches, i.e., precombustion or postcombustion depending on whether a given fossil fuel resource is gasified or combusted, respectively. This dissertation is dedicated to focus on existing precombustion and novel postcombustion membrane technologies. In the studies presented within this dissertation, a high concentration of H2 in synthesis gas for precombustion capture of CO2 and a high concentration of N2 in the flue gas for the postcombustion capture of CO2 are the main driving forces for the use of the metallic membrane technology described within this work. The main scope of this dissertation is showing the value of integration of atomic-scale modeling with experimental testing in improving the material properties of traditional metallic membranes, subsequently leading to the design of new membranes and addressing the challenges that arise from material selection and process scale-up during technology deployment.Palladium-based metallic membranes have been the primary focus in the membrane community as a potential precombustion CO2 capture technology from gasification systems because of their high hydrogen permeability, surface catalytic activity and thermal stability at high temperatures. However, palladium is not only an expensive material to apply at large scale, but it loses its activity and mechanical integrity from sulfur poisoning due to the H2S content of the synthesis gas produced from the coal gasification process. Alloying palladium may be an option for overcoming sulfur poisoning. In this study, the effect of alloying palladium with copper or niobium on the H2 and H2S interactions with the metal membrane surface has been investigated using plane-wave density functional theory-based electronic structure calculations using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package. The overall d-band centers calculated for H2 adsorption at the fcc-fcc site for the pure and alloyed-Pd surfaces indicate that the H2 adsorption strength trend is palladium > copper > niobium. In addition, the H2S binding trend is found to be copper < palladium < niobium, with the copper-alloyed surfaces exhibiting the weakest binding and niobium-alloyed surfaces the strongest binding. The second part of this dissertation is focused on the design and testing of a new N2-selective membrane technology using metallic membranes for the postcombustion CO2 capture application. This technology benefits from the high concentration of N2 present in the flue gas stream (73 wt.%) to separate N2 and concentrate CO2 in the retentate stream of the membrane for CO2 capture as it provides atomic nitrogen on the permeate side of the membrane during separation. These properties along with H2 provided as a sweep gas ammonia synthesis as a byproduct of the separation process may be possible.Within this study, N2 in particular, has been investigated to determine the mechanism of subsequent atomic diffusion into the bulk crystal structure of vanadium and its alloys using density functional theory. It was determined that the octahedral site is the most favorable binding site for N within bulk vanadium, with a binding energy of -2.132 eV. Nitrogen binding in vanadium is nearly twenty orders of magnitude stronger compared to the well-known H binding case (-0.076 eV). These strong N binding energies indicate that N may have difficulty diffusing through the metal. Alloying vanadium with ruthenium may aid in tuning the N binding energy so that it approaches that of H; alloying vanadium with 6.25 at.% ruthenium yields a weaker N binding energy of -0.889 eV. It is anticipated that increasing the content of ruthenium in the alloy will lead to a further reduction in the stability of N within the bulk crystal lattice. Experimental efforts have involved the design and construction of a gas permeation test system and execution of pure gas permeation tests to determine the N2 transport mechanism through the membrane foils comprised of vanadium at temperatures ranging from 600 to 900 °C. The overall experimental findings emphasize the possibility of a solution-diffusion transport mechanism of N2 through vanadium at 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C. Characterization of the foils before and after the permeation tests using XRD, XPS and SEM techniques indicate nitride formation on the surface and in the bulk of the vanadium, thereby providing further evidence that N2 transport through the vanadium membranes takes place via a solution-diffusion mechanism. In total, characterization and flux measurements were compared alongside electronic structure predictions from density functional theory and demonstrate the viability of using Group V metals and their alloys for N2-selective membrane applications.

T1  - Development of bioassay approaches to evaluate the impacts of pollution on New Zealand estuaries using the marine copepod Quinquelaophonte sp.
AN  - 2307649943
AB  - Worldwide, estuaries are under increasing pressure from numerous contaminants. There is a need to develop reliable bioassay methodologies to assess the effects of these stressors on estuary health. This thesis aimed to develop and validate toxicity tests in a New Zealand marine harpacticoid copepod species for use in monitoring and evaluating the effects of estuarine pollution. A survey and toxicological assessment of a range of native copepod species resulted in the selection of Quinquelaophonte sp. as the ideal bioassay species. This selection was based on a broad regional distribution, ease of culture and high reproductive rate in the laboratory, sexual dimorphism, and sensitivity to contaminants. To validate the bioassay, spiked sediments were used to expose Quinquelaophonte sp. to three reference compounds representing important categories of estuarine chemical stressors: zinc (a metal), atrazine (a pesticide), and phenanthrene (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon). A method for spiking sediments that Quinquelaophonte sp. inhabit was developed to ensure even contaminant distribution in sediments. Two sediment bioassays using lethal and sublethal endpoints were validated, one acute (96 h) and one chronic (14 d). These assays incorporated both lethal and sublethal endpoints, which included reproductive output and mobility. Acute-to-chronic ratios were calculated for use in environmental risk assessment and to provide insight into the mode of action of the reference contaminants. The chronic sediment bioassay was used to assess sediment quality in three estuaries across New Zealand: Napier, Christchurch and Invercargill. This validated the bioassay for use with naturally-contaminated field sediments with varying mixtures of pollutants and sediment types (coarse sandy to fine silty organic rich sediments). Quinquelaophonte sp. was also tested to assess whether it can be used to characterise multi-generation impacts. After four generations of exposure to zinc, there were changes in acute sensitivity, indicating this species possesses mechanisms for acclimating or adapting to toxic stressors. Sediment bioassays in Quinquelaophonte sp. were successfully developed and validated, offering significant promise as a tool for monitoring effects of pollution in New Zealand estuaries.

In small organisms, whereas the largest weight increase in medium organisms was in February 18 with 13.57 ± 0.51 gr., and the large size had its biggest increase in January 30 with 21, 33 ± 0.65 gr. The correlation evaluation was given for small sizes and was obtained on January 30 with a R2 = 0.81, medium sizes on February 18 with a R2 = 0, 90 and in large sizes on January 30 with an R2 = 0 , 81. Small organisms showed the best survival (57.81%) and medium and large organisms presented a mortality breakpoint at 30.9 °C, with a survival of 64.4% in medium organisms and 67.7% in large organisms. A workshop was given to the comuneros, the same one that had great relevance in clearing several doubts as to the biology of bivalves and to the installation of the culture in long-line.Alternate abstract:El Ecuador posee una gran variedad de especies marinas costeras, entre ellos los moluscos, cuya presencia ha sido trascendental para el desarrollo de nuestras poblaciones, sin embargo, no se ha desarrollado esta industria hasta la actualidad, es por eso que en este estudio se determinó la adaptabilidad de la almeja Protothaca asperrima en sistemas de cultivo de long – line en la comunidad de Puerto Portovelo, la misma que esta ubicada a orillas del estuario del río Chone, al sur del cantón San Vicente, provincia de Manabí.

T1  - Ecological interactions in populations facing environmental stress
TT  - Interações ecológicas em populações sujeitas a stress ambiental
AN  - 1894053367
AB  - O zooplâncton, particularmente os cladóceros, são organismos de água doce importantes na regulação da produção primária dos ecossistemas de água doce. No entanto, também podem adaptar-se a condições salobras. Tendo em conta as previsões no âmbito das alterações climáticas, a intrusão salina pode ocorrer a par com a subida de temperatura. As populações de água doce podem ficar vulneráveis aos efeitos interativos da salinidade e da temperatura, de acordo com os seus limites de tolerância e capacidade de adaptação ao stress ambiental. Assim, a presente tese analisou as interações resultantes das alterações destes agentes de stress em populações de cladóceros de água doce. Primeiro, comparou-se a halotolerância de diferentes genótipos de Simocephalus vetulus provenientes de populações de água doce e de água salobra de modo a avaliar a existência de uma componente genética de resistência à salinidade. A sensibilidade aguda dos genótipos variou na mesma gama de concentrações; todavia, todos os genótipos da população salobra, exceto um, foram mais tolerantes do que os de água doce, em termos de tempo à imobilização. Contudo, não foi possível estabelecer uma relação entre a performance reprodutiva em condições salobras e o contexto ambiental de origem destes genótipos. Mais, estes ensaios mostraram que as populações de água doce têm potencial para tolerar incrementos de salinidade. Como tal, pode-se concluir que a seleção a que os genótipos estão sujeitos no seu local de origem foi mais fraca do que o esperado. Segundo, investigou-se a capacidade de aclimatação de Daphnia galeata à salinidade e temperatura, de modo a avaliar a halotolerância de Daphnia a duas temperaturas num cenário de aclimatação multigeracional. O objetivo foi compreender se a pré-adaptação ao stress ambiental (20ºC e 25ºC versus 0 g/L e 1 g/L de NaCl) influenciou posteriormente as respostas a estes agentes de stress. Verificou-se uma tendência para um aumento de sensibilidade ao NaCl, a temperaturas mais elevadas. No entanto, este efeito foi anulado após nove gerações, mas apenas quando os organismos foram aclimatados aos dois agentes de stress em simultâneo (salinidade e temperatura elevada). Terceiro, demonstrou-se experimentalmente que a salinidade interferiu com a competição interespecífica, alterando a composição das comunidades zooplanctónicas. Este conjunto de evidências permitiu-nos refletir nos múltiplos impactos de agentes de stress, particularmente os relacionados com as previsões de alterações climáticas. Em paralelo aos estudos de natureza experimental, e numa perspetiva de Educação para o Desenvolvimento Sustentável (EDS), importa também promover o desenvolvimento de competências necessárias à compreensão de mudanças ambientais globais (e.g., o impacto da salinidade e da temperatura) para implementar estratégias de mitigação e adaptação. Neste contexto, foi realizada uma atividade com estudantes do ensino secundário, que se tornou uma boa oportunidade para a sua aprendizagem e aquisição de competências de interpretação de dados experimentais, assim como de sensibilização para as questões ambientais.Alternate abstract:Zooplankton, namely cladocerans, are important regulators of primary production in freshwater ecosystems. However, these filter-feeders can also be found in brackish waters and can therefore adapt to this stressful condition. Bearing in mind climate change predictions, saline intrusion can occur in coastal freshwater systems, accompanied by increasing temperatures. Freshwater populations can thus become vulnerable to the interactive effect of salinity and temperature, framed within their tolerance limits and adaptation ability to environmental stress. Taking this into consideration, the present thesis aimed at addressing the complex interactions resulting from the challenge of these environmental stressors on freshwater cladoceran populations. First, the halotolerance of different Simocephalus vetulus genotypes from two freshwater and one brackish population (salinity 2.3) was explored. The goal was to determine whether there was a genetic component of salinity resistance. Clone acute sensitivity was comparable among populations. However, all brackish clones, except one, were more halotolerant than freshwater genotypes, in terms of survival time. Life history assays, carried out with extreme genotypes (from previous experiment) revealed no relationship between fitness and the original environmental context of genotypes. Also, these experiments showed that freshwater populations do have the potential to tolerate salinity increases. As such, we can conclude that the local selective pressure caused by salinity was weaker than expected. Second, the acclimation ability of Daphnia galeata to salinity and temperature was investigated in this study, by evaluating Daphnia’s sensitivity to salinity, at two different temperatures, along a multigenerational acclimation scenario. The objective was to understand whether pre-adaptation to environmental stress (20ºC and 25ºC versus 0 g/L and 1 g/L of added NaCl) influenced the response to the latter exposure to these stressors. A tendency towards the increase of sensitivity to NaCl was observed, at higher temperature. However, this temperature-dependent effect was nullified after nine generations, but only when animals had been acclimated to both stressors (salinity and higher temperature). Third, we experimentally demonstrated that salinity interfered with inter-specific competition, altering the community composition of zooplankton communities. This body of evidence allowed us to reflect on the impacts of multiple stressors, particularly those related to climate change predictions. In parallel with experimental studies, within the framework of Education for Sustainable Development, it is also important to promote the development of the necessary competences towards the comprehension of global environmental change (e.g. the impact of salinity and temperature), in order to implement adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Hence, an activity with secondary school students was conducted, providing a good opportunity towards learning and competence acquisition in the interpretation of experimental data, as well as increasing awareness towards environmental issues.

T1  - High pressure studies in solid state chemistry and biology
AN  - 1779546330
AB  - The new family of multiferroic perovskites SeMO3 (M= Ni, Mn, Cu) are obtained under high-P,T synthesis conditions from mixtures of the oxides (NiO, MnO, SeO2 etc.) or the corresponding metal hydroxides at pressures between 2-7 GPa and at temperatures up to 1000°C. However, those syntheses can result in retention of the starting oxides in the reaction products, leading to difficulties in analysis of the magnetic properties. We have developed a precursor route based on the reaction of Na2SeO3 with anhydrous MCl2 compounds, leading to the formation of the crystalline perovskite material with formation of only diamagnetic NaCl as a reaction product. This reaction procedure also allows us to lower the reaction temperature. We studied the synthesis both in the laboratory using multi-anvil and piston cylinder techniques, and also using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction using the Paris-Edinburgh press at ESRF ID27, to follow the synthesis reactions and optimise the reaction conditions. Our results indicate initial formation of Se-bearing perovskites such as SeCuO3, in a low-P, T range kinetically stabilised during the early stages of the reaction, followed by further reactions to yield well-crystallised materials at higher-P, T conditions. We also used similar techniques to study possible formation of SeMS3 perovskites indicated to be stable from DFT calculations. Here we could not find any evidence for formation of the perovskite structures, but instead we observed synthesis of pyrite-type materials Bacteria show the greatest adaptability, which enables them to occupy extreme habitats on the planet. It is important to complete a proper evaluation of the biosphere of our planet and to achieve this we must understand the mechanisms and limits for bacterial survival. This work will help us constrain models for the origin of life and is readily transferable to many astrobiological studies. It is now extremely relevant to study the effect of high P on the development and evolution of organisms to understand their survivability mechanisms. We are experimenting with the adaptability of E.coli to pressures greater than 1 GPa. Until recently it was thought that no organisms could survive at P> 120 MPa (Zeng et al 2009). However, a recent study indicated that E.coli and S. onodeinsis remained viable to 1.4-1.7 GPa (Sharma et al 2002), but the results have been questioned (Yayanos 2002). However, our collaborative directed evolution study of E. coli has now confirmed that microbes can adapt and survive at least up to 2 GPa (Vanlint et al 2011).

T1  - Evolution of reproduction and stress tolerance in brachionid rotifers
AN  - 1656157955
AB  - Stress can be a driving force for new evolutionary changes leading to local adaptation, or may be responded to with pre-existing, ancestral tolerance mechanisms. Using brachionid rotifers (microzooplankton) as a study system, I demonstrate roles of both conserved physiological mechanisms (heat shock protein induction) and rapid evolution of traits in response to ecologically relevant stressors such as temperature and hydroperiod. Rapid evolution of higher levels of sex and dormancy in cultures mimicking temporary waters represents an eco-evolutionary dynamic, with trait evolution feeding back into effects on ecology (i.e., reduced population growth). I also reveal that prolonged culture in a benign laboratory environment leads to evolution of increased lifespan and fecundity, perhaps due to reduction of extrinsic mortality factors. Potential mechanisms (e.g., hormonal signals) are suggested that may control evolvability of facets of the stress response. Due to prior studies suggesting a role of progesterone signaling in rotifer sex and dormancy, the  membrane associated progesterone receptor is assayed as a candidate gene that could show positive selection indicating rapid divergence. Despite some sequence variation that may contribute to functional differences among species, results indicate this hormone receptor is under purifying selection.    Detailed analyses of multiple stress responses and their evolution as performed here will be imperative to understanding current patterns of local adaptation and trait-environment correlations. Such research also is key to predicting persistence of species upon introduction to novel habitats and exposure to new stressors (e.g., warming due to climate change). Perhaps one of the most intriguing results of this dissertation is the rapid, adaptive change in levels of sex and dormancy in a metazoan through new mutations or re-arrangements of the genetic material. This suggests species may be able to rapidly evolve tolerance of new stressors, even if standing genetic variation does not currently encompass the suite of alleles necessary for survival.

T1  - Graduation Hazards and Surviving College: A Descriptive Study of the Longitudinal Nature of Low-Income, First Generation, and Minority Student Enrollment and Graduation
AN  - 1651838275; ED545927
AB  - There are ambitious institutional and national goals that aspire to improve the six year graduation rate for undergraduate students. An important element of increasing the overall rate lies in decreasing the educational attainment gaps for low-income, first generation, and other historically underserved students. Comprehensive theoretical approaches to student success show that campuses have the opportunity to influence these achievement gaps with intentional and integrated programming and policy; however, the first step of initiating campus changes is to understand how the longitudinal nature of enrollment varies for demographically different students. This study utilizes a competing risk event history analysis on six cohorts of Colorado State University (CSU) fall-start freshmen over eight academic years in order to describe their dropout and graduation trajectories across a variety of demographic and academic preparation variables. Results indicate that all students have the highest hazard of graduation at year five and the greatest dropout hazard at year one; however, the shapes of these hazards are different based on a student's demographic characteristics. Students with high risk characteristics have much lower graduation hazards after year five and much higher dropout hazards after year one when compared to their low risk peers. Thus, findings from this analysis indicate that high risk students at CSU need to be directed on educational paths that keep them on track to graduate in five years and that these students may also need continued retention support during their second and third years.

T1  - The Role of Life History and the Environment in Population Dynamics of Sockeye Salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus nerka</i>)
AN  - 1514957097
AB  - Processes linking the environment and life histories are central to our understanding of population dynamics. This thesis combines life history theory and environmental variation to explain recruitment dynamics among populations in Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). I first explore relationships between spawning stream characteristics and spawning densities and show that streams with more cover have higher spawning densities. Next, I use a 21-year time series for three of these populations to explore hypotheses about how maternal life history traits and migration conditions, experienced during upstream migrations to their spawning grounds, influence reproductive investment. Maternal body size is strongly linked to total reproductive investment and both egg mass and fecundity; however, migration difficulty only influences egg mass and not fecundity. Using the same dataset, I show that egg mass and incubation temperatures influence juvenile fitness-related traits including length, mass and emergence timing. The main finding from these analyses, that warmer incubation temperatures result in lighter juveniles that emerge earlier, led to hypotheses about how incubation temperature might select for egg size among populations. I tested these hypotheses by comparing 16 populations and confirmed the prediction that in streams with warmer water, fish would produce heavier eggs. I then asked if these same maternal traits and environmental conditions would relate to adult recruitment dynamics. Populations spawning in streams with deeper water had higher maximum population growth rates and less variable recruitment. In addition, populations in streams with larger gravel exhibited stronger density-dependence. Finally, I develop a novel framework for evaluating how habitat data, combined with the cost of collecting such information, can be used in developing cost-effective surveys. I demonstrate this general framework with a simple example using the relationships between stream characteristics and sockeye densities, considering the costs and effectiveness of stream variables. Overall, this demonstration of the joint role of maternal traits and environmental conditions in recruitment dynamics supports the potential use of such variables as indicators of population dynamics in the absence of long-term demographic data. Furthermore, it supports the development of cost-effective surveys, which is important as human impacts on populations increase, and as monitoring resources decline.

T1  - Biological Conversion of Glycerol to Ethanol by <i>Enterobacter aerogenes</i>
AN  - 1318673211
AB  - In a search to turn the economically and environmentally non-valuable "waste" streams of biodiesel production into a profitable byproduct, a mutant strain of Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 was developed by six-tube subculturing technique. This technique is based on the principle of adaptive evolution, and involved subculturing the bacterium in a tryptic soy broth without dextrose (TSB) containing specific glycerol and ethanol concentration for six consecutive times. Then, the six consecutive subculturing was repeated in a fresh TSB of higher glycerol and ethanol concentrations. A new mutant strain, E. aerogenes S012, which could withstand a combination of 200 g/l glycerol and 30 g/l ethanol concentrations, was developed. The wild and mutant strains were used for the fermentation of pure (P-) and recovered (R-) glycerol. Taguchi and full factorial methods of design of experiments were used to screen and optimize the important process factors that influence the microbial production of ethanol. A statistically sound regression model was used to establish the mathematical relationship between the process variables and ethanol production. Temperature of 38°C, agitation speed of 200 rpm, pH of 6.3-6.6, and microaerobic condition were the optimum process conditions. Different pretreatment methods to recover glycerol from the crude glycerol and the subsequent fermentation method showed that direct acidification using 85% H3PO4 was the best. The R-glycerol contained 51% pure glycerol and 21% methanol. The wild strain, E. aerogenes  ATCC 13048, produced only 12 g/l and 12.8 g/l ethanol from 20 g/l P- and R-glycerol respectively, and could not utilize higher glycerol concentrations. The mutant, E. aerogenes S012, produced ethanol amount and yield of 43 g/l and 1.12 mol/mol-glycerol from P-glycerol, respectively within 96 h. It also produced ethanol amount and yield of 26.8 g/l and 1.07 mol/mol-glycerol, respectively, from R-glycerol within the same duration. In a fermentation to estimate hydrogen production using a respirometer, the hydrogen yield and volumetric rate of 1.06 mol/mol-glycerol and 217 ml/l/h, respectively were obtained from 6% P-glycerol in 72 h by E. aerogenes S012. The result was higher from R-glycerol, which produced hydrogen yield and productivity of 1.83 mol/mol-glycerol and 326 ml/l/h, respectively.

T1  - Sex determination and differentiation in the common snapping turtle – A reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination
AN  - 1315240511
AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) was first discovered in an African lizard over 40 years ago. TSD has since been shown to be exhibited by many vertebrates including some fish and amphibians, numerous lizards, turtles, and all crocodilians studied to date. Although numerous questions surround TSD, a major question focuses on understanding the genetic, physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying this process. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TSD are not well known and the gene(s) that transduces a signal for ovary or testis development is not known in any species. Furthermore, it is well established that sex steroid hormones, androgens and estrogens, are important for sex determination and differentiation in TSD species. Yet, the role of androgens in these processes is not well understood. This dissertation addresses these questions in two parts. First, to identify unique, thermo-sensitive, genes involved in TSD and secondly, determine the role of androgens in sex determination and differentiation in the common snapping turtle, a reptile with TSD.     I used differential-display PCR to clone a candidate gene involved in TSD, the cold-inducible RNA binding protein (Cirbp). The temporal and spatial patterns of Cirbp mRNA and protein expression during and after sex determination were determined using quantitative real-time PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry.  I used next-generation Illumina sequencing to identify small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to test for associations between Cirbp genotype, mRNA expression, and sex ratios.     To determine the role of androgens in sex determination and differentiation, snapping turtle embryos were treated with the androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the anti-androgen, flutamide, or a vehicle (ethanol) control. Whole mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the effect of the treatments on sex differentiation of the male reproductive tracts.  Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure expression patterns of ovary-specific genes, testis-specific genes and steroidogenic genes in gonads from embryos treated with vehicle, DHT, or flutamide.     I found Cirbp was induced at a high female-producing temperature, but not at a low female-producing temperature. Cirbp is associated with TSD and expression of alternative Cirbp alleles is capable of transducing temperature differently for establishing a signal that directs ovaries versus testes development. I observed allelic specific expression and differences in allele frequencies between turtle embryos from northern and southern Minnesota, suggesting genetic adaptation to local thermal regime. I also found significant genetic associations between Cirbp genotype, Cirbp expression and sexual phenotype in a study that produced mixed sex ratios.     Androgens were capable of inducing ovarian development even at an all-male producing temperature, presumably by inducing aromatase expression and increasing endogenous estrogen production. I also observed among clutch variation in androgen responsiveness to produce females, suggesting there is a genetic basis for the response.    My findings provide the strongest evidence to date for a unique gene involved in TSD.  Additional studies are required to define the functional role of Cirbp in sex determination. Androgens appear critical for ovarian development, but ongoing research is needed to understand androgen signaling and the genetic variation underlying this process.

T1  - The evolution of stress response and complex life history traits in natural populations of garter snakes
AN  - 1270424298
AB  - How an individual responds to environmental stress (temperature changes, toxins) affects how that individual behaves, its ability to reproduce, and its lifespan. We have limited understanding of how stress response is integrated across single genes, proteins, and metabolites; to whole genomes and transcriptomes; and ultimately its effect on whole organism lifetime fitness. Expanding our understanding of the stress response across generations, and placing it in an evolutionary context, is an even more daunting challenge. Yet without an in-depth understanding of the plasticity and evolution of stress responses, we cannot predict how environmental changes will affect species' ability to respond and survive in our dramatically changing world.      The complex molecular network that underlies physiological stress response is comprised of nodes (proteins, metabolites, mRNAs, etc.) whose connections span cells, tissues, and organs. Variable nodes are points in the network upon which natural selection may act. The aim of my dissertation research was to identify variable nodes that will reveal how the molecular stress network may evolve among populations in different habitats, and how the evolution of these stress networks might impact life-history evolution. To address this, I utilize closely related natural populations of garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) that occur in discrete habitats that have enhanced their divergence along the pace-of-life continuum; the slow-living phenotype  has slower growth, smaller reproductive effort per bout, and extended median lifespan relative to the fast-living phenotype. We take a multifaceted molecular approach – cellular physiology, transcriptomics, and genomics – to test whether lab-born juveniles of these divergent phenotypes vary concomitantly at candidate nodes of the stress response network under unstressed and induced-stress conditions. As molecular resources for this species was lacking, I used next-generation sequencing techniques to generate a large-scale multi-organ transcriptome that provided genetic resources necessary for the rest of this research.     I found, in response to heat stress, some measures increased in both life-history phenotypes: plasma corticosterone; gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs); expression of environmental sensing pathways; and gene expression of mitochondrial rRNAs; and State III mitochondrial respiration. These results supported predicted relationships among these traits. As well, the phenotypes diverged at multiple nodes in both unstressed conditions and in their response to stress. Under unstressed conditions the slow-living phenotype had higher expression of the mitochondrial genome, higher State IV mitochondrial respiration, higher circulating levels of reactive oxygen species, lower liver gene expression of a key antioxidant, and higher erythrocyte DNA damage relative to the fast-living phenotype. In response to heat stress the fast-lived phenotype increased its expression of the mitochondrial genome, increased its circulating levels of reactive oxygen species and its DNA damage relative to the slow-living phenotype. Additionally, mitochondrial haplotypes - defined by nonsynonymous changes - were unique to each phenotype suggesting diversifying selection between the phenotypes. These results support the hypothesis that these evolutionarily divergent life-history phenotypes have also diverged in their molecular stress response networks. In addition I identified specific nodes involved in oxidative stress and mitochondrial function at which selection appears to be acting in these divergent life-history phenotypes. More broadly, these results lend further support to the prediction of tightly integrated molecular interactions between stress networks and life-history traits. Finally, this research furthers our understanding of how changing environmental stresses may drive the evolution of molecular networks.

T1  - Thermal Determinants of Nest Site Selection in Loggerhead Sea Turtles, <i>Caretta caretta</i>, at Casey Key, Florida
AN  - 1266847193
AB  - Many environmental cues are thought to influence nest site selection by loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, and much debate exists over the possible influence of sand temperature.  This study had two primary objectives: (1) to measure thermal differences across transects of a major nesting beach of Casey Key (28.7 N, 82.3 W), Florida and (2) to evaluate thermal pattern variation that influenced nesting patterns of adult female loggerhead sea turtles.  A secondary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of infrared thermometers to collect sand surface temperatures in the field.     Temperature data were collected from 145 nest events and 8 false crawls in the 2008 and 2009 nesting seasons.  Infrared thermometers and thermocouple probes were used to obtain surface temperatures from the water, waterline, beach sand, body pit attempts, nest chamber attempts, eggs, and the surface of the gular skin of the nesting female, within the crawl track created by the female and at one meter adjacent to the crawl track (from undisturbed sand).  Weather influences at the time of nesting were recorded, including the presence or absence of rain, wind, or clouds.  Beach slope was measured using an angle locator.     Temperature data from the infrared thermometer and the thermocouple probe were highly correlated, indicating that an infrared thermometer is an effective measurement tool on a nesting beach.  In 2008, there was a significant difference between temperatures collected within the crawl tracks of false crawl events and nest events, indicating a potential for females to use thermal cues in choosing whether to false crawl or nest.  In both nesting seasons, the sand temperature in the body pit and the surface of the gular skin of the nesting female were nearly identical, suggesting females may locate a suitable nest site using their skin temperature.  Data collected at other loggerhead rookeries in the United States and Australia yielded similar results, however, variability in the use of temperature may arise seasonally, and according to different nesting environments.     Rain, wind and cloud cover significantly thermally altered several locations on Casey Key, but it remains unclear if these weather events significant affect turtle nesting behavior.  Additionally, crawl distance and beach slope were significantly, positively correlated.     Gravid females most likely use multiple environmental cues to select a nest site.  Assimilating information from multiple sources allows for the highest degree of adaptability, and future studies should consider implications for climate change and beach renourishment projects.

T1  - Getting to the root of the matter: Grizzly bears and alpine sweetvetch in west-central Alberta, Canada
AN  - 1199556688
AB  - Wildlife habitat selection is influenced by gender, offspring-dependency, resource availability, and spatiotemporal variation in resource nutrition. In consideration of these factors, this thesis examines alpine sweetvetch (Hedysarum alpinum) root and its relationship to grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in west-central Alberta, Canada.    I observed sexually segregated, offspring-dependent functional responses in selection for sweetvetch habitat that was further affected by inter-annual patterns in spring climate (i.e., Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Selection patterns suggested that habitat segregation was due to differences in nutritional requirements between sexes and offspring predation risk. Nutritional analyses of roots indicated that temporal patterns in protein content were influenced by spatial variations in temperature and soil. This spatiotemporal heterogeneity benefits grizzly bears by prolonging the availability of nutritious roots, and may explain why sweetvetch habitats in the mountains were relied upon throughout the spring and how bears could rely on a root digging (habitat) strategy.

T1  - Brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) thermal adaptive potential: Physiological implications for climate change
AN  - 1182844581
AB  - In regard to global warming, coldwater salmonids are becoming more vulnerable as changing thermal conditions threaten the future sustainability of these species. Thermal stress and habitat loss from increasing water temperatures are expected to impact population viability, particularly for inland populations with limited adaptive resources. Although the long-term persistence of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), an archetypal coldwater salmonid, will depend on their ability to cope with and adapt to changing thermal conditions, very little is known about the scope and variation of thermal tolerances within and among brook trout populations and evolutionary lineages. Demonstrating that brook trout from different ancestral thermal environments vary significantly in their ability to tolerate increasing water temperatures, I found that upper thermal tolerance differs among populations and among acclimation treatments. The northernmost brook trout strain (Lake Nipigon) had the lowest thermal tolerance, while the strain with the most southern ancestry (Hill's Lake) had the greatest thermal tolerance. Standard metabolic rate and critical swimming performance varied similarly across acclimation temperatures, peaking at the upper range of a brook trout's preferred temperature range, then decreasing as temperatures reached pejus points. As well, I investigated a potential physiological mechanism underlying intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance via heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsc70). Heat shock proteins were correlated to thermal tolerance; Hsp70 in cardiac and white muscle tissues were linked, while hepatic tissue showed no correlation. I also attempted to establish whether the heat shock response has equable inter-population coping capacity for protein carbonylation incurred through heat shock. Carbonylation of proteins in white muscle and hepatic tissues was suppressed or repaired, suggesting that heat shock proteins were able to adequately cope with increased oxidative damage due to thermal stress. Taken together, these results suggest that populations of brook trout will vary in their ability to cope with a changing climate.

T1  - Inbreeding depression and segregation distortion in Chinook salmon: Conservation implications of genetic load
AN  - 1175870792
AB  - Strong evidence that shows inbreeding in many plants and animals can lead to detrimental effects at the level of the organism as well as the population. Inbreeding and its effects have been the focus of much attention in terms of conservation and captive rearing and breeding programs for many endangered species. Inbreeding depression (ID) is the fitness loss associated with individuals and populations that have experienced inbreeding. Surprisingly, ID studies within salmonids are not extensive. Here, I used inbred offspring of self-fertilized hermaphrodite parents to study the effects of ID in Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at an extreme level of inbreeding. High levels of ID were found after a single generation of self-crossing, resulting in substantial fitness losses. The potential to purge genetic load from a population was shown to take place and the major genetic mechanism driving ID was due to expression of deleterious recessive alleles.

T1  - Preventing predation: Evolution and adaptive plasticity in morphological defense of an invasive species
AN  - 1113339534
AB  - Invasive species are one of the leading threats to global biodiversity, but until recently, little attention has been paid to how evolution contributes to invasive species effects despite important applications to conservation and our general understanding of evolution in the wild. Invasive species often experience strong selection upon introduction, which may result in adaptive evolution that could facilitate their successful integration into food webs and their effects on native species. Recent species invasions in North America offer a strong opportunity to address fundamental questions in evolutionary ecology as well as advance our understanding of invasive species effects.  Bythotrephes longimanus (the spiny water flea) is a predatory zooplankton with a conspicuous tail spine that invaded the Great Lakes region during the 1980s and may be having large negative effects on fisheries. Previous field studies show the morphology and life history of Bythotrephes strongly vary spatially and temporally, but the cause is not known. Evolution by natural selection and phenotypic plasticity are potential sources of  Bythotrephes trait variation, but heretofore, these sources of variation have not been investigated.     My dissertation research investigated ecological and evolutionary factors that influence morphological and life history variation in Bythotrephes . Using Bythotrephes collected from Lake Michigan, I found moderate-to-high genetic variation in distal spine and body length and maternal effects in both traits. Further, experiments revealed that spine length, body size, and clutch size respond plastically to temperature but not to fish predator cues, with higher temperature inducing mothers to have smaller clutches of larger offspring (longer absolute distal spine and body length) that were better defended against predation. Although Bythotrephes  use temperature as the proximate cue of plasticity, it is likely that the trait changes represent adaptations to varying fish predation risk which correlates with water temperature. I also found temporally and spatially variable selection on distal spine length consistent with seasonal changes in gape-limitation of fish predators and spatial heterogeneity of fish, respectively. Yet, despite net selection for increased distal spine length, I observed little evidence of an evolutionary response to selection based on comparisons of historic and contemporary wild-captured individuals and retrieved spines from sediment cores. In a companion study of Canadian Shield lakes, I identified gape-limited fish predators as agents of selection on Bythotrephes  distal spine length. Specifically, I found selection for increased distal spine length in lakes dominated by a gape-limited fish predator and no significant selection in lakes dominated by a non-gape-limited fish predator. A large difference (20%) in average distal spine length between lakes of each predator type was consistent with the direction of selection, suggesting potential local adaptation of distal spine length to gape-limited fish predation.    The results of my dissertation indicate Bythotrephes respond to fish predation through multiple mechanisms, including phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary responses to selection. These responses to predation likely promote Bythotrephes success as an invasive species, and may also underlie negative effects on important Great Lakes fisheries through food web interactions. More generally, the results of my dissertation suggest the effects of invasive species may occur not just through their ecological interactions, but also through evolutionary and phenotypically plastic trait modifications. As invasive species continue to affect biodiversity worldwide, understanding the mechanisms behind invasive species effects is critical.

T1  - Effects of climate change on reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination and potential adaptation via maternal nest-site choice
AN  - 1095700461
AB  - Reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination may be particularly threatened by climate change, as increasing temperatures could lead to skewed sex ratios.  A potential compensatory mechanism is nest-site choice, with females selecting nest sites to match incubation conditions to climatic conditions.  I studied nest-site choice in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) to determine the extent to which behavioral plasticity in nest-site choice can compensate for the effects of climate change.  In a common-garden experiment, gravid females from five populations across the species' range were collected and nest-site choice was compared among populations to evaluate variation in nesting phenology, shade cover over the nest, nest depth, incubation regime, and offspring sex ratio.  Populations differed in nesting phenology and nest depth, but not in shade cover over nests; thus, when exposed to novel climatic conditions, females from transplanted populations chose nest-sites with similar shade cover to those of local females, thereby producing similar offspring sex ratios.  The performance of hatchlings produced in this experiment declined with decreasing mean temperature of the mother's site of origin, and nests with greater variation in daily temperature range produced hatchlings that performed faster and more readily than nests with less variable incubation temperatures.  Therefore, selection of shadier nest-sites may be a mechanism by which female turtles could compensate for climatic warming, and the increase in temperature fluctuations predicted by climate change models may result in the production of faster hatchling turtles with enhanced righting ability.  In an experiment manipulating nest depth, I found that nest depth affected the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuation, but neither mean nest temperature nor sex ratio were affected by depth.  The adjustment in nest depth that would be required to affect sex ratio in this species is biologically unfeasible, and therefore female adjustment of nest depth is unlikely to compensate for climate change.  Finally, I compared used vs. available nesting habitat between a southern and central population of painted turtles.  Compared to the central population, turtles from southern population were more limited in the available range of accessible shade cover under which to nest.  As shade cover is an easily-manipulated feature, land managers can adjust the range of shade cover available to nesting turtles in order to preserve populations in the face of climate change.  Overall, this research is fundamental to understanding processes in evolutionary ecology in general, and to contemporary climate change biology specifically.

T1  - Applied conservation research of the wēkiu bug in Hawai`i: Life table analysis, population genetics, and phylogenetics create a holistic view of a rare and unique species
AN  - 1082294695
AB  - The wekiu bug (Nysius wekiuicola Ashlock and Gagné 1983) is a flightless carnivore endemic to the dormant Mauna Kea volcano, on the Big Island of Hawaii. Wekiu bugs only occur between 3,350m (11,500ft) and the summit at 4,205m (13,796ft) in an environment described as high alpine desert. Remarkably, the main nutrient input to the summit comes from aeolian deposition of arthropods blown in from lower elevations. The wekiu bug's habitat is subject to dramatic temperature extremes, with daily fluctuations in their microhabitat caused by solar daytime heating and rapid evening cooling. The wekiu bug was, until fall 2011, a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Detailed ecological data of the wekiu bug are necessary for informed management decisions.   I briefly present an overview of insect conservation research and the field's current status in Hawaii as a primer to the research conducted for this dissertation. I investigated unknown aspects of the wekiu bug's life history using life table experiments and degree day modeling, showing how the wekiu bug can develop in its harsh natural environment. They have a low reproductive output in captivity, develop most quickly at 30-32°C, exhibit an intrinsic rate of increase (r) of 0.045 in field simulations, and require 622 degree days for one generation. This developmental requirement is only achieved for a maximum of 8.5 hours of solar heating on Mauna Kea. This lab-based study helped explain field observations and trapping patterns. Also, using population genetic analyses of mtDNA haplotype diversity, I describe the potential impacts of habitat disturbance and ecosystem alteration in two distinct populations. Finally, I investigated the evolution of the wekiu bug within the Nysius lineage using DNA sequence from 29 Nysius species. Its closest relatives are seed feeding  Nysius, on Maui and Hawaii islands, and there is considerable taxonomic revision needed in the genus.   In the appendices of this dissertation, I present a pictorial key of the Hawaiian Nysius for identifying the Nysius in Hawaii, and I provide a summary of the technical reports of wekiu bug monitoring from 2005–2011, with maps for resource managers' use.

T1  - Aphid responses to drought: a combined physiological and transcriptomic approach
AN  - 1040574777
AB  - Drought is arguably one the greatest future challenges for agriculture. The response of phloem feeders, such as aphids, to increased drought expected under climate change is still relatively undefined. The effect on aphid feeding of drought stress in plants can be viewed as potentially positive and negative. It is currently accepted that under drought conditions, host plant sieve elements will become more concentrated; hence increases in available amino acid concentrations will potentially benefit aphids. However, the increased need for aphid osmoregulation under drought, to deal with the osmotically challenging diet, may be detrimental to aphid performance. Using the electrical penetration graph technique (EPG), the probing behaviour of two clones of Myzus persicae (O Clone and B Clone), Brevicoryne brassicae, Rhopalosiphum padi and Sitobion avenae on the host plants Brassica nigra and Lolium perenne (respectively), were analysed under a defined drought regime. Drought treatment had a significant effect on the behaviours of all aphid species and clones, except S. avenae. In B. brassicae and B clones of M. persicae, xylem feeding was significantly increased on droughted host plants. Furthermore, both clones of M. persicae and R. padi spent significantly less time ingesting sieve element sap, and more time not probing or in plant pathway activities whilst on droughted host plants. These results suggest that drought stress may cause a reduced palatability of host plants. In addition, fecundity measurements showed that drought resulted in a reduction in aphid reproductive performance in M. persciae (O and B clone), B. brassicae, R. padi and S. avenae. However, fecundity was only significantly reduced in the M. persicae (O clone only), B. brassicae and R. padi. To understand the aphid response to droughted B. nigra at the genetic level, the gene expression of M. persicae exposed to different drought regimes was analysed using microarrays. Gene expression analysis showed up regulation of the osmoregulation associated enzyme, sucrase, as well as the up regulation of other enzymes such as amylases, cytochrome P450s, Heat Shock Proteins, and an aquaporin when exposed to droughted hosts. Furthermore, it was found that the level of drought had a noticeable effect on gene expression in M. persicae, showing aphids have a very adaptable response to drought stress. The combined physiological and transcriptomic approach of this study gives a complementary whole organism assessment of aphid responses to drought. This study has helped to confirm xylem feeding and sugar polymerisation as important mechanisms of aphid osmoregulation, as well as providing support for the hypothesis of water cycling within the body of the aphid. This study has highlighted that aphids respond heterogeneously to water stress, and although it has been possible to identify some general trends, this study has emphasised that the adaptability of aphids to stress is species and even ecotype specific.

T1  - The evolution and genetics of thermal traits in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 1027769155
AB  - Temperature is a critical environmental parameter and thermal variation has significant effects on local adaptation and species distributions in nature. This is especially true for organisms that are isothermal with their environment. Variation in temperature imposes stress and directly influences physiology, behavior, and fitness. Thus, to thrive across a range of thermal environments populations must contain sufficient genetic variation, the capacity to respond plastically, or some combination of both genetic and plastic responses. In this work I first quantified patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation in nature and then dissected the genetic basis of variation in thermal traits. In the first aim I used natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster  collected from a latitudinal transect in Argentina to investigate variation in heat stress resistance and cold plasticity within and among populations. I found heat stress resistance was highly variable within populations, but was strongly associated with the monthly maximum average temperature of each site. For cold plasticity I was able to demonstrate significant variation in plasticity within and among populations, however the among population variation was best explained by the altitude of each site. I hypothesized that this was caused by a difference in temperature fluctuations at high altitude sites relative to low altitude sites. To evaluate this hypothesis I paired our study with existing laboratory data that demonstrated significant fitness differences between high and low plasticity (and altitude) sites when these populations were reared in variable thermal environments. Thus, cold plasticity is an adaptive response to environmental variation. The final project focused on understanding the genetic basis of thermal variation. I fine-mapped a single co-localized heat and cold tolerance QTL via deficiency and mutant complementation mapping to identify four novel thermal candidate genes. There was no overlap of the deficiencies or genes associated with cold or heat stress resistance. Sequence analysis of each gene identified the polymorphisms that differentiate the lines. To test for independent associations between these polymorphisms and variation in nature the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel was used to confirm associations between allelic variation and cold tolerance in nature.

T1  - The influence of oceanographic processes on recruitment and gene flow in the temperate rockfish <i>Sebastes melanops</i>
AN  - 993012604
AB  - Many marine species are typified by a pelagic stage during which tiny larvae develop in the open ocean, where they are subject to high mortality and transport via ocean currents.  For organisms with this life history, the study of their population dynamics is challenging because individuals are not directly traceable. Challenges to the study of population dynamics include the determination of source and sink populations, of connectivity among populations, of the mechanisms that drive the abundance and relatedness of recruits, and of how life-history characteristics mitigate or exacerbate the uncertainty of the ocean environment. My dissertation addressed these challenges in the Pacific black rockfish, Sebastes melanops, using a combination of standardized field sampling, population genetics, and mathematical modeling.  Like other members of the rockfish genus, black rockfish are long-lived fishes that suffered severe declines in the 1980's due to overfishing.  I collected adults from Oregon to British Columbia, and genotyped them at 8 microsatellite markers.  I used isolation by distance theory to estimate the width of the dispersal kernel, as well as compared coalescent-migration matrices with Bayes factors.  My results illustrated that over several generations, gene flow in the population occurred from south-to-north (a bearing in agreement with the direction of currents during the pelagic phase) and the mean dispersal distance (< 50 km) was smaller than might be expected based on an extensive pelagic phase of 60–80 days.  This analysis was extended to examine the source populations for rockfish recruits that were collected between 2005 and 2009 from Barkley Sound (British Columbia), and my results suggested that substantial local recruitment occurred during downwelling regimes that favored the retention of larvae.  However, the number of source populations for larvae was not correlated with the genetic diversity of recruits.  I used cross-correlations to examine the relationships between oceanographic conditions, the abundance of recruits, and the genetic diversity of those recruits.  I found that although there was a strong positive relationship between upwelling and the abundance of recruits, the effective number of breeders that contributed to each cohort was positively correlated with temperature.  Finally, I utilized computer simulations to examine the conflicting predictions for multiple paternity for the effective size of a population (Ne). For long-lived species like rockfish, there were small differences in  Ne between populations with multiple paternity and a monandrous mating systems, indicating that multiple paternity had little effect on the genetic patterns observed in this study. The results of my research can be applied to the conservation and management of this species across the US-Canada border, and may be useful in predicting how this species will respond to climate change.

T1  - Characterization of Disinfectant and Phage Resistance Determinants of <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>
AN  - 921659190
AB  - Environmental contamination of food plays a key role in transmission of Listeria monocytogenes. Adaptations such as ability to grow under refrigeration, biofilm formation, disinfectant resistance, and resistance to phage are crucial to the survival of L. monocytogenes  in the environment. Here we have investigated some of the adaptations that may contribute towards environmental persistence of this pathogen. These include disinfectant (quaternary ammonium compounds, QAC) resistance, temperature-dependent resistance to phage among epidemic clone II strains, triphenylmethane dye reduction and resistance to heavy metals such as cadmium. Using in silico analysis, we have analyzed the prevalence of cadAC efflux systems associated with cadmium resistance among different  Listeria genomes. Of the three distinct cadAC types known to date in L. monocytogenes, two (cadA1C1 and cadA2C2) were harbored by plasmids and were encountered in diverse strains of L. monocytogenes and (in the case of cadA2C2) non-pathogenic Listeria spp. Large plasmids from two different epidemic-associated strains of  L. monocytogenes harbored cadA2C2 together with a drug efflux system (bcrABC), and both determinants were associated with a putative IS1216 transposon. Plasmid-cured derivatives of these strains were susceptible both to cadmium and to BC. Genetic analyses revealed that cadA2C2 was sufficient for restoring resistance to cadmium to a plasmid-cured derivative of L. monocytogenes  H7550. Furthermore, bcrABC was sufficient for restoring resistance to high levels of QAC to the plasmid-cured strain. The transcription of bcrABC was temperature-dependent, with higher transcript levels at 37°C than at 25°C or below. The bcrABC system was encountered among L. monocytogenes strains of different serotypes, origin (environmental or clinical) and genotypes and was detected more frequently in strains harboring the cadmium resistance cassette  cadA2C2 (alone or together with cadA1C1) than in those harboring cadA1C1 alone. bcrABC was found in several different genetic arrangements, mostly on plasmids, but we also identified L. monocytogenes strains in which  bcrABC appeared to have translocated into the chromosome. Transcriptional analysis revealed that transcription of cadA2C2 and  bcrABC was independent, and induced upon exposure to the respective compounds (cadmium and BC, respectively). On the other hand, bcrABC was co-transcribed with the downstream gene tmr, encoding a putative triphenylmethane reductase. We showed that tmr mediated decolorization (reduction) of toxic dyes such as crystal violet (CV) and that CV could also induce bcrABC. Analysis of a panel of strains of diverse serotypes revealed that those harboring  tmr tended to also harbor bcrABC and cadA2C2 (alone or together with cadA1C1), suggesting the presence of a co-selected multi-resistance unit that includes cadA2C2, bcrABC, and tmr. In previous studies, a gene (ORF 2753) was found to be responsible for the ability of L. monocytogenes  epidemic clone II (ECII) to be resistant to phage when propagated at temperatures <25°C. Here we have shown that ORF2753 corresponded to a putative restriction endonuclease that was a component of a type II restriction-modification (RM) system (LmoH1) that is specific for GTATCC (N6/5). This RM system is present on a chromosomal genomic region unique to ECII strains. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the putative restriction endonuclease was expressed significantly more at ≤25°C than at 37°C, potentially accounting for the temperature-dependent phage resistance of ECII strains, while ORF2754 (putative methyltransferase) was expressed at all tested temperatures; this was in agreement with the resistance of the DNA from cells grown at either 25°C or 37°C to BfuI, specific for GTATCC (N6/5). Given that genetic basis for distinct adaptive attributes were elucidated in an outbreak strain (H7550), it would be of further interest to investigate the contribution of these determinants towards virulence of this pathogen. Such details would provide new avenues to control the incidence of listeriosis.

T1  - Evolution of Thermal Tolerance and Mating Systems in Two Intertidal Crustaceans
AN  - 908981530
AB  - Intertidal invertebrates provide a wealth of opportunities for testing hypotheses in evolution and ecology, as the group encompasses a broad variety of body plans, life histories, and ecologies. In this dissertation I address two themes in two different intertidal crustaceans: the evolution of thermal tolerance, and the evolution of animal mating systems. In the first two chapters, I present the results of a series of selection experiments, measuring thermal tolerance and the capacity to evolve increased tolerance in the tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus. A rich history of intertidal ecology on the west coast of North America demonstrates that temperature and desiccation stress play important roles setting species' distributions. In addition, thermal tolerance limits are likely to mediate species' responses to climate change. In the third chapter, I present the first use (to my knowledge) of molecular data to assign paternity in a barnacle (Tetraclita rubescens ), and use these data to describe the species' mating system.   The extent to which acclimation and genetic adaptation might buffer natural populations against climate change is largely unknown. Most models predicting biological responses to environmental change assume that species' climatic envelopes are homogeneous both in space and time. Although recent discussions have questioned this assumption, few empirical studies have characterized intraspecific patterns of genetic variation in traits directly related to environmental tolerance limits. I test the extent of such variation in the broadly distributed tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus using laboratory rearing and selection experiments to quantify thermal tolerance and scope for adaptation in eight populations spanning more than 17° of latitude. Tigriopus californicus exhibit striking local adaptation to temperature, with less than 1 per cent of the total quantitative variance for thermal tolerance partitioned within populations. Moreover, heat-tolerant phenotypes observed in low-latitude populations cannot be achieved in high-latitude populations, either through acclimation or 10 generations of strong selection. Finally, in four populations there was no increase in thermal tolerance between generations 5 and 10 of selection, suggesting that standing variation had already been depleted.   Limits to adaptation often arise from negative pleiotropic effects of alleles under selection. To measure possible costs of thermal tolerance, I measure six fitness-related traits in selected and unselected lines: male size, female size, fecundity, interbrood interval, minimum generation time and starvation resistance. However, there is no evidence for a cost of increased tolerance. Although five out of six of these populations show a response to selection, selected lines actually show an overall increase in male and female body size, fecundity and starvation resistance. The effect of selection on correlated traits also varies significantly by population for three traits, providing evidence that the genetic basis for the response to selection differs among populations.   Plasticity and adaptation appear to have limited capacity to buffer isolated populations of T. californicus against further increases in temperature. However, my results suggest that genetic variation for thermal tolerance within populations is not limited by a linear tradeoff between tolerance and other aspects of fitness. It may instead by limited by forces such as drift, or negative epistatic interactions among thermal tolerance alleles from different populations.   In the third chapter, I use molecular markers to assign paternity to broods of the intertidal barnacle Tetraclita rubescens. I use these data to describe this species' mating system, and factors affecting paternity success. A paired logistic regression shows no effect of body size or male investment on paternity success, while the effect of proximity is highly significant. Tetraclita is capable of siring broods over distances of 11.2 cm, but broods show low rates of multiple paternity, with 75% of broods having only one father, even at high densities. Siring success is evenly distributed among individuals, with a distribution of successes/barnacle at high densities that is not significantly different from the null expectation of equal probability of success among all individuals, and a distribution that was more even than the null expectation at low densities. High rates of single-paternity broods suggest that this species does not compete via sperm displacement and this may explain the lack of any relationship between male investment and paternity success. Furthermore a lack of any skew in the distribution of paternity successes suggests a lack of strong sexual selection on male traits in this species, a fact that is likely driven by the small size of mating groups available to a sessile copulator.

T1  - Effects of genistein on the modulation of stress and immune response in fish
AN  - 907549169
AB  - Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of genistein as a nutraceutical in modulating stress and the immune response in fish, maintained in aquaculture conditions. Two widely aquacultured fish species, tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus) and steelhead salmon (Oncorhynchus mykiss), representing warm water and cool water environments, respectively, were selected for these experiments.  Fish were obtained from certified hatcheries and were acclimated in their respective environments, warm water (24±2°C; 76±4°F) and cool water (17±2°C; 62±4°F), for two weeks prior to the beginning of the experiments. Within each environment, fish were divided into two groups and maintained in two different conditions- controlled and stressed (by crowding; density > 40 g/l).  Within each condition, fish were further divided into two treatments and fed either regular commercial feed or genistein supplemented commercial feed (@400 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Fish were sampled at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and were assessed for physiological (length, weight, condition factor, blood glucose, packed cell volume, plasma protein, spleen somatic index, and heat shock proteins) and immunological parameters (spleen cell proliferation and macrophage respiratory burst activity). In general, fish held in control groups had relatively better growth, physiological state and immune response than stressed fish. Within the controlled or stressed conditions, fish that received genistein supplemented feed did not show any statistically significant improvement (P>0.05) in any of the physiological or immunological parameters. However, some parameters (spleen somatic index and spleen cell proliferation) in the warm water fish (tilapia) did show a pattern of higher activity in the supplemented group. It is possible that fish, being poikilothermic, were not able to digest and/or absorb genistein due to their slow metabolic rate. Also genistein may only act on pathways that are specific for cancer and virus infection rather than general physiological system and immune response. Further research is necessary before making any definite conclusions, on the benefit of genistein in aquaculture.

T1  - Gene Flow and Adaptation in <i>Lonicera Japonica</i>
AN  - 905174499
AB  - Little is known about the genetic and adaptive dynamics of biological invasions. Here I use Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica ), a horticultural vine invading North America, to assess population genetic processes and adaptive change in an invasion. Lonicera japonica  plants from 17 populations in the core of the invaded range (100-150 years old) and 14 populations in the range margin (65 years old or younger) were compared to determine genetic structure at multiple scales, whether divergent evolution has occurred during invasion, and the potential for populations from these sources to invade novel areas.    There was little genetic structure in L. japonica's invaded range. Genetic variation was distributed over short spatial scales, with most variation accounted for within populations and within patches in populations, but not between core and margin regions. Four genetic groups were identified, suggesting multiple introductions, and admixture is ongoing, with 17% of samples of mixed origin. Genetic diversity did not affect patch-level reproduction, but increasing local conspecific cover resulted in more fruit production, indicating the presence of Allee effects. These findings show that human dispersal of invaders can lead to high levels of local genetic variation, which may increase population growth rates and spread in this self-incompatible species.    Adaptive evolution was found within L. japonica's invaded range. After three years growth in core and margin gardens, margin plants had 36% greater biomass and 30% greater survival than core plants, regardless of planting location or genetic group. Margin plants also were larger and had 54% greater survival after two years in gardens beyond the range edge. Size influenced survival, suggesting that margin plants had higher survival because they grew more rapidly. Across latitudes, winter mortality increased with increasing latitude, and core plants had 39% higher winter mortality than margin plants. Increased performance of margin plants indicates that range expansion has selected for plants with greater ability to establish and this reinforces selection by short growing seasons for rapid growth rates at the margin. In total, evolution in margin populations suggests that adaptations promoting colonization can drive invasions and increase the likelihood of further spread, especially as global temperatures increase.

T1  - Projecting the influence of climate change and daily temperature range on insect phenology and risk period of vector borne diseases
AN  - 902631375
AB  - Understanding how climate change would influence the life history and population dynamics of insects is a key component needed to evaluate the impact of climate change on ecological and epidemiological systems, since insects are relatively sensitive to their surrounding environment, especially ambient temperature. Previous research has demonstrated that rising mean temperatures can influence voltinism, geographic distribution, and vectoring capacity. However, the distributional change among life stages for specific climate scenarios, and the importance of the daily temperature range (DTR), or daily temperature fluctuations, has not been emphasized. In this thesis we employed an agroecosystem and an epidemiological system and quantitatively study how changes in daily temperature range, as well as in mean temperature, would shift pest/vector insect phenology.    In the first chapter (chapter II) following the introduction chapter (chapter I), I developed an individual based Monte Carlo simulation method to project grape berry moth (Paralobesia viteana) life history (e.g. number of generations per year, mean and distribution of emergence time for each generation) under two different climate change scenarios, A1fi and B1, which represent upper and lower global warming conditions, respectively. The results showed that under A1fi condition the number of generations per year would increase nonlinearly after an initial lag of approximately 35 years (from 2009), and by the end of this century we might expect almost one more generations per year on average and a 5th generation would be more common. I then further investigated how changes in the daily temperature range would influence degree day accumulation and consequently P. viteana phenology in chapter III. I discovered that mean temperature alone could not sufficiently and accurately compute degree day accumulation, and various daily temperature range conditions substantially influences degree day accumulation. Large changes in daily temperature fluctuations around current climatic conditions were sufficient to allow the voltinism of P. viteana to approach that simulated to occur in at the end of this century. The simulations based on different daily temperature ranges and mean temperature conditions revealed that, even when mean temperature decreased, larger daily temperature ranges could compensate the effect of decreasing mean temperature, resulting in a similar number of generations per year. These results confirmed that daily temperature range should be an important factor in modeling insect phenology and population dynamics.    In chapter IV I considered to an epidemiological system and investigated if degree day models could predict West Nile virus (WNV) incidence dates in Pennsylvania. The original degree days model did not consider a temperature-dependent extrinsic incubation period or longevity changes in vector mosquitoes ( Culex spp.), and did not capture virus transmission period well in four locations (Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Williamsport) in Pennsylvania from 2002 to 2008. By treating decreasing the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) at the beginning of the season, and incorporating adult mosquito longevity a variable as well, model performance was increased significantly. I also demonstrated that mosquito species composition should be an important factor for predicting WNV transmission period. The calibrated models performed well to predict WNV emergence period in Pennsylvania, with a success rate of more than 70% compared to less than 30% in the uncalibrated model. In the successive research in chapter V I demonstrated that mean temperature alone did not provide enough information to compute degree day accumulation and predict disease transmission period well. I quantified WNV transmission period by comprehensively exploring combinations of changing daily temperature range and mean temperature in four locations: Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Williamsport in Pennsylvania. I investigated vector mosquito life history change according to these different climate change conditions. The results again showed that even when the mean temperatures remained the same, a large daily temperature variation results in more degree day accumulation and consequently a longer transmission period. Increasing mean temperature with increasing or decreasing the daily temperature range would yield earlier first incidences and later last incidences. I also demonstrated that increasing daily temperature range would impact disease transmission more dramatically in relatively cooler areas (Williamsport, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh) than relatively warm areas (Philadelphia). These results showed how daily temperature range alters WNV epidemics quantitatively and confirmed that I need to consider daily temperature range in our research in addition to mean temperature.

T1  - Ecological adaptations and transcriptome evolution of the malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>
AN  - 898609137
AB  - Anopheles gambiae has adapted to flourish in spatially diverse ecological conditions, from the humid rainforests to arid Sahel savannas. Within a region, An. gambiae is capable of surviving considerable temporal fluctuations in rainfall and temperature. This extraordinary adaptive flexibility of An. gambiae is largely attributed to complex chromosomal inversion polymorphisms. In addition, An. gambiae is subject to an ongoing incipient speciation process that also appears strongly associated with adaptive phenotypic traits. A long-standing goal is to identify genomic regions/genes/pathways involved in both evolutionary processes.    With the intent of exploring the genetic basis of adaptive phenotypes associated with both the nascent speciation process and chromosomal inversion polymorphisms, we focus on transcriptome evolution because there is increasing empirical support that gene regulation contributes to adaptive/species differences; and the lack of discrete phenotypic differences between M and S precludes using powerful quantitative techniques that require such  a priori information (e.g., QTL mapping). Transcription profiles can unravel phenotypes not readily visible via these approaches, thereby providing novel insights into the divergence.    Chapter 2 reports on the 2La chromosomal inversion, which is strongly linked to degree of aridity in Africa. Gene expression profiles were generated at three time points following acute heat exposure.    In Chapter 3, global oligonucleotide arrays were employed to search for transcriptome variation at key developmental stages most likely associated with the speciation.    Chapter 4 extended the virgin female time point to include six additional time points and corresponding mated females across a two hour window encompassing dusk. Ten candidate genes linked to olfaction were targeted.    Because premating behavioral isolation involves the interaction between trait and preference in different sexes, corresponding reproductively active virgin male global expression was profiled in chapter 5.    Chapter 6 explores the relationship between molecular form transcriptome variation and degree of swarm segregation in nuptial males and females from Mali and Burkina Faso.    Chapter 7 focuses on the ecological segregation between M and S. Specifically, the divergence in larval breeding habitats in southern Cameroon, where M occupies polluted urbanized habitats. Transplantation experiments explored the genetic basis of M form larval tolerance to the environmental stressors in their habitats.

T1  - Melt Generation in Lithologically Heterogeneous Mantle Sources: Theory, Models and Applications to the North Atlantic Large Igneous Province
AN  - 897915869
AB  - The volumes and compositions of basalts generated by adiabatic decompression melting of the Earth’s mantle depend on mantle potential temperature (TP), upwelling rate and the fertility of the mantle source. Identifying the relative importance of these factors for basaltic melt generation in different tectonomagmatic environments requires the application of forward models accounting for melt generation in compositionally and lithologically heterogeneous, upwelling mantle sources. This dissertation addresses this fundamental problem and is organized into two parts. Part I includes the development of a new forward model that incorporates the effects of TP, lithologic heterogeneity and mantle flow on melting in different tectonic environments (Chapter 1), and specifically examines the origins of high productivity magmatism in the North Atlantic large igneous province (NAIP) (Chapter 2). In Chapter 1, I develop the forward polybaric melting model that simulates melting of a source composed of peridotite and pyroxenite by utilizing thermodynamic expressions for polybaric melt productivities for each source constrained by parameterizations of experiment data. Potential temperature, upwelling rate and source composition are linked by thermodynamic relations and fluid dynamics. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to evaluate uncertainties in model input parameters (coefficient of thermal expansion, isobaric specific heat capacity, heats of fusion for peridotite and pyroxenite, and source density) on computed igneous crustal thickness and modeled trace element and radiogenic isotopic compositions of mantle melts. I apply the model to divergent (Iceland) and intraplate (Hawaii) settings. In Chapter 2, I examine in greater detail the factors responsible for mantle melting in the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) and conclude that, while the mantle source was (is) heterogeneous containing  less than 8% pyroxenite, mantle temperatures 85 – 240ºC in excess of ambient mantle are required. These excess potential temperatures contribute to active upwelling, providing the principal mechanisms responsible for the high melt productivity in the region.   Part II focuses on the petrogenesis of the Central East Greenland (CEG) flood basalts, which provide the most complete record of volcanism in the NAIP. Part II includes three chapters (Chapters 3 – 5). Chapter 3 presents new Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb isotope data for CEG plateau lavas and evaluates the effects of secondary alteration on lava compositions. This analysis forms the basis of assessing whether elements are disturbed by alteration and therefore untrustworthy in subsequent considerations of crustal contamination and mantle melting. Chapter 4 examines the role of crustal contamination in space and time within the CEG flood basalt province. Considerations of chemical and isotopic relationships among lavas and regional basement rocks permits identification and quantification of the extent of contamination of magmas by Archean granulite gneiss, Archean amphibolite gneiss, and basement modified by the Caledonian orogeny. These observations are considered in a regional context and related to the magmatic plumbing systems during continental rifting. Chapter 5 establishes the number, petrologic character and petrogenetic origins of the mantle sources sampled by CEG flood volcanism, as well as the conditions governing melt generation beneath the region. The range of uncontaminated lava compositions are shown to be derived from a mantle source containing subduction – modified Archean cratonic lithosphere and Proterozoic – Early Paleozoic mafic crust presumed to be remnants of Iapetus subduction. Forward melting modeling involving this heterogeneous source requires excess TP of up to 240 °C to explain the geochemistry of CEG basalts. Development of such high potential temperatures may be linked to arrival of the ancestral Iceland plume beneath the Pangean supercontinent in early Paleogene time, although parental melts for the CEG basalts appear to have their origin in the Pangean upper mantle.

T1  - Genetic architecture of phenotypic and transcriptional variation in salmon
AN  - 887808907
AB  - Understanding the genetic determinants of phenotypic variation is crucial for a predictive evolutionary theory. Although Fisher's fundamental theorem provides a simple quantitative framework for evolutionary processes, the underlying assumptions regarding the heritability and variability of traits and population structure can diverge from real systems drastically. Therefore, the genetic architecture of traits associated with fitness should be explored to verify the theory's relevance to evolutionary changes and its universality, but this isn't practiced much in natural systems.   Pacific salmon provide an excellent model system to examine genetic architecture and variance structure in and among populations. Here, I analyzed trait inheritance in salmon, and characterized the underlying adaptive significance under different ecological scenarios. Using transcriptional traits, I examined the relationship between plasticity and genetic differentiation shaping salmon populations. I employed common garden rearing and factorial mating designs to evaluate the genetic architecture of traits under physiological stress (i.e. saltwater, temperature and immune) to explore phenotypic variance under different environments.    In Chapter 2, I showed osmoregulation gene transcription diverged after anadromous steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were introduced to a landlocked lake, and non-additive inheritance of traits was common among diverging populations. In Chapter 3, the variation in innate immune response gene transcription was shown to be mediated by non-additive effects in farmed Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and the effect was elevated after the immune stimulation with Vibrio vaccine. In Chapter 4, significant maternal components in traits closely related to fitness confounded the differences observed among populations. Finally, in Chapter 5, I characterized the among-population variance structure associated with individual response to immune stimulation using a multigene microarray approach. Overall, my research suggests that transcription and phenotypic plasticity is different among salmon populations, can rapidly evolve, and that non-additive genetic effects in transcriptional and phenotypic variation is common in salmon.   In general these results are important to question applicability of fundamental theorem for salmon populations, hence conservational strategies based on evolutionary concerns. Furthermore, it presents a framework of population differentiation in salmon based on modifications to physiological response. These two combined would help us to unravel how salmon populations are structured in space and time.

T1  - Molecular evolution and thermal adaptation
AN  - 879084402
AB  - In this thesis, we address problems in molecular evolution, thermal adaptation, and the kinetics of adaptation of bacteria and viruses to elevated environmental temperatures. We use a nearly neutral fitness model where the replication speed of an organism is proportional to the copy number of folded proteins. Our model reproduces the distribution of stabilities of natural proteins in excellent agreement with experiment. We find that species with high mutation rates tend to have less stable proteins compared to species with low mutation rate.   We found that a broad distribution of protein stabilities observed in the model and in experiment is the key determinant of thermal response for viruses and bacteria. Our results explain most of the earlier experimental observations: striking asymmetry of thermal response curves, the absence of evolutionary trade-off which was expected but not found in experiments, correlation between denaturation temperature for several protein families and the Optimal Growth Temperature (OGT) of their carrier organisms, and proximity of bacterial or viral OGTs to their evolutionary temperatures. Our theory quantitatively and with high accuracy described thermal response curves for 35 bacterial species.   The model also addresses the key to adaptation is in weak-link genes (WLG), which encode least thermodynamically stable essential proteins in the proteome. We observe, as in experiment, a two-stage adaptation process. The first stage is a Luria-Delbruck type of selection, whereby rare WLG alleles, whose proteins are more stable than WLG proteins of the majority of the population (either due to standing genetic variation or due to an early acquired mutation), rapidly rise to fixation. The second stage constitutes subsequent slow accumulation of mutations in an adapted population. As adaptation progresses, selection regime changes from positive to neutral: Selection coefficient of beneficial mutations scales as a negative power of number of generations. Diversity plays an important role in thermal adaptation: While monoclonal strains adapt via acquisition and rapid fixation of new early mutations, wild population adapt via standing genetic variations, and they are more robust against thermal shocks due to greater diversity within the initial population.

T1  - Genetic, individual, and group facilitation of disease resistance in honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) and two species of paper wasps (<i>Polistes dominulus</i> and <i>P. Fuscatus</i>)
AN  - 879049155
AB  - Social insects are remarkable for their extreme form of group living. This includes a reproductive division of labor, overlap of generations, and cooperative care for the brood. The global success of social insects suggests that the benefits of eusociality outweigh its costs. In this dissertation, I investigated how three species of social insects resist disease at multiple levels of biological organization. My co-authors and I first present a comprehensive review of what is known about how social insects resist disease, scaling up from genes to proteins and cells, to individual behavior to groups and populations. Next, I provide the first critical test of the 'haploid susceptibility hypothesis' using naturally occurring genetic misfits in Polistes dominulus populations. This hypothesis assumes that males are likely to have fewer disease resistance alleles than females in haplodiploid species, and that this disparity has shaped the evolution of social behavior. My co-authors and I show that this hypothesis is not a significant contributor to the evolution of social behavior in P. dominulus. Instead, I note strong ecological influences on immune function, including temporal-, sex-, and caste-related factors. Time of emergence and behavioral role are the best predictors of immune function in Polistes. I then scale up from individual genetics in paper wasps to group genetics in honey bee hives. Interestingly, phenoloxidase activity and encapsulation response are not influenced by colony-level genetic diversity. Therefore, the mechanistic explanation linking genetic diversity to prior observations of increased disease resistance in genetically diverse colonies remains elusive. A main theme throughout this work is the use of empirical methods to quantify invertebrate immune function. I report results from a set of experiments, performed with my co-authors, demonstrating the applicability of a novel method for assaying the invertebrate encapsulation response. This method uses a nylon monofilament coated with pathogen-associated membrane patterns (PAMPs). These implants, termed "PAMPlants", now allow researchers to investigate questions relating to how invertebrates mount an immune response against different classes of microbes. Following this, I then report results from experiments documenting how cellular and humoral immune function develops with honey bee ontogeny. I draw conclusions within the context of behavioral differences between life stages, and also differences in pathogen pressure across these stages. The final data chapter investigates a possible immune mechanism for the noted success of the P. dominulus invasion into North America from Europe and Northern Africa. My co-author and I compared multiple measures of immune function between P. dominulus and its sympatric, native congener P. fuscatus. Surprisingly,  P. dominulus had lower immune function than P. fuscatus. I interpret these results within the context of the enemy-release hypothesis as a putative explanation for the success of this non-native population. My results present a comprehensive report of immune function in three species of social insects, and provide important insights into past, present, and future methods for testing immune function in these truly remarkable beasts.

T1  - Intra-specific variation across a small temperature difference in the spider <i>Rabidosa rabida</i> (Araneae: Lycosidae) from the mountians in Arkansas
AN  - 873451663
AB  - Temperature affects all levels of biological organization and ultimately affects multiple aspects of ecological performance and fitness. Generalist arthropod predators are ectothermic and are strongly affected by temperature in ways that are not fully understood. Descriptions of thermal ecology of important generalist arthropod predators are, therefore, essential pieces of information for studying ecology in changing thermal environments.  Rabidosa rabida is a wolf spider that inhabits much of the eastern United States and plays an important role as a generalist predator of large herbivorous arthropods. This study makes the first description of the thermal ecology of R. rabida. A description of intra-specific variation in this spider and applications of this data to habitat selection for this generalist arthropod predator are also made.   Descriptions of thermal preference, critical thermal maxima, and locomotor performance were made for spiders collected at four locations in the mountains of Arkansas which differed by less than three degrees. Comparisons of thermal ecology and other ecologically significant thermal performance measures, such as predation and immunity, were made between these populations to determine if intra-specific variation could be described and if small temperature differences would result in measureable differences in thermal response. Estimates of heritability were also made for size, sprint speed, and immunity measures to determine if variation found could be attributed to genetic factors or if environmental factors such as temperature could explain any variation observed.    Carapace length differed between spiders from different mountains with spiders from Mt. Magazine having a greater CL. Body mass also differed between sexes and between spiders from different elevations with females and spiders from low elevation showing the greater body mass. Rabidosa rabida  was found to have an acute thermal preference of 32.0 ± 0.011°C. Thermal preference differed between spiders from different mountains. The critical thermal maximum was estimated to be 43.52 ± 0.105°C. Thermal limits did not differ between mountain or elevation groups. Sprint speed was significantly affected by temperature and differed between spiders from different elevations with spiders from higher elevations showing a greater mean sprint speed. Comparisons with characteristics of insects using various thermal strategies showed that R. rabida is a thermal conformer and thermal generalist with moderate thermal sensitivity. Thermal sensitivity, which did not significantly differ between 5° intervals, was greatest at the thermal extremes and between 25° and 30°C for all but male spiders. Measures of prey capture showed an apparent increase in prey capture as temperature increased but the ability for statistical interpretation was limited. Immunity showed limited variation between spiders and no significant differences between spiders from different elevations or mountains. Heritability estimates for size, sprint speed, and immunity measures were low and not significantly different from zero.   This first description of the thermal ecology and thermal performance in this large non web building spider gives insights into the thermal habitat selection of this animal. This spider showed a thermal preference suggesting that it can detect temperature differences and actively chooses to occupy one temperature over another. Thermal performance tests show that as temperature increases performance also increases. Survival may be negatively influenced by warmer temperatures especially during early instars and molting. The thermal sensitivity of this spider showed an apparent increase in the temperatures between 25° and 30°C which would suggest that if all other factors were the same then this spider should choose to inhabit temperatures in the low thirties similar to its thermal preference. In the field these spiders are found actively hunting in the low vegetation at night when temperatures are dropping from the 30°'s into the 20°'s and in an area where wind would have negative effects on body temperature and hydration. This suggests that other factors such as inter-specific interactions influence habitat choice in this spider.

T1  - Quantitative trait evolution in a changing environment in a seed beetle
AN  - 2031429322
AB  - During the last decades the climate has been changing more rapidly than in the preceding periods. This is for instance characterized by an increase in temperature. Interestingly, such changes in the environment are not necessarily constant over time as they often show high levels of fluctuation. Organisms are exposed to these changes and respond to them and a recent theoretical model predicts that fluctuations in the environment are important for populations’ response to climate change. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how populations respond to a changing environment, including fluctuations. My thesis is based on the previously mentioned theoretical model and I used a suite of laboratory experiments on the seed beetle Callsosobruchus maculatus, to test the model predictions in a quantitative genetic framework. First, I assessed the genetic architecture of several life history and morphological traits in order to verify that there is sufficient additive genetic variation for the population to respond to changes in the environment. Second, I tested the detailed model predictions explicitly, by investigating whether different types of environmental fluctuations matter for a population’s response. Third, I investigated changes in quantitative genetic variation after i) a rapid shift in temperature and ii) long term selection under increasing temperature including fluctuations. Fourth, I concentrated on sex differences in response to temperature, and finally, I assessed the relative importance of genetic and nongenetic inheritance for traits that differ in their plastic response to a change in the environment. I found that environmental fluctuations are highly important for a population’s response to environmental change. I could detect changes in a set of quantitative genetic parameters, suggesting that a population’s potential to respond to selection, environmental sensitivity and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity are affected by the selective past. I also found that sexes differ in additive genetic variation and plasticity and that parental effects may play an important role in the evolutionary process. Therefore, future studies would benefit greatly from considering details of the selective past and especially environmental fluctuations during attempts to predict how populations respond to a changing environment, particularly with regards to climate change.

T1  - Research of a predictive model of thickness of ring formation in oxidized pellet rotary kiln
AN  - 1874958695
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorWith the rapid development of steel industry in China, the demand of oxidized pellets grows rapidly. But the traditional pellet process - shaft furnace has the shortage of small yield productivity and poor adaptability of raw materials, which cannot meet the growing demand of blast furnace charge. Meanwhile, roasting machine belt needs high temperature resistant alloy steel, which means the process is unable widely to promote temporarily in China. Therefore, to develop the grate-kiln process with mature technology, high production and strong adaptability of raw materials, appears especially important. But the process has a problem of ring formation which brings great trouble to improve the production and quality of pellets. So it has very important practical significance to build a predictive model of ring formation to predict the ring forming behavior in oxidized pellet kiln, and to know the real-time influence of the site operation parameters on ring formation. It has important meaning to guide the instant operation on ring formation. A heat transfer model of rotary kiln was built in this paper which based on the cylinder of the heat conduction differential equation after analyzing the heat transfer process inside the oxidized pellets kiln. And the boundary conditions were established. The thermal physical properties of ring materials were researched for the first time, and the result showed that the thermal conductivity of ring object decreases with the increasing temperature. It provided reference for the subsequent mathematical simulation of oxidized pellet kiln. Based on the correspondence between the kiln outer wall temperature and ring formation, and combined with kiln shell heat transfer model, a model of thickness of ring formation in rotary kiln was built based on certain assumptions. The model was verified correct by comparing the simulation results with site testing results. Simulation software MATLAB was used to program the thickness model of ring formation. The simulation results showed the temperature distribution along the axis of inner wall, and the thickness distribution of ring formation in different position of the rotary kiln. The calculated results of model were showed by graphical display based on the powerful graphics capabilities of MATLAB. Also a GUI of the model was designed which allowed site operators to analyze the producing process conveniently by using the simulation results of the model. The growth rate of ring was analyzed and calculated by historical temperature data. And the rate was used to predict the growth situation of ring. The MATLAB simulation results showed that the ring formation had a linear growth, which was used to predict the growth time of ring. Comparing with historical data, the predictive results were verified correct, so that it provided basis for ring forming prediction, and achieved early warning as to achieve stable operation of site

AN  - 1874928996
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorEnergy is an essential material basis for human survival and development. Over the entire history of mankind, each and every significant step in the progress of human civilization has been accompanied by energy innovations and substitutions. The development and utilization of energy has enormously boosted the development of the world economy and human society. China has set the goal of building a resource-conserving, environment-friendly society, and is endeavoring to coordinate energy development with environmental protection. It endeavors to make the two promote each other for sustainable development. Into the 21st century, China's PV market began to develop relatively fast driven by the government, and a lot of national plans have been implemented, such as the "Power Supply Project for Un-electrified Counties in Tibet", "China Brightness Program", "Brightness Program in Ali District, Tibet", "Township Electrification Program" and "non-electric power construction in the region", and etc. During the period from 9th "Five-Year Plan" to "11th "Five-Year Plan", several demonstration projects have been carried out, such as urban grid-connected photovoltaic power generation and large-scale desert plant grid integration. Light and heat resources in Wuwei is rich in solar radiation intensity, long sunshine hours, annual sunshine hours in 2570-3030.With the use of regional advantages, Wuwei get the big development in the solar in recent years. In December 2008, Wuwei and Da Tang jointly take the construction of the 11th"Five-Year Plan" National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program), which named MW-class desert grid a 0.5-megawatt photovoltaic power plant has been built to the grid. At present, Hua Dian, CECEP, Gansu Power Investment Group each began a 10-megawatt photovoltaic power generation project. License tenders in Liangzhou about 20 MW is under construction. Planning by 2015, solar photovoltaic power generation capacity will reach 1000 MW. The incentive policies of China's PV market mostly are subsidy policy. The initial PV market in China is the independent PV power in the area without electricity, built fully by the state investment; but because of the high cost of PV power generation and the lack of long-term incentive policies for the market, then the PV market is at a standstill, and even the "Renewable Energy Law" implemented since 2006 also failed to promote the formation of the Chinese PV market. In 2009, China began to implement the "solar BIPV demonstration projects" and "Golden sun demonstration projects," providing subsidies for the PV power generation system, officially launched the Chinese PV market. With the rapid development of solar energy industry, Wuwei uses its advantages in all aspects of solar energy, which will usher in new prosperity and

T1  - Establishment and main biological characterization of gynogenetic grass carp population
AN  - 1874898407
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe grass carp is one of an important fish cultured in china. However, farmed grass carp are readily susceptible to various kinds of diseases that cause high percentages of morbidity and mortality, leading to greatly reduced yields. Gynogenesis is considered to be an efficient way to rapidly establish pure line. Gynogenesis, in combination with selective breeding, has been suggested as a shortcut to produce clonal fish lines with desired characteristics, such as higher growth rates and disease resistance.The establishment of pure all-female groups of meiotic gynogenetic (meiG) and mitotic gynogenetic (mitG) grass carp should be a valuable contribution to both fish genetics and grass carp breeding. Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) eggs were first activated by UV-irradiated diploid sperm of allotetraploid hybrids derived from red crucian carp (♀) × common carp (♂) and then duplicated by temperature shock (cold shock or heat shock). Different shock initiation time resulted in two types of diploid gynogenetic grass carp: meiG and mitG. The fertilization rate,hatching rate and survival rate of both gynogenetic fish was highly improved after optimizing gynogenetic technique. Over a five year period, a total of 17,170 meiG and 1,080 mitG fry were produced and 6,862 meiG and 372 mitG grass carp survived. Now two groups of gynogenetic fish in large scale had been successfully established. The main biological characteristics of gynogenetic grass carp were studied, and their growth, development process of their gonad were seriously observed for several years. The major results are as follows: 1. UV-irradiated diploid sperm of allotetraploid hybrids derived from red crucian carp (♀) × common carp (♂) was first used for inducing gynogenesis in grass carp and showed high efficiency. The protocols for eggs duplication were optimized and high survival rate of both meitG and mitG were obtained. Over a five year period, both meiG and mitG group were successfully established in large scale. 2. The observation of early embryo development confirmed that haploid embryos with haploid symptoms were inviable, while diploid gynogenetic grass carp embryos possess of natural embryo development stages and morphological characteristics as normal diploids. Incubating time was influenced by hatching temperature. On the other hand, water dissolved oxygen affecting the hatching rate and survival rate of gynogenetic fish directly. 3. Gynogenetic grass carp had identical morphological characteristics as common grass carp. The size and morphological traits of red blood cells also similar in gynogenetic fish and common grass carp, which indicating that the gynogenetic fish were diploids same as common grass carp. It was confirmed by further chromosome examination of embryos and young gynogenetic fish. 4. Microsatellite DNA analysis indicated that the genome of gynogenetic fish were not contaminated by paternal genome, the genetic purity of mitG grass carp was higher than that of meiG grass carp, and both of which were significantly increased over that of common grass carp after one generation of gynogenesis. A special SCAR marker was successfully transferred from RAPD marker, which could be used for identify gynogenetic grass carp from common carp. 5. The growth rate polarized distinctively in gynogenetic grass carp group after 5 years track. Gonads observation showed that both meiG and mitG grass carp groups were 100% female and 88% of these showed normal ovary development. Thus, the sex determination mechanism in female grass carp was homogamety. The all-female gynogenesis larvae of grass carp were fed with food containing 17α-methyltes tosterone for 4 months. The histological observation results indicating that the inducing of sex-revesal may success. 6. A Foxl2 cDNA was cloned from meiG ovary by RT-PCR and subsequent RACE. Alignment of known Foxl2 sequences from vertebrates confirmed the conservation of the Foxl2. RT-PCR revealed that Foxl2 is expressed in the grass carp brain (B), pituitary (P), gill, and gonads (G), reflecting the involvement of Foxl2 in B-P-G axis. Large-scale scan in gynogenetic fish and common grass carp showed that the Foxl2 only express in ovary while not express in testis, which revealed en evident sexual dimorphic expression pattern in the gonads. This traits could be used for identify the sex of grass carp from molecular level. 7. The complete mitochondrial genomes of gynogenetic grass carp was successfully sequenced and analyzed. The results indicated that gynogenetic grass carp obeys the maternal inheritance rule, and the inheritance structure of their mitochondrial DNA is identical to that of common grass

T1  - On study of the mechantronic dynamic model in constant current saw and the mechanism of arc stability
AN  - 1873882998
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorSubmerged arc welding (SAW) is a popular welding method used in many industrial fields because it has the property of high productivity. The technique of multi-electrode welding, or multi-wire welding, is commonly used in submerged welding processing. Multi-electrode welding can also be classified into two groups, single-power-supplied (SPS) multi-electrode welding and multi-power-supplied (MPS) multi-electrode welding. In SPS multi electrode welding system, the heat supplied from one single power, the total heat input being limited in a definite value, wires are used for heat distribution in welding processing. In MPS multi-electrode system, two or more welding arcs burning in one molten pool, the heat input is several times of single power supply. It greatly incases the welding productive because the amount of melting metal in a unit time is increased. In this paper, we refer to this kind of welding scheme as multi-electrode welding. In recent years, a new type of electronic controlled welding power supplies, switch-mode welding power is emerged and used in industrial field. The output character of this power can be well controlled ether in constant voltage (CV) mode or in constant current mode (CC). The dynamic model and the stability of welding arc under this power supply in submerged arc welding are studied in this paper. Generally, a submerged welding system consists of three parts, a power supply for heat input, a bogie for welding speed control, and a control unit for welding arc adjusting. In the welding processing, wire is burned in the arc, and is sent into the arc by the wire feeder at same time. A smooth welding seam could be obtained only if a balance were reached between the speed of wire burning and the speed of wire sending. In the period of arc initiation, a transient is existed from the time of arc igniting to the time of arc stable. Taking welding arc voltage as major a parameter, cooperated with power supply and wire feeder, an electron-mechanical dynamic model of submerged arc welding in constant current condition is established. Under this model, the balance relationship between wire burning and wire sending is depicted. A compound time constant, which is derived from control circuit, wire feeder, and welding arc, is obtained. It is the theoretical foundation for the further designing of numerical controller. The stability of the system is analyzed in S domain through Lap lace's transformation. Due to the defference of electronic poles in defferent power supplies and the electron-magnetic interference (EMI) in multi-electrode system, the isolation schemes among powers and the coordination method among arcs become the major problems which need to be solved in multi-electrode welding. According to the character and request above, optical isolation technique is used for the transmission of signals or instructions among equipments besides the traditional relay- and transformer-isolation schemes. The ability of anti-EMI of the system is increased. And it also enhances the adaptability and reduces the bulk of the system. Furthermore, the trend today goes towards numerical equipments in mechanical field. A task/job/procedure program structure for several devices working coordinately is reported in the paper. Under this structure, the method of numerical synchronization for several devices becomes easy and clear. Based on the theory, a module structured multi-electrode welding coordinate control circuit, which is placed on a 20cm*30cm printed circuit board (PCB), is designed. Two DC-DC converters, which derived from Buck converter but power ground and gate drive signals ground are common earthed, are designed on it. One is designed for the bogie speed control, and another is for the balance of welding arc and wire feeder control. The principle of a pulse width modulation (PWM) generator and its adjusting method based on integrated circuit SG3525 is reported. The method of the parameters selection of operation amplifier, estimate and design of time constant, are reported as well. Some of the specific questions, such as the method of series connection of several sub-systems, soft start, over current protection, and the prevention of wire inserting into the molten pool during wind up are discussed. According to the experimental results, the welding speeds reached to 1.4-2.0(m/min.) in double-wire welding, and to 2.5-2.8(m/min.) in three-wire welding. The results tally with the theoretical analysis, as well as the reported results in some related

T1  - Growth release determination and interpretation of korean pine in heilongjiang province, china
AN  - 1873856743
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorMixed broadleaf - Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forests are a major ecosystem of the Xiaoxing'an Mountains of northeast China. It is critical to better understand the disturbance regimes and growth dynamics of the main conifer species in these forests, especially in the context of global climate change. The objective of this study was to investigate timing of tree recruitment and forest gap formation using growth releases recorded in tree-ring series of Korean pine, and their responses to annual variation in temperature and precipitation. We sampled trees from three randomly selected stands in the experimental areas of three geographical positions different National Nature Reserve, which are respectively sitting in the most northern, central and southern border of the Heilongjiang Province. All Korean pine trees with diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm in each plot were mapped and increment cores collected from each. All cores were dendrochronologically crossdated with a locally developed chronology and ring widths measured to the nearest 0.001 mm. After measuring, growth release events on each series were determined using the boundary line release criteria, which formulated according to the relationship between percent growth change and prior growth. The results showed that: due to the influence of the prior growth, percent growth change curves of each series were much stronger consistent than tree-ring widths curves. The peaks or valleys of the tree-ring widths curves were differ as peaks or valleys of the corresponding values of the percent growth change curves. In Heihe, almost all Korean pine series had more than one growth release event, with 2.75 average growth releases per tree, and 87.5% of the Korean pine series had at least one major release. The release events happened mainly in the year of the 1930-1960 and 1970-1990, which were coincided with the tree-ring widths changes. The main release periods of Mudanjiang were 1915-1940, 1960-1970 and 1990-2003, with 2.07 average growth releases per tree, and 82.8% of the Korean pine series had at least one major release. Samples collected from Yichun, no matter the total peak number, the peak number which reached the release boundaries or the release event numbers (last 5 or more than 5 years) are all slightly more than the number of the first two sampling points. Displayed in 297 total peaks, with 117 reached the release boundaries standard and 90 formed the release events (33 major releases and 57 moderate). 1910-1950 is the most significant release events period of the Yichun Korean pine, appeared 13 major releases and 23 moderate releases in total 25 samples. In addition, a more significant release period is 1840-1880, totally appeared 22 release events. 1960-1970 and 1980-1990 relatively less release events (7 and 9), but still occupied considerable proportions in the total release events number. Spatial distribution patterns of Korean pine trees indicated that forest gap opening due to a variety of mortality factors is likely the main reason for some tree growth releases in Heihe and Yichun, but not Mudangjiang. A comparison analysis between the percent tree growth and climate changes showed that the local temperature and precipitation could be another important factor causing growth releases for the three points, especially for growth releases that occurred synchronously between

T1  - Cold-adapted bacterium and winter wheat combined remediation of oil-polluted soil
AN  - 1870356283
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe traditional methods to treat oil polluted soils are expensive, and easily cause a large secondary pollution, while the existing single phytoremediation and microbial remediation both exist certain limitations, thus, as an environmental friendly method, it has important theoretical and practical significance on the use of plant - microbial combined remediation of oil contaminated soils. In order to explore the feasibility of the combined remediation of petroleum contaminated soil, this study focused on the combined remediation of petroleum contaminated soil by degrading bacterial and the winter wheat through indoor experiments and a field simulation trial, and to explore the optimum conditions of the combined remediation, the greenhouse pots experiments were conducted. Through indoor experiments, the effect of petroleum contaminated soil on growth of the winter wheat, degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon by the winter wheat and the degrading bacterial, and changes of catalase activity with time were studied. The results showed that, the winter wheat promoted the degradation of petroleum by the microorganisms. After combined remediation, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) disappeared from the rhizosphere soil faster than the non-rhizophere soil. The catalase activity increased after the combined remediation and there was positive relation between the catalase activity and the TPH removal. The combined remediation of oil-polluted soil by cold-adapted bacterial and winter wheat was studied in a field simulation trial, and the variation of the soil microbes, catalase activity, dehydrogenase activity were studied here. The results showed that, 73.29% and 55.26% of spiked petroleum hydrocarbons disappeared from the rhizosphere soil and non-rhizophere soil respectively. Since the over wintering stage, the degradation rate of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil is increasing, decreased in the ripe stage. And there were positive correlations among catalase activity,dehydrogenase activety,microbial counts and the degration efficiency of petroleum hydrocarbons. Studies have shown that the combined remediation technique of the oil polluted soil by winter wheat and cold-adapted baterial was effective and could be applied at room temperature and low temperature in situ remediation. Through greenhouse pots experiments, an orthogonal test method was employed here to study the optimum degration conditions of fixed degrading bacterial and the winter wheat. This orthogonal experiment selected four influencing factors: oil content, amount of bacteria, soil water content and fertilizer. The results showed that in different stages, the optimum degration conditions were different. Oil content and the amount of bacterial were the two biggest factors that influenced the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. The impact of fertilizers on the degradation rate increased with time, and water content on the degradation rate decreased with

Determination of metal elements in environmental samples with Atomic Spectrum has been a very excellent analytical method. However, many analytical workers pay more attention to sample on-line, miniature apparatus and environment-friendly in actual works. In the article the experimental apparatus were set up ; the design theory was discussed ; the effect of detecting conditions were studied; the sample pretreatment techniques were investigated and analytical methods were developed. In the chapter one, the various vapor sampling techniques that applied to AS including cold vapor generation(CVG), hydride generation(HG) and volatilization generation were introduced firstly. Then, the atomic mechanism of chemical hydride generation(CHG)/ECHG, possible interferences and eliminations, the design of electrolysis cell, the choice of electrode material and electrolyte, etc. were discussed. Finally, the improvement and application of CHG/ECHG technique in AS were described. In the chapter two, a novel miniature CVG-AFS system was developed using amorphous Teflon AF-2400 tube as the gas-liquid separator and detection cell for the determination of Hg in tobacco, based on the Teflon AF-2400 tube's excellent gas transport behavior and high UV transparence. At the same time, the mechanization of design and gas permeation were discussed in detail. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limit was 0.02 μg/L, and relative standard deviation ( RSD ) was 3.3% for eleven consecutive measurements of 0.50 μg/L Hg standard solution. The novel system showed the advantages of micro-scale, low sample consumption and high sensitivity. The method had been successfully used in the determination of Hg in tobacco sample with recoveries of 97% 102%. In the chapter three, solid polymer electrolyte hydride generation technology (SPE-HG) for metal elements determination was first applied in AS analysis. A new SPE-HG cell, mainly composed of three components was laboratory manufactured and employed for detecting As in tobacco samples by coupling to AFS. A corrosion- resisting Ti mesh modified by Ir was chosen as anode material which could lengthen the cell's using life; high porous graphite felt with high hydrogen overvoltage was used as cathode, which enhanced the productivity of AsH3; Nafion®117 membrane as the ion exchange membrane and close contaction between electrodes with membrane reduced the power efficiency. Water as an alternative anolyte was first used in the SPE-HG cell. The entire arrangement was fastened with four clamps of C type at four different directions. So the new system has advangtages of low-cost, long-life, easy-assembly and environment friendly. It was successful to detect As in tobacco by coupling the new cell to Atomic Fluorescence Spectrum with high

T1  - Ecology and life history of a deepwater notothenid, dissostichus eleginoides smitt 1989, around the falkland islands, sw atlantic ocean
AN  - 1779949122
AB  - The aim of this research was to gain a better understanding of the ecology and life history of the deepwater notothenid, Dissostichus eleginoides, on the Patagonian Shelf. Archival tagging revealed strong site fidelity of adult toothfish with the majority of fish remaining within 50km of release. Furthermore depth data revealed three behavioural patterns showing feeding, seasonal and spawning activities. The trophic ecology of five notothenioids was studied, examining resource utilisation and niche separation on the Falkland’s shelf. Spatial, ontogenic and seasonal variations in the parasite fauna for juvenile D. eleginoides are described and potential species for use as biological tags to study toothfish population structure are suggested. Validated age readings gave maximum estimated ages of 35 (L = 214.3cm) and 26 years (L = 126.3cm) for females and males respectively and reasons for this sexual dimorphism are discussed. Comparisons of otolith transition zones and growth rates from different regions shows toothfish have adapted their life history traits dependant on their environmental and hydrological surroundings, with populations in warmer areas growing quicker than those in cooler waters. Reproduction in toothfish is discontinuous and group synchronous and final spawning was found to occur in batches. Toothfish predominantly spawn only in one region around the Falklands, on the Burdwood Bank, mainly during July/August. Evidence of skipped spawning was identified indicating that not all fish spawn annually and this aspect is discussed in terms of body condition, periodic strong recruitment and the lack of large scale migrations of adult toothfish. Toothfish around the Falklands have a higher fecundity compared to other regions, a potential adaption to living north of the polar front. This new information on age, growth, reproduction and movements of toothfish, combined with its role in the Patagonian shelf and slope ecosystems, is vital for accurate stock assessment and hence sustainable fisheries management.

T1  - Integrated assessment of sustainable biogas technology options
AN  - 1564435102
AB  - In the last 5 years the number of biogas plants in Germany has increased by about 90% (2,300 plants) at an average capacity of 500KWel.  In 2009, biogas plants, with installed capacity of approximately 1,900 MWel supplied about 110 TWh (>1.6% electricity of demand). Biogas utilisation also accounted for reductions of about 5.54 and 1.01-1.34 million tonnes of CO2 associated with electricity and heat generation, respectively.  The quoted figures correspond to utilisation of just 10% of the inherent potential.
  Biogas is arguably a more versatile renewable energy source (cf. wind and solar energy), due to its determinate energy value and ease of storage.  It can be used directly for heat and electricity generation, and as substitute for natural gas and other fossil fuel applications, while utilisation of the digestate as fertiliser can reduce mineral fertilizer inputs to further mitigate GHG emissions.  The aim of this study was to carry out An Integrated Assessment of Sustainable Biogas Technology Options, from feedstock supply logistics to energy utility (electricity and heat), and the utilization/disposal of the spent digestate.  The specific objectives were: (i) To assess the prospects for expanded utilization of biogas in Germany; (ii) To evaluate the energy efficiency of various biogas production and utilization pathways; and (iii) To determine the environmental impacts of biogas deployment by Life Cycle Assessment of multiple production and utilization pathways.  The associated analyses were conducted for defined case scenarios for single feedstock digestion and multiple feedstock co-digestion in small-scale (<500 kWel) and large-scale (≥500kWel) biogas plants, coupled with selected biogas utilization pathways, and digestate management strategies.

T1  - Heterogeneous gold, palladium and copper based catalysts for liquid phase oxidation of methane.
AN  - 1535004864
AB  - The direct liquid phase oxidation of methane at relatively mild reaction conditions over Au based supported catalysts is discussed. The hydrogen peroxide was used as oxidant and it was introduced either as a co-reactant or by generating in-situ using H2 and O2 gases. Au-Pd supported nanoparticles was shown to capable in oxidising methane giving high selectivity to methanol especially in the reaction carried out with hydrogen peroxide generated using in-situ approach. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts were found to be dependent on the reaction conditions employed. Factors such as oxidant concentration, temperature, reaction time, methane pressure, catalyst mass had significant effects on the catalyst activity and selectivity. A synergistic effect of Au and Pd was observed in these studies. The Au-Pd catalyst with the presence of PdO (Pd2+) on the surface having bigger particle size was preferred than smaller particles with the presence of palladium in metallic state. Modification of the catalyst has been carried out by depositing copper on Au-Pd supported on TiO2 and in this way the oxygenate productivity and methanol selectivity was improved. It was suggested in this study that copper would be responsible for enhancing the formation of methyl hydroperoxide species. Moreover, copper was assumed to block the non-selective sites for hydrogen peroxide decomposition and hydrogenation by disrupting the surface structure of Au-Pd alloy. At the same time, the active sites (Au-Pd alloy) responsible for selective formation of methanol were maintained. In conclusion, a combination of catalyst evaluation and characterisation data gave structure activity relationships for the series of catalysts tested especially on methane oxidation reactions.

T1  - Multidisciplinary appraisal of the effectiveness of customary marine tenure for coral reef finfish fisheries management in nggela (solomon islands)
AN  - 1508803153
AB  - The failure of centralised fisheries management systems to prevent the overexploitation of coral reef resources has led many scholars and conservation practitioners to promote the use of customary marine tenure (CMT) as an alternative devolved means of fisheries management. The effectiveness of CMT for fisheries management is debated; some scholars argue that CMT is embedded within particular historical, socio-economic and political contexts and that unless it evolves to changing circumstances, its effectiveness for fisheries management will wane under external influences and changing exploitation patterns. Each CMT regime is unique; hence its response to changing circumstances may vary. A better understanding of the circumstances under which a CMT regime is likely to succeed is important if it is to be effectively used for fisheries management. This research is posited on the DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) model and employs multidisciplinary methods to investigate the effectiveness of CMT for reef finfish fisheries management. The aims of this thesis are: (1) To investigate the role of markets and subsistence as driving factors for fishing; (2) To investigate fisher spatial allocation of fishing, methods and target taxa (as proxies for pressure and impact); (3) contribute to the biological knowledge of a prominent vulnerable species (Plectropomus leopardus) by investigating aspects of its demography and reproduction (as a proxy for state); and (4) Investigate relationships between the Nggela CMT governance system and modern governance system (as a proxy for response), to improve understanding of how this knowledge may be applied to enhance small-scale fisheries management. The role of markets and subsistence as driving (D) factors for fishing was investigated using the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA). Ninety three (43 from the western zone and 50 from the eastern zone) household surveys were conducted in 10 (5 from the eastern zone and 5 from the western zone) randomly selected villages in Nggela to determine the contribution of different livelihood activities to fisher livelihoods. The reason for comparing the eastern and western zone was to determine the role of available natural land capital as one contributing factor (besides markets) to fishing drivers. Quantitative data generated from the household surveys were analysed using the statistical package SPSS. Additional key informant interviews to generate qualitative data to support the quantitative data were also conducted. Spatial allocation of fishing and target taxa was investigated using household surveys (the same household survey mentioned above but with questions to address the issue of spatial allocation and fishing methods used), participative fishing with fishers to confirm spatial allocation of fishing and fishing methods employed and recording of landings data to determine the types of fish taxa targeted. One of the initial aims of studies on P. leopardus was to compare the age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus between CMT areas and offshore sub-tidal areas, the hypothesis being that if CMT was effective agebased demographic parameters would reveal the non vulnerability of P. leopardus in CMT areas. Such a comparison was not possible as only 4 specimens were obtained from inshore CMT areas compared to 116 specimens from offshore sub-tidal reefs. To determine the age-based demographic parameters of Plectropomus leopardus, fish total lengths (mm) and otoliths of fish were collected in the field, this was followed by otolith annuli counts of ages (tagged to a particular fish of certain total length) at the laboratory. A von Bertalanffy growth curve was then fitted to the fish total length data and to the age data to determine asymptotic length, Brody growth coefficient and theoretical age at length zero. Total mortality rate was determined by generating catch curves where the frequency of fish in each age class was regressed against age. Longevity was determined by calculating the mean age of 10% of the oldest individuals. Demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were also compared to those of Australian locations to determine variations in age-based demography. Data analysis of P. leopardus data was done using the statistical software R and Microsoft Excel 2003. Reproductive aspects of P. leopardus were determined from the fish gonads collected from the field. Fish gonads were used to determine different sexual reproductive stages. Data on the different sexual reproductive stages was used to determine sexual maturity and sex change. The relationship between CMT governance and modern governance and how they may be combined for an effective reef finfish fisheries management was investigated using literature research, key informant interviews and dynamite fisher interviews. Investigations of livelihoods show that Nggela fishers were engaged in more than one livelihood activity for their livelihoods. Subsistence gardening was the most important livelihood activity. While finfish was important for subsistence purposes, accessible markets and the role of middlemen in the villages made it especially important for income generation. A comparison of the role of fishing between eastern and western zone showed that available natural land capital was also an important driver for fishing; fishing was higher in the western zone where there was a narrow natural land capital. Fisher perceptions indicate a declining trend in fisheries resource abundances within CMT areas; such decline has resulted in changes in the spatial allocation of fishing with a shift in fishing to offshore sub tidal reefs. Although some spatial closures were observed, fishing within the CMT areas is flexible. Three MPA’s currently existed in West Nggela and fishing prohibitions within the areas were observed mainly because people thought that the MPA’s were underscored by the government. Line fishing from dugout canoes remains the main method of fishing. Median trophic level of fish catch was between 2 - 3.84 while median standard length of catch was between 19 - 24 cm. Age-based demographic studies show that the Brody growth coefficient of Nggela P. leopardus was 0.13 yr-1, longevity was 12.9 years, maximum age was 15 years and mortality rate was 0.22% yr-1. Female sexual maturity of Nggela P. leopardus began at 2 years of age with 50% sexual maturity achieved at 3.22 years. Sexual transition from female to male began at 3 - 10 years of age with 50% sex change achieved at 11 years. Mature female to male ratio was 3:1. The age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were similar to those in Swain and Lizard Island in Australia. For Swain reef, growth coefficient was 0.17 yr-1, longevity was 10.1 years, maximum age was 14 years and mortality rate was 0.39% yr-1. For Lizard Island, growth coefficient was 0.26 yr-1, longevity was 7.2 years, maximum age was 10 years and mortality rate was 0.59% yr-1. Age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were different to locations in Western Australia – Scott and Abrolhos reefs. For Scott reef, growth coefficient was 0.42 yr-1, longevity was 6.4 years, mortality rate was 0.30% yr-1 while the maximum age was 8 years. For Abrohlos reef growth coefficient was 0.08 yr-1, longevity was 13 years, mortality rate was 0.24% yr-1 and maximum age was 18 years. Sea temperature may be one contributing factor to regional variations in age-based demographic parameters. The current CMT governance system has undergone changes which has rendered it ineffective as a coercive force for reef finfish fisheries management. While CMT is recognised by the modern governance system through National legislations, necessary ordinances at the provincial level are absent which prevent the effective use of CMT for fisheries management. For CMT to be effective it requires empowerment at the provincial government level.

T1  - Demand side management strategies to regulate electricity in oman
AN  - 1442498862
AB  - Demand Side Management (DSM) is the planning and implementation of strategies intended to encourage electricity consumers to reduce energy demand, improve energy efficiency, shift time of usage and promote the use of renewable energy based distributed generation system. It is a close socio- economic link between the utility and consumer for mutually benefiting to both. The research undertaken rivets on the potential use of DSM strategies to regulate electrical energy demand and mitigate carbon emissions in Oman. The main objective of this research is to examine the DSM based activities and policy options which could achieve significant reduction in electricity demand at the distribution network connected to the residential sector. It is revealed that temperature is the major environmental factor while use of air- conditioner units and practice of subsidised tariffs are epic centres of lavish electricity consumption at residential sector in Oman. This study applies a scenario based approach to identify viable energy efficiency and load reduction methods. The technical analysis comprises of bottom-up approach considering operational, behavioural and environmental factors to simulate the hourly load profile. Household load patterns are developed to identify and implement a range of DSM technological activities. An analytical model is set up to control the household load with minimal compromise of end-user satisfaction. Obtained results show that application of DSM strategies could contribute the substantial reduction in peak load and total energy demand. Studies carried out on renewable energy based hybrid power system manifest the viability and cost effectiveness of distributed generation to mitigate carbon emissions and peak load demand. The results of technical analysis are used to explicate the essential policy priorities underpinning the sustainable development of energy sector and mitigate the environmental issues. This comprehensive study provides the base to recommend the incentive based DSM programmes, smart metering, legal frame work for energy efficiency standards and labelling, investment subsidies to encourage renewable energy and legislation for distributed generation. The research has explored the benefits of DSM programmes along with barriers and challenges to implement the appropriate policies.

T1  - Analyses of adaptive evolution and recombination rate variation in <i>Drosophila</i>
AN  - 1289131317
AB  - The neutral theory of molecular evolution provides a framework to understand the molecular basis of evolutionary change. The fundamental principle of the neutral theory is that the majority of mutations observed within populations as well as between species is neutral. More importantly, the theoretical framework that the neutral theory provides not only includes mutation and random genetic drift but also two other important parameters in evolution: selection and recombination. Molecular evolutionary analyses allow us to estimate the magnitude and consequences of these parameters in natural populations. The work presented in this thesis investigates two aspects affecting evolutionary change: adaptation and recombination.   In the second and third chapter, adaptive changes associated with a new habitat are investigated in Drosophila santomea, a species which belongs to the melanogaster subgroup and which is endemic to the volcanic island of São Tomé. In its present habitat,  D. santomea inhabits a colder, darker and more humid environment compared with its sister species, Drosophila yakuba, which is distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Comparisons of genome wide changes in expression between these species indicate that a group of genes involved in detection of external stimuli could be providing selective advantages to  D. santomea in its new environment. In the second chapter, the coding sequences of these genes were obtained in D. santomea and analyzed to assess signatures of selection at the level of amino acid sequence. The analysis reveals that along with changes in the gene expression, protein coding sequences are evolving at a faster rate in D. santomea when compared with D. yakuba, likely providing evidence for an adaptive advantage to D. santomea when colonizing its new environment. The third chapter describes the study of the effect of cold temperature on the fitness of both species. The results indicate that  D. santomea tolerates cold temperature better than D. yakuba,  with different stages of the life cycle showing more pronounced effects. The observed reduction in fitness at low temperatures strongly supports the hypothesis that temperature is a key factor delimiting the distribution of these two species in their current habitats.   Recombination is an important evolutionary parameter that influences the amount of variation present within a species and the potential to adapt to biotic/abiotic changes. As such, it is a key parameter in population genetics models of selection. To date, however, no study has been able to measure the variation in recombination with high resolution (ideally at the level of single genes) while also capturing variation in recombination rates within a species. Further, there is a need to understand how the two outcomes of meiotic recombination (cross-over and gene conversion) are distributed across genomes. The fourth chapter describes the direct measurement of ultra-high-resolution variation in recombination rate throughout the D. melanogaster genome by massively genotyping the products of 5860 female meiosis. These maps reveal that cross-over rates are sharply reduced near telomeres and centromeres, with no cross-over activity in the small fourth chromosome. Importantly, we detect genomic regions with almost undetectable cross-over events embedded in large regions with high cross-over rates. Gene conversion rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than cross-over rates and detectable even in regions with no evidence of cross-over activity. Finally, the study of intraspecific variation on cross-over rates reveals many regions with significant excess of variation thus uncovering the presence of modifiers of recombination segregating with D. melanogaster. The results from this analysis underscore the need to incorporate both intraspecific variation in cross-over rates as well as gene conversion rates into a new generation of population genetics models.

T1  - Genetic Basis of Phenotypic Plasticity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 1034734612
AB  - The ability to produce distinct phenotypes under different environmental conditions is referred to as phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity is advantageous in that it allows organisms to adapt rapidly to environmental changes. However, excessive plasticity caused by dramatic environmental perturbations in otherwise robust traits can lead to undesirable changes in development and behaviors, and increase susceptibility to diseases, which leads to reduction in population fitness. Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity will greatly advance our understanding of adaptive evolution as well as the nature of constraints on adaptation.    In this dissertation I focus on environmental effects on regulation of transcript abundance in Drosophila melanogaster, as the transcriptome directly reflects genome regulation and is organized as dynamic regulatory networks that are influenced by and interact with the environment. I also associate environmental variation at the transcript level with environmental variation of different fitness traits, in order to understand the environmental impact of genetic regulation on organismal fitness.    Chemosensation is an essential modality for evaluating the environment, is implicated in guiding social interactions, and also affects longevity. The chemosensory system of Drosophila melanogaster is one of the best studied sensory systems. Chemosensation is mediated by large families of chemoreceptor genes. I constructed customized cDNA microarrays representing all classical Or-type odorant receptors, gustatory receptors and odorant binding protein genes of Drosophila. I investigated their expression patterns under different developmental stages, physiological status and social conditions, using a laboratory inbred line. I found that chemoreceptor genes that are clustered cytologically in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. Furthermore, exposure of flies only to odor of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of chemoreceptor genes. These transcripts are distinct from those that show transcriptional plasticity when flies are allowed physical contact with same or opposite sex members. Finally, clustering analysis revealed small covariant modules of chemoreceptor transcripts suggesting fine tuning of the expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to environmental and physiological conditions.    To expand the scope of my study on a genome-wide scale I constructed a synthetic outbred population using 40 inbred lines derived from a natural population with sequenced genomes and published transcriptome data and exposed this population to 20 different rearing conditions. I found that over 15% of the transcriptome is highly responsive to environmental changes while the majority of transcripts show robust expression that are consistent across conditions. Among the environmentally sensitive transcripts, 1249 are highly significant in the ANOVA for treatment. These transcripts are associated with response to heat shock, xenobiotic and energy metabolism, immune defense, proteolysis, transcription, and also include non-coding RNAs and computationally predicted transcripts of unknown function. They responded differentially to different environments and could be grouped in 103 highly correlated covariant modules. Environmentally sensitive transcripts associated with different organismal traits have distinct regulatory patterns, and are different from those associated with the same traits across the 40 genotypes under a standard rearing environment. I identified an additional 970 environmentally sensitive transcripts that were not detected by ANOVA due to high within-treatment variation. These transcripts have little genetic variation, show extensive sexual dimorphism, and gene ontology analysis shows that they are enriched for reproduction and post-mating behaviors. Comparisons of sequence conservation across 12 Drosophila species shows that environmentally sensitive genes are more rapidly evolving than those with robust expression under different environments.

T1  - Investigations of carbon-hydrogen activation and the conversion of methanol to triptane
AN  - 1019809187
AB  - Broadly speaking, this thesis represents research towards understanding the mechanisms and important species related to small molecule conversion, namely methane to methanol and methanol to higher hydrocarbons.  The first section is on understanding the catalytic formation of methanol from methane, with specific interest in using gold (Au).  While this transformation is known to occur catalytically, very little is understood about how it happens.  To study this reaction, well-defined Au-complexes were synthesized and reactions relevant to the possible catalytic cycles were examined.  In doing so, the first simple Au(III)-monoalkyl complex was generated and characterized: (Idipp)AuI 2Me, where Idipp = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene).  Kinetics experiments demonstrated that the complex reductively eliminates methyl iodide, which is relevant to the functionalization step in CH activation.  At low concentrations of iodide, the reductive elimination happens faster, from an unobserved 3-coordinate intermediate.  However, at high iodide concentrations, the pathway is still consistent with reductive elimination, but from a 5-coordinate intermediate.  This is in contrast to the related platinum-system, as well as to density functional theory calculations done on the Au-system.     The second section studies the C-H activation step alone by close examination of the microscopic reverse: protonation of a metal-alkyl.  It had previously been noted that the observed kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) were unusually high for the protonolysis of a few Pd complexes and one Pt complex.  It was hypothesized that these high KIEs and involvement of quantum mechanical tunneling  may indicate a change in the mechanism of the protonolysis reaction, from protonation at the metal center and reductive coupling to direct protonation of the M-Me bond.  The experiments described here were designed to explicitly test this theory and demonstrated that no correlation can be made between mechanism and tunneling.     The third section is focused on the study of the conversion of methanol to highly branched alkanes that make good fuel additives, namely 2,2,3-trimethylbutane (triptane), amidst other alkanes, olefins, and aromatics.  Catalyzed by ZnI 2 or InI3 at high temperatures, the reaction is hydrogen deficient: aromatics are formed as unsaturated by-products necessary for alkane generation.  While the product distributions are somewhat different for the two different catalysts, the general mechanism is the same.  While typical InI3 reactions generate more alkanes, more aromatics, and fewer olefins than ZnI2 reactions, longer reaction times and higher temperatures make the ZnI2 reaction look like the InI3 profile. Furthermore, InI3 can activate alkanes; it was found that InI 3 can "upgrade" other alkanes with methanol.  Notably, a 1:1 mixture of 2,3-dimethylbutane  and methanol can be converted into triptane with good selectivity and little aromatic formation; ZnI2 can carry out similar chemistry at higher temperatures.  Quantification of the iodine-containing products in each reaction mixture was attempted because of its relevance to the system's industrial viability and found that these concentrations were significantly higher than would be acceptable in an industrial setting.

T1  - Using remote sensing to create indicators of ecosystem variability for a semi-arid savanna watershed in the Kavango-Zambezi region of Southern Africa
AN  - 1018709617
AB  - This dissertation addresses changes in land and resource availability occurring as a result of climate, water variability and changes in fire regimes in a semi-arid savanna region in Southern Africa. The research combines geospatial analyses of climatological and hydrologic data and various remotely-sensed datasets to create measures of ecosystem variability and adaptability to natural and anthropogenic changes in sensitive ecosystems. The study area is the Chobe River Basin (CRB), a watershed shared between Botswana and Namibia situated at the heart of one of the world.s largest transfrontier conservation areas, where different land-use management strategies and economic policies affect both the ecosystem and the livelihoods support system differentially.    The southern African savanna is a highly variable environment and people have adapted to its harshness through the generations. However, in light of past and ongoing environmental changes, their ability to adapt may become threatened. By mapping and then analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of two important factors, namely flooding and fires, in conjunction with indices of vegetation health and productivity, the findings of this research can ultimately contribute to enhancing our understanding of local adaptation mechanisms to future environmental change. This is the first reconstruction of the spatial and temporal patterns of inundation for the last 25 years in the CRB, a transboundary basin with an unusual hydrologic regime and an important water resource for both human and wildlife populations. In the context of increasing temperatures, decreasing precipitation trends and increasing frequencies and intensities of El Niño episodes in southern Africa (Boko et al., 2007), I also investigated changes in fire incidences and marked shifts in fire seasonality both within and outside of protected areas of central Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA). These changes are likely to have a series of strong impacts on other components of fire regimes in semi-arid ecosystems that will, in turn, affect their ecology, structure, and function.    This dissertation contributes to the field of land use and land change science by proposing a novel spatial coincidence analysis framework for analyzing how the interand intra-annual extents of inundation and fire are correlated with both annual patterns of vegetation productivity and multi-date changes in vegetation productivity.

T1  - First-principles studies of complex hydrides for lithium-ion battery and hydrogen storage applications
AN  - 1018567817
AB  - We employ density functional theory in a computational study of two energy storage systems.    In the first, we explore the thermodynamic viability of light metal hydrides as a high capacity Li-ion battery negative electrode. Given a set of solid-state and gas-phase reactants, we have determined the phase diagram in the Li-Mg-B-N-H system in the grand canonical ensemble as a function of lithium electrochemical potential. We present computational results for several new conversion reactions with predicted capacities between 2400 and 4000 mAhg-1 that are thermodynamically favorable and that do not involve gas evolution. We provide experimental evidence for the reaction pathway on delithiation for the compound Li4BN3H10 and compare with our theoretical prediction. The maximum volume increase for these materials on lithium insertion is significantly smaller than that for Si, whose 400% expansion hinders its cyclability.    In the second study, we attempt to gain understanding of recent experimental results of lithium borohydride nanoconfined in highly ordered nanoporous carbon. The carbon environment is modeled as a single sheet of graphene, and adsorption energies are calculated for nanoparticles of the constituent phases of LiBH 4 desorption processes (LiBH4, LiH, lithium and boron). We find good agreement with previous studies of a single lithium atom adsorbed onto graphene. We predict that infiltrated LiBH4 will decompose such that boron is trapped in carbon vacancies, and that the resulting boron doping is required to achieve negative wetting energies for the remaining LiBH4. Desorption enthalpies are found to increase with shrinking cluster sizes, suggesting that the observed lowering of desorption temperatures is a kinetic effect although interactions with the carbon surface itself are predicted to have an overall effect of decreasing the desorption enthalpy .

T1  - Landscape genetics, hybridization and rapid evolution in the biological control agent, <i>Longitarsus jacobaeae</i>
AN  - 866330747
AB  - An Italian biotype of the ragwort flea beetle, Longitarsus jacobaeae Waterhouse (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), originating from a Mediterranean climate has been the most effective biological control agent against the invasive tansy ragwort (Jacobaea vulgaris) in Pacific coastal areas of the U.S. The spread of tansy ragwort into new environments, including high-elevation areas in northern Idaho and northeastern Montana, has prompted the re-introduction of a cold-adapted biotype of the flea beetle from Switzerland. While the biotypes are morphologically identical they differ in the phenologies, presumably as adaptation to different climatic conditions in their native range.    Establishment patterns of the two beetle biotypes across the Pacific Northwest were investigated using molecular tools. The Italian biotype was found in a wide range of environments including those at higher elevations, characterized by continental, winter-cold climates. Hybrid individuals between Italian and Swiss beetles were also detected at a study site in Montana. Reciprocal transplant and common garden field and laboratory experiments were used to test whether Italian beetles at a high-elevation location on Mt. Hood, Oregon, underwent rapid evolution in response to the significantly reduced growing season at that location. The results indicate that the beetles at Mt. Hood genetically adapted to the cooler conditions in less than 30 years, with shifts in life history and morphological traits that conform to predictions based on models, empirical studies and the phenology of the known cold-adapted Swiss beetles. Finally, to assess the potential impact of hybridization on biological control of tansy ragwort, phenological and fitness characteristics of F1 and F2 reciprocal hybrids between Italian and Swiss L. jacobaeae were measured in the laboratory. Most measured traits showed intermediate values for the two hybrid lineages with some maternal effects. Most importantly, both hybrid lineages had a higher fitness than the Italian parent, or in one hybrid lineage both parents.

T1  - Role of Eukaryotic Sel-1 like Repeat Containing Genes in <i> Helicobacter pylori</i> Evolution and Pathogenesis
AN  - 862550215
AB  - Background. Helicobacter pylori ( Hp) establishes life-long gastric infection in billions of humans, and is often responsible for diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Cumulative actions of genetic drift and natural selection  over several millennia sculpted the present Hp population structure, which is characterized by extreme genetic diversity and striking geographic clustering of genotypes. Natural selection is more commonly imprinted in DNA sequences of Hp proteins that interact with host components; however, in most instances biological relevance of selection during Hp infection remains unknown. Here, I attempted to elucidate the consequence of natural selection in two different contexts: (1) on the preservation of duplicated genes in Hp genome; and (2) lineage-specific adaptive evolution in Hp virulence protein HepC.    Principle findings. I characterized the molecular evolutionary dynamics of paralogs, hcpC and hcpG, which belong to the Hp Sel1-like gene family. hcpG genomic analyses identified three distinct states in natural Hp populations, whereby hcpG was either deleted, pseudogenized or encoded highly polymorphic alleles. In contrast, full-length hcpC  alleles were conserved in all genomes. Although positive selection was detected in the phylogenies of hcpG and hcpC  indicating that both genes had evolved under pressure to diversify, the intensity of selection was much stronger on hcpG than  hcpC. The contribution of hcpC to Hp fitness, in the AGS cell culture infection model, was significantly greater than hcpG; however, both genes together demonstrated an additive effect on Hp fitness during infection (24 hrs p.i.:  SΔhcpC = 0.264 vs. SΔhcpG = 0.074, P<0.01; SΔhcpC or S ΔhcpG vs. SΔhcpC::DhcpG  = 0.431, P<0.01, where S=coefficient of median fitness reduction). Furthermore, HcpC was necessary and sufficient for optimal surface expression of Heat-Shock Protein B (HspB), a major contributor to Hp virulence, specifically during infection, and functionally compensated for the lack of HcpG. In contrast, HcpG was only required for optimal HspB expression during early infection, and was unable to compensate for the lack of HcpC during later phases. Thus, a stable, genetically redundant, epistatic and overlapping yet non-reciprocal functional relationship emerged between hcpC and hcpG: natural selection  favored retention of the ancestral hcpC function and sub-functionalization by fixation of loss-of-function mutations in  hcpG following its origin in the Hp genome.    Earlier studies from my lab showed that the HepC protein, which also belongs to Hp Sel1-like gene family, interacted specifically with human cytoskeletal protein Ezrin, and that lineage-specific positive selection changed HepC-Ezrin interaction affinity. How might alterations in HepC-Ezrin interaction affect progression of Hp infection? As a first step I established that HepC was indeed biologically relevant and contributed significantly to Hp fitness during infection (P=0.05). Furthermore, PCR-array analyses suggested that identical molecules of the human cytoskeletal pathway were differentially up or down-regulated by genetically diverse Hp isolates during infection, and that HepC likely inhibited key components of the human cytoskeletal machinery during infection. Thus HepC (possibly via its interaction with Ezrin) likely contributes a key regulatory role that might determine the pace and trajectory of Hp infection.    Conclusion. Collectively, my thesis proposes a novel mechanism through which natural selection favors the emergence of a stable state of genetic redundancy among duplicated genes, hcpC  an hcpG that contribute significantly to  Hp infection. This work also establishes a framework within which to further clarify the role of lineage-specific selection in fine-tuning  Hp-host interactions.

T1  - Electricity Restructuring and Economic Education
AN  - 860369165; ED516504
AB  - My dissertation research concentrates on the causes, motivations, and results of electricity restructuring, and research on the effectiveness of economic teaching and retention. The first chapter looks at motivations for electricity restructuring in the United States in terms of the Interest Group and Public Interest setting. The second chapter investigates results of electricity restructuring in terms of generating efficiency. The final chapter discusses whether exposing undergraduate students to economics outside of a typical classroom setting increases their retention of classroom taught models. For the first chapter of my dissertation we investigate motivations for electricity restructuring in the United States. Beginning in 1992, with the passage of the Energy Policy Act, measures to promote competition were undertaken in the electricity industry. From 1996 to 2002, 18 states followed suit, with restructuring programs targeted at improving efficiency through the use of increased wholesale trading, abolishment of 'cost of service' regulation, measures to open electricity production to non-utility entities, and the unbundling of transmission and distribution. Theory suggests that the initiatives promoted by these states would expose electricity generation to competitive forces that should increase both productive and dynamic efficiency, thus leading to lower comparative energy prices. The purpose of this chapter is to examine whether deregulation was brought about due to the Public Interest theory (that regulatory changes are undertaken to benefit society) or the Interest Group theory (that groups that hope to gain from deregulation lobby for regulatory changes). I focus on the period from 1995-2006 to investigate this question. All 50 states and the District of Columbia are included. The observational unit is the state year. Hazard models are employed to investigate the question. Results indicate no evidence for the public interest theory, and strong evidence of the interest group theory. I find that a stronger presence of industrial customers in terms of MWh purchased by the average customer implying a greater probability of restructuring. A stronger political influence of residential customers also is associated with a greater chance of restructuring; controlling for other variables and residential price, an increase in median income of $1000 (and thus more ability to lobby) increases the probability restructuring of by between eleven and 28 percent. In the second chapter we investigate the effects of market restructuring initiatives that introduced competition into the United States electricity industry on the thermal efficiency of electricity generation. An empirical model is estimated on annual data for over 950 plants from 1996 to 2006. Model estimates show that restructuring increased the efficiency of investor-owned plants by about 13 percent and that these gains stem from organizational and technological changes within the plant. Instrumental variable approaches indicate that estimates may be lower bounds of efficiency gains. Although not directly targeted by restructuring initiatives, I also find similar efficiency effects for municipality-owned plants. This result suggests that the benefits from restructuring have spilled over to public electricity generation. In addition particular attention was paid to the definition of a restructured electricity market, with alternative measure of restructuring employed as robustness checks. Lastly this improvement in efficiency translates into a substantial reduction in carbon emissions equivalent to taking approximately ten million cars off the road in 2006. For the final chapter of my dissertation we look at the effect of having students read and respond to articles regarding economic events on the learning of economic theory in both Intermediate Microeconomics and Intermediate Macroeconomics. We find that having students apply theoretical material to real world situations has spillover effects into the learning of theoretical material itself. By assigning articles and measuring performance on midterm exams in four Intermediate Theory courses during the 2007-08 academic year, results indicate that each additional article a student completed resulted in an improvement of approximately one percentage point on a given midterm exam. This effect grew to three percentage points per article completed on the middle of three midterms where we could ensure that both "finish everything early" students and "procrastinate as long as possible" students were represented.

T1  - The effect of mate choice on offspring phenotype and performance in Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>)
AN  - 858865097
AB  - Captive breeding is essential for salmon aquaculture and stock enhancement programs, but captive breeding may lead to genetic bottlenecks, inbreeding, and domestication selection. To evaluate the potential for incorporating mate choice into commercial and conservation salmon breeding programs, I measured the effects of mate choice on offspring phenotype. Semi-natural spawning channels were used to compare mate-choice and randomly mated (hatchery) fish for performance and morphological traits. Channel-spawned fish were out-performed by their hatchery counterparts in survival and body size; both genetic and environmental effects contributed to these differences. However, channel-spawned fish had significantly more additive genetic variance for performance traits. Gene transcription of hatchery-bred and channel-spawned fish were compared using microarray analysis after a temperature stress. Few genes showed differential expression; however, overall transcriptional variance was lower in the channel-spawned fish. Mate choice should be included in rearing programs to increase the viability and adaptive potential of captive fish.

T1  - Adaptation at the Range Edge and the Causes of Range Limits in Mimulus laciniatus: The Roles of Gene Flow and Selection
AN  - 857657750
AB  - Species range limits are paradoxically viewed as either diversifying areas, where niche evolution occurs due to adaptations in novel environments, or as fragile and depauperate sinks, where adaptation is stymied by maladaptive gene flow from central populations. Many studies have described individual components of these scenarios that lend support to both viewpoints. This study seeks to simultaneously examine major hypothesized components (gene flow, selection, and the ecological gradient) for understanding population differentiation at range limits and the effects of gene flow on these dynamics.   The first study was is a review of the literature on the evolution and ecology of species range limits. Species range limits involve many aspects of evolution and ecology, from species distribution and abundance to the evolution of niches. Theory suggests myriad processes by which range limits arise, including competitive exclusion, Allee effects, and gene swamping; however, most models remain empirically untested. Range limits are correlated with a number of abiotic and biotic factors, but further experimentation is needed to understand underlying mechanisms. Range edges are characterized by increased genetic isolation, genetic differentiation, and variability in individual and population performance, but evidence for decreased abundance and fitness is lacking. Evolution of range limits is understudied in natural systems; in particular, the role of gene flow in shaping range limits is unknown. Biological invasions and rapid distribution shifts caused by climate change represent large-scale experiments on the underlying dynamics of range limits. A better fusion of experimentation and theory will advance our understanding of the causes of range limits.   The second study was a test of the role of gene flow on adaptation using experimental breeding in the annual plant, Mimulus laciniatus, at its warm range edge. M. laciniatus inhabits open, rocky seeps between 760 – 3,270 m and is endemic to the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Replicate populations, including replicate edge populations, were sampled along three elevation-based transects across the species range. Plants from all populations were grown in growth chambers for one generation to reduce among-family maternal effects. Gene flow was experimentally simulated by producing crosses within and between warm-limit populations as well as crosses between warmlimit and central range populations. Offspring from these crosses were sown into a common garden at the warm-edge species range limit where lifetime reproductive success was measured. Gene flow, regardless of range location, increased emergence at the range limit, but increased lifetime fitness occurred only when pollen originated from another warm-limit population. We found benefits of gene flow among populations, especially beneficial gene flow between populations occupying the same range limit. Our results emphasize the overlooked importance of gene flow among populations occurring near the same range limit and highlight the potential for prescriptive gene flow as a conservation option for populations at risk from climate change.   In the third study, field surveys and genetic markers were used to test established predictions that edges are more isolated and differentiated (“isolated limits hypothesis”) and to place these findings in the context of theory on constraints to adaptation at range limits. In general, there was no pattern of change in population size, but plant density was greater towards margins. No consistent changes in microsatellite diversity was found between the range center and its limits, but there was a reduction in allelic richness in the most peripheral populations, perhaps signaling a step pattern caused by isolation or abrupt environmental changes at range limits. Mean genetic divergence did not increase significantly towards limits, whereas inbreeding increased gradually across the entire species range, from low to high elevation limits. There was little evidence for reduced gene flow at edges as estimated from graph theory analysis. Gene flow appears to be greater among populations inhabiting similar elevations. Vicariance, potentially driven through environmentally mediated selection, was evident across the elevation gradient, even within the same watershed. Depending on the analysis employed (i.e. using continuous or categorical measures of peripherality), one can find support for or against the isolated limits hypothesis. Adaptive constraints at range limits in this system may be due to limited genetic variation at both edges, but are not likely to be due to directional, swamping gene flow from central populations.    The results presented in this dissertation confirm theoretical expectations that gene flow plays a key role in determining the performance of individuals at range limits. Moreover, we have supplied new evidence, from experiments and molecular genetic analyses, that the role of gene flow can switch depending on the environmental sources and destinations of migration. Adaptation across a strong environmental gradient is potentially maintained by preventing maladaptive gene flow through isolation between elevations. Conversely, gene flow among populations inhabiting similar environments at the range margin can provide adaptive genetic variation.

T1  - Genetic and phenotypic variation in resource acquisition and allocation: Testing a fundamental model for life-history evolution
AN  - 748216129
AB  - One of the major goals of research in evolutionary biology is explaining the biological diversity of organismal life histories. One major explanation of this diversity is that limited resources acquired by an organism must be allocated to various life processes, leading to trade-offs between these processes. In this dissertation, I use a model system—the trade-off between flight capability and reproduction in wing dimorphic insects—to investigate variation in the acquisition of resources and its subsequent allocation to competing processes.   I showed that the pattern of allocation varies in response to temperature in the water strider, Aquarius remigis and that this response has the potential to evolve. In addition, I used a quantitative genetic simulation model to show that the optimal allocation strategy depends on the predictability of resource levels across time. Specifically, this model predicts completely different responses of allocation to resource level variation in environments with low versus high predictability of resource levels across time.   Combining physiological assays with a quantitative genetic breeding experiment, I measured genetic and phenotypic variation in acquisition and allocation in and across several different resource environments in the wing dimorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus. I found a significant genetic variance for both acquisition and allocation, but I also found that independent evolution in different resource environments is constrained. I show that when allocation is measured independently of acquisition, there is evidence for the trade-off even when it may be obscured by variance in acquisition when measured only as the correlation between functions.   Using this data set, I also tested the assumptions and predictions of a theoretical model (the Y model) that predicts patterns of variation in trade-offs. An assumption of the Y model, that acquisition and allocation will be independent of one another, was not supported. However, despite this result, I found strong support for the predictions of the Y model in this system, demonstrating the Y model is robust to violations of the assumption of independence. This study is the first to use estimates of acquisition and allocation to directly test the Y model.

T1  - Exogenous correlates of migration, spawning, egg deposition and egg mortality in the lake sturgeon (<i>Acipenser fulvescens</i>)
AN  - 745660546
AB  - Understanding patterns of migration, the timing of reproduction, breeding site selection and the sources and magnitude of early life mortality provides a unique perspective into exogenous regimes that influence patterns in recruitment as well as those leading to the evolution of important and adaptive life history traits. Unfortunately, such knowledge of how migratory patterns and reproductive behaviors, the consistency of reproductive events and the time/location of reproduction relates to exogenous variables is largely lacking for many species, especially long-lived iteroparous vertebrates. Further, associations between habitat variables and patterns in the occurrence of early life stages, quantitative estimates of mortality, and the sources of loss are relatively unknown. In order to address these uncertainties, I used tagging data from a long-term lake sturgeon monitoring program (2000-2008) established in the Black River, MI as well as experimental manipulations and laboratory studies to: (1) quantify relationships between migration patterns and spawning behaviors with exogenous variables, (2) estimate the consistency (i.e., repeatability) for individual spawning events across years, (3) assess whether stream covariates were predictive of spawning site selection, egg deposition and survival during incubation in natural settings and (4) quantify the magnitude, sources and the abiotic and biotic conditions (e.g., substrate size, predator density and size) that influence egg mortality. Migratory activity (i.e., the daily number of adults entering the river) and spawning activity (i.e., the daily number of adults collected at upstream spawning locations) were found to be significantly associated with exogenous variables including daily photoperiod, water temperature, river discharge and the lunar cycle. However, the relative importance of variables interacted in different ways at different sequences in migration continuum (i.e., river entry, upstream movement, entry to spawning locations). Individual male and female lake sturgeon were also found to be highly repeatable in their choices of spawning time and spawning location (i.e., upstream vs. downstream preference). Egg deposition in natural stream settings was spatially explicit (i.e., patchy) and patterns were non-randomly and significantly associated with stream covariates including substrate size and water velocity across all sampled locations. Although egg mortality was consistent between sites over three days (70% mortality rate), environmental covariates, particularly substrate size, were predictive of mortality rates. Finally, egg mortality was high (91%) and quite variable (75-97%) across treatment groups in experimental settings and the relative magnitude of mortality sources varied significantly across simulated conditions, further suggesting strong relationships with the ecological features eggs experience naturally during incubation and survival. Developmental mortality (i.e., mortality due to abnormal egg development) was the major source of loss (84%) followed by predation (16%). However, egg mortality due to predation was shown to be high in laboratory experiments (80% after 24 hrs) with approximately 17-104 eggs consumed on average per predator. The highest levels of mortality were observed in treatments with high predator density and little habitat complexity. Information provided has been largely unknown and will be valuable in the ongoing restoration efforts for this unique and imperiled migratory fish.

T1  - Species interactions in a warming climate: Examining the direct and indirect effects of climate change on New England grassland food webs
AN  - 613708394
AB  - Global climate is predicted to change significantly during the next century. Effects of climate change are already evident as shifts in the geographic distribution of species and altered species phenology and life-history. However, predicting the particular fate of species in food webs is difficult because the net effects of climate change result from multiple interacting species responding to multiple changes within their environment. My research contributes to our understanding of climate change effects on species through a series of experiments that revealed the mechanisms by which climate warming alters food web interactions in a grassland community comprised of herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores and spider predators.  Pisaurina mira spiders are indirect keystone predators that, when present, cause grasshoppers to shift from a grass-based diet to an herb-based diet. Consequently, P. mira has a positive indirect effect on grass biomass and a negative indirect effect on herb biomass. Synthesis of data spanning 15 years revealed that the magnitude of the top-down effect increased with warning. This happened because warming had no affect on grasshopper location but caused P. mira to seek thermal refuge lower in the plant canopy. Thus, by decreasing the degree of overlap between predator and prey, warming decreased predation risk and allowed grasshoppers to increase daily feeding time on herbs. A second spider predator, Phidippus rimator,  cohabits these grassland communities by occupying positions lower in the plant canopy, spatially segregated from P. mira. Experimental warming forced these two spider predators to interact within the lower plant canopy, resulting in intraguild predation by P. mira and the local extinction of P. rimator. The effects of climate change on food webs may be reduced if species respond to warming via phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary responses. I tested this prediction by examining  P. mira spiders along a 4.8°C temperature gradient and found that spiders from warm study sites had higher tolerance to warming, which allowed them to remain high in the plant canopy and precluded warming from increasing top-down effects. Thus, this dissertation not only identified a mechanism by which warming can alter species interactions, but also demonstrated that species responses to chronic climate change may mitigate some of the effects of warming on food webs.

AN  - 610024813
AB  - Reintroductions are a common approach for preserving intraspecific biodiversity in fragmented landscapes; however, reintroduced populations are often smaller and more geographically isolated than native populations. Reintroductions may therefore exacerbate the reduction in genetic variability initially caused by population fragmentation due to the small effective population size of the reintroduced populations. Mixing genetically divergent sources is assumed to alleviate this issue by increasing genetic diversity, but the effects on genetic diversity are often not monitored and there are potential negative tradeoffs for mixing genetically distinct sources.    I examined the consequences of mixed-source reintroductions on the ancestral composition, genetic variation and fitness of a small stream fish, the slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), from three source populations at nine reintroduction sites in southeast Minnesota. I used microsatellite markers to evaluate allelic richness and heterozygosity in the reintroduced populations relative to computer simulated expectations. I then inferred the fitness of each crosstype in the reintroduced populations by comparing their overall persistence, growth rates, and relative body conditions. Finally, I modeled the response of fitness related variables in the reintroduced populations to variation in habitat using a combination of regression and ordination methods.    Ancestry analysis revealed that one of the three sources had more ancestors than the other two sources at most reintroduction sites. Sculpins in reintroduced populations exhibited higher levels of heterozygosity and allelic richness than the sources, but only slightly higher than the most genetically diverse source population. Simulations of maximum genetic variation indicated only a modest expected increase over the most diverse source. Growth rate, body size, and relative body condition suggest significantly reduced fitness in second generation hybrids. I detected evidence of local adaptation in the source populations based on greater predicted fitness for each source in its respective habitat. This local adaptation is strongly associated with a gradient in winter water temperatures. My study indicates that using more than one source for reintroductions may not substantially enhance genetic diversity. Furthermore, using multiple sources risks disruption of important adaptations and may cause outbreeding depression. Future reintroductions may be improved by evaluating the potential for local adaptation in ongoing reintroduction programs.

T1  - Identifying barriers to successful establishment of post-fire seeding in the Great Basin
AN  - 501891527
AB  - The shift of Great Basin ecosystems from diverse shrub-grass communities to near monocultures of annual grasses has altered ecosystems, caused more frequent and intense fires, and led to an increased demand for plant material that can restore altered landscapes back to complex, diverse systems. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Nevada currently spends millions of dollars through the Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation (ES&R) program each year to re-seed land affected by fire. Seeds used for revegetation face many barriers that often prevent their successful establishment in this semi-arid environment including precipitation and temperature limitation, competition with invasive species, and soil type. Field surveys were done to monitor revegetation patterns between years and across aspects at five fire sites in Elko County, NV. A novel common garden experiment was conducted to determine what plants traits increase establishment success in invaded, post-fire field sites. We collected seeds from drill seeded populations of Elymus elymoides  ssp. californicus (Toe Jam Creek bottlebrush squirreltail) at two fire locations in Elko County, NV. Seeds were planted in a common garden environment, where we compared the phenology, size, and reproduction of surviving plants to those of the original restoration material.    In our field survey study, we found that vegetation structure within a site changed significantly in the short distance separating flat, north and south facing aspects; Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) was more likely to establish on south aspects, residual grasses were more likely to remain on north aspects, and seeded perennial grasses were more likely to establish on flat areas. Over time, the density of B. tectorum  and non-seeded perennial grasses and forbs increased, whereas the density of seeded perennial grasses and forbs decreased. We found that for both seeded and residual perennial grass, plant density in 2007 was a good predictor of the plant density in 2009. The density of B. tectorum  in 2007 also predicted the density of B. tectorum in 2009, but not as strongly as perennial species.    In our common garden experiment, plants grown from the original restoration material were larger, produced larger and more seeds, and produced seeds later in the season, while plants grown from material that successfully established at the restoration sites were smaller, produced smaller and fewer seeds, and produced them earlier. Differences in seed size were observed at the family level and persisted in the common garden environment through the next generation, indicating that seed size is likely a genetic, rather than maternal environment, effect. These results were consistent across two different field sites. Natural selection, rather than genetic drift, is the most likely explanation for trait shifts observed in established seed material, and these results indicate that smaller plants may be better adapted for establishment in arid environments.     Our results suggest that altering current monitoring and seed production techniques may increase restoration success in the Great Basin. Modifying management objectives, seed mixes, and seeding efforts for slope-aspect and pre-fire site conditions may result in more cost effective and successful restoration. Restoration practices may also be improved if plant developers select for traits that perform well at restoration sites, rather than in controlled, production environments.

T1  - Climate Change: The Synergistic Impacts of Elevated pCO2 and Temperature on the Early Development of Oysters.
AN  - 2315242567
AB  - Throughout the Earth's history climate change has led to a proliferation and disappearance of species thus playing a major role in shaping the structure of marine ecosystems. Over the next century, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels will cause a rise in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the surface ocean leading to a reduction in surface ocean pH from 8.1 to 7.7 units and a reduction in the concentration of surface ocean carbonate ions (in a process known as 'ocean acidification') vital in the construction of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) shells and skeletons. At the same time, this rise in atmospheric CO2 levels will lead to an increase in sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). Of growing concern are the potentially serious implications that ocean acidification and rising SSTs may have on marine organisms and ecosystems and the potential risk to marine aquaculture internationally. Recent studies, which have mimicked ocean acidification, have reported adverse consequences of elevated pCO2, including reduced calcification and growth, and increased rates of abnormality and mortality in larvae and adults of a range of marine organisms. Yet, we know comparatively little of the synergistic consequences of elevated pCO2 and temperature nor the potential for species to acclimate through genetic adaptation, at the population and ecosystem level. This lack of knowledge limits our ability to create models that accurately predict the consequences of future climate change. Among the organisms most likely to be affected in an acidifying and warming ocean are marine calcifying organisms which construct shells and skeletons of CaCO3. Studies on these organisms, to date, have focused predominately on adults, with comparatively few considering the sensitive early life history stages. 
This study compared the synergistic effects of elevated pCO2 and temperature on the early life history stages of two ecologically and economically important oysters: the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata and the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Gametes, embryos, larvae and spat were exposed to four pCO2 (375, 600, 750, 1000 ppm) and four temperature (18, 22, 26, 30 °C) levels in acute exposure experiments. At elevated pCO2 and suboptimal temperatures there was a reduction in the fertilisation success of gametes, a reduction in the development of embryos and size of larvae and spat and an increase in abnormal morphology of larvae. These effects varied between species with S. glomerata having greater sensitivity than C. gigas. Combined, elevations in pCO2 of 750-1000 ppm and a temperature of 30 °C resulted in 100% mortality of D-veliger larvae of S. glomerata. In contrast, the same pCO2 and temperature combination resulted in only 26% mortality of D-veliger larvae of C. gigas. A comparison between two commonly used methods for manipulating the seawater carbonate system (HCl?acidification and CO2?acidification) showed that there was no significant difference in the responses of S. glomerata and C. gigas to the two methods. This indicates that both HCl acidification and CO2 acidification are adequate methods for determining the effects of elevated pCO2 for these species.

T1  - Stduy of the preparation of magnesium sulfate and magnesium hydroxide sulfate hydrate whiskers from boron slurry
AN  - 1874929354
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorBoron slurry is one of main waste in boron industry. With the development of boron industry and the growing demand of borax and boric acid in china, the dumping of boron slurry also increases with years, which not only engrosses a great deal of the soil, but also produces severe contamination to environment. Boron slurry is a rich source of magnesium. Usually, the content of MgO in boron slurry exceeds 30%. The massive dumping of boron also makes a large waste of the magnesium resource. So looking for suitable method for recycling and utilizing magnesium in boron slurry can not only solve environment pollution problems but also make good use of magnesium resource and gain tremendous economic benefit. In this thesis, the recovery and utilization of magnesium in boron slurry was researched, and a new method of leaching magnesium from boron slurry was developed, which had a large handling capacity, simple process and lower cost. Then magnesium sulfate products such as fertilizer grade magnesium sulfate, technical-grade magnesium sulfate and magnesium hydroxide sulfate hydrate (MHSH) whiskers were prepared. The concrete research contents are as follows. (1).New process of leaching magnesium from boron slurry was researched. The process conditions of leaching magnesium by heap leaching method and pond leaching method had been researched. The result shown that pond leaching method excelled the heap leaching method, which had higher leaching rate of magnesium from boron slurry and milder reaction rate. The optimal conditions of leaching Magnesium were concluded as follow: the concentration of sulfuric acid is about 14%, the amount of sulfuric acid is 110% of the theoretical value; leaching time is about 5 days. (2).Magnesium sulfate products such as fertilizer grade magnesium sulfate and technical-grade magnesium sulfate were prepared. The leaching solution made from boron slurry contained some impurities such as iron, manganese, aluminium and so on. The magnesium sulfate obtained without purification contained 15.24% of MgO and 32.72% of SO3, which had met the demand of magnesium sulfate fertilizer. Using ammonium peroxydisulfate and light-magnesia as purifying auxiliaries, magnesium sulfate obtained after purification excelled the first-grade product of technical-grade magnesium sulfate, what's more, the content of iron and manganese impurities were both under 5 ppm, which had met the requirement of Analytical reagent standard. (3).The chemical reaction system and process conditions of MHSH whiskers were researched. Using the self-made high purity magnesium sulfate as raw mterial, MHSH whiskers were synthesized via a hydrothermal method at. The influential factors of magnesium hydroxide sulfate hydrate crystal growth, such as alkali source, reactants concentration, reactants proportion, hydrothermal temperature, reaction time, and so on, had been researched. And the best reaction system of MHSH whiskers preparation-magnesium sulfate and light-magnesia, was selected through experiments. The optimal conditions were: the concentration of magnesium sulfate in the slurry is 0.60mol/L, the reactants proportion is n(MgSO4): n(MgO)=2: 1, the hydrothermal temperature is 180℃, and the reaction time is 6h. (4).The improvement of MHSH whiskers morphology was researched. The sector-like whiskers were inhibited through adding organic alcohol, and MHSH whiskers with a well dispersion and morphology were obtained. The MHSH whiskers obtained had a diameter of about 1μm and a length of 30~50μm, were smaller than which obtained without adding organic alcohol, but the structure of MHSH whiskers didn't

T1  - Identification and fermentation of antagonistic bacterium against ralstonia solanacearum
AN  - 1874447107
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe prevention and control of tomato bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is a world-wide difficult problem. The objective of this experiment was to screen and identify antagonistic bacteria from tomato rhizospheric soil against R.solanacearum (mainly pathogenic strains SST-Y and G2M1.70), optimize fermentation conditions of antagonistic strains, and illuminate characteristics of antagonistic substances produced by antagonistic strains, and testify the effects of them against R.solanacearum by pot experiment. In this study, antagonistic bacteria against R.solanacearum were screened by the plate culture method. Tomato rhizopheric soil was randomly taken from the depth of 0cm to 20 cm, mixed and plated with gradient dilution. 284 strains were isolated, and 33 strains have the effects against Ralstonia solanacearum. After further screening by dotting and agar block method, 4 strains, YB1, YB6, YB22 and YB70, were selected. The strain YB6 suppressed the growth of R.solanacearum with the inhibition zone above 17mm. Only the strain YB6 had stable antagonistic effects after continuous 10 generations, and was selected as the objective of the following experiments. The strain was identified as Arthrobacter by traditional identification, members of which widely inhabit in soil, and are scarcely reported as antagonistic bacteria. The composition of culture media and fermentation conditions of YB6 were optimized with orthogonal test. The optimal combination of fermentation were as follows: the carbon source with sucrose at a concentration of 1.5%, the nitrogen sources with peptone and (NH4)2SO4 at concentrations of 1.0%,0.3%, respectively, the initial pH at 9.0, the inoculum concentration 3%, and shaker revolution 100 r/min, incubation temperature 30 Under the optimal conditions, the inhibition zone of the strain against SST-Y and G2M1.70 increased by 76.72%, 81.14%, respectively. In the stability test, the strain showed low stability to tested chemical agents, and super acid, super base, and above 1.5 mg/mL concentration of protease inactivated the strain. The strain was sensitive to heat, 60 over the loss of antimicrobial activity, but showed stability to UV 5 h and light 35000 L. The bacterium liquid and the fermentation filtrate of the strain YB6 were stored at 4 and room temperature, respectively. It was found that the inhibition activity of both the bacteria liquid and the fermentation filtrate was higher when stored at room temperature than at 4 , and the inhibition activity of the bacterium liquid was higher than that of the fermentation filtrate. In the production experiment of solid inoculum, the adsporption effect of organic carrier(Organic fertilizer, Corn flour, Peanut meal, peatmoss, Rice stems powder, Rice bran ) was better than that of inorganic carrier(Activated carbon, vermiculite ), and maize flour as the carrier of the strain showed highest adsorption activity, survival rate and inhibition activity. The pot experiment showed that the inhibition activity was highest by the dipping inoculum method in the period of transplanting, and the biocontrol rate reached 65.0%. The antimicrobial range test revealed that the strain showed inhibition activity against all of the eight tested pathogenic strains(Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn, Ustilago scitaminea Syd., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea Pers., Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cubense, Xanthomonas compeatris pv. Oryzicola, Magnaportheoryzea), especially to the sugarcane smut and the wheat scab, indicating that the strain is valuable in the development of biocontrol

T1  - Studies on the surface ultrastructure and their growth development of necrophagous fly species
AN  - 1873753428
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorForensic entomology is the interdiscipline that uses insects and other arthropods in estimating when, where, and why the death happened. The succession of arthropods, morphological changes, and the development stages of the necroghagous flies were often useful to determine the time of death. The infering of the place of death are based mainly on insect geographic range and suitable place. The insect species on cropse could give scientific evidence to the removing of cropse. Qualitative determination of toxic substances and drugs could add information to the analysis of both the cause of death and place of cadaver deposited, and could also be used to investigate the effects of such substances on insect development for the forensic post-mortem interval (PMI) estimates through necroghagous insect development analysis. The results are as follows: In order to accurately determine the death time, the community composition and succession of necroghagous flies and the development stages of the necroghagous flies were investigated in Guangzhou. Important necrophagous fly specie Boettcherisca peregrine, Synthesiomyia nudiseta, Hemipyrellia ligurriens, Achoetandrus rufifacies were selected as experimental material. The development of Boettcherisca peregrine, Synthesiomyia nudiseta, Hemipyrellia ligurriens, Achoetandrus rufifacies under different temperature condition also studied. This article related to the aspects of ultrastructural morphology of four necrophagous fly species and their developmental duration. The paper describes the immature stages of four flies found to in dead animals body in Guangzhou. Eggs, all larval instars, and pupa were studied and their significant morphological features are described and photoed. The immature stage morphology is observated, and key morphology were extracted from all larval instars and puparia. The taxonomic of the morphological features and biological significance to larvae are discussed. The properties such as the surface texture of eggs, the incubative micropyle, the median area, and the hatching pleats could be used to distinguish different kinds of eggs of necroghagous flies. The anterior spiracle, posterior spiracles, mouthhook and prothorax anterior spines band could be used to distinguish different larva of the necroghagous flies more accurately. The connection between the development time of the necroghagous flies and the daily indicator of the body length, body width, and body weight were obtained through culturing four kinds of necroghagous flies in constant temperature. The results indicate that body length and width of the larva are in accord with the cubic curvilinear equation: Y=b0+b1T+b2T2+b3T3, 'Y' represents body length, width or weight, 'T' represents the development time. The pertinence of the fitted curve is remarkable(R2>0.9,p<0.05) and the curve could be used by the legal medical experts to infer the time interval after

T1  - Mechanisms of malathion resistance in sitobion avenae
AN  - 1870388844
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) has affect on wheat yield and quality, wheat aphid is one of the most important pests on wheat, almost distributed in the major wheat producing area of the world, the wheat aphid not only suck the juice, but also is major media which spread the virus and disease of wheat. It has strong fecundity and short life cycle, so the wheat aphid has high frequency in population. Currently pesticides was used to control the wheat aphid, because of chemicals was used in large areas for a long time and its unique biological characteristics, the resistance of wheat aphid has been widely reported as a major pest control problem. Malathion was used on grain aphid (Sitobion avenae)for resistance selection in the laboratory, meanwhile the anti-elimination was used on sensitivity, two strain were obtained after resistance selection of 40 generation and susceptible strain selection of 3 generation, also do research on the cross-resistance spectrum of resistant strains was also determined. Esterase specific activity and kinetic constants of malathion-resistant and susceptible strains were tested with α-NA as the substrate, Glutathione transferase (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of malathion-resistant and susceptible strains were also tested. The synergy of PBO, TPP, DEM and DEF to malathion-resistant and susceptible strains was studied. The mechanism of resistance on Malathion in grain aphid was ascertained through biochemical properties and synergist experiments. Malathion-resistant strain was selected using population selection method in laboratory, the resistance ration was increased to 32.66-fold in the malathion-resistant strain compared to a laboratory malathion-susceptible strain. The susceptibility of malathion-susceptible grain aphid were elevated 2.77-fold by single-selected. Resistance development trend show that the resistance rapidly was improved in a period under insecticide pressure in long-term resistance within a certain period of time. The cross-resistance spectrum of malathion to five insecticides show that malathion-resistant strain produce high cross-resistance to omethoate, then followed by deltamethrin, cypermethrin, methomyl and imidacloprid. The relationship between enzyme concentration, reaction time, temperature and CarE activity showed that, in a certain range of concentration, there is a basic linear relationship between enzyme concentration increases and increase the activity, there is a linear relationship between reaction time and enzyme activity in the beginning 20min; when the temperature is below 30℃, there is a relationship between temperature and enzyme activity. So the optimal reaction condition is: enzyme concentration is 30ml, reaction time is 20min, reaction temperature is 30℃. A comparative study of carboxylesterase(CarE)activity and kinetics constants, the glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) specific activity between malathion-resistant and susceptible strains were accomplished. Carboxylesterase(CarE) activity of malathion-resistant strains were significantly higher than the susceptible strain(P <0.05), while malathion-resistant strains of glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) specific activity were also significantly higher than the susceptible strain (P <0.05), the result of biochemical experiment show that malathion-resistance of grain aphid were related to carboxylesterase (CarE), and may be related to glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). By synergy study of PBO, TPP, DEM and DEF on resistant and susceptible strains of malathion, we found that TPP had the strongest synergies on malathion to resistant and susceptible strains. The efficiency ratio were 11.77 and 1.65; followed by DEM, and the efficiency ratio were 5.12 and 1.30; TPP and DEM on the susceptible strain of S. avenae synergies were weaker than the resistant strains, which Mingmai avenae sensitive to the sensitive strains. DEF and PBO to both malathion resistant strain was sensitive to the synergies are small. Synergist experiments proved once carboxylesterase in wheat aphid resistance to malathion in the work produced, but also that other non-specific esterase also play a

T1  - Impact of climate change on wind energy generation in the UK
AN  - 1442496494
AB  - The release of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels for energy is thought to be one of the main contributors to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This increase is reported to be causing irreversible changes to the earth’s climate, giving rise to temperature increases and other consequent alterations in weather patterns. Amid growing concern about climate change and its impact on the world, targets have been set through agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and via European Union and government legislation to force countries to work towards decreasing their greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing the contribution that renewable sources make to energy production is a major part of most countries’ strategies to meet these targets. The UK has arguably the greatest potential for wind power generation in Europe and the government is seeking to build upon this strength by exploiting the resource further. The liberalised electricity market infers a requirement for private investment in order to develop the wind portfolio and this in turn requires financial and economic feasibility. Given the changes in weather patterns that are projected to occur over the course of the coming century, the possibility that this could change the UK’s wind resource, and hence the financial viability of wind power developments, must be addressed. Other aspects of how changes in the wind resource could impact on the operation of the fragmented electricity system ought also to be considered in this context. This thesis attempts to understand how the current generation of climate models project surface wind climate to change, and seeks to make the model information relevant at a site level by using statistical and physical modelling techniques. The projected changes indicated by the models are small, and it has been assessed that potential impacts on the electricity system, from project feasibility to the potential for inclusion of wind in the generation mix, will be limited.

T1  - The thermal evolution of subduction zone lithosphere: evidence from the chemical development of mt ruapehu and surrounding vents, new zealand
AN  - 1314578881
AB  - Mt. Ruapehu is an andesite volcano located at the southwest termination of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) in the North Island of New Zealand where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the Australian Plate. Volcanism has migrated south with time as rifting from the Kermadec arc has propagated into the North Island lithosphere making Ruapehu the most recent addition to the TVZ. A detailed study of volcanic rocks and crustal xenoliths collected from Mt. Ruapehu and nearby satellite vents was conducted to establish how differentiation processes in arc magmas change with time in response to tectonic movements in the arc lithosphere. The thickness and composition of the arc crust in the southern TVZ directly controls the differentiation histories of magmas from Mt. Ruapehu and satellite vents. The crustal column beneath Ruapehu is composed of two main lithologies; a localised 5-10 km thick lower crustal meta-igneous granulite overlain by 20-25 km of meta-sediment. While fractional crystallisation is an important process in modifying the major and trace element concentrations, crustal assimilation plays a major role in modifying the isotopic composition of magmas from the southern TVZ. New trace element and isotope data for lavas and crustal xenoliths confirm a distinct change in assimilants between the oldest (Te Herenga - TH) and younger formations (Post Te Herenga - PTH) at Ruapehu. TH lavas are a product of lower crustal differentiation involving assimilation of meta-igneous granulite. PTH lavas display evidence for interaction with the same meta-igneous granulite followed by contamination with meta-sedimentary crust. This change in assimilant coincides with increased rates of extension at the southern tip of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). We propose that the change in melt-crust interaction reflected in major geochemical changes from TH to PTH lavas is a response to adjustments in differentiation depth. Peripheral satellite vents near Ruapehu have produced some of the most primitive lavas in the southern TVZ with compositions resembling high-Mg andesite. This contrasts with the central-northern TVZ where the most primitive lavas are high-alumina basalt. The spatial distribution of these two magma series has developed as a result of the evolution of TVZ lithosphere. High-Mg andesites appear to be generated from depleted mantle during the very earliest stages of arc development when the lithosphere is thicker causing fractionation at relatively deep levels. High-alumina basalts however, represent a more mature phase of arc development and are derived from relatively fertile mantle following lithospheric thinning causing fractionation at relatively shallow levels. Finally, new osmium isotope data from meta-igneous xenoliths indicate the lower crust beneath Ruapehu is not formed of altered Jurassic oceanic crust. The relatively unradiogenic 187Os/188Os ratios of the xenoliths instead suggest they represent localised underplated material, which has only developed beneath the graben axis where the magma flux is greatest.

T1  - Effect of growth trajectories on adult performance and lifespan in three-spined sticklebacks
AN  - 1314565781
AB  - Changes in environmental conditions in early life can cause changes in the tempo and pattern of growth and development in animals. Natural selection favours processes that enable animals to make decisions that maximise Darwinian fitness. These decisions are influenced by trade-offs between current and future benefits. An episode of poor conditions (i.e. reduced nutrition, low temperature and changes in photoperiod) is generally linked to a slowing of growth. If adequate conditions are restored after this episode, growth rate is accelerated and normal adult size can be reached; in other words, ‘compensatory’ growth occurs. Compensatory growth has benefits in enabling a return to the typical size-at-age growth trajectory. Although this ability to alter growth rate provides a degree of adaptability, there is now increasing evidence that resource allocation to rapid growth carries various long-term costs. While there is experimental evidence that poor environmental conditions in early life can induce subsequent compensatory growth, little is known about the long-term effects of compensatory growth on locomotor and reproductive performance, and on lifespan. In this thesis, I investigated how different growth trajectories affected subsequent performance (i.e. locomotory capability, reproduction and lifespan), and how any such effects were influenced by the perceived time until the key life history event of reproduction. Using juvenile three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), I showed that temperature manipulations early in life in three temperature treatments (low, intermediate and high, independent of food supply) or food restriction (with a constant temperature) affected skeletal growth trajectory not only during the manipulation itself, but also during a subsequent compensatory phase. To investigate the effects of time of year, all experimental groups of temperature and food manipulations were replicated at different seasonal periods (= Winter or Spring); to manipulate apparent time of year while holding initial size and maturity constant, a photoperiod manipulation was also undertaken at both seasonal times (ambient or delayed photoperiod). While there was compensatory growth (i.e. accelerated growth) in the food manipulation, temperature manipulations induced both positive compensatory growth (i.e. growth acceleration following exposure to low temperature) and also ‘negative’ compensatory growth (decelerated growth following exposure to high temperature). The outcome of these changes was that fish in all treatment groups reached the same average size by sexual maturity, despite having different growth patterns. However, early growth trajectories influenced both pre-breeding swimming endurance and its decline over the course of the breeding season, such that swimming ability was negatively correlated with compensatory growth whereas ‘negative’ compensatory growth reduced swimming ability less (Chapter 2). Reproductive investment (males: sexual ornaments and ability to build nests; females: first clutch size and mean egg size) was negatively affected by compensatory growth; positive effects of ‘negative’ compensatory growth on reproduction were found (Chapter 3). Interestingly, the effects of growth rate on subsequent swimming and reproductive performance were greater when the perceived, or actual, time until the breeding season was shorter (Chapter 2 and 3). These results implied that increased metabolic rates and cellular damage (e.g. oxidative stress) induced by compensatory growth negatively affected subsequent performance, while decelerated growth reduced the damage levels and so later performance was less affected. Under food manipulation, there were similar patterns: compensatory growth (i.e. accelerated growth) negatively affected locomotor and reproductive performance and the time until the breeding season altered the effects on performance (Chapter 4). To further examine trade-offs between growth rate and fitness parameters such as future reproductive investment and rates of senescence, I developed four theoretical models of increasing complexity with different growth-damage scenarios, ranging from assuming that the animal maximises growth regardless of any costs, through assuming a relationship between growth rate and mortality risk, to assuming growth leads to damage accumulation and that the animal is able to apportion resources between somatic growth, gonadal growth and investment in repair of damage. The models predicted that growth trajectories strongly influenced future reproductive investment irrespective of body size at the time of breeding, presumably due to the effects of damage accumulation in the run up to the breeding season; the predictions of the most complex model were closest to the experimental data on egg production (Chapter 5). Lifespan was different among treatment groups and also influenced by early growth trajectories. Compensatory growth negatively affected lifespan whereas ‘negative’ compensatory growth extended lifespan. Lifespan in female sticklebacks was positively related to egg production. Male sticklebacks lived for a shorter time when they showed less growth between their first and second breeding seasons, and a greater change in the duration of having a red throat between the first and second breeding season (an indicator of reproductive senescence). The costs of compensation were strongest when the perceived time until breeding was shortest (Chapter 6). Consequently, this thesis shows that environment conditions in early life have substantial effects on subsequent performances and lifespan. Moreover, results in this thesis strongly support the time-stress hypothesis, that is the time available until the onset of a key life history event, in this case reproduction, influences outcomes.

T1  - Genetic and dietary determinants of allostatic load and chronic disease in the Boston Puerto Rican health study
AN  - 305169308
AB  - Background. Puerto Ricans living in the US have a high prevalence of multiple chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension and obesity. As nearly four million Puerto Ricans live in the US, responding to the health issues of this ethnic group is imperative. Allostatic load (AL) is being explored as a possible mechanism for the health disparities observed in minority groups. AL refers to the cumulative dysregulation of physiological parameters in response to stressors, and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality risk. Individual genetic variations and behavioral responses, such as diet, may also alter the way a person responds physiologically to stress. Variations in minor allele frequencies (MAF) and in population differentiation (FST) in populations contribute to group differences in some common complex diseases, and can indicate local adaptation to environmental pressures. Genetic variability in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may partly explain the response to diet in the manifestation of AL and disease. Genetic and AL research in Puerto Ricans are limited.   Objective. To determine the genetic and dietary factors that contribute to AL and chronic disease in Puerto Ricans by: (1) computing MAF and FST for 101 SNPs in 30 genes of lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammation response, in comparison with non-Hispanic whites (NHW), (2) determining the association between SNPs in selected gene loci, alone, and in interaction with dietary fat intake, with physiological parameters of AL, and (3) estimating the associations of AL with chronic disease in Puerto Ricans.    Methods. Analysis was conducted with data from questionnaires and biological samples collected from participants of the Boston-Puerto Rican Heath Study (n=1360, ages 45 to 75 y). MAF and FST measures were calculated to prioritize selection of SNPs for association analysis. SNPs in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 cluster were analyzed, alone, and in interaction with total dietary fat, for association with 10 parameters of AL. Logistic regressions were run to determine association of AL categories with chronic diseases.   Results. Puerto Ricans had significantly different MAF distribution in 46% of SNPs than similarly aged NHW. They had lower frequency of protective alleles and greater prevalence of risk alleles for disease-associated SNPs. Puerto Ricans showed exceptional FST values in SNPs from chromosome 11, and in intronic, non-synonymous and promoter SNPs. Twelve SNPs analyzed in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 cluster were not associated with AL parameters, but interactions with dietary fat intake were observed. Puerto Ricans carrying the common allele of APOA1-75, APOA4 N147S or APOA5 S19W had lower waist circumference and blood pressure only when consuming less than 31% of total fat from energy. At this intake level, elevated plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol was observed for subjects with APOA5 -1131T>C common allele. Increasing categories of AL were significantly associated with abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes and self-reported CVD and arthritis, but not with self-reported cancer.    Conclusions. Puerto Rican older adults living in Boston present high prevalence of several chronic conditions. Their unique genetic profile, in interaction with total dietary fat intake, modulates physiological parameters of AL in a way that may partly explain health disparities in this group. Puerto Ricans experience AL that is associated with increased odds of some chronic conditions. The results of this dissertation suggest prospective implications in public health and research, such as an approach for selection of candidate genes for association studies, a novel AL definition, and targeted dietary interventions for Puerto Ricans.

T1  - Evolutionary consequences of the introduction of <i>Eleutherodactylus coqui</i> to Hawaii
AN  - 305010419
AB  - The introduction of a species to areas outside its native range can result in ecological and genetic changes of evolutionary significance. The frog  Eleutherodactylus coqui was introduced to Hawaii, from Puerto Rico, in the late 1980s and has lost genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. The extent to which founder effects have influenced phenotypic variation in the introduced range is unknown. In this study I compared phenotypic variation in life-history traits, advertisement calls, and stripe patterns among introduced and native populations of the frog Eleutherodactylus coqui. I also conducted laboratory experiments to determine the influence of genetics and temperature on trait variation. Body size in wild populations was positively correlated with elevation in both ranges, but the slope of elevation on body size was greater in Puerto Rico than in Hawaii. Advertisement call frequencies and rates were negatively correlated with elevation but duration was positively correlated with elevation. Frequencies were correlated with body size, but rate, duration, and intensity were not. Color patterns are more variable in Puerto Rico than Hawaii and appear to be maintained by balancing selection in Puerto Rico. Lab results indicate that body size is negatively correlated with temperature, which may explain Bergmann's rule in the field, but patterns of intrinsic growth rate may explain differences in the effect of elevation between Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Body size appears to explain most of the variation in call frequencies, whereas temperature explained most of the variation in rate and duration. Color patterns appear to be determined by a single locus with five alleles. Founder effects appear to explain the difference between Hawaii and Puerto Rico in color pattern variation and in clinal variation in body size and call frequencies. The loss of genetic variation in these traits is likely to have evolutionary consequences for this species in Hawaii.

T1  - Modeling the evolution of insect phenology with particular reference to mountain pine beetle
AN  - 305009142
AB  - Climate change is likely to disrupt the timing of developmental events (phenology) in insect populations in which development time is largely determined by temperature. Shifting phenology puts insects at risk of being exposed to seasonal weather extremes during sensitive life stages and losing synchrony with biotic resources. Additionally, warming may result in loss of developmental synchronization within a population, making it difficult to find mates or mount mass attacks against well-defended resources at low population densities. It is unknown whether genetic evolution of development time can occur rapidly enough to moderate these effects.   The work presented here is largely motivated by the need to understand how mountain pine beetle (MPB) populations will respond to climate change. MPB is an important forest pest from both an economic and ecological perspective, because MPB outbreaks often result in massive timber loss. Recent MPB range expansion and increased outbreak frequency have been linked to warming temperatures.    We present a novel approach to modeling the evolution of phenology by allowing the parameters of a phenology model to evolve in response to selection on emergence time and density. We also develop a temperature-dependent phenology model for MPB that accounts for multiple types of developmental variation: variation that persists throughout a life stage, random variation, and variation due to the MPB oviposition mechanism. This model is parameterized using MPB development time data from constant temperature laboratory experiments.   We use Laplace's method to approximate steady distributions of the evolution model under stable temperatures. Here the mean phenotype allows for parents and offspring to be oviposited at exactly the same time of year in consecutive generations. These results are verified numerically for both MPB and a two-stage model insect.   The evolution model is also applied to investigate the evolution of phenology for MPB and the two-stage model insect under warming temperatures. The model predicts that local populations can only adapt to climate change if development time can adapt so that individuals can complete exactly one generation per year and if the rate of temperature change is moderate.

T1  - Geographic variation in species demography and community structure in temperate rocky reefs
AN  - 305004493
AB  - Geographic variation in coastal marine upwelling creates a complex seascape of environmental conditions that underlie biogeographic patterns of demographic rates, species distributions, and the structure of marine assemblages. Quantitative descriptions of spatial and temporal variation in assemblages can identify potential processes that regulate structure and dynamics of species at different scales. Understanding the spatial patterns of species demography and structure of assemblages across the seascape also informs more applied endeavors such as fisheries management, conservation of species diversity and species response to global change. This dissertation addresses patterns of community structure and demographic variation of populations in temperate kelp forest ecosystems and explores mechanisms that may generate these patterns.    In Chapter 1, I present one of the first comprehensive studies of kelp forest community structure across variable upwelling conditions. Variation in the strength and frequency of upwelling can influence coastal marine assemblages through bottom-up effects of temperature, nutrients, and larval delivery. However, high variability in community structure may exist at local scales due to species interactions, habitat structure, and other local-scale processes. I ask whether benthic species vary across regional scales (10s-100s km), reflecting variation in upwelling, or at local-scales (1-10s km), signaling possible effects of local processes. From replicate detailed surveys of kelp forest flora and fauna, I explicitly test the assumption that subtidal benthic communities exhibit variation in the abundance of dominant benthic functional groups associated with regional-scale variation in upwelling. I demonstrate that upwelling processes regulate biomass of functional groups in kelp forest assemblages, but that local-scale patterns are important for some species, highlighting the need to look at both aggregate and compositional aspects of natural assemblages.    In Chapters 2 and 3, I compare life history traits (i.e. growth, fecundity, and survival) among populations of Megastraea undosa, a benthic turbinid snail, across different upwelling regimes. Geographic variation in life history traits underlies patterns of population persistence, biogeography, evolutionary biology, and predicted response to global change and resource management; but, geographic variation in life history traits has received little attention, particularly in marine conservation and management.    Variation in coastal upwelling dynamics leads to differences in both temperature and food availability, two factors that can affect energy available for individual maintenance, reproduction and growth. However, temperature and food availability are negatively correlated in coastal marine systems dominated by upwelling and may lead to reduced energy available for multiple life history traits. In Chapter 2, I examine whether geographic variation in upwelling leads to trade-offs between growth and reproduction in  Megastraea undosa, and whether geographic differences in trade-offs lead to differences in average individual fitness between populations. Using mark-recapture and histology techniques, I demonstrate that geographic variation in trade-offs between growth and reproduction exists and is related to variation in upwelling. In cold, nutrient-rich waters, higher growth rates lead to lower reproductive allocation, while in regions of less persistent upwelling, the opposite occurs. However, these two different life history strategies lead to similar lifetime cumulative reproductive output between regions. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple life history traits rather than single traits when examining geographic variation in population dynamics. Furthermore, I show that applying similar fisheries regulations across populations with varying demography may result in local depletion of populations.    In Chapter 3, I examine whether a relationship between seawater temperature and individual growth of M. undosa exists, and if this relationship varies with regional variation in upwelling conditions. I reconstruct time series of water temperature and growth of M. undosa using isotopes and growth marks in calcium carbonate opercula. Results indicate that M. undosa growth is correlated with water temperature, but the direction of the correlation depends on upwelling region. The mechanisms causing spatial variation in these relationships are likely the direct effects of temperature on metabolism coupled with the indirect responses of the dominant macroalgae to upwelling intensity and energy allocation to other vital rates.

T1  - Experimental population dynamics of <i>Amyloodinium ocellatum</i> in the spotted seatrout, <i>Cynoscion nebulosus</i>, and the red snapper, <i>Lutjanus campechanus</i>
AN  - 304998298
AB  - Amyloodinium ocellatum is a parasitic dinoflagellate that infects warm water marine bony fishes and causes high mortalities in aquaculture settings. It has three life history stages: the feeding trophont, the reproductive tomont, and the infective dinospore. This dissertation describes the characteristics of A. ocellatum infections in juvenile spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus, and red snapper,  Lutjanus campechanus, studies the survival and fecundities of the stages in the life cycle of the parasite and presents a population model for  A. ocellatum.    At 25°C and 33 ppt, the peak of trophont detachment occurred on day 2 post-infection in spotted seatrout and day 3 in red snapper. Trophont mean length at detachment was significantly larger in red snapper than in spotted seatrout (80 versus 72 µm, respectively), which translates to an increased mean dinospore production in red snapper (99 dinospores tomont−1  versus 82 in spotted seatrout). There was no difference either in the dinospore infection rate (0.36 and 0.34 dinospores d−1 for spotted seatrout and red snapper, respectively) or in the dinospore lethal dose (237,243 and 141,010 dinospores fish−1 for spotted seatrout and red snapper, respectively) between host species, but the mean trophont lethal load was higher in spotted seatrout (178,067 trophonts fish −1) than in red snapper (123,160 trophonts fish−1 ) suggesting that the red snapper is less tolerant of A. ocellatum  infections than spotted seatrout.    The mean number of offspring per generation per individual for  A. ocellatum (R0) was 49.15 dinospores tomont−1  with a generation time of 6.3 d. These rates were estimated using the mean tomont size for infections in spotted seatrout. Analysis of the population model revealed that changes in the mean number of dinospores tomont −1 had the largest effect on A. ocellatum population growth, followed by the dinospore infection rate, the tomont sporulation rate and the dinospore mortality rate. A higher A. ocellatum population growth rate was observed in infections in red snapper than in spotted seatrout. These studies elucidate the dynamics of the life cycle of A. ocellatum  and demonstrate the critical life cycle control points at which management strategies can be focused.

T1  - A brittle damage model in thermoelastodynamics
AN  - 304985107
AB  - The response of brittle materials subjected to dynamic thermomechanical loading is investigated. In particular, simulations are used to determine the role of material property dependence on the microstructure of a brittle material, and to determine the viability of modeling thermal phenomena associated with brittle failure within the framework of continuum damage mechanics (CDM). A system of equations is derived via the theory of internal state variables that fully couples the elastic, thermal, and microstructure evolution of a thermoelastic material with isotropic damage. Dynamic effects in the equations of motion and the intrinsically local nature of the constitutive equations are carefully studied.    A new implementation of the finite element method is proposed for finding approximate solutions to the derived model. The damage variable is treated as a field, as opposed to the common method of considering values of the damage at the quadrature points. In this way, the damage is treated in the general framework of finite element methods. A key element of the proposed numerical formulation is the use of a piecewise constant approximate solution space for the damage variable.    This is physically motivated; not only is the damage variable local, it is most often the result of homogenization over a representative volume element, and therefore evolves in a piecewise constant manner according to the mesh. Adaptive mesh refinement is implemented to keep the size of higher dimensional problems reasonable, and also to properly resolve the morphology of the damage field. Brittle behavior is captured by defining a minimum mesh size and allowing the damage variable to grow rapidly, as is physically the case in fracture.    Failure induced thermal heating is observed in the simulations. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first presentation of such a result in the context of CDM for brittle materials. The specific heat and its dependence on the damage variable/microstructure were found to play an extremely important role in this heating. Therefore, further study (both theoretical and experimental) of the effects of failure mechanisms on the specific heat appear to be particularly important to better understand the failure of brittle materials subjected to thermomechanical loading. Specific issues in the modeling of an intrinsically discontinuous phenomena like fracture within a continuous theory are discussed.

T1  - Foraging, feeding, energetics, and environment: Interactions between physiology and ecology of Gila monsters
AN  - 304942280
AB  - The ecology of Gila monsters is largely related to the endurance of unpredictable resource availability, and to the tolerance of predictably harsh environmental conditions. Gila monsters use a novel suite of behavioral, physiological and morphological adaptations to overcome the vagaries of their desert habitat, and as a result, they survive by interacting with their environment in unique ways that would seem impossible for other species.    This dissertation investigates the physiological and ecological consequences of the unique ways in which Gila monsters interact with their environment. Each chapter analyzes different aspects of how individuals acquire, process, store, and use essential food and water resources, while simultaneously managing the constraints and opportunities provided by the environment.    Chapter one is a laboratory study that investigates the thermal preferences of Gila monsters, the effects of feeding on body temperature selection, and the ability of individuals to physiologically control heat exchange. These investigations set the stage for the ecological importance of body temperature regulation, and also provide a baseline by which to appropriately measure behavioral thermoregulation.    Chapter two explores the importance of temperature regulation by Gila monsters in the field. The physical limitations imposed by the thermal environment are used as a framework to analyze trade-offs between foraging activity and thermoregulation. In order to forage, lizards must nearly always tolerate thermal conditions that are outside of their preferred range, but in doing so, they sacrifice their ability to thermoregulate and risk reduced performance.    Chapter three examines the influences of body temperature regulation and activity on the use of energy and water. The magnitude of energy use is measured directly, and specific components of energy partitioning are modeled mathematically to yield seasonal and annual energy budgets for Gila monsters in southern Nevada. These analyses are then extended to a larger geographic scale, and the effects of both environmental variation (temperature) and individual variation (body mass) are used to simulate differences in resting energy use between four ecologically distinct populations of Gila monsters.    Each of these chapters takes an eco-physiological approach to investigating the interactions between Gila monsters and their environment. While in some ways Gila monsters may seem maladapted to desert life, I show how they use specific behavioral and physiological strategies to overcome environmental limitations.

T1  - Development and applications of second-order turbulence closures for mixing in overflows
AN  - 304922771
AB  - Mixing between overflows and ambient water masses is a crucial problem of deep-water formation in the down-welling branch of the meridional overturning circulation of the ocean. In this dissertation work, performance of second-order turbulence closures in reproducing mixing of overflows is investigated within both hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models.    First, a 2D non-hydrostatic model is developed to simulate the Red Sea overflow in the northern channel. The model results are compared to the Red Sea Outflow Experiment. It is found that the experiments without sub-grid scale models cannot reproduce the basic structure of the overflow. The k-&egr; model yields unrealistically thick bottom layer (BL) and interfacial layer (IL). A new technique so-called very large eddy simulation (VLES) which allows the use of k-&egr; model in non-hydrostatic models is also employed. It is found that VLES results the most realistic reproduction of the observations. Furthermore, the non-hydrostatic model is improved by introducing laterally average terms, so the model can simulate the constrictions not only in the z-direction but also in the y-direction. Observational data from the Bosphorus Strait is employed to test the spatially average 2D non-hydrostatic model (SAM) in a realistic application. The simulations from SAM with a simple Smagorinsky type closure appear to be excessively diffusive and noisy. We show that SAM can benefit significantly from VLES turbulence closures.    Second, the performance of different second-order turbulence closures is extensively tested in a hydrostatic model. Four different two-equation turbulence closures (k-&egr;, k-ω, Mellor-Yamada 2.5 (MY2.5) and a modified version of k-&egr;) and K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) are selected for the comparison of 3D numerical simulations of the Red Sea overflow. All two-equation turbulence models are able to capture the vertical structure of the Red Sea overflow consisting of the BL and IL. MY2.5 with Galperin stability functions produce the largest salinity deviations from the observations along two sections across the overflow and the modified k-&egr; exhibits the smallest deviations. The rest of the closures fall in between, showing deviations similar to one another.    Four different closures (k-&egr;, k-ω, MY2.5KC and KPP) are also employed to simulate the Mediterranean outflow. The numerical results are compared with observational data obtained in the 1988 Gulf of Cadiz Expedition. The simulations with two-equation closures reproduce the observed properties of the overflow quite well, especially the evolution of temperature and salinity profiles. The vertically integrated turbulent salt flux displays that the overflow goes under significant mixing outside the west edge of the Strait of Gibraltar. The volume transport and water properties of the outflow are modified significantly in the first 50 km after the overflow exits the strait. The k-&egr; and k-ω cases show the best agreement with the observations.    Finally, the interaction between the Red Sea overflow and Gulf of Aden (GOA) eddies has been investigated. It is found that the overflow is mainly transported by the undercurrent at the west side of the gulf. The transport of the overflow is episodic depending on the strength and location of GOA eddies. The most crucial finding is that the Red Sea overflow leaves the Gulf of Aden in patches rather than one steady current. Multiple GOA eddies induce lateral stirring, thus diapycnal mixing of the Red Sea outflow.

T1  - The sensitivity and adaptability of the grape and wine industry in the Maule Region of Chile to climate change
AN  - 304888302
AB  - This paper examines the sensitivity and adaptability of the Chilean grape and wine industry to climate change in the context of other stresses via a case study in the Maule Region. The research was conducted using a vulnerability approach, which is based on the empirical documentation of exposures and adaptive capacity. Key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews and a focus group were used as the primary data sources. The climatic exposures to which growers and producers are exposed include wet springs, spring frosts, wet falls, high growing season temperatures, and drought. These exposures were placed in the context of other conditions, including market price, currency fluctuations, national and international rules and regulations, and labour availability. The Maule Region has not developed extensive suites of adaptation strategies because the grower- and producer-identified exposures have not yet threatened their operations' viability. Future climate change may be beneficial and accommodate the cultivation of new varieties. However, many of the climatic exposures are projected to be exacerbated into the future, and the adaptive strategies currently used may not be effective into the future. The national government, a lack of education and market uncertainty hinder the industry's ability to manage exposures.

T1  - Establishment and productivity of irrigated switchgrass across ecozones in California
AN  - 304837027
AB  - Bioethanol has been produced from maize grains in the US. Several negative aspects of maize based bioethanol have been reported, such as low ethanol productivity and net energy production (Pimentel 1996, 2001; Pimentel and Patzek 2005) and high greenhouse gas emissions (Adler et al. 2007). However, technology is being developed to produce ethanol from cellulose, proposed to offer energy and environmental and economic advantages over current biofuel sources (Schmer et al. 2008).    Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from urban and agricultural wastes, such as rice and wheat straw, wood chips from tree pruning and dedicated energy crops. High biomass yielding crops, like switchgrass (Panicum virgatum ), are candidates to be used solely as cellulosic energy crops. Switchgrass has been promoted as a biofuel crop because of its high yield potential, relatively low fertilizer requirement, soil conservation attributes and compatibility with conventional farming practices (McLaughlin 1992).    Switchgrass is a C4 warm-season perennial grass native to the North American Prairies. It has been grown in the US as a forage crop, for grazing and for ground cover. Only recently it has received attention as a promising cellulosic biofuel crop. Most research on switchgrass has been conducted in the Midwest and Southern US under rain-fed conditions and little is known about the adaptability and productivity of switchgrass in California. Basic information, such as establishment methods, weed control options and optimal fertilization under irrigated condition remains lacking. In addition, California is composed of different ecozones, ranging from high elevation intermountain regions, to Mediterranean climates and true deserts, where switchgrass adaptability and yield response to nitrogen will differ.

T1  - Development of biomimetic systems for biofuel cell applications
AN  - 276224646
AB  - Biomimics have been developed and characterized in order to further the understanding and the technology of bioelectrocatalysis. Glycerol, which is a natural product and also a byproduct of biodiesel production, has had limited success as a fuel as a result of its poor catalytic oxidation on traditional precious metals. However, since glycerol is a natural compound that has a natural metabolic pathway in living organisms, it remains a possibility to be efficiently oxidized to carbon dioxide by using biological catalysts. To do this a non-natural metabolic pathway was developed that uses a three enzyme cascade that had low substrate specificity and good direct electron transfer to carbon electrode materials. This allows glycerol and other similar compounds to be completely oxidized without the complexity of a natural pathway which would require many more steps.    Another method of accomplishing complete oxidation is using the organelle responsible for cellular energy generation, the mitochondria. Since the mitochondria already contain all of the necessary enzymes, cofactors, and pathways for complete oxidation of pyruvate and fatty acids, it is an ideal package for energy conversion. Mitochondrial bioanodes were developed and characterized for energy conversion of pyruvate and fatty acids in a biofuel cell system. In this study, the immobilized mitochondria were shown to be intact and viable by traditional viability assays, and the electron transport mechanism to the carbon electrode was probed.    In an effort to develop a totally synthetic, but biologically inspired catalyst for oxygen reduction, phthalocyanine doped carbon nanotubes were synthesized and characterized. This included development of a low temperature solvothermal synthesis of multiwalled carbon nanotubes by the reduction of carbon tetrachloride with iron metal powder in supercritical hexane. Then, using the same synthesis, perchlorinated phthalocyanine was added to the reaction so that the phthalocyanine is incorporated into the growing graphitic sheets of carbon. This yielded carbon nanotubes that contained catalytic sites where a chelated metal atom demonstrated similar catalysis as seen in biological catalysts, such as cytochrome c, but was designed for optimal operation in a fuel cell instead of a cellular environment.

T1  - Evolutionary ecology of symbionts within free-living and host environments in the sepiolid squid-<i>Vibrio</i> symbiosis
AN  - 205459449
AB  - Most microorganisms experience variable environments which at least occasionally involve periods of harsh and extreme conditions that impose stress and hinder optimal performance of microbial physiology, metabolism, survival, and fitness. Microorganisms have evolved sophisticated, elaborate, and complex stress responses to regulate and mitigate the negative effects of stress in an attempt to maintain homeostasis. The different stress responses (e.g., heat shock and starvation) involve crosstalk to each other and are cross-connected in manifold ways to determinants of symbiosis, defined here to include mutualisms, parasitisms, host-pathogen relationships, and commensalisms. How stress impacts microbial diversity, ecology, and evolution is not entirely clear and is an interesting question. The sepiolid squid-Vibrio mutualism is an ideal model system to explore this problem. The aim of this dissertation was to investigate how environmental variation, abiotic factors, exposure to novel hosts, and stressors influence the evolutionary ecology of the symbiont  Vibrio fischeri and what the potential consequences are to its free-living and host-associated phases, along with the accompanying overall effect on the symbiosis itself. Growth curve studies showed temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability can synergistically interact and affect symbiont reproduction, abundance, competition, and allelopathy prior to their encounter with host squid. Furthermore, these results suggested the distribution patterns of the hosts could be a contributor in shaping how V. fischeri  biomass production responds to abiotic factors and stress during the planktonic lifestyle. Subsequent co-infection studies with dissimilar strains in squid showed how proportions of different symbiont types can modify the outcome of host colonization, including the countervailing of competitive dominance. Microbial experimental evolution indicated that V. fischeri  is capable of rapid adaptation to environmentally stressful and novel host environments. Both of these perspectives are related, since host immunity imparts its own particular set of advosarial stresses. Temporal population genetic studies of V. fischeri isolated from animals provided a macroscale evolutionary viewpoint into the coevolution of the symbionts with their host squid. Genomic resequencing of experimentally evolved  V. fischeri in E. tasmanica identified genes potentially responsible for the adaptation to this host. Phenotypic characterization indicated evidence of convergent evolution between derived lines through E. tasmanica and "ET" wild isolates procured from field-caught specimens of this same squid host species.

T1  - Sexual selection and reproductive compatibility in tribolium castaneum
AN  - 1802522697
AB  - The following statements summarise the key findings described in this thesis.Â  (1) A global sample of 22 T. castaneum populations revealed considerable inter-strain variance in a number of morphometric traits and nuclear genes (AFLP).Â  (2) Molecular phylogeography suggests that, almost certainly due to human activity, flour beetles quickly colonised the globe.Â  (3) Against RENSCHâ��s rule, sexual size dimorphism across T. castaneum strains was positively correlated with body size.Â  (4) The fitness of inter-strain crosses in most cases did not differ from intra-strain crosses, but when they did the crosses showed outbreeding depression.Â  (5) Reproductive success showed a gradual and significant decline with increasing genetic distance between mates.Â  (6) Artificial selection across 20 generations with contrasting levels of sexual selection/conflict altered female, but not male reproductive traits, and there was evidence for both â��good genesâ�� and sexual conflict.Â  (7) I found no strong support for accelerated evolution of reproductive isolation under elevated sexual selection/conflict.Â  (8) Eight generations of inbreeding resulted in decreased reproductive success, sperm competitive ability, egg size and increased intra-male variance in sperm length.Â  (9) Inbred beetles of both sexes were able to restore their fitness by mating monogamously with non-inbred main stock individuals.Â  (10) Polyandry was an effective way for inbred females to avoid inbreeding depression.Â  (11) Larval density negatively influenced spermathecal size and complexity.Â  (12) Against BERGMANNâ��s rule, sperm were longer in males that developed at higher temperatures.

T1  - Seasonal effects of treated sewage effluents upon the reproduction and development of european freshwater molluscs
AN  - 1783894853
AB  - The most widespread evidence of environmental endocrine disruption in aquatic wildlife is from the feminising effects of oestrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds. However, very little is known of the effects of these chemicals (and others) upon freshwater molluscs found in our river and lakes. This thesis aimed at evaluating the effects of treated sewage effluent upon the reproductive and developmental cycle of a range of commonly found European freshwater gastropod molluscs. Initial mesocosm experiments were undertaken to test a range of mollusc species for their the suitability to the experimental system, and to test adult snails for their reproductive and developmental responses during spring to summer time. With suitable species chosen, P.corneus, a pulmonate species (sequential hermaphrodite), and V. Viviparus a prosobranch species (dioeious; separate sexes), full reproductive output was assessed over summertime and into autumn, along with developmental responses amongst the F1 generation of snails. My results suggest that the affects of effluent upon the reproductive and developmental cycle of P. corneus are strongly mitigated by both day length and water temperature (day length is most important with V. viviparus); results are sensitive to seasonal effects. However, at the peak of reproduction mid summer, P. corneus produced significantly more egg masses in effluent (100% effluent particularly), and more than one parameter of reproduction was affected. Egg masses were significantly smaller in effluent and contained significantly fewer eggs per mass. Further, there were indications that total reproductive output was increased (100% effluent significantly) in effluent compared to the river water control. In the prosobranch species V. viviparus results were less convincing, however, in 100% effluent a second reproductive peak occurred that was not seen in river water. Further, in both species there was a failure of certain reproductive parameters to observe the normal seasonal decline towards winter. In P. corneus there was a failure to stop producing egg masses in effluent, in V. viviparus the second reproductive peak in effluent could also threaten their survival with winter approaching. Developmental effects in the F1 generation were the subject of preliminary investigations, however, F1 V. viviparus demonstrated a higher than normal incidence of intersex (male and female developmental features) in effluent, and P. corneus appeared to have disturbed reproductive function (disturbance of both male and female reproductive function in the ovotestis). Therefore, both of these species of molluscs demonstrated that they are sensitive to the effects of effluent in mesocosm studies. However, we need to understand much more about their responses to effluent; in particular whether these effects could have repercussions for wild mollusc populations, and whether these effects could occur over more than one generation of snail threatening the survival of wild populations of molluscs.
