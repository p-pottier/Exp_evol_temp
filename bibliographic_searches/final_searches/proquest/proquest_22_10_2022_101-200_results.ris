T1  - Efeito das Altas Temperaturas de Verão Observadas no pólo de Conservação da Videira de Pegões Sobre a Concentração do Vírus do Enrolamento Foliar da Videira Tipo 3 (GLRaV3) em seis Castas
AN  - 2723853177
AB  - A vinha pode ser alvo de várias pragas e doenças parasitárias, entre elas diversas viroses. Atualmente, estão identificados vários vírus responsáveis por algumas dessas patologias da videira embora apenas alguns afetem a sua produtividade, maturação e longevidade. A doença do enrolamento foliar da videira é a virose que está mais expandida pelas vinhas portuguesas, sendo Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV3) o mais difundido.Em Pegões está o Pólo de Conservação da Diversidade da Videira da Associação Portuguesa para a Diversidade da Videira (PORVID), associação esta responsável pela seleção clonal das videiras em Portugal. Alguns clones localizados nesse Pólo Experimental foram testados por ELISA em 2013 para o GLRaV-3 tendo resultados positivos. Nos anos seguintes os mesmos clones não manifestaram sintomas, pelo que com este estudo pretende-se analisar se essas videiras continuam infetadas por GLRaV3 de modo a verificar se as elevadas temperaturas de verão na região influenciam a presença do vírus na planta e respetiva manifestação dos sintomas da doença.No verão de 2017 fez-se acompanhamento visual dos sintomas das plantas de vários clones em seis castas e, em Setembro, fez-se a recolha das amostras e os testes ELISA de modo a analisar a concentração de GLRaV-3. Após a análise dos resultados mostrou-se conveniente fazer uma nova visita ao campo experimental em Pegões e tiraram-se novas fotografias a alguns clones estudados. Foi feito um estudo comparativo entre os resultados obtidos nos testes ELISA realizados em 2013 e em 2017, bem como entre os resultados de 2017 e a situação sintomática observada.Os resultados evidenciaram a existência de plantas isentas de GLRaV-3 em 2017 que, no entanto, estavam infetadas por este vírus em 2013. Nas plantas que continuaram positivas também houve várias situações em que os sintomas não se manifestaram, apesar da infeção pelo GLRaV-3 permanecer. Estes parâmetros sugerem que as temperaturas elevadas durante o verão em Pegões possam inativar ou até eliminar o vírus.Alternate abstract:Vineyards are the target to many pests and parasitic diseases, among them several viruses. There are currently identified several viruses responsible for some of these grapevine pathologies, although only a few affect their productivity, maturation, and longevity. The grapevine leafroll disease is the most expanded virus in the portuguese vines, being Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) the most widespread.In Pegões is located the Pole of Conservation of the Vineyard of the “Associação Portuguesa para a Diversidade da Videira” (PORVID), which is responsible for the clonal selection of grapevine in Portugal. Some of the clones in this experimental pole were submitted to ELISA in 2013 for the GLRaV-3 with positive results for the virus. During the following years the same clones showed no symptoms, so this study intends to analyze if these vines are still infected with GLRaV-3 in order to verify if the high summer temperatures in the region influence the presence of the virus in the plant and the manifestation of the disease symptoms.In the summer of 2017, plant symptoms were visually monitored in several clones from six grapevine varieties and, in September, the samples collected and ELISA tests for GLRaV-3 were carried out. After the analysis of the results, it was convenient to make a new visit to the experimental field in Pegões and new photos were taken to some studied clones. A comparative study was carried out between the results obtained in ELISA tests performed in 2013 and in 2017, as well as, between the results of 2017 and the symptomatic situation observed.The results showed the existence of GLRaV-3-free plants in 2017 that, however, were infected by this virus in 2013. In the plants that remained positive there were also several cases in which the symptoms were not present, although the GLRaV-3 infection still remains. These parameters suggest that summer temperatures in Pegões can inactivate or even eliminate the virus.

T1  - Energy Storage in Wind Farms
TT  - <html><head><meta name='ValidationSchema' content='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd'/><title></title></head><body>Armazenamento de Energia em Parques Eólicos</body></html>
AN  - 2700780196
AB  - In wind farms, due to the intermittency of the resource and to the fact that most wind parks have an installed power superior to the maximum power injectable into the grid, there is the need of curtailment, leading to resource and economic losses. Allied to these factors, in the future, wind generation should participate in the wholesale electricity market, being crucial the capacity to limit the generation in periods of low market price and to concentrate it in periods of higher price. In order to solve these issues, the use of energy storage systems is essential to store the power that otherwise would be wasted and to obtain a higher income to the wind farm. In this way, there is a need to develop algorithms able to correctly manage the energy storage system and also the wind resource.The main objective of this dissertation was to analyze the impact of an energy storage system, based on batteries, in wind farms. For such purpose, a management system for a wind farm with energy storage was designed. In order to ensure it, two management algorithms developed in MatLab environment were implemented, one with the objective of reducing wind power curtailment and the other, maintaining the curtailment as a priority, but also with the objective of maximizing the economic income of the wind park.The algorithms were tested and simulated for different scenarios and generation profiles and through the developed technical and economic analysis it was possible to verify the system viability. With the developed algorithms it was possible to reduce wind power curtailment and to increase the economic impacts of wind farms.Alternate abstract:Nos parques eólicos, devido à intermitência do recurso e ao facto de que, na sua maioria, possuem uma potência instalada superior à máxima potência injetável na rede, surge a necessidade de curtailment, resultando assim em desperdícios de geração e em perdas económicas. Para além de estes fatores, futuramente os parques eólicos serão renumerados em regime de mercado, sendo então crucial limitar a geração em períodos de preço baixo e concentrar a geração em períodos de preço elevado. De forma a resolver estes problemas, o uso de sistemas de armazenamento é essencial, para assim, armazenar a geração, que de outra forma seria desperdiçada e ao mesmo tempo aumentar o lucro do parque. Surge então a necessidade de desenvolver algoritmos capazes de fazerem a gestão correta, não só do sistema de armazenamento, mas também do recurso eólico.O principal objetivo desta dissertação foi analisar o impacto de um sistema de armazenamento de energia elétrica composto por baterias em parques eólicos. Para tal, foi desenvolvido um sistema de gestão de um parque eólico com armazenamento de energia. Com esse intuito, foram desenvolvidos dois algoritmos em ambiente MatLab, um com o objetivo de reduzir curtailment e outro, mantendo a redução do curtailment como prioridade, com o objetivo de maximizar o lucro do parque eólico.Ambos os algoritmos foram simulados e analisados em diferentes cenários e para diferentes níveis de geração, através da análise técnico-económica realizada foi possível verificar a viabilidade do sistema. Com os algoritmos desenvolvidos foi possível reduzir o curtailment assim como aumentar o impacto económico em parques eólicos.

T1  - Salinization of Freshwater Coastal Ecosystems: Possible Impacts on the Genetic Diversity of Zooplankton Populations
AN  - 2700778771
AB  - As previsões feitas no âmbito das alterações climáticas, apontam para a ocorrência do aumento do nível médio da água do mar e o aumento da frequência de eventos extremos (ex. secas prolongadas). Associado a estes eventos é expectável que ocorram intrusões de água do mar em regiões costeiras, nomeadamente sistemas aquáticos costeiros dulçaquícolas, provocando a sua salinização. Este aumento de salinidade pode comprometer a resiliência do biota que habita estas regiões. De facto, já foram publicados vários estudos que reportam os efeitos provocados por aumentos na salinidade quer a nível sub-individual que individual. No entanto, poucos são os trabalhos que avaliaram os efeitos de salinização na diversidade genética de populações de organismos dulçaquícolas. Sabe-se que a diversidade genética é um componente chave para as populações poderem lidar com perturbações ambientais. Deste modo, se uma exposição a salinização provocar um decréscimo na diversidade genética (por exemplo, através do morte dos gentótipos mais sensíveis) irá também causar uma diminuição na plasticidade evolutiva e resiliência dessa população a perturbação ambientais futuras. De acordo com o exposto, o presente trabalhado pretendeu compreender os efeitos de salinização na diversidade genética de populações do cladócero Daphnia lonhispinae do rotífero Brachionus calyciflorus, sob a influência de diferentes temperaturas. Para atingir este objectivo foram selecionadas seis linhagens clonais de D. longispina e seis linhagens clonais de,B. calyciflorus com diferentes sensibilidades letais a salinização. Cada linhagem clonal foi exposta a um controlo (ASTM) e ao valor de conductividade correspondente ao LC70,48h para D. longispina e ao LC70,24h para B. calyciflorus. A exposição e cada um destes dois tratamentos decorreu 17, 20 e 23ºC. A densidade populacional foi monitorizada diariamente durante todo o período de exposição. Baixos níveis de salinidade (4.8 to 9.7 mS/cm, comparativamente a valores de conductividade da água do mar de aprox. 35 mS/cm) provoracam reduções significativas na densidade populacional das diferentes linhagens clonais após curtos períodos de exposição, provocando a extinção de algumas das linhagens após longos períodos de exposição. As temperaturas extremas de 17ºC e 23ºC induziram efeitos mais intensos na densidade populacional que a temperatura de 20ºC. Verificou-se ainda uma alteração na ordem de sensibilidade entre as linhagens clonais quando comparando respostas a períodos de curta ou longa duração de exposição. Estes resultados e as suas consequências a nível populacional são discutidos no âmbito da hipótese de erosão devida a selecção natural.Alternate abstract:Under the context of climate changes, it is forsee a global sea level rise and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. Associated with such events (namely sea level rise and periods of intense drought) it is expected to occur the intrusion of seawater into coastal lowlying freshwater ecosystems, causing its salinization. Such salinization may compromise the resilience of natural populations inhabiting these coastal regions. Actually, several studies already reported adverse effects at sub-individual and individual level caused by exposure to increased salinity, but, only a few addressed the effects that salinization may cause in the genetic diversity of freshwater biota. Genetic diversity is a key for populations to be able to cope with environmental changes. Thus, if exposure to salinization leads to a decrease of a population’s genetic diversity (e.g. through the death of the most sensitive genotypes), it will as well reduce the population’s evolutionary plasticity and resilience under future perturbations. Accordingly with the mentioned previously, this work intended to understand the effects of salinization on the genetic diversity of populations of the cladoceran Daphnia longispina and rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, under different temperature regimes. For this, six lineages of D. longispina and six lineages of B. calciflorus, differing in their lethal sensitivity to salinity were selected. Lab-populations of each clonal lineage were maintained under optimal conditions until reaching a steady state. At this point, they were exposed to low salinity levels (corresponding to the LC70,48h and LC70,24h, respectively for the most toleranbt clonal lineage of D. longispina and B. calyciflorus) at 17, 20 or 23ºC, for at least 30 days. The population densities were monitored every day until the end of the experiment. Low levels of salinization (4.8 to 9.7 mS/cm, when comparing with conductivities of seawater approx. 35 mS/cm) affected survival and reproduction of the two tested species, leading to the extirpation of some genotypes after long-term exposures. Different ranks of sensitivity were observed for clonal lineages when comparing short-term and long-term responses,most probably due to acclimation-driven population recovery. Extreme temperatures (17oC and 23oC) induce negetive effct of salinity on genetic diversity of zooplankton.These results and its consequences at the population level are discussed in light of the genetic erosion hypothesis, through natural selection (due to small within genotype variability).

T1  - Preparation and Performance of Novel CaO-Based Sorbents for High-Temperature CO2 Removal
AN  - 2558484721
AB  - Sorption-Enhanced Steam Reforming process (SESR) is an auspicious technology for hydrogen (H2) production with simultaneous capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) derived from design modifications performed on the conventional Steam Reforming Process (SRP). Enhancing the reforming reaction in terms of kinetics, yield and purity through capturing in situ CO2 using high temperature solid sorbents brings advantages including reduction in energy requirements and lower investment capital. Even though SESR is a cost-effective route for energy generation based on organic volatile and gaseous feedstock including natural gas, its implementation implies overcoming challenges. Diminishing the sintering in CaO-based CO2 sorbents has become one of these challenges since the reactivity of these captors decreases significantly as the number of carbonation/calcination cycles proceeds. This research work centres its efforts in the development of novel sintering resistant CaO-based CO2 sorbents enhanced by means of the incorporation of a refractory, high surface area, polycrystalline fibrous support (Saffil), with high-Al2O3 content, acting as structural stabilizer of CaO. Four families of CaO-based CO2 sorbents were prepared using wet impregnation and precipitation methods. Different variants such as CaO precursor, precipitant agents, pH, stirring, aging time, etc. were tested to optimize the synthesis parameters. The best preparation conditions were aimed at achieving a homogeneous deposition of CaO over the Saffil support as well as a morphology in CaO that might improve the durability of CO2 acceptors. In particular, the formation of nanoflakes, and particles with an octahedral shape were found to be two of the most promising morphologies. Upon the determination of optimal synthesis parameters, the as-prepared CO2 sorbents were characterized in order to determine their physicochemical properties such as textural features (surface area and pore size distribution - N2 physisorption), real CaO content (XRF), dispersion of CaO over Saffil supports (SEM-EDX), phase identification (XRD), etc. Carrying capacities and durability of CaO-based CO2 sorbents were assessed through multicycle carbonation/decarbonation tests under controlled conditions such as temperature and atmosphere. The dynamic/isothermal experiments conducted in a TGA system confirm an enhancement in reactivity when CaO grows over the periphery of the Saffil support. In addition to the use of a support, achieving a 'clamping effect' (to diminish lateral mobility of CaO, thus avoiding particle densification), in conjunction with the morphology adopted by CaO, is shown to provide thermal stability. SEM-EDX techniques applied on used CaO-based sorbents (30 carbonation-calcination cycles) corroborate that the enhancement in durability is due to the outstanding sintering resistance exhibited when CaO adopted the nanoflake or octahedral structure. The viability of the as-prepared sorbents was also confirmed through a kinetic study in which kinetic parameters and mechanisms associated with both carbonation and calcination reactions were estimated. Concerning the CO2 uptake kinetics, the isothermal method was used to collect mass change data whilst model-based equations were employed to elucidate the kinetic triplet. For the calcination reaction, the kinetic study was performed using both isothermal and non-isothermal methods. Activation energies assessed for the carbonation and calcination reactions were compared among them and also in relation with other CaO-based sorbents available in the literature for reliability purposes.

T1  - The North Atlantic Ocean : a Force for Change at Earth's Greenhouse-Icehouse Transition
AN  - 2548448548
AB  - Earth’s landmark greenhouse-icehouse transition at the Eocene Oligocene Transition (EOT) is arguably one of the most important climatic events in geological history. The dominant global geochemical signature of this dramatic shift in Earth’s climate (approximately 33.7 million years ago), a 1.2 - 1.5%o increase in the stable oxygen isotope ratio (d18O) of benthic foraminifera, represents a significant period of global cooling that occurred contemporaneously with the initiation of widespread Antarctic glaciation. The EOT represents the first establishment of a widespread, continental-scale, somewhat stable ice sheet on Antarctica and yet significant debate remains as to the forcing mechanism responsible for this substantial perturbation marking the end of the Eocene greenhouse world. Initiation of the step-wise shift in d18O occurred during an interval of low eccentricity and low-amplitude change in obliquity; an orbital configuration considered the ultimate trigger for glaciation at the EOT and the pacemaker for subsequent ice sheet growth. However, some other forcing mechanism(s) must have been important in conditioning the climate leading up to the EOT as these orbital configurations are found at other points in geological history where such large-scale changes in climate are absent. The overall aim of this thesis is to explore the evolution of temperature, ice volume and ocean circulation, the interactions between these key climatic parameters and the relative importance of different forcing and feedback mechanisms across the EOT. This thesis will place particular emphasis on paleoceanographic changes that occurred in the Atlantic Ocean region across this interval and their subsequent impacts. To this end, multiple records of foraminiferal stable isotopes and trace elements, and fish teeth neodymium isotopes are presented from sediment cores largely within the Atlantic Ocean or subject to its influence at the EOT. Findings of this thesis suggest a fascinating link between deep water formation in the North Atlantic Ocean and Antarctic ice sheet dynamics at the EOT. A new highresolution eNd record derived from fossil fish teeth at ODP Site 1263 (Walvis Ridge) in the South Atlantic provides evidence for a significant strengthening of Northern Component Water (NCW), a paleo pre-cursor to North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), at 34.7 Ma one million years prior to the onset of the EOT. The increasing influence of northern-sourced deep waters, and associated cross-hemisphere heat piracy, provided optimal conditions for landmark climate change prior to the occurrence of the orbital parameters considered to be the ultimate trigger of the EOT. From this point on, NCW played a significant role in the distribution of heat and salinity within the Atlantic Ocean basin and is likely partly responsible, along with enhanced production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) due to Antarctic glaciation, for the interhemispheric temperature asymmetry documented within this thesis. Benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca-derived bottom water temperatures from IODP Site U1406 (Newfoundland Sediment Drifts) in the North Atlantic show a much lesser degree of cooling in the high northern latitudes when compared to their southern counterparts; in line with previous evidence from records of sea surface temperature (SST). Benthic foraminiferal trace element data from IODP Site U1406, along with ODP Site 925 (Ceara Rise) in the Equatorial Atlantic, demonstrate a regional, transient excursion in primary productivity that begins coeval with Antarctic glaciation at the EOT. Arctic Ocean continental shelves served as a nutrient-rich source fuelling the III Cardiff University Amy Sparkes productivity pulse in the Atlantic at the EOT when glaciation-induced sea level fall exposed organic-rich shelf sediment nutrients to weathering. This new source of bioavailable nutrients was efficiently distributed through the North Atlantic region by surface water overflows between the Greenland and Norwegian Seas and the North Atlantic causing increased primary productivity and associated export production leading to a steepening of the overall decline in pCO2 and hence acting as a positive feedback on Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) growth. Overall this thesis makes significant strides in clarifying the timeline of key climatic events in the Atlantic Ocean in the lead up to and across the EOT and highlights the importance of the influence of the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic in modulating climate and ocean chemistry at the EOT.

T1  - Competition of Staphylococci as Probe for Novel Antibiotics
AN  - 2511946754
AB  - Staphylococci are frequent members of the human skin microbiome. It was previously determined that Staphylococcus aureus meets widespread antagonism from coagulase-negative staphylococci. Furthermore, cumulative antagonisms by species in the niche correlate with the absence of S. aureus nasal colonisation, supporting collective antagonism trait expression as a barrier. However, genetics factors and adaptive pathways of bacterial interactions remain uncharacterised.Using a two species system, strongly antagonistic inhibitor-producing S. epidermidis B155 was co-cultured with S. aureus SH1000 to identify determinants of competition and resistance using an experimental evolution approach. In the presence of S. epidermidis B155, S. aureus evolved a high relative fitness due to inhibitor resistance after several days of S. epidermidis co-culture. Unexpectedly, rather than known two-component system TCS loci associated with antimicrobial resistance, Illumina platform genome resequencing of S. aureus identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both sensor kinase (desK) and response regulator (desR) genes that comprise the poorly described DesKR homologous TCS. The DesKR-like TCS system is located in an operon with two genes encoding an ABC transporter with homology to ABC polyketide efflux transporters. Genetic analysis identified that allelic replacement of desK or in-frame deletion of the SAOUHSC_01312 ABC efflux transporter gene decreased survival of S. aureus in competition with S. epidermidis, supporting the transporter as a resistance module. The desK gene mutant revealed reduced growth rate at both low (25°C) and high (42°C) temperatures compared with its parent strain. Gene inactivation of the desKR locus reduced pigment production with both desK and SAOUHSC_01312 mutants expressing less staphyloxanthin.PacBio genome sequencing of S. epidermidis B155 and antiSMASH identified a 55 kb plasmid with a unique polyketide/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster likely encoding the inhibitor of S. aureus growth. This cluster shares considerable sequence homology with a gene cluster encoding a polyketide/NRPS of Streptococcus mutans. Due to the production of this unique antimicrobial, further skin-isolated bacteria were screened for those that inhibit S. aureus SH1000 WT strain but not a desR SNP variant, thereby identifying Bacillus flexus B003. PacBio genome sequencing and antiSMASH identified genome-encoded polyketide synthase and linear azol(in)econtaining peptides (LAP) genes that might have the same mode of action as S. epidermidis B155 or DesKR resistance mechanism.RNAseq was performed to probe the regulon of the S. aureus DesKR-like TCS using WT to compare with the desR SNP variant, plus desK allelic replacement and SAOUHSC_01312 mutants. From this analysis, it was identified that the five genes SAOUHSC_01311-01312-desKR operon and SAOUHSC_01315 were very highly expressed in the desR SNP variant and these five genes are likely to comprise the DesKR-like regulon. Moreover, these data support the central role of this TCS in S. aureus resistance to the S. epidermidis B155 and B. flexus B003 antimicrobials. In contrast, transcriptome analysis of desK and transporter SAOUHSC_01312 mutant strains revealed hundreds of genes were differentially expressed in pathways associated with metabolism, virulence and regulations.The DesKR-like regulon has undefined roles that could be linked to membrane homeostasis and these findings provide significant insights into pathways that impact bacterial growth, resistance and microbial interaction. Ultimately, the TCS and its functions identified here might represent a future target for novel therapeutics targeting S. aureus.

T1  - Sustainable Metal Organic Framework Thin-Films for Medical Sensing Applications
AN  - 2430744150
AB  - We spend more and more time indoors, and the monitoring of the concentration of CO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is important to maintain comfort, productivity and health. Furthermore, can the long-time exposure to these compounds lead to medical issues like cancer and nerve damage. The accumulation of CO2 and VOC takes place automatically indoors. CO2 is produced by cellular respiration, while VOCs are often outgassed from e.g. paint or furniture. In order to maintain a comfortable indoor atmosphere without wasting energy by wrong heating or ventilation the real-time monitoring of CO2 and VOC concentrations is needed. Long period grating fibres (LPG) are known to be lightweight and low-cost sensors with extreme short response times, possibly in the microsecond scale, but the non-selective response to various stimuli like strain, temperature and refractive index change is problematic for the creation of a reliable real-time sensor system. The use of metal-organic frameworks(MOFs), a new class of hybrid porous materials with tuneable pore size and chemical properties, might be here able to provide selectivity and sensitivity towards specific target compounds as a thin-film coating on the LPG surface. However, MOFs are in general first prepared as powders, often at elevated temperatures and long reaction times. Furthermore is the transformation of a powder synthesis to a thin-film synthesis not trivial. For this work, two promising MOFs, MIL-53(Al) and TIFSIX-3-Ni, have been identified and the possible coating of LPGs was separated into three steps. These are the optimisation of the powder synthesis regarding more sustainable conditions (e.g. shorter reaction times, lower reaction temperature and easier purification of the product), devolving of a thin-film synthesis for glass as support and the application of the most-promising thin-film coating techniques on LPGs. The real-time sensor performance of the MIL-53(Al) and TIFSIX-3-Ni coated LPGs towards CO2 and selected VOCs was tested afterwards. In summary, could be especially the powder synthesis for MIL-53(Al) and TIFSIX-3-Ni in comparison with the literature protocols be improved. It was possible to greatly reduce the reaction time of MIL-53(Al) from 220°C and 72 h to 150°C and 5 h using the low-weight alcohol methanol as solvent. Furthermore, does the MIL-53(Al) derivate prepared in methanol show porosity directly after the synthesis. A common disadvantage of MIL-53(Al) is that normally a time and energy consuming activation process is needed in order to access the internal porosity. For TIFSIX-3-Ni, the yield could be improved and the reaction time reduced in comparison with the literature protocol using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent. For both MIL-53(Al) and TIFSIX-3-Ni new thin-film protocols could be developed for the successful coating of glass surfaces with homogenous and uniform thin-films, but still more research is needed in order to create a reliable and repeatable sensor response of these MOF-coated LPGs.

T1  - Predicting Response of Potato and Barley to Climate Change in Maine Using the Crop Model DSSAT
AN  - 2391981978
AB  - Climate change has the potential to impact yield and yield stability, and thus, sustainability in agriculture. Farmers are confronted seasonally with the challenges and unpredictability weather can bring. Current climate change projections anticipate an overall rise in temperature, precipitation and CO2 for the Northeast with weather increasing in variability in the forms of heatwaves, drought and heavy rain events. Using the computer simulation model DSSAT (Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology), we aimed to assess the vulnerability and potential climate adaptation strategies for potato and barley in Maine. Chapter 1, “Assessing the Vulnerability of Potato and Barley to Climate Change using the Crop Model DSSAT”, encompasses the calibration and evaluation of the crop model DSSAT for two varieties each of potato (an early-season and late-season) and barley (a 2-row variety and 6-row variety) in Maine. The growth and development of each variety was assessed across numerous planting dates under a baseline weather scenario (1989-2018) and four future weather scenarios for 2050-2079, varying by emissions scenario and CO2 concentration. An additional assessment was conducted looking at yield stability under less variable and more variable weather. Following any necessary adjustments, model evaluations found the calibrated model to adequately simulate all four varieties under various management and growing conditions in the state. Subsequent simulations revealed that the late-season variety of potato and the 6-row barley variety may be more stable with climate change in Maine, while the early-season variety of potato may be more vulnerable, particularly with increased weather variability. The late-season variety of potato and both varieties of barley performed best with the earliest possible planting, while the early-season variety of potato performed better with late planting. Crop growth and development improved with climate change and projected elevated CO2 for all four varieties in terms of biomass and final yield. Crop quality could not be evaluated.Chapter 2, “Investigating Soil Health as a Climate Resilience Strategy for Potato and Barley in Maine Using the DSSAT Crop Model”, evaluates adaptive management strategies for potato and barley in Maine. Adaptive management strategies included improved soil health in a manure-based system (amended) and irrigation in a fertilizer-based system, both compared to a conventional fertilizer-based system (nonamended). Here, the model was evaluated for a set of data containing many rotations of potato and barley in a nonamended fertilizer-based system and an amended manure-based system. Following minor changes and a successful evaluation, simulations were conducted using a feasible planting date and the five weather scenarios from Chapter 1. Results found the irrigated system to perform best under all five weather scenarios for potato with the amended system a close second in production performance, while the performance of barley in the amended system was equal to that of the irrigated system. While irrigation may not be the most viable option for all Maine farmers, this study illustrated the importance soil health both now and in the future in improving or maintaining current crop production.

T1  - Genetically Stable Poliovirus Vectors Activate Dendritic Cells and Prime Antitumor CD8 T Cell Immunity
AN  - 2379596101
AB  - Viruses naturally engage innate immunity, induce antigen presentation, and mediate CD8 T cell priming against foreign antigens. Polioviruses can provide a context optimal for generating antigen-specific CD8 T cells, as they have natural tropism for dendritic cells, preeminent inducers of CD8 T cell immunity; elicit Th1-promoting inflammation; and lack interference with innate or adaptive immunity. However, notorious genetic instability and underlying neuropathogenicity has hampered poliovirus-based vector applications. We devised a strategy based on the polio:rhinovirus chimera PVSRIPO, devoid of viral neuropathogenicity after intracerebral inoculation in human subjects, for stable expression of exogenous antigens. PVSRIPO vectors infect, activate, and induce epitope presentation in DCs in vitro; recruit and activate DCs with Th1-dominant cytokine profiles at the injection site in vivo. They efficiently prime tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells in vivo, induce CD8 T cell migration to the tumor site, delay tumor growth and enhance survival in murine tumor models.

T1  - Effects of Habitat Restoration and Thermal Environments on Site Use by Northern Bobwhites (<em>Colinus virginianus</em>)
AN  - 2378090042
AB  - Non-native grasses, particularly buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) and Old World bluestems (Bothriochloa and Dicanthium spp.), have invaded native plant communities in southern Texas, resulting in loss of habitat for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite). These grasses form dense monotypic stands, resulting in reductions in bare ground as well as reducing food sources provided by native vegetation and invertebrates. I examined bobwhite site use in response to a large-scale grassland restoration, in which a nearly 120-ha area was converted from a monoculture of non-native grasses to a native grassland savannah. Bobwhites used the restoration site to a lesser degree during the 2 years post-planting than before the treatments were conducted, which may be attributed to the removal of woody vegetation on the site. As a result, managers must place emphasis on the preservation and enhancement of woody vegetation in future habitat restoration plans. However, the precise vegetation structural characteristics creating microclimates conducive to bobwhite survival during extreme heating periods are unclear. I sought to determine which vegetation characteristics (canopy density, vegetation height, and vegetation overlap) were important drivers of operative and ground surface temperatures as well as important in creating shade. I also quantified whether bobwhites would select variables associated with temperature (shade and thermal index) as an indication of selecting locations solely for thermoregulation. No single vegetation characteristic was more effective than others in reducing both operative and ground surface temperatures (R2≤0.16) and in casting shade (R2≤0.13) over others. Bobwhites selected for cooler temperatures and shade but also canopy density and overlapping woody vegetation during the midday (R2=0.67), indicating that temperature and, secondarily, other factors such as predator avoidance influence selection of microsites during summer. Additionally, bobwhites sought locations consisting of multiple woody plant species instead of 1 species individually. Therefore, managers must prioritize the preservation of mixed-brush clusters in order to provide shade, dense canopies, and overlapping woody vegetation. Moreover, current methods to quantify fine-scale thermal heterogeneity are often time and energy-intensive as well as insufficient to account for fine-scale variation in thermal conditions across temporal scales. Remote sensing techniques such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may provide a more practical alternative as they cover more ground and collect high resolution imagery. I sought to assess the feasibility of utilizing a UAV to quantify thermal heterogeneity and to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of thermally suitable space for bobwhites using UAV-derived imagery. During the 1400 hr flight, about 7.5% of a 16-ha pasture in which the UAV was flown contained operative temperatures below the lower hyperthermic limit of 39º C. This increased to 27% and 98% during the 1600 and 1800 hr flights, respectively. Utilizing UAV imagery combined with black globe temperature data can be an effective means towards assessing thermal heterogeneity at a landscape scale. An understanding of the specific vegetation structural attributes providing thermal refugia for bobwhites will benefit managers seeking to increase thermal cover on the landscape. This is especially paramount as bobwhites may become exposed to more extreme thermal conditions as daytime temperatures increase and heating periods lengthen in duration as predicted by climate change models.

T1  - Functional Traits in Desert Winter Annual Plants: Community Structure, Landscape Genomics and Genetic Basis
AN  - 2353549921
AB  - Rapid climate change results in natural selection on key functional traits of species, not only influencing microevolution within species, but also potentially inducing macroevolution in the future via hierarchical interactions within and among species. The question of how rapidly species adapt to the changing world has long been at the center of ecological and evolutionary studies. To connect the dots and answer this fundamental question, we need to understand what genetic variation exists for key traits, how trait variation influences individual performance and fitness across populations, how trait variation influencing community structure, and how all this feeds back to natural selection on the genes that regulates the key traits. The Sonoran Desert winter annual plants provide a long-term study system where detailed demographic information for populations as well as communities has been collected. Functional traits and shifts in population sizes and community structure have been investigated for the dominant species in this community. Despite this abundant information there is still a poor understanding of genetic variation and microevolutionary modification of these traits which such important roles in population and community processes.This dissertation tackles this gap in knowledge from three angles: 1) examining the degree of trait variation and covariation of all species in the entire annual community, 2) determining degree of trait variation of many populations of one dominant species and its genetic correlation with climate, 3) determining the genetic regions that are associated with traits. Firstly, I expanded the scale of examination of a previously identified community-organizing functional trade-off: relative growth rate and water use efficiency, to include the entire desert annual community. I found that dominant species hold the strongest negative correlation between the two critical functional traits and that the trade-off weakens as rarer species were included. However, the trade-off pattern is significant with all species included in the analysis and has been constantly expressed for the past three decades in spite of turnovers in species composition. This critical trade-off serves as a potential rule determining which species become dominant in the community. Secondly, I examine functional trait variation and covariation across the regional landscape for one dominant Sonoran Desert winter annual species, Pectocarya recurvata for signatures of trait heritability, climate association with traits and genetic associations. Despite low heritability across functional traits that may be results of low standing genetic variation, there is still a significant trade-off pattern between relative growth rate and water use efficiency among populations across the landscape. Climate associated loci were identified and loci that were under selection were discovered. Precipitation and temperature may function on different sets of genetic components to regulate plant adaptation. Lastly, genetic variation and covariation of key functional traits were examined. Quantitative trait loci that associate with trait variation were identified. No apparent loci colocation between relative growth rate and water use efficiency was detected. Moreover, trait genetic correlation analysis revealed new sets of previously overlooked functional traits that covary. Interacting loci underlie trait variation indicating that the complex functional traits may be regulated by a number of minor loci that will require a higher resolution investigation to properly characterize.By dissecting genetic components of functional trait variation, we provide direct evidence that can be used to infer desert annual plants’ adaptive responses to climate change not only at population level, but also at the community level. Though we didn’t observe a direct locus colocation of the key pair of functional traits that trade-off at the population and community levels, unobserved minor effect loci may be important in regulating complex functional trait responses in the annual plant community.

T1  - Identifying Rare Somatic Mutations as a Means of Understanding Tissue Clonal Evolution
AN  - 2341811186
AB  - Many general principles governing the development and evolution of cancers have been discovered by measuring how cells within tumors evolve with time. It is however still largely unclear what first steps a cell population must take in order to form a mature malignant cancer. In part, the technical difficulties of measuring and following extremely rare cell populations makes the task of understanding the earliest dynamics in cancer formation a formidable one. One common approach of following the early development of cancer is through next-generation deep sequencing as it facilitates measurements of rare cell populations.Despite numerous advances in deep sequencing methods and technologies, measuring the rarest mutations within a tissue's somatic cells has remained challenging. In part, next-generation sequencers make sufficient errors that they themselves create a background noise greater than the true mutation signal that often exists within tissues. As with sequencing, library-preparation has improved with time, however, as oxygen, heat, and water are still involved in the process, ex-vivo nucleotide changes are relatively common. It is therefore advantageous if these ex-vivo errors can be controlled for, understood, and predicted. Here, a barcoding system is combined with with a targeted capture method in a method termed FERMI in order to systematically eliminate much of the false-positive signal that originates from library preparation. This combination allows for accurate detection of mutations that occur at least as rare as 1/10,000 DNA molecules, and provides a quantitative understanding of the allele frequencies of these mutations.With accurate enough sequencing methods, it may be possible to create sufficiently detailed genetic maps of tissue landscapes as they age and evolve towards a malignant state. An understanding of the earliest steps involved in a tissue evolving towards a malignant state may start to show how many oncogenic clones precede the development of cancer, and the factors that determine which and how many of those clones ever progress to a malignant state. Here, FERMI is employed to sequence blood samples from people with Down Syndrome as they develop leukemia at elevated rates over the general population. This deep sequencing reveals a significant selection for oncogenic changes within the TET2 and JAK2 genes, suggesting that differences in the hematopoietic microenvironment may be particularly permissive to the survival and expansion of cells carrying these mutations. Furthermore, the oncogenic mutations observed within the youngest people with Down Syndrome together resemble the patterns observed in the aging-related hematopoietic phenomenon of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential. These similarities may be indicative of environmental perturbations that are similar between aged hematopoietic tissue, and blood that contains three copies of chromosome 21.Similar to the motivation to understand leukemogenesis in Down Syndrome, lung cancer development in chronic smokers may also follow predictable evolutionary paths. Deep sequencing with FERMI of lung biopsies isolated from the lungs of chronic smokers reveals that cells containing similar mutations within the EGFR and PI3K genes are present multiple clonal expansions even in relatively healthy tissue. These clonal expansions suggest that the insult of chronic tobacco smoke exposure creates a tissue environment that is permissive to the expansion of particularly malignant cell phenotypes.Overall, the research presented herein has describes a method of accurate and quantitative deep sequencing. This method is employed to better understand the clonal dynamics in stressed and perturbed tissues in a manner that reveals predictable patterns of clonal evolution.

T1  - Monitoring the microstructural evolution of solid oxide fuel cell anodes
AN  - 2340732149
AB  - As the global energy landscape evolves in the face of climate change, the uptake of intermittent renewables is gaining ground. Electrochemical devices for energy generation and storage are therefore becoming increasingly prevalent. Solid oxide fuel cells represent an energy conversion device with high efficiency and fuel versatility but continue to suffer from cost and durability issues, hindering commercial viability. Establishing electrode microstructure-property relationships provides insight into both initial and long term performance and thus far, full comprehension of degradation phenomena has remained elusive. Building on 2D stereological approaches, recent advances in tomographic techniques such as focused-ion beam-scanning electron microscopy and X-ray nano computed tomography have allowed for 3D investigations of electrode microstructures. However, the former methodology is inherently destructive and with the latter, reliable contrast for typical SOFC electrode materials has not been easily accessible. In this thesis, an examination of these tomographic modalities is conducted, with focused-ion beam scanning electron microscropy slice and view applied to both virgin and aged Ni-YSZ anodes to virtually reconstruct their microstructures. A laser-preparation technique for the fabrication of geometrically optimised samples for X ray nano-computed tomography is developed, and facilitates access to a larger sampled volume, thus providing more representative characterisation of the entire anode. Prepared samples are exposed to ex-situ annealing in a lab-based furnace wherein 900 °C is identified as the appropriate temperature for monitoring appreciable microstructual evolution within the first 12 hours of annealing. An in-situ¬ laser heating set-up at a synchrotron beamline illustrates the very early-stage microstructural reorganisation inherent to high-temperature operation. Significant attention is directed throughout towards the extraction of reliable metrics, sampling a representative volume element and capturing evolution by digital volume correlation techniques. The expectation is that the developed methodology will provide insight into the necessary fabrication and operational parameters for maximising solid oxide fuel cell performance and durability.

T1  - Subsurface deformation micromechanisms induced during machining of titanium alloys at low temperatures, and a novel testing methodology to examine their machining behaviour
AN  - 2340298683
AB  - The aerospace industry's drive towards higher productivity has led manufacturers to strive for higher surface speeds in metal cutting. Machining of titanium alloys leads to high temperatures attributed to their low thermal properties, resulting in high tool wear rates. To counter this, large amounts of coolants are used. These contain toxic chemicals, which are harmful to both people and the environment. To reduce these hazards, near-dry strategies such as cryogenic cooling and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) are investigated in this thesis. A fundamental knowledge gap in the literature was identified, which is the characterisation of the subsurface microstructural evolution during plastic deformation in the machining of titanium alloys. Besides, its impact on surface integrity needs to be investigated in detail. The aims of this PhD research were (1) To determine the "machinability" of titanium alloys by designing a novel and straightforward cutting test. (2) To determine the effect of low temperatures (LTs) on the underlying deformation mechanisms during plastic deformation in the machining of aero-structural Ti-6Al-4V. In particular, during the application of a cryogen media such as LN2 and CO2. (3) To build a constitutive model to predict the experimental flow behaviour. (4) To analyse the imparted subsurface deformation and relate to its subsurface integrity. A material's inherent mechanical, physical and thermal properties strongly influence its machining behaviour. In the uniaxial compression test, it was determined that β annealed Ti-6Al-4V ELI: undergoes shear localisation even at quasi-static strain rates, has a high sensitivity to temperature and a lower sensitivity to strain rate. The higher the temperature, the higher the strain rate sensitivity. Plastic deformation at LTs exhibited higher flow stresses vs ambient temperature. The true strain at the onset of thermal instability (softening) and at fracture was identified, it was c30% smaller at LTs vs room temperature, leading to a reduction in c20% energy for cutting at LTs. The strain-hardening rate during plastic deformation decreases linearly with further imparted strain and decreases faster at LTs. Machining generates a graded subsurface microstructure. Four different regions were identified in this investigation. (1) Severe plastic deformation region (SPD), where a nanocrystalline grain structure was observed through electron microscopy from cryogenic machining under CO2, resulting in a significant increase in strength. (2) Gross plastic deformation region. (3) Twinned region. (4) Undeformed bulk. In conclusion, machining of titanium alloys at cryogenic temperatures is easier as a lower strain is required for shearing, leading to lower energy spent for chip generation. Nevertheless, a larger microstructural damage depth is introduced into the subsurface, leading to more potential sites for crack nucleation. The main challenges that lie ahead are: (1) to determine the extent of the effect the microstructural damage has on the fatigue life during dynamic loading, and (2) to determine whether easy diffusion is allowed to occur under thermal exposure, which would negatively affect their mechanical properties.

T1  - Development of novel disposable metal/coliform biosensor device for simultaneous monitoring of chemical and microbial quality of drinking water and urine
AN  - 2322068873
AB  - The main sources of human exposure to heavy metals are water and food. Metals play significant roles in the growth and development of living organisms. However, they can be lethal at elevated concentrations due to their interference with normal biological processes, although some metal species are toxic even at low concentrations (e.g. Hg, Pb). The traditional laboratory-based analytical investigations for environmental contaminants are expensive and usually require trained staff and sophisticated facilities. This study sought to develop a sensitive, specific, accurate, rapid, cheap and portable novel disposable biosensor device for the detection of arsenic and other heavy metals in drinking water and investigate its biomedical potential for testing arsenic in urine samples. A pre-existing arsenic biosensor consisting of the E. coli chromosomal ars promoter, arsR repressor gene and lacZ'α gene was tested. The expression of lacZʹα allows the fermentation of lactose with production of acid, changing the coloured pH indicator bromothymol blue from blue to yellow. Our results showed that the biosensor responded reliably to arsenate concentrations in water and urine samples below the recommended World Health Organisation limit of 10 ppb arsenic. Novel zinc and copper biosensors were developed using promoter elements regulated by endogenous zinc-binding and copper-binding transcription factors, ZntR and CueR respectively, fused to lacZʹα, and a suitable test medium, ZBM3, was developed. Initial designs showed high background activity. The constructs were redesigned using either weaker ribosome binding sites (RBS), low copy number plasmids or promoters with lower activity. The redesigned Zn biosensor accurately detected zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury concentrations (3 mg/L, 0.003 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L and 0.001 mg/L respectively) below the recommended WHO limits. Similarly, copper, silver and gold levels (2 mg/L, no guidelines for silver and gold respectively) were detected by the novel copper biosensor, below the limits recommended by the WHO. The stability of the sensor cells was independently tested by; air drying, freeze drying, or immobilised on paper, each within a re-sealable system that can then be stored and distributed, hence eliminating the need for routine culture and minimizing variation between different batches of cells. Sensor bacteria were successfully revived after 120 days storage at room temperature or 370C. Data obtained showed approximately 0.2% viable cells at the aforementioned conditions after initial inoculations of 1.3 x 108 CFU / mL of cells, an indication of reduced viability as a result of rigorous cell preparations and incomplete drying particularly air dried cells. However, data also obtained showed that dried cells with such survival rate were still effective in the assay. These growth-based biosensors supported growth on lactose medium which allows use of the same format for detection of both metals and biological contaminants (coliforms) in a single unit. Coliforms were readily detected based on lactose fermentation using a variant of the same growth medium used for biosensor organisms, allowing for easy generation of a combined coliform/metal sensor device. In conclusion, metal contaminants in environmental samples can be reliably and accurately detected at the safe limits set by the regulatory authorities by the use of biological methods of testing. These testing techniques, together with the simultaneous testing of biological contaminants, have the potential of reducing the high costs of physico-chemical methods, save time as well as make sample testing available to areas lacking modern testing facilities. However, the systems need to be improved to allow for a reduction in time needed to obtain reliable results.

T1  - Genetic Connectivity, Adaptation, and Phenotypic Plasticity of Corals and Anemones Under Thermal Stress
AN  - 2315540051
AB  - Under global climate change, our oceans are warming at an unprecedented rate. Increased temperatures represent a severe source of stress for many marine organisms. This thesis aims to understand how corals and anemones respond to changing temperatures across different timescales and investigates mechanisms that can facilitate persistence in light of environmental change, from selection and adaptation across generations to phenotypic plasticity within a single individual's lifespan. In this context, I explore three case studies of thermal stress in corals and anemones. I begin with massive Pontes lobata corals from the central Pacific. Here, reefs that are most affected by El Nino, such as Jarvis and the northeast Phoenix Islands maintain genetic diversity indicating recruitment from nearby reefs may occur. Yet, they show significant genetic differentiation (FsT) from farther areas, suggesting this dispersal may be limited. Thermal variability in this region may also favor plasticity over adaptation, as we do not find differences in bleaching histories among genetic groups. Next, I investigate genetic connectivity and adaptation to chronically elevated temperatures across a natural temperature gradient within the Palauan archipelago. Combining genetic data and historical growth measurements from coral cores, I find that Palau's warmest reefs harbor unique genetic subpopulations of Pontes lobata and find evidence for a genetic basis of their higher thermal tolerance. Lastly, I explore if parents can modulate parental effects to increase the thermal tolerance of their offspring over short time scales, using the estuarine anemone Nematostella vectensis. Indeed, I find parents exposed to increased temperatures quickly produce more thermally tolerant larvae. In fact, offspring from these Massachusetts parents show thermal thresholds that are indistinguishable from more southern populations. This thesis highlights the ability and potential of corals and anemones to persist under variable conditions over different timescales. Nevertheless, a compelling effort to reduce rates of warming worldwide will be imperative to the survival and integrity of key marine ecosystems such as coral reefs.

T1  - Information-Based Analysis of Environmental Factors Adaptive Force and Potential of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Variants Associated with Human Diseases
AN  - 2309942112
AB  - Populations genomic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributions, represent the populations’ adaptation to different environments. Thus, examining the relationships between the single SNP or linked SNP (Haploblock) distributions and environmental agitations should help in understanding the optimization of populations’ survival. Biophysical formulations are utilized to characterize genomic potentials (occurrence) of the alleles and SNPs in genomic energy units (GEU) reflected through the information content of the whole genome. Mathematical functions were then autonomously fitted to blindly flag significant correlations between these potentials and quantified ancestral environmental parameters, and the rate of change in the genomic distributions due to environmental factors were determined. In this study, a likely relationship was found between the average temperature as an environmental force to favor increased conservation of the T form of the rs9310709 SNP alleles in areas with increasing temperature, to demonstrate the viability of the formalism. Other SNPs were also flagged for future study.

T1  - Managing the Risk of Rapid Vessel Capsize: An Exploratory Study of Sensemaking among Oregon Dungeness Crab Commercial Fishing Captains
AN  - 2306291312
AB  - Dungeness crab commercial fishing is a tough, dangerous business.  Oregon Dungeness crab fishermen face some of the most hazardous working conditions in the United States, contributing to a fatality rate several times higher than the national average for the commercial fishing industry.  Vessel disasters, including rapid capsize events, account for over half of these fatalities.  Beyond the harsh and often unpredictable marine environment characterized by cold temperatures, strong winds, and large waves, there are many complexities associated with managing commercial fishing operations in the Oregon Dungeness crab fishery.  Current descriptive reports and statistical analyses have documented causal and contributing factors for capsize incidents; however, these factors alone do not consider occupational culture, including the ongoing communicative and social interaction that may critically influence the environment through which action is or is not undertaken, decisions are considered, and outcomes are determined.  In the high-risk world of commercial fishing, captains face a wide array of complex and uncertain situations related to fishing operations, crisis, and safety. 
Weick’s model of organizing maps a three-stage process through which organizational members engage in interconnected communication practices to make sense of complex risk (enactment), select strategies for preventing and responding to crisis events (selection), and incorporate what was learned from these communication cycles for guiding future prevention and response as a form of organizational intelligence (retention).  This study employed a qualitative approach to explore the perspectives of the master of the vessel and key cultural influence, Oregon Dungeness crab commercial fishing captains.  Specifically, I examined the equivocality, or multiple possible interpretations, of vessel safety issues (occupational culture, unpredictability, complexity, and precedent) to understand how captains understand the risks (enactment) and determine how to avoid and respond to potential capsize events (selection).  Finally, I explored how this information may be stored as rules for future application (retention, as organizational intelligence).  Fieldwork included document review, participant observation in a commercial fishing safety course, observation of fishing operations at sea, and site visits to commercial fishing ports along the Oregon coast, followed by sixteen semi-structured, in-depth interviews with Oregon Dungeness crab commercial fishing captains at two sites.  Interviews were analyzed using a modified constant comparison method.
To determine how to prevent rapid vessel capsize, captains employed a combination of rules (use of early warning systems, such as alarms) to manage the known risks, and communication cycles (e.g., talk to crew, U.S. Coast Guard) to manage unexpected or emerging risks.  Many captains saw constant teaching of the crew about safety and encouraging communication “up”; that is, telling the captain when something is wrong, were essential for safety, though a few relied on more one-way, authoritarian approaches to communication with crew.  As there is often little time to respond in capsize events, captains described response efforts largely driven by emergency procedure-based rules learned through on-the-job and drill conductor training opportunities.  However, if time allowed, captains engaged in communication cycles, or repeated communicative interactions to investigate and solve highly equivocal problems.
Future work should examine challenges of enactment (learning of vessel safety issues) and selection (determining strategies for prevention and response).  Specifically, one might consider whether training and experience help captains and crew to see when reliance on a rule is the best way to manage imminent danger and when use of communication cycles to consider multiple sources of danger and the best way to address them is most appropriate.  Additionally, opportunities to enhance and expand organizational intelligence (e.g., harnessing the power of storytelling and adaptive training approaches) should be explored.  Further analysis of possible gaps between how safety and risk are perceived and communicated and what quantitative assessments say about causes of mortality and morbidity in Dungeness crab fishing are warranted.

T1  - Realizing and Probing Driven Quantum Systems with Ultracold Gases
AN  - 2303896987
AB  - Ultracold quantum gases offer a versatile platform to study a wide range of open questions in condensed matter physics and beyond. In particular, their controllability, isolation from noisy thermal environments, and evolution on experimentally-accessible timescales make them a natural choice to probe the effects of driving on time evolution and energy. This thesis details the construction of two cold-atom apparatuses, a lithium machine and a strontium machine, for quantum emulation experiments studying driven systems. Initial numerical simulations along two experimental lines are briefly discussed, and results from the first two experiments on the strontium machine are then presented. In the first, a strontium Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical trap is strongly driven to emulate ultrafast photoionization processes; in a series of proof-of-principle experiments measuring the momenta and energy of particles ejected from the trap, we demonstrate the viability of this technique to study open questions in strong-field physics. The second experiment realizes a tunable quasicrystal, the energy structure for which is described by the multifractal Hofstadter butterfly. Quasiperiodic structures host not only phonons, but also a higher-dimension analogue called phasons. In the experiment, we demonstrate phasonic spectroscopy for the first time by directly driving one of these modes; we characterize the coupling to the resulting excitations, and directly map a slice of the Hofstadter energy spectrum.

T1  - Thermal Acclimation and Adaptation of Key Phytoplankton Groups and Interactions with Other Global Change Variables
AN  - 2301892752
AB  - Several functional groups of marine phytoplankton groups play especially critical roles in global primary productivity, carbon export and biogeochemistry. In particular, diatoms substantially contribute to primary production, carbon sequestration and the food web. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria are equally important as a source of new nitrogen (N) through nitrogen fixation. The relationship between environmental forcing and these key marine phytoplankton groups needs more attention, especially in the context of future global change.Elevated atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) are bringing about ocean acidification and giving rise to sea surface warming. By the end of this century, atmospheric CO2 concentration is predicted to rise from current levels of ~415 parts per million (ppm) to 800-1150 ppm, while average surface seawater temperatures will increase by 2-4°C. Global warming will also result in indirect changes, such as intensified stratification of seawater, increased temperature variability and decreased nutrient inputs from the interior of oceans. Phytoplankton communities in the euphotic zone will be forced to accommodate to all of these concurrent climate change trends.The three research chapters of this dissertation aim to increase our understanding of the possible responses of marine diatoms and diazotrophic cyanobacteria to this changing ocean environment. The first project investigated the physiological responses of the widespread centric diatom Coscinodiscus sp. to interactions between elevated CO2, warming, and nitrogen availability. The growth and physiology of Coscinodiscus were found to be regulated by both individual and interactive effects of these three variables. Growth stimulation by warming was coupled with a decreased growth affinity for nitrate, indicating increased vulnerability to nitrate-limitation. Rising CO2 promoted carbon fixation rates, which may provide a negative feedback to increasing atmospheric CO2. Cellular phosphorus (P) and silicon (Si) contents declined and consequently N: P and C: Si ratios were elevated at high temperature, especially at ambient CO2 level. Moreover, numerous mutual interactions among the three climate change variables were observed for growth rates, carbon fixation rates, cellular Chl a content and elemental stoichiometry, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the overall effects of multiple climate change variables rather than only to their independent impacts.The second chapter examined how short-term thermal variability affected the growth and physiology of Trichodesmium erythraeum GBRTRLI101 in two seasons (winter / summer), as well as the interaction between temperature variation and phosphate availability. P limitation played a bigger role in stressing the growth of Trichodesmium than temperature variability. The responses of Trichodesmium to thermal variability varied with the seasonal temperature regimes and ambient nutrient availability. In particular, thermal variability significantly decreased the growth and nitrogen and carbon fixation rates of Trichodesmium cells under P-replete conditions in wintertime. Increases in cellular phosphorus use efficiencies of Trichodesmium were observed at high temperature, suggested a lower P requirement in the future warming ocean. This chapter incidentally illustrated that a nonlinear averaging model commonly used to predict growth rates under fluctuating temperatures is not appropriate to apply to nutrient-limited cells. Future warming and greater thermal variability could significantly interact with projected reduced P supplies, and thus impact the growth and physiology of marine diazotrophic cyanobacteria.The third chapter explored the short-term physiological responses and potential for evolutionary adaptation of Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and Crocosphaera WH0005 after long-term exposure to different temperatures. Long-term thermally-selected Trichodesmium IMS101 showed a quick re-acclimation to temperature shifts from 20-34°C, while a true thermal adaptation or possibly a much slower plastic acclimation occurred in Crocosphaera WH0005. A remarkable finding was that 32°C-selected Crocosphaera cells can survive and fix nitrogen at a normally lethal temperature of 34°C, suggesting that Crocosphaera can adaptively extend its upper thermal limit if warming occurs gradually. These distinct responses of Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera may stem from their different genetic backgrounds and lifestyles. These results provide insights into evolutionary versus plastic responses, competitive interactions, niche partitioning, and changes in new nitrogen supplies from these two keystone diazotrophs in the future tropical and subtropical ocean.The three studies in this dissertation help us to better understand the synergistic effects of multiple climate change variables on marine diatom growth, elemental stoichiometry and the silicification process. They also provide unique information on the interactions of thermal variability and nutrient limitation on the growth and physiology of an important marine diazotroph, and allow better predictions of short-term acclimation and possible evolutionary adaptation to future warming conditions in two representative nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Together, this dissertation research provides novel insights into the potential trends of marine primary productivity and biogeochemistry under future ocean global change scenarios.

T1  - Shrimp Production Environment and the Gut Microbiome: Effects of Aquaculture Practices and Selective Breeding on the Gut Microbiome of Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp, <em>Litopenaeus Vannamei</em>
AN  - 2300268949
AB  - Knowledge of the functional role of the gut microbiome in animal health and nutrition may provide solutions to shrimp aquaculture challenges, such as improving disease resistance and optimizing growth particularly with low cost feeds. Successful manipulation of bacteria found in the gut requires a deeper understanding of shrimp microbial communities and how their compositional structure is influenced by environmental conditions, and inherent host factors such as genetics.The initial research investigated the intestinal bacterial communities of the Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) reared in pond systems and indoor aquaculture facilities as an exploration of the effects of aquaculture practices on the acquired gut microbiome. Indoor production shrimp were maintained at 28 ± 1 °C in temperature-controlled tanks. Water management was carried out using separate indoor recirculating aquaculture systems, one for each tank, utilizing fresh water processed by reverse osmosis then mixed at 28 g Marinemix (Marine Enterprises International, LLC., Baltimore, MD, USA) per 1 liter of production water. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) levels were maintained at less than 3.0 mg/mL (NH3 ≤ 0.2), nitrite levels below 4.5 mg/mL, and nitrate levels never exceeded 100 mg/mL. Evaporated water was replaced with fresh water as needed to maintain salinity at 28 ppt. Samples from that experiment showed consistent intestinal bacterial community profiles within each production system, as major differences were uncovered between the two culture practices. Bacteria affiliated with Rhodobacteraceae (Proteobacteria) and Actinobacteria were significantly more abundant in indoor samples (84.4% vs. 5.1%; 3.0% vs. 0.06%, respectively), while Vibrionaceae (Proteobacteria) (0.03% vs. 44.8%), Firmicutes (0.7% vs. 36.0%), Fusobacteria (0.0% vs. 7.9%), and Cyanobacteria (0.001% vs. 1.6%) were predominant in pond samples. The results indicate that aquaculture practices greatly influence the intestinal bacterial profile of whiteleg shrimp, and further suggest the bacterial communities of this economically important crustacean could in the future be effectively manipulated using diet composition or environmental factors such as water chemistries.A subsequent trial containing two experiments focused on two genetic families of Pacific whiteleg shrimp. As one family was selected for its’ specific pathogen resistance (Shrimp Improvement Systems, SIS), while the other genetic line was selected for growth (Oceanic Institute, OI). Both stocks of postlarvae juvenile shrimp were reared in a biosecure / indoor aquaculture facility under the same indoor aquaculture practices used in the initial trial comparing the pond vs indoor culture, with the added variable of daily probiotic additions to the water column. Stocking densities were maintained in the standard range of intensive production systems at 30–60 shrimp per cubic meter, with feed offered continuously. Production tanks (2,921L) were maintained for 72 days with six tanks for each genetic family, three replicate tanks receiving probiotic infusions and three without. A commercial product, BioWish 3P, was obtained from BioWish Technologies (Cincinnati, Ohio). BioWish 3P contains Pediococcus acidilactici ≥ 1 x 108 cfu/g, Pediococcus pentosaceus ≥ 1 x 108 cfu/g, Lactobacillus plantarum ≥ 1 x 108 cfu/g, Bacillus subtilis ≥ 1 x 107 cfu/g. The freeze-dried bacterial cultures are delivered in an inert carrier, cereal food fines. BioWish 3P was added a rate of 0.73 ± 0.05g per trial tank daily and was dosed (0.7g) with the feed offered over 24h. Microbiome sampling occurred on day 43 (prior to probiotic additions), day 57, and day 71 (28 days following initial probiotic introduction). Water management was maintained at 28 ± 1 °C and 28ppt salinity utilizing artificial seawater. Total ammonia nitrogen, nitrite, and nitrate levels were maintained at less than 3.0 mg/mL (NH3 ≤ 0.2), below 4.5 mg/mL, below 100 mg/mL respectively.Considering that the gut microbiome of shrimp begins to develop immediately after hatching and is dependent on the initial diets and environmental conditions, it was not surprising to discover the initial phylum abundance between groups on day 43 differed, with a range of 72.3- 82.5% being Proteobacteria in the SIS shrimp compared to 61.1-65.1% in OI shrimp. The two genetic lines of shrimp revealed significant differences in gut microbiome by family and sampling time points following the inclusion of probiotics into the diet. After 28 days of treatment on tenure day 71, significant variation became evident in the second most abundant phylum in the SIS shrimp with Bacteroidetes increasing from 4.0% on day 43 to 8.6% on day 71 with probiotics, and from 5.6% on day 43 to 30.6% on day 71 without probiotics. By comparison, the second most abundant phylum in the OI shrimp was Firmicutes, increasing from 0.5% on day 43 to 22.1% on day 71 with probiotics, and from 2.8% to 36.7% without probiotics. As Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacillus-affiliated OTUs were found in only very low abundance or were undetectable in the gut of probiotic supplemented shrimp, bacterial species from the commercial probiotic formulation did not appear to efficiently colonize the shrimp gut in this study. However, their presence or absence did impact the development of gut bacterial communities through abundances. While future investigations will be necessary to uncover the mechanisms involved, it could be hypothesized that, even if probiotic bacterial species do not become established in high density in the gut of exposed shrimp, they produce metabolites that favor the establishment of certain bacterial species or OTUs over others.These results suggest that bacterial communities of this economically important crustacean can be effectively manipulated utilizing environmental conditions. They further indicate that development of direct fed microbial strategies to effectively manipulate the microbiome of this important seafood will likely need to take into serious consideration the genetic background of the various current and future shrimp genetic lines used in aquaculture production.

T1  - Conservation Ecology of Freshwater Turtles in Saline Environments
AN  - 2299779970
AB  - Despite their ecological value and relative importance to humans, tidal marsh wetlands and their native biota are constantly at risk to land conversion, water-diversion systems, patterns of water consumption, and water-intensive management practices. While tidal marsh wetlands have several direct threats, they are also indirectly affected by climate change and sea level rise, which is currently occurring at an unprecedented rate and geographic scale. The synergistic effect of these hydrological impacts places many tidal marsh vertebrates at risk, most notably species that are rather intolerant of increases in water salinity variation and complex hydrological regimes–freshwater turtles. Freshwater turtles are disproportionately more threatened than any other taxa, thus, understanding their interaction with sea level rise, salinity, and direct anthropogenic impacts should be a research priority. To address this conservation issue, I investigated freshwater turtles and their present and predicted vulnerability to sea level rise along coastlines, experimentally tested their response to elevated salinities, assessed their interactions with tidal marsh management practices and local hydrological regimes, and developed a framework for their conservation. First, I completed an exhaustive review of the literature on freshwater turtles of the world that occur in brackish water ecosystems. I synthesized current knowledge of physiological, homeostatic, and behavioral mechanisms of freshwater turtles that use coastal brackish water systems. I also used end of century sea level rise projections to estimate spatial impact on coastal occurring turtle species. I then integrated results from my literature assessment, sea level rise impact analysis, and a novel turtle phylogeny to generate a spatially and phylogenetically informed conservation prioritization framework. My literature review suggested that observations of freshwater turtles in brackish water do not imply long-term salinity tolerance. Rather, experiments show that some species exhibit potential for adaptation and plasticity in physiological, behavioral, and life history traits that enable them to endure short periods and levels of saltwater exposure. In addition, my analysis suggested that approximately 90% of coastal freshwater turtle species will be impacted by a 1-m increase in global mean SLR by 2100. Most at-risk are freshwater turtles in southeast Asia, Australia, New Guinea, and North America that may lose greater than 10% of their present geographic range. Next, I conducted an experimental physiological study to determine osmoregulatory response of the Western Pond Turtle (Actinemys marmorata)–a declining freshwater turtle native to California, USA–to elevated salinities. My experimental study revealed that freshwater turtles from a coastal tidal marsh population regulate their plasma osmolality more efficiently than their conspecifics from a freshwater creek population. However, rapid mass loss in both populations suggested that these responses may only be effective for short-term exposures to elevated salinities and are unlikely to be effective under salinities expected from projected sea level rise. Finally, I conducted a multi-year field study on Western Pond Turtle basking activity, abundance, and survivorship in a tidal marsh wetland via monthly mark-recapture and motion-sensor camera monitoring. Our results suggested that Western Pond Turtle basking activity and population dynamics are highly correlated with local environmental attributes, some which are directly tied to area-specific habitat management strategies–water temperature and salinity. In sum, these studies highlight the importance of improving coastal freshwater turtle management strategies in the face of increased anthropogenic hydrological modification, wetland management, and sea level rise. These studies also move us closer towards understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that have prolonged the existence of freshwater turtles in coastal brackish water habitats and may prove useful in predicting their response to a changing world.

T1  - The Adaptive Arsenal of Crustacean Larvae Against Predatory and Environmental Stresses of the Plankton
AN  - 2299216377
AB  - Most benthic marine animals have larval stages that temporarily occupy the plankton during migrations between larval and adult habitats. These larvae are subject to drastically different selective pressures than adults imposed by the unique predatory and environmental challenges of the plankton. This often results in larval stages with radically different morphologies and behaviors than adults. Understanding the adaptations of marine larvae will be instrumental in developing more accurate mechanistic models of larval survival and dispersal in current and future ocean conditions. Crustacean larvae express a variety of behavioral and morphological defenses from predators, but these defenses may be costly by increasing susceptibility to other stressors such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR), resulting in trade-offs. Zooplankton are largely transparent to reduce visibility to visual predators, but this transparency increases susceptibility to UVR, which can be blocked by pigmentation. In this dissertation, I examine the morphological anti-predator defenses of crustacean (primarily crab) larvae, trade-offs with morphological pigmentation defenses from UVR, and compensatory behavioral and morphological responses to circumvent this trade-off. Overall, my results suggest that crustacean larvae are subject to a diverse set of predation threats that they counter with behavioral and morphological defenses and UVR may be a stronger driver of the evolution of crab larval pigmentation and behaviors than visual predation.Chapter one reviews the diversity of predators that consume crustacean larval, the behavioral and morphological defenses these larvae employ to defend themselves, and the importance of competition among larvae. Crustacean larvae are consumed by a vast diversity of predators of all feeding types and are an important component of many predators’ diets. Crustacean larvae can defend themselves with long spines, hard carapaces, vertical and horizontal migrations, rapid darting behaviors, and strong swimming. Future research on chemical defenses and phenotypic plasticity are needed to fill gaps in our knowledge. These results have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of larval forms in Crustacea and the factors determining crustacean abundances and distributions.Chapter two examines the photoprotective benefits of pigmentation in the plankton. In the first quantitative and phylogenetically controlled test of the hypothesis that planktonic pigments protect from UVR, I examined inter- and intraspecific relationships between larval pigmentation and survival under UVR in 12 species of tropical crabs. I found a strong interspecific relationship between larval pigmentation and susceptibility to UVR such that more pigmented species were better defended from natural levels of UVA and UVA + UVB. However, intraspecific results were equivocal. These results suggest the evolution of pigmentation in larval crabs (and possibly other zooplankton) was driven by UVR, despite potentially increasing visibility to visual predators. This chapter improves our understanding of the selective forces acting on animal coloration and the factors determining planktonic distributions, survival, and dispersal.Chapter three investigates the cost of pigmentation in increasing susceptibility to visual predators and the compensatory behavioral responses of tropical crab larvae to UVR and predation. I measured the preferences of silverside fish for pigmented crab larvae in 3 UVR treatments (visible light, visible + UVA, visible + UVA + UVB), the color change behaviors of crab larvae in response to UVR and predatory fish cues, and the vertical swimming behaviors of crab larvae to UVR and sun intensity. Fish preferred pigmented larvae on sunnier days in visible light lacking UVR. Three of 5 species consistently expanded chromatophores in UVR or visible light but responses to fish cues were inconsistent. One species avoided surface waters after exposure to sunlight with UVR. The more consistent larval responses to UVR than to predator cues and the lack of predator preferences in natural light conditions suggest that UVR may have a stronger influence on pigmentation than predation.Chapter four explores the compensatory behavioral color change and vertical swimming responses of temperate crab larvae to UVR and visual predation. I investigated color change in larvae of the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes in response to 4 UVR treatments (shade, visible light, visible + UVA, visible + UVA +UVB), predator cues, and background color, as well as their swimming behavior in 4 UVR treatments compared with the more lightly pigmented crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis. P. crassipes expanded chromatophores in UVR and intense sunlight but did not respond to predator cues or background. While both species swam least on the sunniest days, lightly pigmented H. oregonensis swam most in shade while darkly pigmented P. crassipes swam most in UVR, perhaps to avoid competition or predation by less UVR-tolerant species. These results improve our understanding of compensatory behavioral responses to the conflicting threats of UVR and predation, as well as the drivers of larval vertical swimming behaviors that determine larval distributions, survival, and dispersal.Chapter five examines the correlates and constraints of pigmentation and defensive spines in larval crabs. I examined 1) the relationship between spine lengths and pigmentation, 2) the allometric scaling of spine lengths with body size, and 3) phylogenetic constraint in spine lengths, pigmentation, and body size, among and within 21 species of laboratory-hatched crab larvae and 23 species types of field-collected crab larvae from Panama and California. We found a negative relationship between spine length and pigmentation that was significant interspecifically and marginally significant intraspecifically. This may suggest that species are specializing in defending from UVR or predation depending on the dominant threats encountered in their larval habitats. Furthermore, spine lengths exhibited positive allometric scaling with carapace length, which may result in reduced predator defenses as larval body sizes decrease with climate change due to negative effects of warming temperatures on offspring size. Lastly, spine and carapace lengths, but not pigmentation, had significant phylogenetic signals. Our results improve understanding of the evolution of the larval morphology of crabs, morphological defenses in the plankton, and evolutionary responses of morphology to multiple spatially-segregated selective forces.

T1  - Spatio-temporal Niche Patterns and Thermal Environmental Cues: Implications for the Persistence of Nicrophorine Burying Beetles
AN  - 2280702869
AB  - The persistence of burying beetles (Silphidae: Nicrophorus) depends on the successful acquisition of a highly competitive resource. Breeding pairs of the Nicrophorine genus work together to bury and prepare a suitable carcass as food for their developing larvae. To understand the mechanisms allowing for the persistence of multiple burying beetle species in Nicrophorine-rich communities, this thesis explores how sympatric burying beetles utilize space and time to partition the carrion resource. Further, to explore how thermal environments influence the reproductive biology of burying beetles, the response of Nicrophorus marginatus, both within and across generations is measured by monitoring rearing behaviors, movement activity, and brood characteristics with exposure to varying temperature regimes. The results of these studies present an important interplay between space use and temporal activity patterns that may serve to mediate negative interactions among sympatric buying beetle species. Generally, where species exhibit high temporal or spatial overlap, they are segregated along the alternative niche dimension. Future work on this community of burying beetles should examine the trophic ecology of species that appear to overlap spatially and temporally. The findings of these studies also indicate that increasing temperatures may impose direct fitness consequences on populations of N. marginatus. While this species appears to exhibit higher activity in elevated temperatures, they also exhibited extended burial timing and significantly reduced reproductive success rates. Efforts should be made to increase our understanding of the thermal capacity of the Nicrophorine genus as a whole.

T1  - Prenatal Stress As a Potential Adaptive Modulator of Offspring Survival, Phenotype, and Performance in Response to Elevated Temperatures
AN  - 2246444761
AB  - Climate change is increasing global water temperatures, and by altering temperatures, is subsequently impacting aquatic life, particularly ectothermic fish. When mothers encounter environmental stressors such as elevated temperatures during follicular recruitment (maternal stress), resultant offspring often have altered phenotypes. Recent studies suggest that this maternal stress signal may prepare offspring for a similarly stressful environment (environmental match). I applied the environmental match hypothesis to investigate whether a maternal stress signal can prepare offspring to cope in a stressful environment. Specifically, I exposed Lake Ontario Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eggs to a biologically relevant maternal stress signal (1000ng/mL cortisol or control). We split and reared these dosed groups at temperatures indicative of current and future temperature conditions (+3°C). Then we investigated the interactive effects of thermal and maternal stress on offspring early survival, early morphology, and thermal tolerance (i.e., CTMax and energetic responses to temperature spikes). Overall I found that rearing temperature was an overriding modulator of offspring phenotype and performance. Offspring raised in elevated temperatures had lower early survival, were smaller and had a higher acute tolerance. Prenatal cortisol did not definitively modulate offspring phenotype or performance under elevated rearing temperatures. My thesis provides evidence for the role of predictive adaptive responses, as offspring who were reared in elevated temperatures had higher thermal tolerance at parr stage. Applying the environmental context of intergenerational plastic mechanism such as maternal stress remains imperative as the world continues to rapidly change under the effects of human-mediated climate change.

T1  - Endothelial Cell Adhesion on Acrylate-Based Shape Memory Polymers for Use in Cardiovascular Stents
AN  - 2238777568
AB  - Although cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, current treatment methods continue to be limited. Balloon angioplasty, bare metal stents (BMS) and drug eluting stents (DES) provide minimally invasive methods for opening and supporting narrowed vessels, but complications such as restenosis and thrombosis from reduced biocompatibility resulted in vessel re-occlusion, limiting this approach. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have shown promise as polymer stents due to their self-deployment capabilities and vascular biocompatibility.
Prior research on SMPs for stent use has focused on the mechanical properties for stent deployment and implantation and to confirm low cytotoxicity. However, both in vitro studies and in vivo studies using animal models, have demonstrated that endothelialization of a device surface soon after implantation enhances the likelihood of device integration, leading to device success. Thus, to make SMPs a more viable option for cardiovascular stents, verifying the endothelial cell recruitment ability of the surface is an important step.
This work aims to optimize the surface of a shape memory polymer previously developed in our group to encourage endothelialization for future use in cardiovascular stents. First, we optimized the SMP formulation to retain its shape memory properties while also encouraging endothelial cell adhesion and survival. The 80:20 weight percent ratio tBA:PEGDMA SMP was selected for further experiments, based on previous thermomechanical data as well as acquired endothelialization data.
In vivo, healthy vascular ECs are typically elongated and aligned in the direction of flow; as a result, many studies involving implanted blood-contacting devices contain topographical cues that direct cells to adhere in an organized fashion. Topographical surface modifications provide a less resistive regulatory path compared to those of the biological or chemical variety. Grooved surfaces have demonstrated cell adhesion, alignment, and improved cell function on a variety of surfaces, including metal and polymer; as a result, microgrooves were introduced to the surface of the SMPs using metal printed molds. Metal printing offers a simple, cost-effective, reproducible, and robust method for mold fabrication that can be used to fabricate molds with surface features on the order of tens of microns. Microgrooved SMPs demonstrated increased cell adhesion, survival and alignment compared to their unpatterned analogues.
To further optimize rapid cell adhesion, groove depth was increased, and shape memory was extended to the surface features. Through initial compression of the grooved SMP surface and subsequent surface recovery at physiological temperature after cell introduction, cells attach to seemingly flat surfaces prior to feature recovery. which increases cell adhesion. The microgrooves also continue to encourage cell alignment. These studies provide some preliminary data that may aid in the future use of these materials for cardiovascular stents.

T1  - The Roles of Adaptation and Plasticity in Populations Persistence in the Face of Multiple Stressors
AN  - 2203475656
AB  - Global environmental changes are rapidly transforming ecosystems. As a result, populations will face changes in environmental conditions over short timescales that can threaten their persistence. When dispersal to more suitable habitats is not possible, the threat of extinction can be ameliorated through distinct, but non-exclusive biological mechanisms, including phenotypic plasticity, which refers to changes in traits mostly common due to shifts in gene expression, and genetic adaptation by rapid evolutionary shifts in gene frequencies. In my dissertation research, I studied the phenotypic and molecular population responses of a freshwater zooplankton (Daphnia) from Sierra Nevada mountain lakes of California to anthropogenic environmental variation caused by climate change and introduced predators. Hence, populations with different environmental histories may diverge in response to changing selective pressures, such as those caused by such as warming and introduced predators, because they might differ on the level of plasticity and adaptation they show to current environmental conditions. In Chapter 1, I show that different  Daphnia populations were equally able to evolve plasticity in response to selection by different temperature regimes for two years in field experiment. This results highlights the importance of evolution of plasticity in response to temperature regime, thus in Chapter 2, I explore whether or not a population of Daphnia exhibits genetic variation that confers shifting plasticity in response to temperature throughout the annual cycle, since there is strong seasonal variability in temperature in most lakes located in temperate climates Studying Daphnia population from Blue Lake I found a marked distinction in plastic responses between  Daphnia collected in the beginning and end of the growing season, indicating that seasonal temperature variability has distinct effects on plasticity for different traits. In Chapter 3 I studied the possible molecular mechanisms behind phenotypic response to temperature and how it is affected by predation. I studied two Daphnia genotypes collected from Blue and Gardisky Lakes. Overall our results suggest that both genotypes can reach similar fitness through distinct underlying molecular mechanisms, but also that they have distinct environmental sensitivities to stressors. Together these findings illustrate the variation and the importance of plasticity in addition to the potential for its evolution in maintaining Daphnia populations as key species in freshwater ecosystems, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change on food webs and ecosystem processes.

T1  - Contemporary Adaptive Shifts in the Physiology and Life History of Pumpkinseed <i>(Lepomis gibbosus)</i> Introduced into a Warm Climate
AN  - 2197596530
AB  - Contemporary evolution has the potential to help limit the biological impact of rapidly changing climates, however it remains unclear whether wild populations can respond quickly enough for such adaptations to be effective. In this thesis, I used the introduction of native North American Pumpkinseed  (Lepomis gibbosus) into the milder climate of Europe over 140 years ago, as a 'natural' experiment to test for contemporary evolution to a change in climate in wild populations. In 2008, four outdoor pond colonies were established in central Ontario using adult Pumpkinseed from two native Canadian populations, and two non-native populations from northeastern Spain. By raising native and non-native Pumpkinseed within a common environment, this design minimized the impact of phenotypic plasticity on differential trait expression, and allowed me to interpret differences in the phenotype among pond-reared Pumpkinseed as evidence of genetic differences among populations. I demonstrated that Canadian and Spanish Pumpkinseed have similar thermal physiology except when acclimated to seasonally warm temperatures; trait differences are consistent with Spanish Pumpkinseed being better adapted to a warmer climate. Populations also had similar overwintering ecology, however some differences, such as higher survival under starvation conditions and greater energetic benefits associated with winter feeding, indicated that Canadian populations are better adapted to harsh winter conditions typical of the native range. Finally, I determined that the relatively fast life history expressed in wild European Pumpkinseed is largely driven by plastic responses to the local environment; however, the higher reproductive investment by European populations has a genetic basis. Most climate change research considers taxa that are expected to be negatively impacted by warming: my research demonstrates that even warm-tolerant taxa that are unlikely to experience strong climatic selective forces can respond to a warming environment through evolutionary changes. The potential for adaptive contemporary evolution in warm-tolerant taxa should be taken into account when predicting future ecosystem effects of climate change, and when planning management strategies for species introduced into novel climates.

T1  - Maternal Effects and the Evolution of Chinook Salmon
AN  - 2714865900
AB  - Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations are under increasing threat due to habitat degradation, over fishing, invasive pathogens, and climate change. The early life history stage (fertilization – free feeding) is one of the most vulnerable developmental phases and performance at this stage may be a critical factor affecting population persistence. Offspring traits and performance are often greatly influenced by maternal effects, which have the potential to alter patterns of inheritance and selection, and environmental factors such as temperature. However, the contribution of maternal effects to the evolution of offspring traits under varying environmental conditions is still poorly understood in salmon. To address this research gap, I assessed the contribution of egg size, a primary maternal effect trait, to the within and among population variation in offspring traits in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) under different rearing temperatures. I found that egg size explained most of the within and among population variation in offspring traits, which suggests that egg size has the capacity to significantly influence the adaptive response of early life phenotypes. I also assessed the effect of egg nutrient composition, which is a transgenerational maternal effect, on the expression of offspring phenotypes and determined that both the fatty acid and proximate composition of eggs influenced offspring phenotypes above and beyond the effect of egg size. Importantly, the effects of both egg size and nutrient composition were temperature dependent. A primary concern for many studies of maternal effects is the lack of in-situ studies. Therefore, I reared Chinook salmon embryos in-situ and found that egg size had a linear, non-linear, or no effect on early life survival depending on the habitat characteristics of the nest. Based on the in-situ egg size - survival relationships, I showed how variation in egg size could increase or decrease offspring production in a population depending on the match between the population egg size distribution and the egg size selection regime using a simulation model. Overall, this work demonstrates the significant contribution maternal effects make to the expression and evolution of offspring phenotypes in salmon.

T1  - The Detection of Cervical Cancer Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Biomarkers Using Metal Oxide-Polymer Nanocomposite Sensors
AN  - 2689288529
AB  - Three film sensors prepared with Tin (iv) oxide (SnO2), carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and cellulose acetate (CA) composite and each containing different amounts of SnO2 powder were prepared for the detection of n-dodecane, 2-hexanone and 3- methylcyclopentanone biomarkers for cervical cancer at room temperature. Another four sensors made with, CNPs/CA, SnO2/CA, SnO2/CNPs and SnO2 composite was used as control and compared their performance with sensor based on SnO2/CNPs/CA towards wide range of 2-hexanone and 3-methylcyclopentanone vapour concentrations. Sensors based on CNPs/CA and SnO2/CNPs/CA selectively responded very well towards 3-methylcyclopentanone and 2-hexanone, respectively. The sensing mechanism, the in situ FTIR study revealed that both sensors undergo deep oxidation process during sensing. The effect of SnO2 concentration in the composites indicated that Sensor A highly selective towards 3-methylcyclopentanone and low selective towards to the two analytes. Sensor B and C, were selective towards 2-hexanone and n-dodecane, respectively and very low selectivity towards other two analytes. All the fabricated sensors were found to have their sensing ability regenerated after the analytes were removed from the system without losing the sensing and recovery abilities. The synthesised materials were characterised by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm.

T1  - Epigenetic Basis of Long-Term Responses to Environmental Stress
AN  - 2670135184
AB  - Responses to environmental stimuli can persist over a wide range of timescales within the lifetime of the organisms and, in some cases, even across multiple generations. Since these responses can extend beyond the duration of the stimuli, but they are not as stable as genetic adaptation, they are likely mediated by various layers of epigenetic regulation. How epigene-environment interactions mediate lifelong and transgenerational persistence of induced responses has thus far been underexplored. Here we investigate it using complementary model systems of responses to novel stress in flies. In each of these models, the response is linked to a major epigenetic memory system, regulated, respectively, by the Polycomb (pc) and trithorax (trx) genes. The transgenerational model is based on larval exposure to artificial patterns of toxicity which has been shown to induce a Polycomb-mediated response. The life-long perturbation model, on the other hand, is based on environmental induction of haltere-to-wing homeotic transformation (the ‘Bithorax phenocopy’) that is triggered by brief exposure to ether vapor and persists throughout the life of the fly. Our work on the transgenerational model identified a new mechanism of epigenetic inheritance, which depends on polycomb genes. We found that exposure to G418 in the parental generation reduces the maternal deposition of pc transcripts in the oocyte and that this reduction contributes to transgenerational inheritance of ectopic expression (Stern and Snir et al., 2014). Analysis of the Bithorax phenocopy uncovered a mechanistic chain of events linking the stress of exposure to ether to a Trithorax-dependent reduction in tri-methylation of histone H3K4 shortly after the exposure. The resulting interference with the onset of the epigenetic memory, predisposes wing development genes for much later up-regulation in the haltere disc of the larvae. The emerging picture suggests an intriguing axis of influence: Environment → Stress/chaperone function → Epigenetic memory → Morphogenetic transformation. These findings implicate the major epigenetic memory systems of the fly, Polycomb and Trithorax in mediating environmental-induced changes, which persist over a range of timescales that can bridge part of the gap between physiology and evolution.

T1  - A Genomic Appraisal of the Stock Structure of South African Sardines, <em>Sardinops sagax</em>
AN  - 2528094716
AB  - The southern hemisphere sardine Sardinops sagax is common in two of South Africa’s temperature-defined marine provinces (cool-temperate West Coast and warm-temperate South Coast), and during the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run, it is also represented on the subtropical East Coast. Non-genetic data suggest that the species may comprise at least two regional stocks that need to be managed separately, and it is possible that different environmental conditions among the provinces may have influenced population structure and driven adaptive divergence. However, genetic evidence for such spatial heterogeneity is lacking, and results from previous studies using traditional molecular methods remain inconclusive. As a result, a single-stock management strategy is presently being applied, which can potentially result in stock collapses as regional stocks become overexploited. To address this question, genome-wide DNA data were generated to determine whether there is evidence for genetic differentiation between sardines from the different bioregions. As a means of assessing the role of active adult dispersal in the sardines in reducing genetic differentiation between regions, genomic data were also generated from an endemic goby whose range is almost identical, but whose adults are sedentary. The majority of genomic markers were selectively neutral, and a pattern of isolation by geographic distance was found in both species. However, genetic clusters did not clearly match pre-defined marine bioregions. In contrast, outlier loci under thermal selection identified regional genetic clusters that could be linked to bioregions in both species, with stronger evidence for admixture in the high-dispersal sardines. These results reject the idea that the South African sardine stock is genetically homogeneous, and challenge present management practices.

T1  - Direct Selection on Lifespan in <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> to Elucidate the Mechanisms of Longevity
AN  - 2473879478
AB  - Artificial selection can be used to create model organisms tailored for a specific research question. Selection experiments using Drosophila have been a prominent aspect of ageing research over the last 40 years, being used to elucidate the evolutionary roots of ageing, as well as the mechanisms and corollaries by which lifespan extension is achieved in semi-natural populations. With the advent of modern sequencing, and other -omics, technologies, selection experiments offer an exciting opportunity to investigate the molecular and genetic mechanisms of longevity. We selected directly on lifespan in a recently wild-caught population of Drosophila melanogaster, achieving a median lifespan extension effect of 30% and a delay in the onset of ageing of 68% after 5 generations of selection. Various life-history traits and stress responses were measured and one line from each the selected and control regimes were analysed using RNA-Seq. Changes in stress resistances were observed in the selected flies, with the long-lived lines showing an increase in starvation resistance and a decrease in heat stress resistance, both responses being consistent with previous selection experiments. Desiccation resistance was initially increased by selection, but this declined after 5 generations of selection, suggesting that it was not necessary for the long-lived phenotype. Likewise, and somewhat unexpectedly, oxidative stress resistance was not altered in the selected lines, and neither did levels of protein carbonylation change, suggesting that early life prevention of oxidative damage is not an indicator of lifespan. Differential expression analysis of the long-lived flies revealed enrichment of developmental and metabolic biological processes amongst the genes with the highest fold-change. These categories are commonly altered in long-lived expression profiles and suggest the longevity of the selected lines may be due to alterations in developmental pathways in accordance with the hyperfunction theory of ageing.

T1  - Innovation in Solar Thermal Chimney Power Plants
AN  - 2440363912
AB  - This thesis analyses novel technology for renewable electricity generation: the solar thermal chimney (STC) power plant and the suspended chimney (SC) as a plant component. The STC consists of a solar collector, a tall chimney located at the centre of the collector, and turbines and generators at the base of the chimney. Air heated in the collector rises up the chimney under buoyancy and generates power in the turbines. STCs have the potential to generate large amounts of power, but research is required to improve their economic viability. A state-of-the-art STC model was developed, focussing on accurate simulation of collector thermodynamics, and providing data on flow characteristics and plant performance. It was used to explore power generation for matched component dimensions, where for given chimney heights, a range of chimney and collector radii were investigated. Matched dimensions are driven by the collector thermal components approaching thermal equilibrium. This analysis was complemented with a simple cost model to identify the most cost-effective STC configurations. The collector canopy is an exceptionally large structure. Many of the designs proposed in the literature are either complex to manufacture or limit performance. This thesis presents and analyses a series of novel canopy profiles which are easier to manufacture and can be incorporated with little loss in performance. STC chimneys are exceptionally tall slender structures and supporting their self-weight is difficult. This thesis proposes to re-design the chimney as a fabric structure, held aloft with lighter-than-air gas. The performance of initial, small scale suspended chimney prototypes under lateral loading was investigated experimentally to assess the response to wind loads. A novel method of stiffening is proposed and design of larger prototypes developed. The economic viability of a commercial-scale suspended chimney was investigated, yielding cost reductions compared to conventional chimney designs.

T1  - The Potential for Biological Control of the Invasive Asian Longhorned Beetle with Native North American Parasitoids
AN  - 2439347929
AB  - The invasive Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), is a destructive xylophagous forest pest species originating from Asia. First discovered in New York in 1996, breeding populations have since spread to several U.S. states, and are also found in Canada and Europe. Currently, control of ALB is focused on its eradication; however, the rapid detection and removal of infested host trees is complicated by the cryptic nature of the wood boring larvae. Moreover, the removal and treatment of both infested and at-risk trees has led to tremendous ecological and economic impacts in infested regions. More sustainable options for the management of invasive ALB populations are greatly needed; therefore, my dissertation research focused on exploration for mortality factors of ALB in its endemic China as well as the potential for a new-association biological control approach using native North American parasitoids. Mortality factors affecting ALB eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults infesting Populus and Salix were investigated in several Chinese provinces. Results revealed that ALB density and mortality caused by various abiotic and biotic factors varied between host tree species as well as among different years and regions in China. Overall ALB density was the highest in Jilin province, and in Gansu province nearly four times the density of live larvae and pupae were found infesting Populus compared to Salix. In a survey across all provinces, ALB eggs were the life stage that was most susceptible to mortality factors, with the majority of eggs dying from undetermined factors, followed by parasitoids, and lastly from being removed by woodpeckers or other unknown predators. Larval and pupal stages were least susceptible to mortality factors throughout China, and the majority of those that died were either removed by woodpeckers or taken by unknown predators. We recovered the parasitoids Dastarcus helophoroides (Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Bothrideridae) and Scleroderma guani Xiao et Wu (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) from a small number of larvae and pupae in Gansu province and Beijing City. While foreign exploration has not resulted in the discovery of any host-specific co-evolved biocontrol agents, exploration for native North American natural enemies has revealed several native parasitoid taxa that can form new associations with ALB under laboratory conditions. One of the native parasitoid species, Ontsira mellipes Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), has been continually reared on ALB larvae at the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit (USDA-ARS BIIRU) since 2010, and may be useful as a new-association biocontrol agent against ALB. Currently, little is known about this North American parasitoid species; therefore, several laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate its life history, thermal tolerances, host preference, and potential to adapt to ALB through continuous laboratory rearing.Life history studies indicated that adult O. mellipes parasitized approximately 21% of beetle larvae presented to them throughout their life, and that host paralysis occurred 1 – 2 d after oviposition. Adult female parasitoids produced around 26 offspring throughout their lifetime. Females that were provided access to a host, honey, and water survived 9 d longer, on average, then females denied access to these resources. Egg to adult development was completed in around 3 wk, during which larvae developed through five instars before pupating and emerging as adults. Thermal studies were carried out to determine the effect of temperature on immature development, phenology, and adult reproduction and survival. Development time from egg to pupa significantly decreased from 26.7 to 6.1 d as temperature increased from 10 to 30°C, and no pupae eclosed as adults at 10°C. Furthermore, increasing temperature from 15 to 30°C significantly decreased pupa to adult emergence from 39.7 to 12.2 d. Based on the linear regression equations obtained from immature development stages, we estimate a single generation of O. mellipes requires 342.9 degree days accumulated above a lower development threshold temperature of 11.1°C. Results of the lower developmental threshold and degree-day requirements for O. mellipes obtained from linear regression models were then combined with temperature data from ALB infested areas in the U.S. to estimate the phenology of this parasitoid. This reveled that nearly 1.2 to 3.7 generations per year may occur in ALB infested areas. Adults parasitoids attacked (parasitized) host larvae across all the tested temperatures; however, parasitism reached a maximum at 25°C. Additionally, increasing temperatures significantly reduced the pre-oviposition period and longevity of female O. mellipes. Host preference studies using ALB-reared parasitoids revealed that the most abundantly and frequently collected native cerambycid naturally infesting red maple trees, Neoclytus acuminatus ssp. acuminatus, is most likely not a host of O. mellipes as no larvae were parasitized during no-choice testing, while 70.4% of ALB larvae were parasitized. Laboratory adaptation experiments revealed that host attack rates (% parasitism) increased from 46.9% to 65.7% between the F1-2 to F68-71 generations of parasitoids reared on ALB, indicating a marginally significant increase in host attack rates by later generation parasitoids (F41-43, F68-71). Additionally, later generation parasitoids produced significantly more progeny, on average, than did early generation females (F1-2).The overall results of the laboratory studies indicate that the artificial selection process acting through current laboratory rearing conditions has enhanced this candidate biocontrol agent’s ability to attack and reproduce on ALB, and further demonstrates the potential of using O. mellipes as a new-association agent of the invasive ALB. While investigations in China did not reveal any co-evolved and host specific naturally enemies, we suggest that future investigation should examine the causal agents of mortality in the field that is currently categorized as undetermined.

It describes the current situation of the organization, product planning, process planning, work planning, as well as operational management and improvement proposals. The first chapters describe the organizational and operational characteristics, and describe the structural and location characteristics of the plant, as well as its distribution at the infrastructure level. Based on this information, an exhaustive analysis was developed and with technical support, it proposes proposals for improvement in performance, cost reduction and efficiency, aimed at generating additional profits that satisfy the expectations of shareholders and the regional market, which would provide a profit of 30 to 50% of the final investment. All this focuses on the proposal of a new distribution of plant, new organization chart that raises the area of investment and project, flow of processes of activities that optimize the processes and increase the productivity of the same. Likewise, planning is proposed with assertive strategies that improve the productivity of human capital, which is transmitted in efficiency and effectiveness of results. On the other hand, it is proposed to improve preventive maintenance policies to reduce corrective costs, which would generate a reduction of 40 to 50%, with an increase in assets of 3 million 360 thousand. Finally, it is proposed to explore and exploit new, renewable energy alternatives. The implementation of new policies with assertive strategies using specialized and motivated human resources in an efficient manner can generate greater profits for the company, job satisfaction and quality of service to customers, which allows the development of new energy projects as the demand for energy increases electricity in conjunction with the urban development that has been increasing in recent years, it is worth mentioning that the effects of global warming are altering the water flow of the main sources of water in the Peruvian Andes, which motivates to think about exploring new Projects. To conclude, the generation of clean energies reduces the risks of environmental impacts that must go hand in hand with a culture of environmental responsibility, the improvement of rules and rules of the game regarding the use, generation and distribution of electrical energy and in this way guarantee the availability of the service for future generations at affordable costs.

T1  - Heat recovery and conversion technologies with organic fluid cycles : optimal working fluid and system design
AN  - 2340375355
AB  - Heat recovery and conversion technologies have become increasingly important for a variety of reasons relating to growing global concerns on energy security, rising electricity costs, CO2 emissions and global warming. Although many energy intensive industries could benefit significantly from the integration of these technologies, the current adoption rate is limited due to the high investment costs involved and the difficulty of prospective investors and end-users to recognise and, ultimately, realise the potential energy savings from such deployment. Thus, the wider adoption of these technologies can be facilitated by improved performance and reduced investment costs. In this context, integrated thermoeconomic optimisation of such power systems through the optimal design of working fluids and operating parameters is invaluable in improving economic viability. The performance of single-component working fluids is limited by the large exergy destruction associated with evaporation and condensation. Thus, working-fluid mixtures promise reduced exergy losses due to their non-isothermal phase-change behaviour, and improved cycle efficiencies and power outputs over their constituent pure fluids. The optimisation of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems revealed that mixtures do indeed show a thermodynamic improvement (in terms of the system power output and efficiency) over the pure-fluids. Although systems with fluid mixtures could see up to a 30% increase in power output over those with pure ones, they require larger expansion devices and heat exchangers (evaporators and condensers) due to their deterioration in heat transfer during the phase-change processes; thus, the resulting ORC systems are also associated with higher costs. Hence, ORC systems with pure working fluids have lower plant costs per unit power output, up to 14% lower than those with mixtures, highlighting the importance of considering system cost minimisation in designing ORC plants. The Up-THERM heat converter is a two-phase unsteady heat engine; it contains fewer moving parts than conventional ones and represents an attractive alternative for remote or off-grid power generation. With the aid of a validated first-order lumped dynamic model, its performance with respect to working-fluid selection for its prospective applications is investigated. With the engine's power output and efficiency being conflicting objectives, fluids with low critical temperatures (and high critical pressures, reduced pressures and temperatures) resulted in designs with high power outputs and correspondingly low efficiencies. For a nominal Up-THERM design corresponding to a target application with a heat-source temperature of 360 °C, R113 was identified as the optimal fluid, followed by i-hexane in maximising the power output. The Up-THERM heat converter was also seen to be effective over a range of heat-source temperatures delivering in excess of 10 kW (about four times higher than with water as working fluid in the nominal design) when utilising thermal energy at temperatures above 200 °C. Of all the working fluids considered, ammonia, R245ca, R32, propene and butane feature prominently as optimal and versatile fluids on the developed optimal working-fluid selection maps, delivering high power over a wide range of heat-source temperatures. To facilitate simultaneous optimal working fluid and process design of waste-heat recovery systems, a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) optimisation framework for the computer aided molecular and process design of heat engines was developed. The components of the framework, consisting of thermodynamic process models, heat-exchanger sizing models, component cost correlations, economic evaluation models, transport property group-contribution correlations and the SAFT-γ Mie group-contribution equation of state are individually and collectively validated to acceptable degrees of accuracy against experimental and available commercial data. Following validation, the framework is used to identify optimal working-fluids for ORC systems with three different industrial waste-heat sources (150, 250 and 350 °C), with different objective functions. Although slightly related, maximising the power output and minimising the specific investment costs (SIC) are not equivalent objectives. From NLP optimisations, n-propane, 2-pentene and 2-hexene were the optimal working fluids when maximising power output, while n-propane, 2-butane and 2-heptene were optimal when SIC is minimised. With MINLP optimisations minimising the SIC, 1,3-butadiene and 4-methyl-2-pentene were the best performing working fluids for the 150 °C and 250 °C heat sources respectively; these novel working fluids do not belong to the common hydrocarbon families assessed in the NLP optimisations. Similarly, with multi-objective cost-power optimisation, the same molecules are identified, striking a delicate balance between investment costs and system performance. Ultimately, the results demonstrate the potential of this framework to drive the search for the next generation of organic Rankine cycle and waste-heat recovery systems, and to provide meaningful insights into identifying the working fluids that represent the optimal choices for targeted applications.

T1  - A GIS based approach to investigating the potential of herbaceous bioenergy feedstocks for cellulosic bioethanol production in Nigeria
AN  - 2322034354
AB  - Cellulosic ethanol provides a global alternative transport fuel to substitute conventional fossil fuels. The Nigerian Biofuel Policy in 2005 mandated the production and blending of gasoline with 10% bioethanol. Although, there have been indications that Nigeria has sufficient land available for 1st generation biofuel production, there is an urgent need to achieve food security for an increasing population. To these effects, this study aimed to investigate the land requirement and production potential of purposely grown herbaceous energy crops for 2nd generation cellulosic ethanol production in the six geo-political zones and states of Nigeria to meet the government Biofuel Policy. In this study, ArcGIS software was first used to identify two target land use classes (grassland and shrubland) with the potential for cellulosic ethanol production. The two land use classes were evaluated both on a regional and state basis. The study further employed a GIS-based multi-criteria decision method to determine land suitability for four herbaceous bioenergy crop species (Alfalfa, Elephant grass, Miscanthus x giganteus and Switchgrass). Suitability analysis was conducted using literature-based criteria weights for temperature, rainfall, soil organic matter, soil pH, slope and elevation by zone and state. The study further integrated Python software with ArcGIS to evaluate biomass productivity of the 4 species, where the NE zone was found to record the overall highest potential across the country, the SW was the highest in the South while SE zone generally possessed the least potential for all species. Estimates of productivity by state showed that Borno is the most potential productive state in the North and Oyo in the South. Lagos, which is largely comprised of built up areas, is the state with the least potential. In terms of crop productivity, elephant grass showed highest production potential followed by Miscanthus x giganteus and switchgrass while the C3 species (Alfalfa) has the least potential. The theoretical ethanol yield based on cellulose content of each bioenergy crop showed that at a national level, elephant grass has the greatest potential of the four species at 338 billion litres production per annum, which can power 735 large-scale cellulosic ethanol processing facilities. Generally, the study demonstrated that Nigeria will require the construction of multiple process facilities in order to be able to sustainably use the potential feedstocks available. Furthermore, the study showed that Nigeria has the potential to produce about 66 billion litres of cellulosic bioethanol per annum from the range of feedstocks evaluated. It is to this effect that the study indicated that Nigeria could potentially exceed the proposed 10% biofuel target of about 2 billion litres per annum using purposely grown herbaceous energy crops for cellulosic ethanol production.

T1  - Acclimatisation and adaptive capacity of echinoderms in response to ocean acidification and warming
AN  - 2313039483
AB  - Based on literature indicating that echinoderms are tolerant to moderate increases in temperature and seawater pCO2, this study hypothesises three outcomes of long-term exposure to combined ocean acidification and warming:  1. Echinoderms possess the genetic capacity to adapt over long time-scales to predicted levels of combined ocean acidification and warming. 2. Echinoderms possess the physiological capability to acclimatize to ocean acidification and warming over long time-scales without a significant cost to metabolic energy budget. 3. After long-term exposure to ocean acidification and warming, echinoderm parents would alter the phenotype (Anticipatory Parental Effect) of their offspring to increase fitness in the F1 generation in response to the environment to which the parents were exposed. Broadcast-spawning echinoderms from the phylum Echinodermata (Fellaster zelandiae; Arachnoides placenta; Acanthaster spp.; Patiriella regularis; Odontaster validus) are used to investigate these hypotheses. Adaptive capacity was investigated using a quantitative genetic approach to examine the response in gastrula-stage offspring of multiple half-sib families raised in fully crossed treatment combinations of temperature (ambient, +2.0, +4.0 C) and pCO2 (ambient; 2x; 3x ambient ppm). Contributions of both genetic and environmental factors to the trait normal development at gastrulation were examined for wild populations of all five echinoderm species. Complex interactions between sire (father) and dam (mother) identity and environmental factors were detected for most species, and the individual response to warming of between +2.5 - +3.0 C and concurrent acidification equivalent to -0.4 pH units depended on phylogeny, genetic identity and environmental exposure history. For all species except O. validus, significant [sire x environment] interactions were found. The response of Acanthaster spp. as well as that of both clypeasteroids (A. placenta and F. zelandiae) to ocean acidification depends on both maternal and paternal lineage, and differences in resilience among genotypes will affect future population response. Maternal lineage (dam identity) was an important factor in every species. For O. validus, the only genetic sources of variation among genotypes came from dam identity and [dam x environment] interactions. The hypothesis that marine populations possess the capacity to adapt to future ocean warming and acidification is therefore supported. Physiological acclimation was investigated in two sea star species: P. regularis and O. validus. Adults were acclimated to combinations of elevated temperature and low pH for 12 months, during which time physiological indices of gonad and pyloric cecum growth rate, righting time and tissue inorganic content were measured every three months. At the same time respiration, energy absorption efficiency, and nitrogenous excretion rates were measured to estimate Scope for Growth (SfG) in all treatments. The hypothesis that adult echinoderms exposed to near-future climate-change conditions will be able to acclimate was supported for both species, however P. regularis may still be at risk of physiological distress over multiple generations as it maintains SfG by taking energetic investment away from gametes. Odontaster validus may be one of the most thermally-tolerant polar species and therefore may be one of the winners of future climate change. Trans-generational plasticity was investigated in F1 offspring of the P. regularis and O. validus parents used in the long-term acclimation study. The hypothesis that echinoderm parents can alter the fitness of their offspring in response to their own thermal or CO2 environment is supported for O. validus but not P. regularis. This is the first study to combine long-term parent acclimatization to ocean acidification and warming with estimates of broad-sense heritability and trans-generational plasticity in the next generation, and can go some way towards answering questions about the effect of parent environment on non-genetic inheritance and evolutionary fitness. The result of this study have wider implications for predictive models of how Southern Ocean echinoderm species adapt to ocean acidification and warming, and supports the need to exercise caution when using models which predict the responses of temperate marine species from examining their related polar counterparts, or models which use parent environmental stability as a predictor of trans-generational responses to climate change.

T1  - Low temperature selective oxidation of methane using hydrogen peroxide and oxygen
AN  - 2204719957
AB  - The selective oxidation of methane, which is the primary component of natural gas, isone of the most important challenges in catalysis. While the search for catalysts capable of converting methane to higher value commodity chemicals and liquid fuels such as methanol has been ongoing for over a century, an industrially viable process has not yet been developed. Currently, large scale upgradation of natural gas proceeds indirectly employing high temperature conversion to syngas which is then processed to synthesise fuels and chemicals. Different catalysts are currently being studied for direct low temperature selective oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates primarily methanol. One of the systems studied is based on gold-palladium supported nanoparticles using hydrogen peroxide. Though the catalyst was shown to be active, high wastage of hydrogen peroxide was observed along with low productivities. The work in this thesis shows the removal of support can be used to increase the activity and efficiency of the reaction. By tuning the amount of hydrogen peroxide, high productivities and selectivities were observed. Further optimisation of catalyst preparation and methane oxidation were also performed. A theoretical study based on density functional theory into interactions between metal particles, such as gold and palladium and substrates such as oxygen, hydrogen and water was also carried out to identify the active sites and reaction mechanism underway with hydrogen peroxide and these metal particles.

T1  - The Adaptive Evolution of Herbivory in Freshwater Systems
AN  - 2194388572
AB  - Herbivory is thought to be nutritionally inefficient relative to carnivory and omnivory. But, herbivory evolved from carnivory in many lineages, suggesting that there are advantages to eating plants. To understand the adaptive significance of the transition from carnivory to herbivory, I proposed five hypotheses for the adaptive evolution of herbivory and reviewed the current freshwater literature to identify conditions where eating plants might be adaptive over eating animals. I tested three of these ideas (Suboptimal Habitat, Heterotroph Facilitation, and Lipid Allocation) using the herbivorous Sailfin Molly (Poecilia latipinna)and identified each as a potential mechanism for the evolution of herbivory. To understand the origins of herbivory in Sailfin Mollies, I reconstructed ancestral habitats and dietsacross a phylogeny of the genus Poeciliaand then used phylogenetically independent contrasts to identify patterns of diet evolution. I found that the degree of herbivory increases with increasing salinity affiliation, suggesting that in this genus, herbivory evolved as an adaptation for invading less productive saline habitats from freshwaters. This result is consistent with the Suboptimal Habitat hypothesis, which states that herbivory allows organisms to invade and persist in ‘suboptimal’ habitats. To understand how herbivory is maintained in extant populations, I raised juvenile Sailfin Mollies in mesocosms and enclosure cages placed in the Everglades to document that dietary autotrophic lipids play a role in early life history by supporting rapid growth (Lipid Allocation). However, dietary bacterial fatty acids promoted fish survival, consistent with the Heterotroph Facilitation hypothesis, which states that indirect detritivory supplements the herbivorous diet. Finally, I quantified periphyton quality/availability and consumer density across the Everglades landscape to examine the correlates of trophic dynamics in nature. Results revealed that herbivores can persist in diverse habitats and survive on varying resources when habitats are unfavorable, supporting the Suboptimal Habitat hypothesis.

T1  - Advances in Air Pollution Simulations for the United States: Ozone and Ultrafine Airborne Particulate Matter
AN  - 2193796402
AB  - Air pollution throughout the United States has changed dramatically over the past 50 years in response to numerous initiatives to protect public health. The improved efficiency of motor vehicles and adoption of stricter emission policies on coal-fired power plants are two of the reasons concentrations of criteria air pollutants have decreased. Despite nationwide reductions in most pollutant emissions, many urban regions throughout the United States still exceed unhealthy levels of criteria air pollutants. The underlying causes of these exceedances are difficult to determine as they may be the result of unidentified sources, certain meteorological conditions or changes to ambient pollutant concentrations that may alter the formation of secondary pollutants. In order to develop plans that manage these air pollution episodes, accurate tools that are used to resolve the underlying sources and chemical pathways are required. This dissertation describes three studies that improve our understanding of the causes of modern air pollution problems and provide insights that are useful for the development of the next generation air pollution abatement strategies.    The first study explores the effectiveness of historical ozone control strategies by updating the calculation of the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) scale that predicts ozone production from volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Inputs to the MIR calculations were modernized from 1988 atmospheric conditions to 2010 conditions by accounting for changes in meteorology, emission rates, and background concentrations. The calculations show that the median MIR values across thirty nine cities in the United States decreased by approximately 20% due to the impact of emissions control programs on the atmospheric composition and updates in meteorological variables including temperature, humidity, and boundary layer height. Although the absolute MIR values decreased, the sorted MIR rank of each specific VOC did not change strongly compared to the original rankings calculated using 1988 conditions. These findings indicate that past decisions about ozone control strategies remain valid today and the MIR scale continues to provide relevant guidance for policy makers.    The second study evaluates an updated version of the SAPRC chemical mechanism for the prediction of ambient ozone and peroxy-radical concentrations. The SAPRC16 mechanism represents more compounds explicitly and includes a new lumping scheme to improve toxics and SOA precursors compared to the previous SAPRC07 and SAPRC11 mechanisms. SAPRC16 was applied under ambient conditions in cities spanning the United States in order to determine if the improved performance observed during the simulation of smog chamber experiments translated to the real atmosphere. Concentrations of ozone, hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical were predicted with SAPRC16 and SAPRC11, and compared to measured values. It was generally observed that SAPRC16 predicts slightly lower ozone concentrations than SAPRC11 in NOx rich urban centers. Predictions from SAPRC11 are in better agreement with the measurements in the western United States; however, SAPRC16 outperforms SAPRC11 in some eastern and southern U.S. cities. Ozone concentrations predicted by SAPRC16 and SAPRC11 diverged more as emissions decreased suggesting that the two mechanisms will predict different outcomes from increasingly stringent future emissions control programs. A box model analysis showed that the SAPRC16 mechanism quenches ozone production earlier than SAPRC11 as NOx concentrations increase (yielding decreased VOC/NOx ratios). This could be caused by more detailed HO2+RO2 reactions and RO2 isomerization reactions in SAPRC16 that compete with the HO2+NO reaction. The predictions of OH and HO2 were also evaluated for the two mechanisms using measurements from the CalNex field study in Pasadena. SARPC11 and SAPRC 16 prediction of OH are similar and within EPA criteria for mean fractional error (<0.75). However, SAPRC16 largely under predicts HO2 leading to the conclusion that further analysis of the HO2+RO2 reactions and RO2 isomerization reactions is needed before the SAPRC16 chemical mechanism is widely adopted.    The final study described in this dissertation investigates the predicted concentration of PM0.1 in thirty-nine urban regions throughout the U.S. during summer pollution events in 2010. PM0.1 is a subset of PM2.5 that has been measured to have high toxicity and has been found to be associated with Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) mortality in recent epidemiological studies. Artificial source tags were used to track contributions to primary PM0.1 and PM2.5 from fifteen source categories. On-road gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, and food cooking significantly contributed to regional PM0.1 in all 39 cities. In addition, natural gas combustion made large contributions to PM0.1 concentrations due to the widespread use of this fuel for electricity generation, industrial applications, residential, and commercial use. However, the source composition of primary PM0.1 across many cities was notably different. Future epidemiological studies may be able to differentiate PM0.1 and PM2.5 health effects by contrasting cities with different ratios of PM0.1 / PM2.5.

T1  - Fish Growth, Temperature, and Life History: Applying Theory to Improve Fisheries Research and Management
AN  - 2190686745
AB  - Ectotherm growth is inextricably linked to both temperature and other aspects of life history. In this dissertation, I leverage life history and bioenergetics theory to (1) justify and standardize the use of metrics that adequately describe the effect of temperature on ectotherm growth, and (2) develop and apply methods that leverage the links between ectotherm growth and life history to extract life history information from growth data. I focus on fishes as example ectotherms. Fish growth is driven by the amount of thermal energy accrued over time (i.e., the thermal integral). Accordingly, numerous studies have found strong linear relationships between fish growth and degree-days (DD), a thermal integral metric. Despite these findings, fish science lags behind other fields in the widespread adoption of DD, likely due to (1) a lack of theoretically-sound support for the observed linear relationships between fish growth and DD, and (2) insufficient justification for using DD derived from air temperatures in place of DD derived from water temperatures in fish science. Moreover, there is limited guidance for selecting the base temperature for growth (T0), an important parameter for calculating DD, among fishes and scenarios. In Chapter 2, I combine empirical data and simulation modeling to provide bioenergetic and limnological foundations for the linear relationship between fish growth and DD, and I show that air-based DD can serve as an accurate proxy for water-based DD for describing fish growth. In Chapter 3, I provide estimates of T0 for 82 fish species using approaches that are rooted in fish biology. Together, these analyses will help to justify and standardize the use of DD in fish science. Fish growth is also strongly correlated with other aspects of life history (e.g., maturity, mortality). Recent advances in life history theory have led to the development of biphasic growth models that allow for the estimation of age-at-maturity, reproductive investment, and other life history traits from growth data. However, these models can be difficult to fit in the absence of maturity data. In Chapter 4, I develop a statistical framework for fitting biphasic growth models using only length-at-age data. I show that this approach can provide accurate estimates of age-at-maturity and other life history traits, and I evaluate the performance of the method across various species and data quality scenarios. In Chapter 5, I use a similar approach to investigate shifts in life history traits in an ecologically and economically important fish stock (Gulf of Mexico red snapper Lutjanus campechanus) from 1941-2005. This growth-based approach allows for the estimation of life history traits deeper into the past than would have been possible using traditional approaches and provides a more holistic understanding of how red snapper life histories have shifted in the face of fishing pressure and other stressors. Taken together, this work has the potential to improve fisheries research, promote sustainable fisheries management, increase global food security, and encourage similar advances in other fields.

AB  - Alongside sexual reproduction and multicellularity, eusociality is considered one of the major transitions in evolution (Szathmary and Smith 1995). Eusociality has evolved most often among the insects, particularly the Hymenoptera (the ants, bees and wasps) and termites. The hallmark of social evolution in insects is the appearance of permanently sterile castes, which is reflected by reproductive division of labour. A notable feature of insect societies is the emergence of sophisticated immune adaptations at the individual and group level to control the spread of disease. However, the evolution of termite immunity remains poorly understood. In particular, information regarding molecular evolution of the canonical immune pathways, and how innate and induced immunity were shaped by the evolution of a sterile caste system, remain major gaps in knowledge. A comparative approach in the study of the evolution of termite immunity requires robust knowledge of the immune system of the nearest non-social insect lineages: the cockroaches. To this end, the immunity of a cockroach, Blatta orientalis, was explored in Chapter I. Using de novo transcriptomes, a full repertoire of immune gene members was identified. Interestingly, expansions of immune gene families of receptors, including GNBP, PGRP and hemolymph LPS-binding protein (LPSBP) were identified. After immune challenging cockroaches with a mixture of heat-killed microbes (Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseudomonas entomophila, Saccharomyces cerevisiae), I was able to record a broad induced response in canonical immune pathways, pointing to the presence of effective and potentially long-lasting protection against infection, which is a key trait for organisms that thrive in a rich antigenic environment. In the first part of Chapter II, I examined the evolution of immunity in termites by first reconstructing a termite phylogeny with 19 newly sequenced transcriptomes and 16 available genomic datasets. As a result, we confirmed termites as the sister group to the Cryptocercus, a subsocial cockroach genus, and located their most recent common ancestor (MRCA) to the lower Jurassic. An evolutionary analysis of immune related gene families was then performed based on 18 of the newly sequenced transcriptomes. A family of antimicrobial peptide, Drosomycin, was found to be lost in the ancestor to the subsocial wood roaches and all termites. A further analysis of two other classic effectors, catalase and thioredoxin peroxidase, revealed a rapid contraction of related genes in the ancestor to all eusocial termite species. In addition, a family of receptors, C-type lectins (CTLs), showed contraction in the MRCA of Cryptocercus and termites as well as in the root of the Termitidae. In addition, these contracted gene families underwent a subsequent re-expansion in some individual higher termite lineages. These results suggest a substantial re-modelling of the termite immune system during the evolution of eusociality. This qualitative analysis focusing on major shifts in termite immunity was followed in the second part of Chapter II by a quantitative analysis of individual immunity across different castes of a representative lower termite, Neotermes castaneus. Gene expression changes were then compared with a subsocial wood roach, Cryptocercus meridianus, and the solitary cockroach, B. orientalis. Interestingly, I found evidence for higher investment into innate immunity in the reproductive termite caste as compared to sterile soldier caste members or false-workers. Furthermore, the induced immune response elicited in soldiers, but particularly in the reproductive caste mimicked the induced immune responses of C. meridianus and B. orientalis more closely than the response of false-workers. Additionally, the induced response to the same experimental immune challenge was remarkably similar between the subsocial C. meridianus and the solitary B. orientalis. From these results, I argue that the evolution of division of labor in termites was linked to the evolution of a fundamental change in individual immune defence between the sterile and non-sterile castes. In Chapter III, I expand on the role of the sterile caste in eusociality and immunity by examining the function of soldiers in social immunity in the Darwin termite, Mastotermes darwiniensis. In this chapter, M. darwiniensis soldiers are shown to contribute significantly to the social immunity of the colony by increasing the survival of groups of workers, probably via the secretion of potent orally-derived antimicrobial substances. In a comprehensive proteomic analysis, I demonstrate that M. darwiniensis soldier oral secretions possess a rich array of immune related proteins and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cytotoxins such as benzoquinone. These findings shed new light on termite societies, indicating that termites are likely to have evolved a sterile soldier caste with important functions not only in colony defence but also in social immunity. In this thesis I reveal how the termite immune system evolved during the transition to eusociality. I have established a robust foundation for the study of molecular immunity in termites and contributed new insights into the evolution of immunity in social animals in general. As the contraction and re-expansion of receptors and effectors in termites indicates, the function of a number of immune gene families should be examined in much greater detail. Furthermore, it will be particularly interesting to explore the individual immune (as well as general) responses of termite in a wider social context, particularly given the observed immune differences that were detected between the termite castes. Comparisons with immune adaptations in the Hymenoptera and other social animals would also be highly beneficial to understand commonalities and differences during this key evolutionary transition.

T1  - Phenotypic, Genetic, and Transcriptomic Decoupling of Thermal Hardiness across Metamorphosis in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 2174054568
AB  - Complex life cycles (CLCs), developmental programs in which life-history stages are distinct in morphology, behavior, and physiology, are common throughout the biosphere. However, it is still unclear why and how CLCs evolve. The adaptive decoupling hypothesis (ADH) postulates that CLCs evolve to decouple the developmental processes that underlie traits across ontogeny to allow for independent, stage-specific responses to selection. This ultimately could lead to alternate life-history stages adapting to unique environments, thus optimizing fitness across development. However, few empirical tests of the ADH are available. Detecting genetic and transcriptomic decoupling of thermal hardiness using robust techniques in a model system, D. melanogaster, was the goal of this dissertation. Furthermore, this work illustrates that different life-history stages have the potential to become adapted to unique ecological niches. I performed three primary studies to test the ADH: 1.) estimation of the genetic correlation for cold hardiness between larvae and adults using isogenic lines of  D. melanogaster to determine if unique genetic architectures underlie variation in cold stress response using standard quantitative genetic and Genome-Wide Association (GWA) methods, 2.) testing whether developmental acclimation is genetically correlated across stages, and whether acclimation alters cross-stage correlations in cold hardiness, and 3.) analysis of the transcriptional responses of both larvae and adults to extreme cold to determine if stage-specific stress response mechanisms exist across development.

T1  - Heat Stress Response and Evolution of Thermal Tolerance in the Copepod <i>Tigriopus californicus</i>
AN  - 2166202246
AB  - With the warming trend due to climate change, conservation of species requires knowledge in ecological and evolutionary aspects of thermal tolerance and adaptation. In this dissertation, I use tidepool copepod, Tigriopus californicus, as a model for studying both aspects of thermal tolerance. For ecological aspect, identifying the most sensitive life stage can help us predict future responses especially in marine organisms with complex life history. I examined different survivorship to acute heat stress among life stages and across populations of T. californicus. Results revealed early life stages of T. californicus survived acute heat stress at higher temperatures than adults in contrast to popular belief. However, heat stress during larval stage of T. californicus resulted in developmental delay. Survivorship in larval and juvenile stages across populations also conform with a pattern previously observed in adults with more heat tolerant populations toward southern range of the species. In order to uncover the evolutionary basis underlying thermal tolerant in  T. californicus, I examined allele specific expression in F1 hybrid between populations from San Diego (SD) and Santa Cruz (SC). RNA sequencing revealed regulatory divergence in several gene ontology categories that potentially contribute to thermal tolerance including, electron carrier genes, genes involved in muscle and cuticle assembly, genes involved in proteolysis and Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes. Heat Shock Protein Beta 1 (HSPB1) is one of the highest expressed HSPs in response to heat stress. HSPB1 Allelic imbalance suggested divergence in cis regulatory element underlying heat stress induced expression. HSPB1 promotor sequencing revealed polymorphisms in the Heat Shock Elements (HSEs), a binding site for Heat Shock Transcription Factor (HSF), where heat tolerant southern populations contain 2 canonical HSEs while northern populations have substitutions in the conserved motif of HSEs. Allele specific expression in more F1 crosses confirmed biased expression favoring alleles from populations with 2 canonical HSEs. Functional assays comparing recombinant SD and SC HSPB1 demonstrated that SD HSPB1 has a better capacity for preventing protein aggregation and preserving enzymatic function under high temperature. Overall, results from this dissertation provide insights on both ecological and evolutionary perspectives of thermal tolerance.

T1  - Evaluation of Effects Due to Land Restoration on Northern Bobwhite Demographics and Movements in North-Central Texas
TT  - EVALUACIÓN DE EFECTOS DEBIDOS A LA RESTAURACIÓN DE LA TIERRA EN DEMOGRAFÍAS Y MOVIMIENTOS DE BOBWHITE NORTE EN TEXAS NORTE-CENTRAL
AN  - 2164781615
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation leave ecosystems deficient of natural ecological functions thus reducing availability of food and cover for important socio-economic species life northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus ). Recovery plans for degraded grassland ecosystems recognize land restoration as an important strategy to combat habitat destruction and mitigate population declines in northern bobwhite. However, studies monitoring effects due to land restoration on demographics and movements of northern bobwhites are especially lacking. My objectives were to (1) examine the effects due to land restoration on northern bobwhite nest microhabitat, reproductive success and nest predation, (2) compare northern bobwhite movements and land use between treated and non-restored sites, (3) determine how breeding season survival differs between site types in the Rolling Plains of Texas. To understand the influences of land restoration, I radio-marked northern bobwhites, measured and compared ground composition at nests and diurnal locations, and compared weekly survival of individuals between treated and non-restored site types. In the 2 years, I radio-marked 182 northern bobwhites across treated and non-restored site types and located initiated 38 nests; 7 nests (n = 18) in treated, and 6 nests (n = 20) in non-restored were successful. Nests in treated sites had higher rates of reproductive parameters (clutch size, hatchability). Only 1 confirmed nest depredation event, captured by infrared game cameras, committed by coyotes occurred on a non-restored site. I failed to detect differences in nest vegetation between sites. Based on AICc candidate model selection, I identified temperature as the best predictor of daily nest survival across both site types. However, I found confidence intervals of estimates describing temperature to overlap zero indicating no reliable direction of effect on daily nest survival. I compared breeding season home ranges, determined by minimum convex polygons, but failed to detect differences between site types. Northern bobwhites in treated sites were in areas containing less vertical and horizontal vegetation structure but greater bear ground compared to northern bobwhites in non-restored sites. To examine the effects on breeding season survival, I used the Cormack-Jolly-Seber approach to compare weekly apparent survival rates. I used AICc and found the most parsimonious model influencing survival was [&phis;(t), p(t)]. Estimated seasonal survival in 2016 was 0.79 ± 0.04 for treated landscapes and 0.83 ± 0.06 for non-restored. Estimated seasonal survival in 2017 was for 0.86 ± 0.02 treated landscapes and 0.88 ± 0.02 for non-restored.   Alternate abstract:La pérdida y la fragmentación del hábitat dejan a los ecosistemas deficientes en funciones ecológicas naturales, reduciendo así la disponibilidad de alimentos y la cobertura de importantes especies socioeconómicas, bovinos del norte (Colinus virginianus). Los planes de recuperación para los ecosistemas de pastizales degradados reconocen la restauración de la tierra como una estrategia importante para combatir la destrucción del hábitat y mitigar la disminución de la población en el norteño bobwhite. Sin embargo, los estudios que monitorean los efectos debidos a la restauración de la tierra sobre la demografía y los movimientos de las bobwhites del norte son especialmente deficientes. Mis objetivos eran (1) examinar los efectos de la restauración de la tierra en el microhábitat del nido bobwhite norte, éxito reproductivo y depredación de nidos, (2) comparar los movimientos de bobwhite norteños y el uso de la tierra entre sitios tratados y no restaurados, (3) determinar cómo la cría la supervivencia de la temporada difiere entre los tipos de sitios en los Rolling Plains de Texas. Para comprender las influencias de la restauración de la tierra, radiobordé bobwhites norteños, medí y comparé la composición del suelo en nidos y lugares diurnos, y comparé la supervivencia semanal de individuos entre tipos de sitios tratados y no restaurados. En los 2 años, marqué radioeléctricamente 182 bobwhites norteños a través de tipos de sitios tratados y no restaurados y localicé 38 nidos iniciados; 7 nidos (n = 18) en tratados, y 6 nidos (n = 20) en no restaurados fueron exitosos. Los nidos en los sitios tratados tuvieron mayores tasas de parámetros reproductivos (tamaño de nidada, incubabilidad). Solo 1 evento de depredación del nido confirmado, capturado por cámaras infrarrojas del juego, cometidas por coyotes ocurrió en un sitio no restaurado. No pude detectar diferencias en la vegetación de nidos entre los sitios. Con base en la selección del modelo candidato AICc, identifiqué la temperatura como el mejor predictor de la supervivencia diaria del nido en ambos tipos de sitios. Sin embargo, encontré que los intervalos de confianza de las estimaciones que describen la temperatura se superponen a cero indicando que no hay una dirección de efecto confiable en la supervivencia diaria del nido. Comparé los rangos de inicio de la temporada de cría, determinados por polígonos convexos mínimos, pero no detecté las diferencias entre los tipos de sitios. Las bobwhites norteñas en los sitios tratados estaban en áreas que contienen menos estructura de vegetación vertical y horizontal pero mayor terreno de oso en comparación con las bobwhites norteñas en sitios no restaurados. Para examinar los efectos en la supervivencia de la temporada de cría, utilicé el enfoque de Cormack-Jolly-Seber para comparar las tasas de supervivencia aparente semanales. Usé AICc y encontré que el modelo más parsimonioso que influía en la supervivencia era [φ (t), p (t)]. La supervivencia estacional estimada en 2016 fue de 0.79 ± 0.04 para los paisajes tratados y de 0.83 ± 0.06 para los no restaurados. La supervivencia estacional estimada en 2017 fue de 0.86 ± 0.02 paisajes tratados y 0.88 ± 0.02 para los no restaurados.

T1  - The impacts of heat-wave conditions on reproduction in a model insect, tribolium castaneum
AN  - 2164141091
AB  - Climate change will increase the frequency, intensity and duration of weather extremes including heat-waves, which could have important consequences for biodiversity. This thesis examines the direct influences of thermal stress associated with heat-wave conditions on reproduction in a model insect in order to understand how animal populations might be affected by climate change. Fertility reductions in homeotherms due to thermal stress are well documented, but effects on ectotherms have received little attention. In the first half of this thesis, the flour beetle model Tribolium castaneum is used to measure the impacts of heat-wave conditions on reproductive fitness in males and females, and the proximate mechanisms behind any impacts. I find that the reproductive fitness of males, but not females, is impacted by heat-wave conditions. Female fecundity is not affected when mating with heat stressed males, but egg hatch and pupal eclosion rates are reduced. Transgenerational effects were not found beyond the pupal stage. In experimental examinations of mating behaviour, males exposed to heat-wave conditions were slower to initiate mating and mated less frequently, but still achieving sufficient matings that would normally allow full female fertility. However, ejaculate sperm numbers were reduced more than five-fold following a simulated heat-wave, partly explaining how male reproductive fitness is halved following exposure to a heat-wave. In addition to an impact on male fertility and sperm production, I also found clear evidence that sperm in female storage were also sensitive to heat-wave conditions, with significant declines in female reproductive fitness if they had already mated and contained sperm, but no effects if the heat-wave was experienced before mating and sperm storage. This sensitivity of male fertility to heat-wave conditions could generate selection on both males and females to respond. In the second half of the project, the male and female responses to thermal stress and their impacts across generations were investigated. Females were found to be able to rescue their fertility when facing matings with heat stressed males by mating polyandrously, restoring their reproductive output to normal levels. However, I found no evidence that females strategically or facultatively adjusted their remating behaviour to compensate for reductions in fertility condition after thermal stress, and multi-generational male responses to elevated ambient temperature regimes showed no evidence for an ability to acclimate or adapt to heat-wave conditions. This thesis advances our knowledge of how one important trait for population viability and biodiversity can be impacted by climate change and increases in extreme weather conditions. It offers directions for future research to investigate the drivers of temperature-induced male fertility loss, and suggestions for how management efforts might be focused to mitigate the impacts of heat-wave conditions on reproduction in ectotherms.

T1  - Vulnérabilité des tanières du renard arctique aux aléas géologiques reliés aux changements climatiques
AN  - 2161216696
AB  - Les changements climatiques augmentent les risques d’altérations sévères des habitats essentiels de nombreuses espèces animales, surtout dans l’Arctique. Le renard arctique (Vulpes lagopus) utilise des tanières comme refuges contre les grands froids et les prédateurs. Ces tanières, creusées dans la couche supérieure du pergélisol (couche active), sont essentielles pour l’élevage des jeunes et sont réutilisées d’une génération à l’autre. Nous avons testé l’hypothèse selon laquelle, en raison du réchauffement climatique, l’augmentation de la fréquence des aléas géologiques comme le tassement au dégel, les mouvements de masse et l’érosion thermique est une menace sérieuse à la stabilité de ces tanières. Sur l’Île Bylot (Nunavut, Canada), nous avons développé un indice de vulnérabilité qualitatif des tanières à ces aléas. Cet indice a été calculé à partir d’observations de terrain et de photos aériennes obliques. Parmi les 106 tanières étudiées, 14% ont été classées comme très vulnérables alors que 17% et 69% ont été classées comme modérément ou faiblement vulnérables, respectivement. La vulnérabilité n’était pas significativement reliée à la probabilité d’utilisation pour la reproduction. Les changements climatiques affectent donc les tanières de renards arctiques, mais sans qu’ils soient un risque majeur pour l’espèce à notre site d’étude. Notre recherche est la première à donner un aperçu de l’impact des aléas géologiques reliés aux changements climatiques sur l’écologie du renard arctique. La méthode proposée est flexible et pourrait être appliquée, dans un cadre de conservation ou de recherche fondamentale, à d’autres sites ou d’autres espèces qui dépendent directement du pergélisol durant leur cycle vital.   Alternate abstract:Climate change increases the risk of severe alterations to essential habitats for wildlife species, especially in the Arctic. The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) uses dens as shelters against cold temperatures and predators. These dens, which are needed for successful reproduction, are dug in the top layer of permafrost (active layer) and reused across multiple generations. We tested the hypothesis that due to climate change, the increasing frequency of geohazards like thaw settlement, mass movements, and thermal erosion is a serious threat for the long-term stability of Arctic fox dens. On Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada), we developed a qualitative vulnerability index to geohazards for Arctic fox dens. The index was calculated from field observations and oblique aerial photographs. Of the 106 dens studied, 14% were classified as highly vulnerable while 17% and 69% had a moderate and low vulnerability, respectively. Vulnerability was not significantly related to the probability of use for reproduction. While climate change will impact Arctic fox reproductive structures, we conclude that this is not a major threat to the species in our study area. Our research is the first to provide insights into the climate-related geohazards potentially affecting Arctic fox ecology. The developed method is flexible and could be applied, for conservation or basic research, to other study sites or other species depending directly on permafrost for part of their life cycle.

T1  - Coronavirus Evolution and Immune Evasion
AN  - 2139225334
AB  - Coronaviruses are emerging pathogens that threaten human health and prosperity. Each year, hundreds of millions of people are infected with continually circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold in healthy individuals and kill the most vulnerable of us. Coronaviruses adapt to environmental change at a remarkable rate. The HCoV-229E coronavirus has adapted and evolved over the last 50 years by mutating residues in the receptor-binding loops of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike (S) protein. These sequences phylogenetically segregate into Classes whose viruses have successively replaced one another in the human population. These Classes possess different receptor (hAPN) and antibody binding characteristics and the crystal structures of RBD-hAPN complexes have been solved. Structural insights into the ever-changing RBD and its interaction with hAPN show the use of secondary structure-less loops facilitate tremendous structural variability, a trait that likely enables changes in viral fitness and immune evasion.

T1  - Nitrogen Loading, Climate Change, Pathogens: Impacts of Multiple Stressors on Rhode Island Shellfish
AN  - 2116142718
AB  - Filter feeding bivalves, such as the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis are valued for their role in the marine nitrogen cycle; specifically, their ability to facilitate the process of denitrification (reduction of nitrate to an inert N2 gas), and thereby the removal of reactive nitrogen from the system. Historically, these organisms have been victim of overharvesting along much of the east coast, however Rhode Island has undergone a vast expansion of oyster production through the development of a prosperous aquaculture industry within the state, potentially contributing to the restoration of this valuable ecosystem service. However, the success of all of Rhode Island oyster populations are threatened by anthropogenic stressors, such as warming waters and increased nitrogen loads into coastal habitats, which many interrupt and/or alter the rates at which C. virginica and M. edulis are able to perform the process of nitrogen removal. Of particular concern is incomplete processes of denitrification that may lead to an accumulation of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas with global warming potential nearly 300 times more powerful than that of carbon dioxide.   Warming waters are also known to favor common oyster pathogens such as  Haplosporidium nelsoni, H. costale and Perkinsus marinus . The combination of high temperature and nitrogen loads is likely to cause physiological stress to these organisms, leading to increased susceptibility of the organisms to pathogens and, therefore, further impacting the environmental benefits provided by bivalves.   The goal of this study was to investigate how the combination of current and projected temperatures and nitrogen loads may impact the health status, rates of nitrogen removal, and rates of N2O production of  C. virginica and M. edulis. This was accomplished through separate studies conducted on C. virginica and  M. edulis. Two types of experiments were performed with  C. virginica: Experiment 1, which was a controlled, laboratory-based study, in which organisms were maintained in a gradient of ammonium nitrate levels, crossed by contrasting temperatures Upon completion, prevalence of three common oyster pathogens listed above was determined in a subsample of oysters from each treatment. A similar mesocosms experiment was performed with blue mussels with slightly different experimental conditions, selected based on biological and ecological differences between oysters and mussels.    With the realization that C. virginica tolerates much more variation in environmental conditions within their habitat than just temperature and nitrogen, Experiment 2 was performed, and consisted of two, 3-month field manipulations in which oysters where maintained in contrasting ends of the estuarine gradient of Point Judith Pond, in Narragansett, RI were performed. At each location, organisms were deployed in experimental setups and left at either ambient or enriched conditions. Oyster growth and mortality and water quality measurements were made at selected time points over the 3 month period and, upon completion, experimental organisms were brought back to the laboratory for a single incubation at ambient conditions in Year 1, and at contrasting temperatures and high nutrient levels in Year 2. The goal was to reveal how previous exposure of oysters in the field to different environmental factors may have impacted the rates of gas production under high temperature and nitrogen loading. In 2017, a random subset of experimental organisms were sacrificed and analyzed for the prevalence of common oyster pathogens.   The major hypotheses for this study included: (1) Temperature will initially increase rates of denitrification of both C. virginica and  M. edulis. (2) Increased nitrogen loads will increase rates of denitrification and nitrous oxide production of both C. virginica and  M. edulis; (3) The combination of warming and high nitrogen levels over long terms will compromise the health of the organism, causing physiological stress for both C. virginica and M. edulis, and higher nitrous oxide accumulation (possibly via incomplete denitrification).    Several major conclusions emerged from this study. Based on both mesocosms and field experiments, temperature appeared to be an initial driver of denitrification for C. virginica, however long-term exposure may act as a stressor, possibly inhibiting the process, indicated by the greater level of mortality within warmer laboratory treatments, over time, and general lack of enhanced rates in association with temperature for both experiments. Additionally, increased temperature may lead to increased N2O production, indicated by the field study. The combination of nitrogen loading and warming appears to promote N2 consumption, as opposed to denitrification, as well as increased N2O production of C. virginica over time.

T1  - Transport and Tunneling Investigation of Strongly Correlated Superconducting and Magnetic Thin Films
AN  - 2102148487
AB  - Complex physical phenomena, such as superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect, multi-ferroics, metal-insulator transition, quantum phase transition,  etc. in strongly correlated materials have been enduring topics in condensed matter physics. The overarching theme of this dissertation is the study of transport and electronic states in emergent phases with distinct magnetic and electronic properties in strongly correlated materials in thin film forms.   At first, we have investigated anisotropic electronic phase separation (EPS) of optimally doped La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) thin films under various degrees of anisotropic strain by static magnetotransport and dynamic relaxation measurements. Distinct from the prototype perovskite manganite LPCMO with well-known micrometer scale EPS, the bulk optimally doped LCMO does not exhibit the large-scale EPS near a transition from paramagnetic insulating phase (PMI) to ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) phase at a high temperature. Through epitaxial growth of LCMO thin films on NGO (001) substrates and post-growth annealing, an antiferromagnetic insulating phase is induced in the FMM ground state and results in a large-scale EPS of coexisting AFI and FMM phases below the bulk metal insulator transition (MIT).   Substantial resistivity anisotropies along the two orthogonal in-plane directions in the EPS region were experimentally probed by static temperature and magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements. More strikingly, with increasing annealing time, resistivity along the tensile-strained [010] direction becomes progressively larger than that along the compressive-strained [100] direction in the EPS region. The enhanced resistivity anisotropy suggests that the EPS is characterized by phase-separated FMM entities with a preferred orientation along [100] direction, possibly due to the deformation and rotation of the MnO6 octahedra under the enhanced anisotropic strain via the post-growth annealing.   Furthermore, the EPS was found to exhibit glass-like behavior. The resistivity measured at fixed temperatures relaxes logarithmically over a long period of time. The relaxation behavior also shows a coherent enhancement with increasing annealing time. By fitting the relaxation data to a phenomenological model, the fitted parameters, resistive viscosity and characteristic relaxation time were found to evolve with temperature, showing a close correlation with the static measurements in the EPS states.   In another project, we have investigated the superconductor-insulator quantum phase transitions tuned by disorder (d), magnetic impurity (MI) and magnetic field (B) in ultrathin Pb films by electrical transport measurement and single electron tunneling spectroscopy. In the past decade, the investigation of SITs in homogeneous thin films by transport measurement from our group has provided valuable insights to the mechanisms of SITs.   There are two main theoretical models to explain SITs. The first one emphasizes that a transition from a superconducting state to a fermionic insulator without the existence of the superconducting order parameter, the formation of Cooper pairs is completely suppressed at the transition. The other one calls for a bosonic insulator with localized Cooper pairs. d-tuned and MI-tuned SITs well fit the fermionic framework, and both share common transport features, such as a sharp resistive transition to the superconducting state, a well-defined phase boundary, and a weakly insulating state near the phase boundary. While B-tuned SITs are a canonical example of the bosonic model. The resistive transition to the superconducting state is broadened by an application of magnetic field. Rather than a clear phase boundary near the transition, emerged resistive reentrance and double reentrance indicate phase fluctuation of the superconducting parameter is the main driving force for the transition, suggesting the survival of Cooper pairs in the insulating phase.   Electron tunneling spectroscopy has been proposed to directly probe the existence and evolution of the superconductivity in these SITs. For  B-tuned SITs, the existence of Cooper pairs is supposed to be detected even in the global insulating phase of thin films. More importantly, the approach also allows us to compare the evolutions of the normal state density of state among these SITs, particularly for d-tuned and MI -tuned SITs. Transport results show that MI has little influence on the normal state sheet resistance near the transition, while increasing disorder gradually raises the normal state sheet resistance. These observations suggest that the normal state density of states behaves differently in the two transitions. The experimental setup is a dilution refrigerator incorporated with in situ quench condensation, electrical measurement, and sample rotation, enabling us to achieve and tune SITs in the same sample by different parameters, and systematically check and compare the evolution of the density of states in the SITs.   Up to now, we have performed transport and tunneling measurements for  d-tuned SITs in homogeneous Pb films in a 4He quench probe and the modified dilution refrigerator. The transport results are consistent with previous experiments from our group.

T1  - Factors Affecting Mating, Monitoring and Phenology of Grape Berry Moth, <i>Paralobesia viteana</i>, in Michigan Vineyards
AN  - 2100729487
AB  - Paralobesia viteana (Clemens), the grape berry moth (GBM), is a major economic pest of cultivated grapes in Eastern North America. Although pheromone lures and traps are available for monitoring this pest, male moth captures in these traps are not consistent between Michigan grape-growing regions, and male captures decline as the infestation increases through the multiple generations that occur during a season. This makes it difficult to use traps to monitor this pest’s population dynamics and complicates the timing of pest management activities.     Substantial regional variation exists in the magnitude of the response of male GBM to sex pheromone-baited traps in Michigan vineyards. Males are readily captured in traps in the southwest region, whereas in the northwest very few males are captured. However grape berry moth larval infestation is found in fruit in both regions. Using Y-tube choice tests and trapping trials with captive females, I determined that males from Southwest and Northwest Michigan responded similarly to the standard pheromone blend, and males did not preferentially choose females from the same population. From these results I conclude that the regional differences in male captures are not due to differential responses of males in these respective areas. I postulate that the reason fewer males are trapped in Northwest Michigan is because the P. viteana population is much smaller than in Southwest Michigan.    To test whether seasonal changes in the plant canopy affect captures of male grape berry moth, I manipulated grapevine fruit density or canopy structure in multiple growing seasons, and measured male captures under these conditions. Removal of either 50 or 100% of the fruit clusters from vineyard plots did not consistently affect captures in pheromone traps. In a separate canopy manipulation experiment, I detected significant differences in male captures between unaltered and open canopies for some sample periods, and there was a trend toward numerically more male captures in unaltered than in open canopies. I conclude that fruit presence, fruit density and canopy fullness do not reduce male P. viteana captures late in the season, and thus do not explain the seasonal pattern of development and abundance of this insect.    Experiments that measured the frequency, intensity and duration of mating and reproductive behaviors in colonies held under different temperature and photoperiodic conditions were used to determine that temperature is the likely driving force behind the seasonal variation in male P. viteana captures, and thus shapes the observed phenology of this pest. The frequency of male flights, mating and oviposition increased with temperature. This amplified activity helps to explain the intensification of oviposition and subsequent larval feeding damage in vineyards during the summer and early fall when conditions are warm. My data also show the proportion of male flights that occur when females are not receptive to mating is greater at lower temperatures, which helps explain why more males are trapped in the spring when temperatures are cool.     Traps baited with lures that contained different quantities of  P. viteana sex pheromone were used to determine that the increased amount of pheromone released by lures during hot periods can reduce male captures. My research shows that temperature is an important factor that governs the behaviors associated with mating and reproduction, and also influences the main tool for monitoring this pest, the pheromone trap. Taken as a whole, the effects of temperature on behavior and trapping strongly shape the observed phenology of this pest.

T1  - A Tale of Two Cities: Merging Biology with Chemistry for Drug Design
AN  - 2099611690
AB  - PART I: The amidohydrolase urease is critical for the survival and pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of one molecule of urea to two molecules of ammonia. It is through the generation and excretion of basic ammonia that H. pylori  can survive the acidic gut. It has been well established that inhibition of the enzyme renders the pathogen defenseless against the harsh human stomach. Therefore it is not surprising that urease has become an ideal target for  H. pylori eradication. However, despite considerable research efforts, few practical urease inhibitors exist. Additionally, increasing antibiotic resistance has generated a need for effective therapies against H. pylori. Urease’s unique ability to generate a basic product simplifies activity detection using pH indicators such as phenol red. The first phenol red-based (pH-based) high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for small molecule inhibitors of H. pylori urease has been developed and optimized. The phenol-red based assay, which allows for rapid screening at room temperature, has exhibited high quality and reproducibility, with an OD Z’- factor = 0.6109 ± 0.2123. The assay has been utilized to screen upwards of 200,000 compounds against recombinant H. pylori  urease, with 255 primary hits (0.13%), 61 reconfirmed hits, and 26 valid inhibitors. Additionally several novel compounds that exhibit low and submicromolar inhibition against H. pylori urease have been identified. Further characterization of these inhibitors is ongoing, including co-crystal structures of the inhibitors with H. pylori urease. Overall, the phenol red assay unlocks opportunities to discover and develop highly effective, direct treatment against H. pylori urease that will eradicate the chronic bacterial infection in humans.   PART II: Cytochrome P450 represents a superfamily of heme-containing oxidase enzymes responsible for transmuting xenobiotics into more water-soluble compounds. Amongst the cytochrome P450 isoforms, CYP3A4 is the most profuse, and one of the most clinically relevant xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in humans. Moreover, CYP3A4 is the most chemically versatile P450, with the ability to oxidize a variety of molecules ranging in size and chemical structure. In addition to drugs, CYP3A4 is involved in the transformation of toxins, environmental pollutants, and carcinogens. Variations in expression and activity of CYP3A4 can greatly affect drug efficacy or toxicity. Additionally, various synthetic or naturally derived agents such as furanocoumarin derivatives can either enhance or inhibit CYP3A4 activity. Although inhibition of CYP3A4 can result in undesirable drug toxicity and/or drug-drug interactions, carefully controlled inhibition can be exploited to increase the bioavailability of drugs that would otherwise be rapidly metabolized. Controlled inhibition is already being exploited in HIV and HCV combination treatment with ritonavir. Initially designed as an HIV protease inhibitor, ritonavir was later found to be an effective CYP3A4 inhibitor. However, neither ritonavir, nor its derivatives were developed using pharmacophore models, rational design, or CYP3A4 crystal structures. Therefore, little is understood on the mechanism of inhibition. Using the ritonavir-CYP3A4 crystal structure as a guide, a preliminary pharmacophore model of CYP3A4 inhibition was proposed. Through scaffold modification and rational design, the requirements for successful CYP3A4 inhibition are now more clearly understood. To date, several modest, yet highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitors have been developed. Ultimately, these rationally designed pharmacoenhancers may assist in more effective combination treatment and lower drug costs.

T1  - Predicting Nitrogen Mineralization in California Agroecosystems
AN  - 2088839683
AB  - Concerns over the fate of excess nitrogen (N) from fertilizers in California agroecosystems has prompted the need for more accurate N budgets. While many growers have adopted decision support tools to improve fertilizer use efficiency, these tools often overlook the N released from soil organic matter (SOM) through mineralization (Nmin), which can contribute significant quantities of crop available N over a growing season. While methods exist for assessing the Nmin potential of soils, they are often time consuming and impractical. Furthermore, attempts to model Nmin have revealed the need for regional specificity. The goal of this study was to develop a predictive model for Nmin from native SOM (no organic amendments) based on soil properties and temperature in California soils for real-time decision making and improved N fertilizer use efficiency.    In the spring of 2016 and 2017, undisturbed soil cores (4.5 cm x 15 cm), representative samples, and samples for a greenhouse trial were taken from 57 soils under annual crop rotations in productive growing regions throughout central and northern California, including the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Salinas Valleys, as well as Sacramento River Delta and Tulelake Basin. Cores were incubated at 3 temperatures, 5, 15, and 25 °C, for 10 weeks at 60% water-filled pore space before being analyzed for final mineral N (ammonium-N and nitrate-N). Representative soil samples were analyzed for a number of soil properties, including initial mineral N (Nint), total carbon (Ctotal), total N (Ntotal), particulate organic matter C (CPOM), particulate organic matter N (NPOM), permanganate oxidizable C (CPOX), microbial biomass C (Cmic), fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), texture, bulk density (pb), water holding capacity (WHC), and dithionite and pyrophosphate extractable iron (Fed and Fep, respectively). Nitrogen mineralization was calculated by subtracting Nint from the final mineral N. Stepwise multivariate regression was used to select soil properties for generation of a predictive model of Nmin. In greenhouse trials, soils (0.8 – 1.5 kg) were mixed with sand (2:1 soil:sand), planted with tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea var. Cajun II), and grown for ~218 days with intermittent harvests to track N uptake over time. These trials served as a validation of the incubation derived model and to assess plant influences on Nmin. Stepwise regression was also conducted on greenhouse obtained Nmin values.    Nitrogen mineralization ranged from 10.5 to 133.7 mg kg-1 at 25 °C, and 0.24 to 6.1 % of Ntotal. Generally, Nmin was greater in soils from the Delta and Tulelake regions as compared to the other regions. The temperature response of Nmin was similar across all soil types and was fit with an S-shaped curve. Concerning modeling, Akaike Information Criterion suggested that two separate models should be created; one for high SOM soils (SOMhigh; > 3%) and one for low SOM soils (SOMlow; < 3%). For SOMhigh soils, WHC, Ntotal 2, CPOM, NPOM, NPOM 2, FDA, and C:N were the variables included in the model with the best fit (adjusted R2 = 0.89). For SOMlow soils, pb, Ctotal, Ctotal2, CPOM, FDA, CPOX were included in the best predictive model (adjusted R2 = 0.36). In SOMlow soils, previous crop, residue management, and tillage significantly contributed to residual variance, though no quantitative data were collected. The temperature model coupled with core incubation data tended to over-predict Nmin in the greenhouse trials by a factor of 1.71, on average. When using greenhouse derived Nmin values for regression, one model across all sites was found to be better than two separate models. The variables included were Nint, Ctotal, Ctotal 2, Ntotal, NPOM2, log(sand), Fep, CPOX, C:N, POM C:N, and soil-mix WHC (adjusted R2=0.86). Differences between lab incubations and greenhouse trials could have resulted from sub-optimal moisture contents, plant-microbe interactions including rhizosphere priming, and experiment duration and the depletion of mineralizable N pools.

T1  - Genomics and Transcriptomics of Antarctic Nematodes Reveal Drivers of Life History Evolution and Genome Evolution
AN  - 2081899003
AB  - Elemental stoichiometry defines a critical understanding of the relationship between nutrient availability and usage throughout different levels of the biological community. We found there is a link between available phosphorus (P), cellular phosphorus, and nematode development as postulated by the growth rate hypothesis (GRH). I predicted that in a P-poor environment, cellular RNA concentrations would be lower than they are in P-rich environment, and thus the 18srRNA expression level will have reduced. To most efficiently regulate the uptake of limited P, I predicted that nematodes in P-poor environments would decrease the number of copies of the 18s rRNA gene in their genome. I measured life history traits as well as rRNA gene expression and gene copy number. We found that elemental stoichiometry predicts evolutionary changes consistent with the Growth Rate Hypothesis. We sequenced and assembled a draft genome of P. murrayi. Although we expected to find genes responsible for stress tolerance, we hypothesized that in response to strong selection pressure associated with living in a simplified ecosystem, over time the genome of P. murrayi should have undergone significant decay (gene loss) relative to species in ecosystems structured more strongly by biotic interactions. We found significantly fewer genes in P. murrayi . To compare patterns of gene expression between two highly divergent Antarctic nematode species, we sequenced and assembled the transcriptomes of S. lindsayae and P. murrayi.  Under laboratory conditions at 4 °C, S. lindsayae had significantly lower rates of gene expression but expressed a significantly larger number of genes.  We speculate that the differences in gene expression are correlated with life history traits (developmental rates) while the differences in the number of genes expressed can be explained by their different genetic systems (S. lindsayae is amphimictic, P. murrayi is parthenogenic) and the soil environments to which they are adapted. Since we previously showed that differences in available P content can influence the evolution of gene expression via gene copy number, and that this ultimately influences growth rate, we wondered how much of this response is driven by genetics versus how strongly these patterns are driven by temperature. To better understand this, we maintained wild type populations of P. murrayi in P-rich and P-poor conditions at 5 °C, 10 °C and 15°C in the laboratory for over 40 generations and sequenced the transcriptomes prepared from each treatment group. We found that nutrient levels played an important role in gene expression when the temperature is optimal for  P. murrayi culturing and that temperature is more important in gene expression when the available P is limited. This work underscores the utility of using principles of elemental stoichiometry coupled with genomic and transcriptomics research tools to make and test predictions about life history evolution. The results of my work also inform inferences about the ways in which nutrient availability also drives the organization of trophic interactions and ultimately ecosystems.

T1  - Receptor Binding Domains and Coronavirus Adaptation and Evolution
AN  - 2080268974
AB  - Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that cause respiratory diseases in humans and other animals. The continued circulation of human coronaviruses and the large reservoir of non-human coronaviruses that have the potential to infect humans represent a significant health concern. Similar to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, and evolution and adaptation has accompanied the diversification of coronaviruses. The coronavirus spike protein is a viral membrane protein involved in host receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes.     Reported here is work performed on the spike proteins of two human common cold causing coronaviruses: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Specifically, the X-ray crystal structures of the following were determined: i) the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein of HCoV-229E in complex with human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) and ii) the carbohydrate binding domain (CBD) of the S-protein of HCoV-OC43 in complex with 9-O-Acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac 2). In addition, viral sequence analysis, binding studies, and comparative sequence and structural analysis among closely related coronaviruses were performed.  The observation that the greatest variability shown by natural viral isolates of HCoV-229E is located in the receptor binding loops is quite surprising from a receptor binding standpoint. However, this observation suggests that the receptor binding region is changing due to viral selection. Indeed, our results indicate that the optimization of receptor binding affinity and/or immune evasion, two known determinants of viral fitness, are operative in the emergence of new viral isolates. Although less well characterized at this point, natural viral sequence variation at or near the carbohydrate binding site of HCoV-OC43 is also observed, an indication that similar selection pressures are operative. Together, our results provide mechanistic insights into coronavirus adaptation and evolution.

T1  - Sex-Specific Behavioral Strategies for Thermoregulation in the Common Chuckwalla (<i>Sauromalus ater</i>)
AN  - 2057678801
AB  - Intraspecific variability of behavioral thermoregulation in lizards due to habitat, temperature availability, and seasonality is well documented, but variability due to sex is not. Sex-specific thermoregulatory behaviors are important to understand because they can affect relative fitness in ways that result in different responses to environmental changes. The common chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater) is a great model for investigating sex differences in thermoregulation because males behave differently from females while they actively defend distinct territories while females may not. I recorded body temperatures of wild adult chuckwallas continuously from May to July 2016, as well as operative environmental temperatures in crevices and aboveground sites used by chuckwallas for basking. I compared the effect of sex on indices of thermoregulatory accuracy and effectiveness, aboveground activity, and the time chuckwallas selected body temperatures relative to their preferred temperature range (34–39 °C) for May-July. Males and females achieved the same thermoregulatory accuracy and effectiveness, and amount of time at preferred body temperatures, but males were more active aboveground than females, especially in June. These results indicate that different behavioral strategies can accomplish the same thermoregulatory outcomes. Further, chuckwallas might be able to cope with predicted changes in climate that result in a shorter amount of time they could be active at preferred body temperature because these lizards were only active aboveground for one to four hours per day, a fraction of the time available.

T1  - The Evolutionary Significance of Body Size in Burying Beetles
AN  - 2056568503
AB  - Body size is one of the most commonly studied traits of an organism, which is largely due to its direct correlation with fitness, life history strategy, and physiology of the organism. Patterns of body size distribution are also often studied. The distribution of body size within species is looked at for suggestions of differential mating strategies or niche variation among ontogenetic development. Patterns are also examined among species to determine the effects of competition, environmental factors, and phylogenetic inertia. Finally, the distribution of body size across the geographic range of a species or group of closely related is looked at for indications of the effects of climate and resource availability on body size at different latitudes and altitudes. In this collection of research, I address the evolution and importance of body size in burying beetles (genus Nicrophorus). Body size is important to several aspects of burying beetle natural history, including competitive ability, fitness, parental care, climate tolerance, and locomotor activity. In Chapter 1, I use a large data set of body size measurements for seventy of the seventy-three Nicrophorus species to make inferences about the distribution of body size within the genus, across its geographic range, and the importance of body size in speciation. I found that the range of body sizes is not normally distributed, with an overrepresentation of small-sized species. I also found that expansion of the burying beetle range has been restricted by their inability to tolerate warm, dry climates, and therefore the majority of burying beetle diversity occurs in the temperature mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Body size also seems to be important in speciation, as almost all sister taxa are significantly different in body size. In Chapter 2 I use common garden experiments to assess the importance of body size for males and females in competition, reproductive output, and starvation resistance. Body size is equally important for both sexes in starvation resistance, but it is more important for males in competitions for carcasses and for females in reproductive output. In Chapter 3 I test for fitness consequences of multigenerational effects of body size in offspring. I found that the larger offspring that are produced by larger mothers and on larger carcasses had higher fitness than small offspring. In Chapter 4 I test for the possibility of brood parasitism in two species of burying beetles, N. guttula  and N. marginatus, which co-occur over part of their geographic ranges. I found that both species are able to detect and remove parasitic larvae. Finally, in Chapter 5 I compiled parent and offspring body sizes from seven species of burying beetles and use them to compare the heritability of body size among species using comparative techniques and a meta-analysis. I found that body size heritability is different between species, but is low for the genus as a whole. Together, these projects provide valuable information on the evolutionary significance of body size in Nicrophorus , and indicate compelling questions for future research into the evolution of body size in burying beetles.

T1  - Influence of Natural and Anthropogenic Light Levels on Female Preferences in Eastern Gray Treefrogs (<i>Hyla versicolor</i>)
AN  - 2055351406
AB  - Chapter 1: While the influence of environmental variables, particularly temperature and rainfall, on the breeding behavior of amphibians is widely recognized, relatively few studies have addressed how the moon affects amphibian behavior. Yet, the lunar cycle provides several rhythmic temporal cues that animals could use to time important group events such as spawning, and the substantial changes in light levels associated with the different moon phases may also affect the behavior of nocturnal frogs. Using seven years of field observation data, we tested for lunar effects on the reproductive activity of male and female Eastern gray treefrogs ( Hyla versicolor). We found that chorusing and breeding activity was statistically more likely to occur around the first quarter of the moon and during intermediately bright nights, but that reproductive activity also occurred during various other times during the lunar cycle. We discuss these findings in relation to the two main hypotheses of lunar effects on animals: predator avoidance and temporal synchronization of breeding.    Chapter 2: Nocturnal light levels vary throughout the course of the lunar cycle, being darkest during the new moon and brightest during the full moon. Many nocturnal animals change their behavior in response to this natural variation in moonlight intensity. Frequently, these behavioral changes can be attributed to the way in which moonlight affects the ability of predators to spot potential prey. Mate sampling females may expose themselves to predators, making mate choice a behavior likely influenced by moonlight. Because mate choice is an important cause of sexual selection, understanding the causes of variation in mate choice decisions can yield a better understanding of the strength and direction of sexual selection under natural conditions. We predicted that female Eastern gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) would prefer longer calls (i.e., more attractive males) and/or be choosier, under darker conditions, because cover of darkness may aid in predator evasion. However, light treatment did not affect how females responded to variation in call duration, nor did it affect female choosiness or aspects of their approach behavior. This suggests that in gray treefrogs, variation in light levels associated with the changing phases of the moon does not alter the sexual selection regime on male call traits.    Chapter 3: Human activities are drastically changing the amount of artificial light entering natural habitats. Because light pollution alters the sensory environment, it may interfere with behaviors ranging from prey detection and vigilance to mate choice. Here we test the hypothesis that anthropogenic light pollution affects the mate choice behavior of female Eastern gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor). We tested this hypothesis under two experimental light treatments that simulate the light pollution created by streetlights (i.e., expansion of lit areas and increased light intensity), and the light pollution created by headlights of passing vehicles (i.e., rapid fluctuations between bright and dark conditions). The hypothesis predicts that females tested under conditions simulating light pollution will show behavioral changes geared towards mitigating detection by predators, such as relaxed preferences, decreased choosiness for the normally preferred call, and differences in approach behavior (either more directional, faster, or stealthier movements, or no approach at all). Contrary to our prediction, we found that light pollution did not affect mate choice behavior in gray treefrogs, and should therefore neither interfere with population persistence nor affect the sexual selection regimes on male call traits of this species. However, we caution that this result does not imply that anthropogenic light pollution is of no concern for amphibian conservation, because behavioral responses to variation in nocturnal light levels (both in the natural as well as anthropogenically enhanced range) seem to be highly species-specific in anurans. We encourage additional studies to help gage the vulnerability of anurans to anthropogenic light pollution.

T1  - Phenotypic plasticity drives phenological change in Mandt's Black Guillemot (<i>Cepphus grylle mandtii</i>)
AN  - 2054012977
AB  - The ability of individuals to change breeding time is predicted to be an important aspect of adapting to climate change. Changes in breeding time could occur through either behavioural adjustment of breeding time or evolution. To date, few studies have investigated these processes in Arctic environments, where temperature is rising at a greater rate than the global mean. I evaluated the contribution of behavioural adjustment of breeding time and evolution to changes in breeding time associated with annual variation in snow melt and female breeding age over a 42-year dataset from an Arctic population of Black Guillemots (Cepphus grylle mandtii). I used an Animal Model to decompose the variance observed in breeding time and I used three fitness metrics in a bivariate Animal Model to estimate selection on clutch initiation DOY. Finally, I examined the temporal trend in the genetic component of variation in clutch initiation date to determine if evolution contributed to the shift in breeding time. During the study period mean clutch initiation date advanced 7.8 days, snow melt date advanced 7.6 days, and the average female breeding age increased by 4.7 years. Earlier clutch initiation was associated with experienced mothers, earlier snow melt, and higher fitness. Individuals advanced clutch initiation at different rates as they aged but responded similarly to variation in snow melt. Heritability of clutch initiation date was negligible (h2 = 0.04, 95% CI [0.00-0.11]), and there was no evidence of evolution contributing to the change in breeding time. My results suggest that covariation between clutch initiation date and fitness is driven by environmental, but not genetic factors. Consequently, changes of breeding time in Black Guillemots are likely driven by plastic behavioural adjustment with limited potential for evolutionary change.

T1  - Sociality and Stress in Female Chacma Baboons (<i>Papio ursinus</i>) in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa: Behavioral Flexibility and Coping Mechanisms
AN  - 2047671604
AB  - The physiological stress responses that animals exhibit to the myriad stressors in their environment can be used to assess the state of their health and well-being, and even survival capability. Although the stress response is adaptive in many cases, chronic stress responses may be maladaptive in some situations when it leads to dysfunction of the physiological system involved in the stress response itself, and can also cause deleterious effects on health, reproduction and survival. The stress response includes physiological responses to both environmental perturbations and psychosocial stress and anxiety associated with social perturbations. The latter factor is particularly important for social animals such as primates. One way in which primates may respond to stressors is by adjusting their social bonds as well as their behaviors so as to cope with stressors and mitigate their negative effects.     In my dissertation research, I studied the effects of three types of stressors—social, environmental and anthropogenic—on the glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and behavior of females in three troops of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. I collected behavioral data from 33 females, i.e., all females that were adults at the start of the study period, and I also collected and analyzed fecal samples to determine GC levels. My study has three components, as follows:    1. Social stressors: I examined the effects of social instability caused by death and rank changes of males on GC hormone levels of females, as well as female behavioral responses to these events and their use of social bonds as coping mechanisms. In response to male instability, females increased the strength of their social relationships with other females, while focusing less of their social effort on males. Females differed in their adjustment of social relationships by reproductive state, with cycling females increasing their grooming of males and lactating females—who are at most risk of infanticide—reducing their grooming of females during the period of instability associated with the alpha male's injury. These changes in behavior may have effectively mitigated the negative impacts of social stressors, as GC levels did not increase during periods of male instability.     2. Environmental stressors: Living on the southern tip of Africa naturally exposes the baboons to extremes of temperatures, with hot, dry summers characterized by shortened day lengths and cold, wet winters with longer day lengths. In this study, I found that females had higher GC levels in the winter months and changed their activity budgets to accommodate their seasonally varying needs. Females spent a larger proportion of time feeding in the winter, with its shorter days, while at the same time reducing their time spent on other activities such as socializing and resting. There is some indication that the baboons used behavioral mechanisms for thermoregulation, as they spent more time in open, sunny areas in the winter possibly to absorb more heat, and they spent more time in closed forested areas in the summer, possibly as a way to remain cool.     3. Anthropogenic stressors: The study population of baboons lives in close proximity to humans in the Cape Peninsula and the home range of each troop is a patchwork of natural and developed habitats. When the baboons range in the more developed and urbanized areas, they have regular interactions with humans, often of a conflict nature. I examined the effects of this anthropogenic presence on female GC hormone levels as well as on their use of self-directed behaviors (SDB). Females had higher GC levels when they spent more time ranging in areas where they interacted more with humans and more often came into conflict with them. In some troops, ranging in areas of human presence was also associated with higher rates of self-directed behaviors.     The results of this study are meaningful and timely as anthropogenic disturbance and anthropogenic climate change are significant forces acting on animal communities, changing selection pressures and potentially driving evolutionary change. This study adds to our understanding of the variation of responses among taxa, as well as the behavioral flexibility exhibited by animals, and whether and how this flexibility may be adaptive in enabling animals to survive stressors and anthropogenic change. More broadly, my research aims to contribute to an understanding of the behavioral flexibility exhibited by primates in response to social and ecological variation and the adaptive value of this flexibility.

T1  - Adaptability and Management of Alfalfa Overseeded Into Warm-Season Perennial Grasses in Mississippi
AN  - 2038463865
AB  - Alfalfa overseeded into warm-season perennial grasses such as bahiagrass or bermudagrass has the potential to increase forage quality and dry matter yield as well as extend the growing season.  Many of the challenges associated with alfalfa in mixtures have been observed in warm-season grasses, but few studies have attempted to explain the dynamics between these grasses and alfalfa when grown together.  Two studies were designed to note these relationships: The objective of the first study was to observe the effect of seeding rate and sod preparation on alfalfa and bermudagrass persistence over three years by using minimum tillage and alfalfa seeding rates of 17, 22, 28, and 39 kg ha-1.  Results indicated that sod preparation had no effect on establishment compared to no-tillage.  Seeding rates resulted in similar biomass yields and species composition by the second year suggesting that increased seeding rates were unnecessary.  Forage quality and yield were improved throughout the year, but alfalfa composition generally decreased towards the end of summer.  The objective of the second study was to quantify the amount of nitrogen recovered when alfalfa was overseeded into bahiagrass and bermudagrass and fertilized with ammonium nitrate during late summer.  This was accomplished by using two nitrogen rates of 15N labeled fertilizer (28 and 56 kg N ha-1) and two application times (after 2nd and 3rd harvest) and in two separate planting environments (planting I and II).  It was found that bahiagrass was more competitive than bermudagrass when overseeded with alfalfa.   Alfalfa/grass mixtures did not increase forage dry matter yield, nutritive value or grass composition with N application. Nitrogen fertilizer recovery was variable between plantings due to a large variation of alfalfa persistence within different soil types.  Where alfalfa was limited, grass fertilizer recovery was over 60%, but when grass composed less than 10% in the mix, then alfalfa had the potential to recover over 40% of the applied fertilizer.  The greatest N recovery by grass were favored during late N application.  On the other hand, alfalfa N recovery was favored by early fertilizer application.

T1  - Persistent Effects of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Exposure Across Generations: A Bioenergetic and Mitochondrial Perspective
AN  - 2037231233
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. PAHs are toxicologically important for both humans and wildlife in large part due to their mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic properties. While the effects of adult and developmental exposures to PAHs are relatively well characterized, the potential for PAHs to have effects across generations is an emerging concern in the field of environmental health. In epidemiological studies, prenatal exposure to PAHs is associated with adverse birth outcomes as well as later life metabolic, neurological, and reproductive disorders— which have become global human health epidemics. These findings have been validated in animal models, with reduced survivorship, increased morphological deformities, and alterations in behavior, physiology, and disease risk in multiple subsequent generations. However, the mechanisms underlying the multigenerational effects of PAHs are poorly understood. This dissertation focuses on mitochondrial contributions to the maternal and cross-generational toxicity of PAHs.   Mitochondria are essential to the development, health, survival, and reproduction of all aerobic organisms. The importance of maintaining mitochondrial function for health is supported by the prevalence of mitochondrial diseases, which clinically manifest in at least 1 in 4,300 people. Mitochondrial diseases often present with metabolic, neurological, and reproductive consequences, similar to those associated with prenatal PAH exposures. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited and undergoes bottlenecks (i.e. reductions in mtDNA copy number per cell) during oogenesis and early embryonic development, creating potential for maternal and cross-generational inheritance of mitochondrial diseases. Inheritance of mitochondrial dysfunction across generations has been established for genetic, pharmacological, and dietary etiologies. Notably, mitochondria are important targets of environmental contaminants such as PAHs, which affect bioenergetics at multiple levels of biological organization. However, the potential for environmental toxicant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction to have persistent effects across multiple generations is still largely uncharacterized. This is the knowledge gap we address in this dissertation.    To this end, we evaluate the persistent bioenergetic effects of BaP – a model PAH and known mitochondrial toxicant – in F1 (maternally exposed) and F2 (cross-generationally exposed or germline exposed) generations following a chronic maternal (F0) dietary exposure using the model teleost  Danio rerio. Maternally exposed F1 embryos exhibit reduced mitochondrial DNA integrity, reduced mitochondrial function and efficiency, and impaired antioxidant defense systems during development, largely in the absence of effects in exposed F0 females. Metabolic shifts during development create potential for disease pathologies and reduced organismal fitness later in life. In F1 adults, mitochondrial dysfunction presents in cardiac tissue with reductions in mitochondrial reserve capacity. Cardiac function and plasticity are key determinants of fitness in the environment, and impaired function confers disease risk in humans. Maternally BaP exposed F1 fish also exhibit altered locomotor activity throughout life and reduced fear/anxiety behaviors as adults.   PAH-induced changes in mitochondrial function and metabolic plasticity persist in the F2 embryos, two generations removed from the original BaP exposure, suggesting cross-generational reductions in fitness may follow a single exposure event. Metabolic consequences occur in F2 embryos at F0 exposure levels that do not cause significant dysfunction in the F1 generation, with important implications for evaluating the risk associated with the persistent effects of pollution (e.g. lasting impacts of oil spill events) in the environment.    The ability to adjust metabolism is crucial for organisms to effectively respond to a variety of natural and anthropogenic stressors, suggesting that organisms with alterations in fundamental bioenergetic processes may be more sensitive to secondary stressors. Herein we demonstrate that F2 organisms with a cross-generational history of exposure exhibit altered metabolic response to thermal stress, reduced thermal tolerance, and fitness tradeoffs. Cross-generational exposure to BaP potentiates metabolic effects under thermal stress even in the absence of effects at baseline temperature. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to PAHs such as BaP affects mitochondrial function, organismal physiology, behavior, and secondary stress response capacity across generations, creating potential for downstream population and ecosystem level effects.

T1  - From Species to Populations: Genetic and Eco-physiological Divergence Across Puerto Rican <i>Anolis</i> Lizards
AN  - 2033928636
AB  - Species pairs of Puerto Rican anoles inhabit distinct thermal environments and are locally adapted to those environments with regard to physiological traits. In chapter 1, I analyzed multilocus nuclear genetic data and genome-wide SNP data to test for simultaneous divergence and gene flow between physiologically divergent species pairs. I utilized new model-based methods that rigorously test for shared evolutionary history by jointly estimating divergence times for multiple species while implementing models of divergence with and without gene flow, and compared results from Sanger and SNP datasets to determine which dataset is best suited for comparative phylogeographic analyses. These analyses indicate that ‘xeric’ adapted lizards may have evolved synchronously, but in general, recent speciation of Puerto Rican anoles proceeded idiosyncratically.   Recent models show that tropical ectotherms may respond to increasing temperatures by undergoing range shifts, acclimatizing, or becoming locally extinct. These models often overlook standing genetic variation and assume that tropical ectotherms will not be able to adapt rapidly enough to track global climate change. In chapter 2, I used multilocus nuclear genetic data and genome-wide SNP data to investigate phylogeographic patterns in  A. cristatellus across Puerto Rico, and to test whether genetic variation correlates with environmental climate layers. These analyses identified multiple genetic populations of A. cristatellus that correlate with thermal environment indicating that selection on physiological traits may drive population divergence. Surprisingly, I found asymmetrical gene flow from xeric to mesic populations. Genes flowing ‘out’ of xeric habitats fits a pattern in which selection against ‘warm-adapted’ genotypes in cool habitats is weak, whereas selection against ‘cool-adaptive’ genotypes in warm habitats is relatively strong.   Phylogeographic approaches identify geographic and ecological features that generate and maintain genetic diversity in co-distributed taxa. I analyzed genome-wide SNP data for three species of widespread Puerto Rican anoles to test the relative contributions of geography and ecology in driving population divergence. While only one species (A. cristatellus) had phylogeographic structure associated with ecological transitions, all three (A. cristatellus, A. pulchellus, and  A. stratulus) shared concordant population breaks and simultaneous divergence across the San Loiza Basin in eastern Puerto Rico. These results are consistent with phylogeographic work on other Puerto Rican vertebrates including frogs, indicating the San Loiza Basin as an important geographic feature driving population divergence across diverse ecological groups on Puerto Rico.   Divergent selection and local adaptation are recognized as primary drivers of reproductive isolation. However, thermoregulatory behavior may buffer divergent selection acting on thermal physiology, resulting in high gene flow across thermal gradients. I tested this prediction by analyzing genome-wide SNP data to investigate genetic clines along elevation gradient for populations of A. cristatellus that differ in operative temperatures and body temperatures. I also ran ecological association analysis of SNPs to test for signatures of selection resulting from temperature and precipitation. I found sharp genetic clines, despite thermoregulatory behavior that should buffer natural selection, indicating that precipitation may be the main agent of selection along the elevational gradient in southern Puerto Rico.

T1  - Phenology of a Southern Population of Mountain Pine Beetle (<i>Dendroctonous ponderosae</i>)
AN  - 2031119730
AB  - Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae, Hopkins) is a major disturbance agent in pine ecosystems of western North America. Adaptation to local climates has resulted in primarily univoltine (one generation per year) generation timing across a thermally diverse latitudinal gradient. We hypothesized that this pattern in total development time is shaped by selection for slower developmental rates, altered developmental thresholds, or oviposition rates in southern populations inhabiting warmer climates. To investigate traits responsible for latitudinal differences we measured lifestage-specific development of southern mountain pine beetle eggs, larvae and pupae across a range of temperatures. We also describe and model oviposition of southern US MPB. Using a novel technique that included frequent X-ray imaging, oviposition rate and fecundity were estimated separately and shown to both be significant and independent sources of variation. When compared with previously collected data for a northern MPB population, total oviposition time predicted for southern MPB at a constant 20°C was slightly longer than that of northern MPB, but the delay was too small to account for significant differences between the populations in total development time.    Developmental rate curves for eggs, larvae, and pupae were fit using maximum posterior likelihood estimation with a Bayesian prior to improve fit stability. When compared to previously published data fora northern population (Régnière et al. 2012), observed developmental rates of the southern and northern populations were similar across all studied lifestages at 20 and 25°C, although southern individuals were generally faster at temperature extremes (10 and 27°C). These findings were inconsistent with our hypothesis that southern individuals would have consistently slower rates. Optimal development of southern individuals occurred at higher temperatures, with higher development thresholds, as compared with northern individuals. Our results suggest that evolved traits in the remaining unstudied lifestage, teneral (i.e., pre-emergent) adult, likely influence latitudinal differences in mountain pine beetle generation time.

T1  - Intraspecific and Interspecific Competition in Two Species of Anurans: <i>Hyla Savignyi</i> and <i>Bufotes Viridis</i>

AN  - 2585368660
AB  - Inter- and intraspecific density-dependent effects may influence amphibians in temporary pools. Two factors were tested in my thesis: oviposition site selection in response to Hyla savignyi intraspecific density and larval performance of the two species interacting intraspecifically and interspecifically in response to density – survival to, size at, and time to metamorphosis.The first outdoor mesocosm experiment tested the effect of 3 levels of density (0, 10 and 40 tadpoles) on oviposition site selection and larval performance of Hyla savignyi using plastic tubs as mesocosms filled with 20 L of water, simulating temporary pools. Mass to metamorphosis was strongly and negatively affected at the high density. Gravid females chose oviposition sites with no or low density of conspecific tadpoles. The main mesocosm experiment was set as a replacement design to test intraspecific and interspecific competition between H. savignyi and Bufotes viridis due to the fact that these two species co-occur in the same habitats and at the same time, and appear to both be predominantly periphyton grazers. The design included five treatments of different densities for each species (0 Hyla + 20 Bufotes; 0 Hyla + 40 Bufotes; 20 Hyla + 20 Bufotes; 20 Hyla + 0 Bufotes; 40 Hyla + 0 Bufotes) and a control with no tadpoles in order to test the effect of tadpole density on the invertebrate community. As demonstrated in the preliminary experiment, mass at metamorphosis of H. savignyi was affected by intraspecific competition in the second experiment as well. Time to metamorphosis was also affected by intraspecific competition with strong tendency towards statistical significance. Although tadpoles of B. viridis did not exhibit density-dependent effects, temperature had a positive correlation with survival and a negative correlation with time to metamorphosis. Since literature suggests that when intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific competition coexistence is possible, my results might explain the co-occurrence of these two species.Alternate abstract:השפעות תלויות-צפיפות, תוך-מינית ובין-מינית עלולים להשפיע על דו-חיים המאכלסים בריכות חורף עונתיות. שתי השפעות נבחנו במסגרת התיזה שלי: בחירת אתר הטלה של נקבות כתגובה לצפיפות תוך-מינית של אילנית מצויה )savignyi Hyla )והתפתחות לארוולית של שני מינים באינטראקציה בין-מינית ותוך-מינית כתגובה לצפיפות - שרידות במטמורפוזה, משקל במטמורפוזה וזמן למטמורפוזה. הניסוי הראשון אשר בוצע בשטח ומדמה ככל הניתן את התנאים הטבעיים של בריכה עונתית, בדק את השפעת 3 רמות של צפיפות )0 ,10 ו-40 ראשנים( על בחירת האתר הטלה של נקבות ועל ההתפתחות הלארוולית של אילנית מצויה )savignyi Hyla .)נעשה שימוש בגיגיות פלסטיק כאשר כל גיגית מולאה ב-20 ליטר מים, על מנת לדמות בריכה עונתית. לצפיפות גבוהה של ראשנים הייתה השפעה חזקה ושלילית על משקל הראשנים במטמורפוזה. נקבות בחרו להטלה אתרים ללא ראשנים או עם מספר נמוך של ראשנים מאותו המין. הניסוי הראשי והמרכזי עוצב כך שיוכל לבחון תחרות בין-מינית ותחרות תוך-מינית של שני מיני דו-חיים: אילנית מצויה )savignyi Hyla )וקרפדה ירוקה ) Bufotes viridis ,)מתוך העובדה ששני מינים אלו חולקים את אותו בית גידול, באותה תקופה וככל הנראה גם ניזונים מפריפיטון. הניסוי כלל חמישה טיפולים של צפיפויות משתנות לכל מין )0 אילנית+20 קרפדה; 0 אילנית+40 קרפדה; 20 אילנית+20 קרפדה; 20 אילנית+0 קרפדה; 40 אילנית+0 קרפדה( וטיפול אחד נוסף ללא ראשנים כלל ששימש כביקורת במטרה לבחון את השפעת צפיפות הראשנים על אוכלוסיית חסרי החוליות. בדומה לכפי שהוצג בניסוי ההתחלתי, משקל במטמורפוזה של האילנית המצויה הושפע מתחרות תוך-מינית גם בניסוי המרכזי. זמן למטמורפוזה גם כן הושפע מתחרות תוך-מינית עם נטייה חזקה למובהקות סטטיסטית. למרות שראשני הקרפדה הירוקה לא הראו השפעות תלויות-צפיפות, טמפרטורה הייתה בקורלציה חיובית עם שרידות הראשנים ובקורלציה שלילית עם זמן למטמורפוזה. ההצעה הנה שתחרות תוך-מינית חזקה עשויה להסביר את הדו-קיום של שני המינים שנבדקו במחקר זה.

AB  - Numerous studies illustrate that the mineral zircon is the preeminent material resource for understanding fundamental geologic processes that occur in continental crust. Zircon can grow and exist in a broad range of igneous and metamorphic environments within the Earth's crust, and incorporates trace concentrations of elements (U, Th, Hf, REE) that allow age and chemical fingerprinting of these "environmental" influences. This dissertation explores the tectonic and petrologic ramifications of zircon inheritance in the rock cycle, focusing primarily on insights from xenocrystic zircons found in igneous rocks. Pre-magmatic (xenocrystic) domains in zircons can convey otherwise inaccessible details regarding the composition and history of deep--seated magma source regions from which the xenocrysts were derived. The pre--Cenozoic kinematic and tectonic history of the Arctic Alaska Chukotka terrane (AAC) is explored in Chapters 1 and 2. Constraining the pre-opening paleogeography of the Canadian and Alaskan margins of the Canada Basin is a first-order objective in resolving the plate tectonic evolution of the Amerasia Basin of the Arctic Ocean. Paleogeographic models of Northern Alaska are tested using detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of 12 samples from Middle Mississippian to Early-Middle Jurassic strata (Ellesmerian and lower Beaufortian megasequences) obtained from wells and outcrop along Alaska's North Slope. Arctic Alaska received sediments recycled from the Devonian foreland clastic wedge and underlying Franklinian Basin strata along the Canadian margin-- indicating northern Alaska was part of the foreland fold and thrust belt of the Franklinian mobile belt prior to the opening of the Canada Basin. During the Mesozoic, the AAC was involved in crustal shortening, followed by magmatism and extension, with localized high--grade metamorphism and partial melting, all of which obscured its pre--orogenic geological relationships. New zircon geochronology and isotope geochemistry results from Wrangel Island and western Chukotka basement rocks establish and strengthen intra-- and inter--terrane lithologic and tectonic correlations of the AAC. Temporal patterns of zircon inheritance and O--Hf isotopes are consistent with Cryogenian--Ediacaran AAC magmatism in a peripheral/external orogenic setting (i.e., fringing arc on rifted continental margin crust). In Chapters 3 and 4 fundamental questions about lithology, age, structure, and thermal evolution of the deep crust of the retro--arc hinterland of the North American Cordilleran orogen are addressed through systematic investigation of zircons from Cretaceous and Paleogene granitic rocks in the Snake Range, Kern Mountains, and Deep Creek Range in the east-central Great Basin. Regional metamorphism in Neoproterozoic strata succeeded by (and facilitating?) local underthrusting of low δ18O Paleoproterozoic cratonal basement at depth best explains the observed patterns of inheritance associated with retroarc magmatism during Late Cretaceous time. Ubiquitous mid--Cretaceous to Paleogene zircon overgrowths on xenocrysts from 40 Ma muscovite porphyry dikes indicate that fertile conditions for zircon growth existed throughout the time span of the Sevier and Laramide orogenies, persisting until 45 Ma. "Closed--system" like conditions allowed the overgrowths to preserve similar δ18O compositions to their cores. After 40 Ma in the study area, increased mantle heat flow related to foundering of the Farallon oceanic lithosphere exceeded conditions for pre--magmatic zircon preservation, making xenocrysts a unique archive of the deep crust history here.

T1  - Understanding and Tuning Thermal Transport at the Nanoscale
AN  - 2508877764
AB  - Thermal transport in nanoscale materials is highly sensitive to the presence of defects and imperfections. For applications in areas ranging from electronics thermal management to energy harvesting, it is crucial to understand how material microstructure impacts thermal conductivity. Microstructural features such as grain boundaries, interfaces, and point defects can all scatter vibrational energy carriers leading to a modulation of the local thermal resistance. This work examines these phenomena over a range of defect length scales, in materials ranging from isotropic three-dimensional (3D) to highly anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) layered systems, using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy (time-domain thermoreflectance, or TDTR) as a probe. First, we discuss thermal transport measurements and modeling of heat conduction in thin-films of polycrystalline diamond, down to ~500 nm in thickness, where phonon scattering at grain boundaries plays a crucial role. The complex nucleation and growth kinetics lead to the formation of a columnar grain structure, which results in a highly anisotropic (~5×) and inhomogeneous thermal conductivity tensor. We construct a geometrical model that relates the spatial evolution of the thermal conductivity to the underlying competition and survival of growing crystallites. Second, we describe thermal conductivity measurements of epitaxially-grown short-period (~4 nm) III-V superlattice thin-films, where phonon-interface scattering plays a central role. Detailed theoretical analysis using a phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) model reveals that lattice-matching in this system leads to high-quality interfaces that scatter phonons specularly. The implications of these results for the design and operation of mid-infrared Quantum Cascade Lasers are discussed. Third, we shift our focus to understanding thermal transport in van der Waals layered 2D materials and devices. We describe measurements of the fundamental mean free path (MFP) spectrum of heat-carrying phonons along the c-axis of MoS2, via thickness-dependent cross-plane thermal conductivity measurements of films as thin as ~20 nm. We uncover a surprising fact about the prominent contribution of long MFP phonons (MFPs as long as ~100s of nm) to thermal transport. Combining our experimental data with first principles phonon calculations, we show that the spectrum of heat-carrying vibrational modes (traveling normal to the layers) extends from ~5 nm to ~1 µm in crystalline MoS2. Finally, we present a novel thermal application of a dynamically tunable microstructure based on a layered 2D material. We show how point-defects, namely intercalated Li ions, can be used to reversibly modulate cross-plane thermal transport in MoS2. These electrochemical thermal transistors, only ~10 nm thick, show large thermal "on/off" ratios approaching nearly one order of magnitude. Using a novel in operando thermal conductance microscopy technique, we demonstrate "live" visualization of Li ion redistribution during charging and discharging of the MoS2 thermal transistor, with a spatial resolution down to ~1 µm. Atomic force microscopy on chemically intercalated samples shows that Li insertion into the van der Waals gap in MoS2 increases its c-axis lattice constant, and introduces mesoscopic disorder. Using first principles density functional theory and molecular dynamics calculations, we sort out the relative contributions of different factors that lead to the large modulation in thermal conductivity, including increased phonon scattering by Li 'rattler' modes, acoustic mode-softening due to lattice-expansion, and disorder at the atomic and mesoscopic length scales.

T1  - Ecophysiology of Overwintering in Honey Bees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>, L.)
AN  - 2426174624
AB  - Winter is a great challenge for all animals living in the temperate climates. Among insects, honey bees are unique for their overwintering behavior. While virtually all other insect species go into diapause (a dormant state), honey bee colonies comes to a reproductive arrest but existing worker bees form a thermoregulatory cluster to generate and maintain heat against the ambient temperature (Döke, Frazier, & Grozinger, 2015). During this process, the colony solely depends on food they have collected through the previous spring and summer and stored in the form of honey for energy (Owens, 1971). Moreover, the workers in fall must survive until the end of winter since there simply cannot be worker turn-over during this broodless period (Mattila, Harris, & Otis, 2001). Thus, in fall, workers with a distinct physiological state and increased longevity are produced in the colony, replacing the short-lived summer bees (Fluri, Lüscher, Wille, & Gerig, 1982; Z. Y. Huang & Robinson, 1995).Populations of honey bee colonies maintained in the same area for several generations can adapt to their environment and moving colonies between climatic regions can lower their overwintering survival, suggesting existence of selectable, genetic components for overwintering success (Büchler et al., 2014; Hatjina et al., 2014; Parker et al., 2010). On the other hand, all of the individuals throughout the year are half-sisters – daughters of a multiply mated queen – making them genetically similar. Yet worker bees of summer and winter are radically different in their physiology and behavior suggesting existence of differentially expressed genes that modify the individual phenotype according to environmental cues. The research presented in this dissertation establishes a solid foundation for the genetic, transcriptomic, physiological, and social components of honey bee overwintering and its regulation.Chapter 1 reviews the current state of research on honey bee overwintering and best practices to maximize survival rate of managed honey bee colonies. Additionally, using the literature, a testable hypothetical model for the environmental cues acting on honey bee overwintering is offered. We believe this model will be a useful framework for researchers in testing the effect of individual environmental parameters on honey bee overwintering, and indeed we initiate testing of this model in Chapter 5.Chapter 2 examines the molecular mechanisms underlying the unique “winter bee” physiological state. We evaluate expression patterns of key metabolic and antioxidant genes in the abdominal fat body tissues and thoracic flight muscles of nurses, foragers, and winter bees collected from the same colonies throughout the year. When the three groups are compared using gene expression patterns in the abdominal fat body tissues, winter bees resemble nurses. However, when the gene expression in thoracic flight muscle is compared, winter bees resemble foragers. These findings suggest two distinct genetic toolkits working in tandem in different tissues to mixand- match expression profiles of summer workers tending different tasks to generate a novel phenotype; the winter bee.Chapter 3 explores the interactions between host physiological state and parasites, including the unique phenotype of the winter bee. Nosema is a microsporidian parasite infecting honey bees, which has been shown to alter the physiology of their hosts and increase behavioral maturation rates from nursing the foraging. However, these studies have been largely conducted by infecting one day old bees, and thus the impacts of Nosema on nurses, foragers, and winter bees have not been evaluated. Findings from this chapter show the effect of infection on longevity is greatly affected by host physiology. Moreover, previously identified “Nosema responsive” genes in honey bees (whose expression was altered by Nosema infection of young, cage-reared bees) were here shown to be primarily affected by the physiological state of the host rather than the infection state, suggesting that previous transcriptional studies were capturing the impact of Nosema on host maturation rather than a direct host immune response. Overall, these findings demonstrate the need for contextual experiments for realistic assessment of the effects infectious diseases have on their hosts.Chapter 4 compares the overwintering success colonies from southern (TX & FL) and northern (WV & VT) United States when placed in the same apiaries in temperate central Pennsylvania to examine the effect of genotype on winter survival and investigate whether northern stocks are locally adapted to colder and longer winters. Findings from this chapter suggest that while there locally adapted to colder and longer winters. Findings from this chapter suggest that while there are small – but detectable – genetic differences between populations of honey bees reared in the northern and southern United State, these differences are not associated with variation in overwintering survival. Instead, overwintering survival is greatly dependent on the size of the colony and can vary dramatically with the specific location – and its associated floral resources and climatic conditions - in which the colony is placed.Chapter 5 investigates the theory that landscape floral nutritional resources and climatic conditions influence social interactions and demographic structure in the colony, which then in turn mediates the production of winter bees and prepares the colony for winter. As was proposed in Chapter 1, two worker-produced pheromones (brood pheromone and forager pheromone) can act antagonistically, creating a push and pull model for the initiation and maintenance of winter phenotype. Testing this hypothesis, we did not find evidence to support a direct effect of the pheromones on colony vigor or survival. However, this study was limited by the fact that we experimented solely in the field where multiple confounding factors likely acted on the colonies.Lastly, Chapter 6 summarizes the findings from this dissertation, integrates results with current scientific literature, and discusses the future of research on honey bee overwintering.

T1  - Digital micromirror devices and femtosecond laser pulses for rapid laser micromachining
AN  - 2083754941
AB  - Laser machining techniques are almost ubiquitous in industry for micro- to nanoscale fabrication. It is essential for the advancement of the field that faster, cheaper processes be developed. Enhancements in speed and fidelity of production can be made to both additive and subtractive writing techniques by using Digital Micromirror Devices (DMD), particularly when coupled with femtosecond laser pulses. The objective of this thesis is the demonstration of DMDs used in conjunction with ultrafast laser pulses for both novel and rapid machining applications; primarily image-projection based techniques, using DMDs as dynamic intensity masks, will be used for subtractive patterning, laserinduced transfer, multi-photon polymerisation and centimetre-scale micro-machining. The dynamic nature of the DMD enables its application to the field of multiple exposures, and the centimetre-scale machining is applied to functional biological assays. Adaptive mask techniques are used to enhance the image reproduction achieved, correct for positional errors introduced by translation stages, as well as to attain greyscale intensity control with a DMD in single ultrashort pulses. A new technique for producing digital holograms is developed, and will form the basis of future work. Image projection-based patterning using DMDs as dynamic intensity masks is shown via ablation, multiphoton polymerisation and Laser-Induced Transfer (LIT). Ablation was achieved in a range of materials (including, but not limited to: gold, graphite, diamond, bismuth telluride and antimony telluride, glass, nickel, glucose, and gelatin), with 2 micron resolutions in samples and overall sizes of 1cm2. A multiple exposure technique reduced final structure resolution by 2.7 compared to the diffraction limit possible in a single exposure – from 1m to 370nm on one experimental setup, and from 727nm to 270nm on a second setup. The first demonstration of shaped, solid-phase LIT deposits has been made, both in forward and backward directions of transfer. Adaptive optics techniques have been developed for DMD mask corrections, and have reduced the positional error of samples introduced by translation stages. Greyscale intensity patterns have been projected at samples using the strictly binary-style DMD display technology, and the loss of intensity in high spatial frequencies at the sample has been addressed. A novel method for the generation of binary holograms is introduced, which allows for several additional degrees of control over spatial intensity patterns when using DMDs, such as the effective mask position relative to imaging optics, greyscale control, the formation of images at multiple planes, phase control, and overall lateral shifts of the intensity distribution below a single DMD pixel width.

T1  - Comparative Ecology and Physiology of Critically Endangered Madagascar Tortoises
AN  - 2057567519
AB  - For ectotherms, physiology and behavior are critically tied to environmental conditions. Feeding, metabolism, reproduction, and even movement are strongly influenced by temperature, cover availability, and resource quality. The underlying mechanisms of these interactions are, however, poorly understood. The use of seasonal baseline hormone concentrations and data on ranging behavior can be used to determining the potential reproductive output in both wild and captive populations. Using three closely related, critically endangered Malagasy tortoise species as models, I assessed the tempo and mode of reproductive potential, activity, and health (stress and body condition) by measuring circulating stress and sex steroid hormones in conjunction with environmental, physical, activity, and behavioral features. Over a period of four years, I monitored circulating plasma hormone concentrations in conjunction with associated ecological and behavioral parameters to define and describe baseline and divergences which may be linked to reproductive adaptations to changing environments (weather and habitat features). Using wild, successfully reproducing populations and two captive populations for comparison, I tested the hypotheses that 1) timing, onset, duration, and frequency of reproductive cycles are a function of environmental conditions; 2) physiological stress influences behavior and reproduction, representing behavioral adaptability; 3) animals housed in captive conditions will exhibit chronic stress which reduces reproductive output; and 4) that perturbations in environment alters normal activity patterns and preferences. Elucidating the causal relationships that trigger divergence from homeostasis (stressors) will facilitate the development of effective management strategies, which are presently needed for Critically Endangered species (threatened by extinction in the wild; IUCN 2016).

T1  - Characterization of Surface Sulfate Species on Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts: Insights From Spectroscopic Studies
AN  - 2025506622
AB  - Solid acid and super acid catalysts are promising alternatives for very important reactions usually catalyzed industrially by homogeneous acid reactions. Sulfated metal oxides are among many examples of solid super acids which work well for acid catalyzed reactions. These catalysts have applications in isomerization, alkylation, acylation and oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. A characteristic example encompasses products from tert-butylation of phenol which have tremendous importance in chemical, petrochemical as well as pharmaceutical industry. In spite of significant amount of work devoted in this area, the catalysts being commercially used have low yields. Hence we channel our efforts in enhancing the productivity of the alkylation of phenol reaction by using sulfated metal oxides as it has shown in our preliminary work improved catalytic activity. In this work, we focus on the preparation and characterization of sulfated mixed metal oxides. Specifically, sulfated-Tin-Zirconium oxides (STZ) are produced by coprecipitation method using hydrated Zirconium Oxychloride(ZrOCl 2.8H2O) and Tin Chloride(SnCl4.5H2O) as metal precursors and ammonia as the precipitating agent.  Different proportions of hydrous tin and zirconium oxides (molar ratios of 1:10,1:1 and 10:1) are synthesized. Sulfation of the prepared hydrous oxides is performed using wet impregnation method with 1M and 0.5M sulfuric acid solution. Calcination of the prepared sulfate mixed hydroxides follows at 600°C. Our work focuses on the incorporation of vibrational spectroscopic teqniques at the individual steps of the synthesis procedure. To that end, first we utilize Raman spectroscopy to study the speciation of the metal salts precursors in water and at various pH range. The broad spectral envelope is assigned to specific vibational modes of the various species. XRD analysis is done to understand the crystalline phases of the catalyst. Additionally, we study the temperature evolution of the deposited sulfated species by means of in-situ Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR-FTIR) and in-situ Raman spectroscopy using high temperature reaction chamber. The results show that the molecular structure of the surface sulfate species varies significantly with increasing temperature as underscored by the changes of S=O vibrational bands. It was found that the sulfated species getting attached to the catalyst support can  majorly be present as bidentate, tridentate and polymeric species and are a function of the temperature as well as the Sn:Zr ratio. Tuning the molecular structure of the sulfated species could potentially alter the acidic properties of the catalysts as indicated by the Lewis/Bronsted acid sites. Lastly, it was found that the crystalline phases of the  the regenerated catalyst remain unaffected along with the sulfated groups.

T1  - Driven by Affect to Explore Asteroids, the Moon, and Science Education
AN  - 2023999683; ED581019
AB  - Affect is a domain of psychology that includes attitudes, emotions, interests, and values. My own affect influenced the choice of topics for my dissertation. After examining asteroid interiors and the Moon's thermal evolution, I discuss the role of affect in online science education. I begin with asteroids, which are collections of smaller objects held together by gravity and possibly cohesion. These "rubble-pile" objects may experience the Brazil Nut Effect (BNE). When a collection of particles of similar densities, but of different sizes, is shaken, smaller particles will move parallel to the local gravity vector while larger objects will do the opposite. Thus, when asteroids are shaken by impacts, they may experience the BNE as possibly evidenced by large boulders seen on their surfaces. I found while the BNE is plausible on asteroids, it is confined to only the outer layers. The Moon, which formed with a Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO), is the next topic of this work. The LMO is due to the Moon forming rapidly after a giant impact between the proto-Earth and another planetary body. The first 80% of the LMO solidified rapidly at which point a floatation crust formed and slowed solidification of the remaining LMO. Impact bombardment during this cooling process, while an important component, has not been studied in detail. Impacts considered here are from debris generated during the formation of the Moon. I developed a thermal model that incorporates impacts and find that impacts may have either expedited or delayed LMO solidification. Finally, I return to affect to consider the differences in attitudes towards science between students enrolled in fully-online degree programs and those enrolled in traditional, in-person degree programs. I analyzed pre- and post-course survey data from the online astrobiology course Habitable Worlds. Unlike their traditional program counterparts, students enrolled in online programs started the course with better attitudes towards science and also further changed towards more positive attitudes during the course. Along with important conclusions in three research fields, this work aims to demonstrate the importance of affect in both scientific research and science education.

T1  - Functional Studies of Novel Mosquito Stage-Specific Genes in the Malaria Parasite Plasmodium berghei
AN  - 2023572023
AB  - The development and survival of the malaria parasite Plasmodium within its mosquito vector is not very well understood. When the parasite is taken up by an Anopheles mosquito, it is exposed to digestive enzymes, reactive oxygen species, increasing pH, decreasing temperature, and a diverse microbial flora. Our lab is studying the adaptive mechanisms underlying parasite survival in this hostile environment, one of which is movement out of the midgut. In order to escape the midgut, the parasite develops into an elongated, motile form called the ookinete. I am investigating two genes, thioredoxin-like protein 1 (trxl-1) and subpellicular microtubule protein 1 (spm-1) that are specifically upregulated during the development into an ookinete. Based on our own previous findings and other literature in a related protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, I hypothesize that these genes are important for the generation and maintenance of the essential polar shape of the ookinete. In order to determine the function of these genes, I used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate trxl1KO and spm1KO transgenic parasite lines. The results of this study are presented in this thesis.

T1  - Calibration-free Spectrophotometric Measurements of Carbonate Saturation States in Seawater
AN  - 2002331568
AB  - This work describes efforts to improve methodologies and instrumentation for investigation of the marine CO2 system. In the first section of my thesis, a method was developed that provides simple, calibration-free measurements of seawater carbonate saturation states (Ωspec) based solely on the use of a laboratory spectrophotometer. Measurements of pH are made in paired optical cells, one with and one without added nitric acid. The amount of added nitric acid is determined through the direct proportionality between nitrate concentration and UV absorbance. After an initial calibration, the method is calibration-free and requires no volumetric or gravimetric analyses thereafter. Saturation state measurements can be obtained in twelve minutes and attain Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network accuracy goals over a wide range of conditions. This simple one-step measurement protocol is ideal for monitoring ocean acidification conditions in coastal areas, fish hatcheries and shellfish farms.   The second section of my thesis outlines the development of a next-generation handheld photometer for field measurements of seawater pH. The hand-held instrument is simple to use, inexpensive, and has a pH measurement accuracy of ±0.01. Each photometer is calibrated by relating pH-indicator absorbance ratios (R B) obtained with the broadband photometer to indicator absorbance ratios (RN) obtained with a high quality, narrowband scanning spectrophotometer. The RB vs RN relationship for each photometer is entered into the instrument’s software, providing discrete, real-time pH observations from measurements of RB, salinity and temperature. Measurement accuracy is assessed through comparisons of photometer pH with pH observations obtained using standard measurement procedures and high-quality spectrophotometers. The targeted user-groups for these instruments include middle and high school students, citizen scientists, and resource managers.

T1  - Self-optimisation of automated continuous reactors
AN  - 2001424844
AB  - The optimisation of problematic reaction steps in the synthesis of a drug compound is crucial for pharmaceutical process development. In recent traditions, this has carried out using design of experiments (DoE), which shows the key reaction variables and provides optimum reaction conditions. The process can require a lot of experiments and be time and resource consuming. The speed of optimisation experiments can be increased by using automated platforms complete with online analysis, which carry out reactions and acquire analytical samples without any human intervention. If these experiments can be carried out in continuous reactors then they will benefit from faster kinetics, enhanced heat and mass transfer, improved safety and higher productivity over their batch counterparts. An automated self-optimising flow reactor combines a continuous reactor with online analysis and feedback loop. The feedback loop contains full computerised control and monitoring of all equipment as well as a minimising algorithm, which will use the results from the online analysis to predict new optimum conditions. The technique has been shown to optimise the synthesis of small organic compounds but has, so far, yet to be widely used in pharmaceutical process development. This thesis has improved self-optimising technologies in order to make it a useful technique in pharmaceutical process development. First, the final bond forming step in the synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient was optimised for yield. Studies were primarily carried out on a model compound in order to establish the correct reactor setup before transferring to the active compound, which found an optimum yield of 89%. The work also provided mechanistic evidence for generation of impurities. Next, response surface models were successfully fitted to the data obtained from a branch and fit algorithm optimisation of a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. In depth statistical calculations show how DoE models can be generated from self-optimisation data with good fit and predictability (R2 > 0.95, Q2 > 0.90), and with the aid of commercial DoE software. Further work developed the use of direct mass spectrometry (MS) as the online analytical method. The short method times and real-time analysis of MS allowed a steady state detection function to be built, followed by a linear calibration model of all the species in the amidation of a methyl ester. The reaction was optimised for yield using branch and fit algorithm, and DoE, with excellent agreement between the two techniques in both optimum conditions and responses. Finally, changes were made to the optimisation program to reduce the amount of material required for automated optimisations. Reaction pulses of sub-reactor volumes were pumped through the reactor, dispersed in a continuous phase of miscible solvent. Residence time distribution experiments were carried out to characterise the dispersion of the reactor and calculate the minimum reactor pulse volume. Optimisations were primarily carried out using pattern search algorithm and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, the latter of which generated a three target function optimum, reducing the amount of waste by 81%. Overall this work has shown how self-optimisation can be a valuable tool for pharmaceutical process development. The existing technique has been improved by demonstrating its use in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, combining it with existing DoE techniques, adding new forms of online analysis, and reducing the amount of material required to deliver a multi-target optimum.

T1  - Thermal adaptation of thalassiosira pseudonana using experimental evolution approaches
AN  - 2001423424
AB  - Diatoms contribute about 50% of global primary production and are on of the most diverse phytoplankton groups. Additionally, they form the basis of most marine food webs and play an important role in elemental cycles such as carbon and silica. Global warming impacts the diversity and productivity of marine ecosystems as temperature is considered a strong selecting agent underpinning global diversity patterns of marine phytoplankton. In order to gain insights into diatom distribution and diversity in the Atlantic Ocean, we analysed 18S rDNA ribotypes over a broad spatial scale from the Fram Strait to the South Atlantic. Diversity patterns were related to environmental metadata in order to identify main drivers. Our results indicate that salinity had a negative effect on diatom diversity in the Fram Strait transect with stations showing low diversity at high salinities. In contrast, diatom diversity in the Atlantic Ocean was negatively correlated to temperature with high temperature showing low diatom diversity. The order of Coscinodiscales showed a, formerly unknown, cosmopolitan distribution and was the overall most abundant species. With this study we provided an updated estimate of diatom distribution and diversity in the Atlantic Ocean. Phytoplankton physiology is highly temperature dependent and despite the importance of temperature as a major driver of marine phytoplankton evolution, the molecular mechanisms of adaptive evolution under temperature selection are largely unknown but instrumental for predicting how marine phytoplankton will respond to a changing ocean. Here we provide evidence, based on experimental evolution experiments with the marine model diatom Thalassisoria pseudonana that thermal tolerance can rapidly evolve within 300 generations. Our results indicate that upper and lower temperature limits were fixed, however temperature optima for growth shifted towards the selection temperature. Furthermore, temperature had a significant impact on average cell diameter, bSi content and cellular stoichiometry (C:N:P). Physiological adaptation to high temperature was underpinned by differential expression of genes related to protein metabolism (protein binding and folding), and down-regulation of mismatch repair mechanisms potentially causing a high number of SNPs in the genome. Furthermore, several transposable elements showed strong, temperature specific up-regulation suggesting epigenetic enabled genome plasticity. Our results highlight the relation of adaptive pheno- and genotypes driven by temperature selection. This knowledge is key to our understanding of how the environment shapes the evolution of microbes and the biogeochemical processes they drive.

T1  - Synthesis and characterisation of barium titanate nanoparticles for second harmonic generation applications
AN  - 2001106272
AB  - This thesis presents findings of hydrothermally synthesised barium titanate nanoparticles for biomarker applications. Hydrothermal barium titanate (H-BT) and barium strontium titanate (H-BST) nanoparticles were successfully synthesised and were characterised for their second harmonic generation applications. X-Ray powder diffraction (laboratory and synchrotron) highlighted that H-BT and H-BST had a mixed tetragonal and cubic phase fraction present by Rietveld peak fitting analysis. Regardless of the phase fractions present, all nanoparticles emitted SHG (including a commercial cubic BaTiO3 sample that appeared cubic by XRD). The smaller sized H-BST nanoparticles (45 nm) required an increase in incident laser power compared to the H-BT sample (~140 nm). The phase of the nanoparticles and origin of SHG was investigated by electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy and high resolution HAADF-STEM imaging. In-situ electron diffraction of barium titanate showed that the tetragonal diffraction pattern transformed to a cubic pattern when heated above the Curie point. The phase transition was also investigated by EELS measurements of the Ti-L3 edge t2g-eg peak separation at room temperature and 400 oC showing the reduction in t2g-eg peak separation when the sample transforms from a tetragonal to cubic phase. The surface of the nanoparticles also showed an atomically rough layer with incomplete unit cells, and the ‘bulk’ of the nanoparticles showed random Ti-atom distortions by HAADF-STEM Ti-atom displacement analysis. This suggests the origin of SHG is likely to be both a cause of surface roughness and local asymmetric distortions in the nanoparticle bulk. The hydrothermally prepared and PLL-coated nanoparticles were measured to assess the cell viability and DNA damage of cells after a 24-hour exposure. The nanoparticles were measured by dynamic light scattering to understand the behaviour of uncoated and PLL-coated nanoparticles suspended in different media. The uncoated nanoparticles showed little reduction in cell viability and genotoxicity, whereas the PLL coated nanoparticles showed a reduction in cell viability and a failed comet assay at concentrations ≥10 µg/mL. The nanoparticles were confirmed to be taken up into the cells by electron microscopy of critically point dried and resin embedded cell sections. Cryo-TEM of the H-BT-PLL nanoparticles suspended at 100 µg/mL in complete cell culture media showed that some nanoparticles were coated with a calcium phosphate coating and others not. This resulted in, either cells having a direct exposure to PLL and positively charged nanoparticles, or all the calcium was removed from the media that is required for cell signalling pathways which could lead to a reduction in cell viability.

T1  - Paling in Comparison: The Role of Sex and Temperature in Melanin-Based Immune Function
AN  - 1989778401
AB  - Sex differences in disease susceptibility have been observed across a wide range of species, yet we lack a strong understanding of how environmental context influences these patterns. In this thesis, I take a life-history approach to investigating the plasticity of immunological sex differences in insects. Insects rely on the pigment melanin for both immune function and the structure and coloration of the cuticle (i.e. integument). Although many studies have shown evidence of correlations between immunity and cuticle pigmentation, most do not take into account the many potential modes of selection acting on cuticle melanism. Given that the biochemical precursors of melanin are a common currency in thermoregulation, sexual ornamentation, and immune function in insects, we hypothesized that sex differences in melanin-based resource allocation contribute to sex differences in immunity, and that the thermal environment will moderate this influence. My thesis work focused on the interactive effects of sexual selection and thermal selection on cuticle melanism and immunity in the Pacific field cricket (Teleogryllus oceanicus). After rearing crickets under multiple temperatures, we found, as predicted, that females invested more in immunity, males invested more in cuticle melanism, and both immune function and cuticle melanism were reduced in individuals that developed under warmer temperatures. Our results suggest that sex-specific investment in melanin corresponds with sex differences in immunity and that thermoregulation may act as an immune constraint under high temperatures, thus regulating the extent to which males and females diverge in disease susceptibility. By quantifying melanin-based traits underlying strategies for both reproduction and survival in insects, this study sheds light onto the selective forces shaping sex differences in immunity and insect life-history in general.

T1  - Analysis of Cisco (<i>Coregonus artedi</i>) Populations in Eastern Lake Ontario
AN  - 1985952197
AB  - The Cisco (Coregonus artedi) is a cold-water planktivorous fish species that has undergone significant declines within Lake Ontario as a result of over-exploitation and other anthropogenic impacts. The goal of this project was to expand upon the current scientific knowledge base for Cisco within Eastern Lake Ontario [ELO] by providing an up-to-date assessment of the current status of this population. This thesis focusses on two distinct topics, each related to a distinct natural history characteristic of the ELO Cisco population that could represent a factor limiting population recovery in this region: fisheries-induced alterations to life-history traits, and fluctuations in year-class strength. In order to identify whether fisheries-induced change has occurred in this population, I compared the size-at-age and maturation of the ELO population both before [1926-1928] and after [1992-2016] the collapse of the fishery. The modern population had larger body sizes at a given age compared to the historical group, as well as a lower age-at-maturity [size-at-maturity remained similar]. It appears as though Cisco within the historical population may have been experiencing fisheries-induced selection in size-at-age, with potential recovery of this trait occurring in the modern population after a reduction in fishing pressure. This suggests that Cisco have a high capacity for adaptation through either phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary change. To assess patterns in year-class strength [YCS] within the ELO population, I used a residual catch-curve method to first calculate relative YCS, and then used linear models to correlate any fluctuations in YCS with environmental variables [temperature, ice cover, wind velocity]. The ELO population of Cisco demonstrated high variability in YCS, and only the timing of first consistent ice cover appeared to be correlated with these fluctuations. The environmental conditions influencing YCS in Lake Ontario may be different from those acting in other Great Lakes, highlighting the importance of local assessment. Advancing our knowledge of Cisco life-history within Lake Ontario provides important insights into the current condition of this population, which could have potential implications for future rehabilitation in this region.

T1  - The Potential of Green Roofs to Provide Habitat for Native Plant Conservation
AN  - 1984493727
AB  - Many species have lost their natural habitat due to anthropogenic land use change. Ecologists are increasingly looking at habitat in cities to bolster efforts to conserve biodiversity. Green roofs are examples of urban habitats that are becoming more common globally. Green roofs can provide resources to support life in an otherwise inhospitable space. However, the harsh abiotic conditions found on green roofs preclude many species from establishing and persisting. Typically, non-native succulent species are planted on green roofs because of their ability to survive and provide beneficial ecosystem services to humans. However, greater support for biodiversity could be achieved with an increased diversity of plants. To support the fullest range of biodiversity possible, green roofs would support species diversity, community diversity, and genetic diversity. In my dissertation, I aim to determine if green roofs can contribute to all three aspects of biodiversity and thereby aid in the conservation of native plant species in cities.    The first two chapters of my dissertation examine how species diversity on green roofs changes over time and which traits plant species possess to help them to survive for many generations. I hypothesized that the diversity of unmanaged plants and arthropods on green roofs would change in a deterministic pattern and be affected by abiotic factors. I also hypothesized that persistent plant populations would possess similar traits that contributed to stress tolerance. I used long-term vegetation surveys and collected plant and arthropod data from a 1–93 year chronosequence of green roofs in northeast Germany to addresses these hypotheses. I found that the plant and animal diversities did not change on green roofs in predictable ways but that site conditions such as substrate depth and water infiltration may affect how many species are present. Functional diversity explained more of the patterns in the vegetation than species diversity alone, as over time green roofs became dominated with plants that shared similar traits. Persistent species tended to have traits to tolerate stress and repeated disturbance. Together, these results highlight the need to carefully consider the characteristics of species that are originally planted, and continue to manage green roofs to support a rich diversity of both plants and arthropods.    The third and fourth chapters of my dissertation address the potential for green roofs to support greater community diversity by experimentally testing a proposed habitat analog approach. This approach looks to mimic natural plant communities with abiotic properties similar to those of green roofs. I surveyed dry prairies in northeast Illinois and attempted to mimic the cover of the most common species on green roofs with both continuous substrate and modular trays. The plant communities from the most analogous habitat were the most successful at establishing in the continuous substrate, supporting my hypothesis that a habitat analog approach can promote community diversity. However, green roofs are typically built to provide ecosystem services to humans and do not typically consider biodiversity support the main priority. Therefore, I also evaluated the ability of the native plant communities to provide the ecosystem services of stormwater retention and thermal insulation and compared their performance to commonly planted non-native succulent Sedum species. I found that the industry standard Sedum communities provided more thermal insulation but that native prairie communities absorbed more stormwater and could release it quickly to be ready for more rain. I, therefore, suggest that a combination of native plants and non-native succulents might be best to maximize green roof function that includes both ecosystem services and biodiversity support.    The fifth chapter of my dissertation uses a two-part study to address how genetic diversity can be supported on green roofs. I used neutral alleles at ten microsatellite loci to compare the genetic diversity of a self-compatible forb, Penstemon hirsutus, between natural prairie populations and established green roof populations. I hypothesized that the green roof populations started from nursery stock would fail to capture the full amount of genetic diversity that was found in natural populations because commercially produced plants tend to underrepresent the genetic diversity found in the wild. My hypothesis was supported, although the sampled natural populations had higher inbreeding than the populations on the green roofs. In the case of self-compatible species like P. hirsutus, pollinators are necessary to maximize gene flow by carrying pollen between populations. But previous work has found that some pollinators are lacking on green roofs, especially the small bees that pollinate P. hirsutus . Therefore, for the second part of this study, I measured the degree of inbreeding between ten parental green roof populations and their offspring and conducted a paternity analysis to measure the frequency with which bees move pollen between populations.

T1  - Temperature Effects on the Routine Metabolic Rates of Brook Trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) Eggs, Alevin and Fry: Implications for Climate Change
AN  - 1983962883
AB  - Early developmental stages of cold-adapted ectotherms such as brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are at risk of mortality with increasing water temperatures because of their sensitivity to changes in their environment. I studied the mass and routine metabolic rate (RMR) of wild-origin brook trout eggs, alevin and young fry reared at normal (5°C) and elevated (9°C) temperatures for the duration of the study or at mismatched temperatures. This setup determined if preconditioning acclimation for one temperature benefits or hinders the organism later in life. Three levels of biological organization (ancestry, population, family) were studied using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to identify models that best accounted for variation in the data. Family, mass and temperature were most important in predicting body mass and mass-adjusted RMR, although population and ancestral-level differences were also detected at some life stages. Strong variation in body mass and mass-adjusted RMR among families may  indicate adaptive potential within brook trout populations to respond to increases in water temperature with climate change.

T1  - Demographic Processes in Forest Trees in the Rocky Mountains
AN  - 1977996414
AB  - Forests provide numerous ecological and economic services including regulation of biogeochemical cycles, fiber production, watershed protection, as well as less tangible aesthetic and recreational benefits. Forests are being substantially altered by a range of consumptive uses related to expanding human population and economies. Superimposed on other anthropogenic impacts is global climate change. Global circulation models unambiguously reveal the role of greenhouse gas forcings associated with industrial processes in driving global temperature trends (Hanson et al. 2005). Meteorological observations indicate that global mean temperature has increased by approximately 0.6 °C over the past century relative to a base 1951 to 1980 period, with record high temperatures occurring in 2010. Paleoclimatic reconstructions based on proxy data indicate that modern rates of warming may be unprecedented in the context of the past 1000 years. Rates of warming are geographically heterogeneous. Temperature anomalies in the Rocky Mountain ecoregion, for example, are 2?3 times higher than the global mean temperature increase. Some models and observational data suggest that temperature trends are elevation dependent with greater warming at high altitudes and with greater increases in daily minimum temperatures than maximum temperatures. Documented increases in minimum temperature is associated with earlier spring thaw events, driven by minimum temperatures that exceed 0 °C and a lengthening of the growing and fire seasons.   In the Rocky Mountains, an altered climate system is projected to result in a higher frequency and intensity of drought events. Precipitation over the previous 100 years lacks clear trends across the region as a whole, but models of snow water equivalent (SWE) indicate declining moisture availability since the mid-20th century. Early spring snowmelt and warming driven increases in rates of evapotranspiration may correlate with reduced stream flow and declines in effective soil moisture late in the growing season. Warming temperatures and reductions in moisture availability have been associated with significant increases in area burned by wildfire in some forest systems, particularly at high elevations where climate variability rather than fuel conditions is the primary driver of fire activity. Changing climate may also be expanding the ranges and altering the dynamics of forest insects, such as the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), resulting in extensive tree mortality.   The recent widespread acceptance of climate change has highlighted the need for regional and species specific adaptation strategies. However, a lack of reliable projections describing the responses of organisms and communities to climate change has been identified as a major impediment to the development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies within federal agencies. Potential vegetation responses include migration to track preferred habitats or adaptation through phenotypic or genetic plasticity. Heat stress and prolonged drought have been associated with rapid shifts in the range limits of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and in significantly elevated rates of background tree mortality for tree species and forest environments worldwide. Mortality events associated with physiological stress or environmental disturbances may accelerate changes in the distributions of long-lived tree species that might otherwise persist in sub-optimal environments.   The distribution and abundance of plants are largely determined by physiological, life history, and ecosystem processes, and how these processes interact or respond to climate. A mechanistic understanding of these processes and their physiological thresholds is required to accurately predict forest response to climate change. The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group has argued that current predictive vegetation models are limited by a failure to adequately quantify relationships between climate, critical life history processes, and disturbance regimes.    The main objective of this research is to quantify life history processes for select tree species in the Rocky Mountain ecoregion. Specifically, non-linear regression models will be developed to quantify variation in both tree fecundity and growth as a function of climate variables, edaphic gradients, and competition. Comprehensive field data will be used to train flexible functions in a maximum likelihood framework. Competing models representing alternative hypotheses will be evaluated using information theory. The overarching objective of this project is to provide detailed quantitative life history information that may subsequently be used to parameterize dynamic simulation models for the prediction of forest response to alternative future climate scenarios. An additional component of this research involves the reconstruction of historical temperatures in the southern portion of the Rocky Mountain ecoregion using chronologies of radial growth from several high elevation tree species occurring in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming. Historical temperatures have been reconstructed for northern portions of the Rocky Mountain ecoregion. A comparable reconstruction for the southern portion of the region has not been developed. Global climate models predict that parts of the Rockies may experience future climates with no previous analogs. Historical temperature reconstructions based on proxy indicators will provide historical context for both modern climate variation and simulations of future conditions.

T1  - Resilient Cities of the Future Utilizing Natural Intelligence to Retrofit the Urban Systems
AN  - 1968663456
AB  - Accentuated by the industrial revolution, the climate change is aging our cities, which are now facing an ecological, economical, and political imbalance resulting into the degraded quality of urban living. Not only has global warming altered the earth’s natural patterns, but it also altered the economic and socio-cultural urban patterns. With the growing needs of rapidly expanding urban population due to the industrial revolution, the cities underwent unplanned sprawling of urban agglomerations. However, our globalized economic system has evolved the way we live,  work, and play, transforming the modern infrastructure growth models significantly. Our architects, urban planners, and policy makers are powered by the environmental scientist’s years of research and analysis, yet are struggling to replenish the post-industrial age rust belt mayhem with sustainable solutions. As the transition from industrial to ecological age become eminent, by investigating into the natural intelligence’s survival techniques, we could extract practical solutions to using clean and renewable energy systems to support life.    This thesis aims at analyzing the current trends in redesigning and retrofitting the urban-systems with the eco-systems at the micro- and macro-scales, thus providing with sustainable solutions to the new city center of the sixth largest town in Canada, Mississauga. Caused by rapid urbanization, population growth & migration, increased emission of green house gases, and overuse & pollution, our deteriorating infrastructure is grappling for mitigation against climate change, and global warming. Using natural intelligence to shift from linear to a closed loop system, the solutions provided herein aims at increasing the infrastructure’s resource efficiency and changing from fossil fuel to solar economy. Catalyzed by the proposed Midwestern high-speed rail line, the project in Mississauga (Ontario, Canada) seeks to introduce the hybrid, mixed-use, transit oriented development to instigate the shift towards eco-cities. These intermodal transit infrastructure aims to bring a strategically sustainable change at a neighborhood scale, thus eventually refurbishing the entire city, one territory at a time. The idea of these utopian cities may seem unachievable at a larger scale, but the cities like Hammarby Sjöstad, Tianjin, and Dongtan seem to lead, inspire, and equip the ignorant with their sustainable approach to growth. By transitioning towards an ecological age, there seems a way to negating the effects of human induced climate change, and make our planet sustainable for the future generations to survive.

T1  - <i>Salmonella</i>'s Desiccation Survival and Thermal Tolerance: Genetic, Physiological, and Metabolic Factors
AN  - 1964263212
AB  - Salmonella can survive for long periods under extreme desiccation and low water activity conditions (aw < 0.6) while becoming tolerant to heat. This stress tolerance poses a risk for food safety, but relatively little is known about the molecular and cellular processes involved in this adaptation mechanism and its potential for cross-protection.    This dissertation consists of three distinct studies focused on elucidating this mechanism. The objective of the first study was to identify the genes involved in Salmonella’s resistance to desiccation. A global transcriptomic analysis comparing S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells equilibrated to low aw (aw 0.11) and cells equilibrated to high aw (aw 1.0) determined that 719 genes (16% of the total number of genes in the genome) were differentially expressed between the two conditions. The genes that were up-regulated at aw 0.11 (290) were mostly involved in metabolic pathways, DNA replication/repair, regulation of transcription and translation, and virulence. Based on the transcriptomic analysis, we created deletion mutants for two virulence genes, sseD  and sopD, and tested their ability to survive desiccation and low aw on glass beads. The two mutants exhibited significant cell viability reductions after desiccation compared to the wild-type and additional decrease after exposure to aw 0.11 for 7 days. Under scanning electron microscopy, the mutants displayed a different cell morphology and extracellular matrix production when compared to the wild-type under the same conditions. The findings of this study suggested that sopD and sseD are required for Salmonella’s survival during desiccation.    The objective of the second study was to determine the effect of food and inert matrices, nutrient availability, and growth conditions on desiccation survival and thermal tolerance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium.  Salmonella was grown in LBglc and M9 media, in the presence or absence of EDTA and dipyridyl. Cultures were inoculated on toasted oat cereal (TOC) or glass beads, dried, and equilibrated for a week at aw 0.11 and 1.0, before being thermally treated at 75, 85, 90, and 95°C. For all growth conditions and temperatures tested, cells exposed to aw 0.11 had inactivation rates (δ-values) at least 10-fold longer than cells equilibrated at aw 1.0. Our results showed that growth in the presence of EDTA or Dipyridyl did not have any effect on Salmonella ’s thermal tolerance at either aw on TOC. In control conditions, recovery after drying and thermal tolerance was higher on TOC than on glass beads, suggesting that the food matrix was protective for desiccation and thermal treatment. Growth in M9 resulted in lower survival to drying and exposure to low aw on glass beads, compared to LBglc. On the contrary, thermal tolerance increased in cells grown in M9 compared to LBglc at both aw. Cells grown in LBglc and M9 displayed differences in the production of extracellular matrix, in particular during equilibration to aw 0.11 and after thermal treatment at both aw. Additionally, when Salmonella  was grown on glass beads in LBglc as biofilm, the thermal tolerance was greater than free cells dried on beads. Our observations suggest that the presence of nutrients during growth and before exposure to desiccation and thermal treatment influenced Salmonella’s ability to survive desiccation and develop thermal tolerance.    The objective of the third study was to identify proteins involved in  Salmonella’s resistance to desiccation and thermal treatment using iTRAQ. Proteins were extracted from S. enterica servorar Typhimurium cells dried, equilibrated at high aw (1.0) and low aw (0.11), and thermally treated at 75°C. Our analysis determined that 734 proteins were differentially expressed among samples, and of these 175 proteins were the most significant in determining differences in the proteomic profiles among treatments. Based on their proteomic expression profiles, the samples were clustered in two main groups by PCA analysis, “dry” samples and “wet” samples, while we did not observe significant differences between the thermally treated samples and the non-heated samples, at both aw. Protein profiles indicated shifts in cell metabolism in both samples, as well as a strict regulation of DNA repair, replication, transcription, and translation. “Dry” samples had higher levels of 50S and 30S ribosomal proteins, indicating that ribosomal proteins might be important for extra-ribosomal regulation of cellular response even when the synthesis of proteins is slowed down. Stress response proteins were more frequently present in “wet” samples compared to “dry” samples, including SspA, GorA, and Dps, suggesting that “wet” cells were activating stress systems in response to rehydration. In conclusion, our study indicated that pre-adaptation to dry conditions was linked to increased thermal tolerance, while reversion from a dry state into a wet state implied a significant change in protein expression that is linked with reduced thermal tolerance.

T1  - The Role of Seasonal and Geographic Temperature Variation in the Life Cycle of the Clonal Sea Anemone <i>Diadumene Lineata</i> (Verrill)
AN  - 1961606325
AB  - Clonality is the general term that encompasses all manner of pinching, splitting, budding, and fragmenting behaviors by which organisms divide their somatic body tissues into more or less independent units. It can be as straight forward as fragments of a sponge surviving after being rent apart by a hurricane or as convoluted as the telescoping generations of parthenogenic aphids. Clonality is a widespread feature of animal life cycles and the degree of clonal investment is expected to affect everything from spatial genotypic and genetic structure to evolutionary dynamics and ecology interactions. Yet, the shear diversity and complexity of clonal behavior has hampered efforts to develop a general understanding of how and why clonality evolves as the adaptive benefits of these behaviors may be as idiosyncratic as the mechanisms by which cloning occurs.    Contrary to some past formulations of the problem, the production of clonal progeny is not typically an alternative to sexual reproduction, as most clonal organisms also reproduce sexually. While there is often an immediate tradeoff where a unit of energy can either be invested in gametes or clonal progeny at any given time, there is not inherently a tradeoff between asexual and sexual reproduction over the span of a lifetime. Dividing somatic tissue in to separate units can be a way of increasing total lifetime fecundity by increasing total biomass, more efficiently colonizing open space or promoting longevity by spreading the risk of mortality over spatially-separated somatic units. With this perspective, understanding the adaptive value of clonality becomes a matter of analyzing the holistic suite of fitness effects that arise from variation in allocating energy among unitary growth, clonal propagation and gametogenesis.    The amount of energy available and the fitness value of a particular investment strategy are governed in large part by the environment and so understanding the environmental context is key to understanding the forces shaping life cycle evolution. Temperature, in particular, affects the metabolic cost of maintaining body tissues and is key in determining the energetically optimal body size for a unitary animal. Where temperatures fluctuate seasonally or where clonal replicates may spread across a heterogeneous landscape, the reaction norm of fission rate, body size or traits associated with gamete production may be an important target of selection, influencing which life cycle patterns can evolve.    In this dissertation I examine the influence of seasonal and geographic temperature variation on fission rate, body size and gamete production of the clonal sea anemone, Diadumene lineata (Verrill 1869), to better understand the constraints and tradeoffs that govern the evolution of resource allocation strategy; and ultimately, the factors that drive the evolution of clonality in this species. Through a combination of laboratory experiments, field observations, optimality modeling and genetic tools I demonstrate that (1) fission rates are strongly temperature dependent, resulting in seasonal and geographic variation in clonal behavior, (2) the production of gametes is closely tied to body size and shows an inverse latitudinal pattern with fission rate, (3) the observed reaction norm of fission rate with temperature is consistent with selection to maximize gamete production across the locally experienced range of temperatures, as opposed to selection for maximum clonal proliferation, per se, and (4) there is a latitudinal decrease in genotypic richness and diversity that corresponds with changes in fission rate, suggesting that variation in fission rate leads to changes in the spatial structure of genetic variation among sites.    Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that clonality is adaptive under conditions where individual body size is constrained by the environment. Under these conditions more gametes may be produced over a lifetime by genets dividing somatic tissue into multiple small units rather than remaining a single large unit. In this species, there is an immediate cost to dividing a large body into two pieces as the number of gametes produced by two small individuals sums to less than those produced by a large individual, yet, the lost reproductive potential may be able to be compensated for over time by an increased growth rate at a smaller body size. Additional costs and benefits imposed by changes in mortality rate, competitive ability or mate choice as fission rate changes remain to be investigated and may be equally important in understanding and predicting the evolution of clonal behavior in this and other species.

T1  - Geographic and Seasonal Effects on Community Compositions and Functional Traits of Frugivorous <i>Drosophila</i> and <i> Leptopilina</i> Parasitoids
AN  - 1957430676
AB  - One of the most important processes driving adaptive evolution and diversification of organisms is ecological interactions among species. Geographic and temporal variation in intra- and interspecific interactions among species then can result in diverse geographic patterns of coevolution. In my dissertation, I explored how species interaction may play the role driving future coevolution is host-parasitoid system. Frugivorous Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and its Leptopilina parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) were used as a study system. I carried out a large field study to characterize the Drosophila host - Leptopilina parasitoid community composition in the Eastern North America. As part of characterization of the community compositions, I first reviewed and described three previously undescribed species in eastern North American Leptopilina species. In total, 32 Drosophila species and six Leptopilina species were documented. Second, I characterized the Drosophila host - Leptopilina parasitoid community composition across geographic locations and between the breeding seasons. The result showed species diversity of both host and parasitoids were higher in the northern sites compared to the southern sites, and latitude was the main factor structuring the community composition of both hosts and parasitoids. Moreover, species co-occur in my community data indicated potential species interaction. Third, I investigated if geographic/seasonal variation in functional traits were correlated with local host-parasitoid community diversity or environmental factors. I used body size and ovipositor related traits of L. boulardi as example. Mean body size displayed larger in the North than in the South sites, and also larger in the late breeding season than in the early season. Because larger parasitoids typically have greater fat storage, this pattern may be adaptive in northern sites to enhance overwinter survival. The result also showed body size of L. boulardi was not correlated with host-parasitoid species diversity, but negatively correlated with thermal environments. Moreover, the width of the ovipositor but not ovipositor length varied geographically and was positively correlated with host adult size. The functional significance of this trait is not known, however it may allow the wasp to attack larger, more active larvae, or the host larvae with thicker cuticles. My data lay the groundwork for future studies to test the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.

T1  - Essays in Economic Development
AN  - 1952261906
AB  - The dissertation consists of three essays: “Benefits of diversification in agriculture: Evidence from Malawi”, “Corruption and economic growth revisited” and “How close is your government to its people? Worldwide indicators on localization and decentralization”. All three essays focus on issues, which are particularly important for developing countries: food security, corruption, decentralization.   In the first essay I use data from a farmers’ survey in Malawi to compare two agricultural technologies: monoculture maize and crop diversification (maize-legume intercrop). I match farmers locations with data on rainfall and air temperature to test whether more biodiverse agriculture is better at absorbing weather shocks. The data make it possible to compare variation not only over time, but also over different plots within the same time period, which helps reduce omitted variable bias. The instrumental variable method is used to eliminate rainfall measurement error. For a number of specifications, and controlling for fertilizer use, crop diversification is both more productive than monoculture maize and more resistant to weather shocks. Although I am not able to identify the average population effect, I show that the effect I identify is likely to prevail if the Malawian government decides to shift the focus of its agricultural subsidy at the margin from fertilizer to legume seeds and education.   The focus of the second essay is on corruption. While literature finds many channels through which corruption can hurt economic growth, the link proved hard to establish in empirical cross-country studies. In this paper I show that part of the explanation of this puzzle is that there is a reverse causality: everything else equal, exogenously-driven economic growth can increase corruption. The reason is that the boost to output increases tax revenue, and hence pool of resources that corrupt public officials can embezzle. I show the workings of this channel in a simple stylized model, which is then accompanied by numerical simulations in a dynamic general equilibium overlapping-generations model, which allows for corruption and tax evasion. I also present empirical evidence, which supports my findings.   The third chapter assembles and analyzes a unique data base on local governance that provides a first approximation of the institutional architecture of local governance that has emerged as a result of the silent revolution (decentralization reforms) of the last three decades on moving governments closer to people. An important feature of this data set is that, for comparative purposes, it measures government decision making at the local level i.e. the order of government that is closest to the people and hence providing a better indicator of decentralized decision making as compared to the "sub-national governments" that also include intermediate tiers of provinces and states, used by the existing literature. This unique data set for 182 countries attempts to capture institutional dimensions of political, fiscal and administrative autonomy enjoyed by local governments under diverse multi-order governance regimes using a common framework. These dimensions are aggregated to develop a "decentralization index" and then adjusted for heterogeneity to develop a "government closeness index" that provides an overall ranking of countries on the closeness of their government to the people.

T1  - The Genetic Architecture Underlying Rapid Seasonal Evolution in Natural Populations of Drosophila Melanogaster
AN  - 1951752739
AB  - The rate and tempo at which populations respond to environmental change is fundamental in understanding the adaptive process. Evolution is generally considered to be a gradual process and it is unclear if populations can adapt rapidly to environmental selection pressures. Annual seasonal rhythms produce rapid, predictable environmental changes that may result in rapid adaptation in multivoltine species that reproduce multiple times each year. This work demonstrates that Drosophila melanogaster adapts rapidly and predictably to seasonal environmental changes across five years and multiple locations. Suites of complex fitness traits change in a predictable way over the 10–15 generations from spring to fall. After surviving the harsh environmental selection of the winter, the spring flies are characterized by a increased investment in somatic maintainance: higher resistance to thermal stress, higher tolerance to pathogenic infection, faster development time and better learning. These traits decline throughout the summer when ripening fruit is abundant due to correlated trade-offs with reproduction. Parallel changes in G-matrixes over this seasonal timescale counters the basic assumption of stable covariance over time and indicates that selection acts rapidly to alter the genetic architecture of a population. We show that there are alleles that have functional effects on these important life history traits that oscillate in frequency as a function of seasonal time, but that non-additive epistatic interactions are prevalent and shape the genetic architecture of change across seasonal time. Functional analysis of candidate genes shows that epistatic interactions among seasonally oscillating alleles facilitate rapid adaptation by producing emergent fitness phenotypes. Together, these findings demonstrate rapid, repeatable adaptation to abiotic and biotic environmental parameters that cycle as a function of seasonal time. Epistatic interactions within and among genes facilitate the rapid evolutionary change that is occurring over timescales previously considered static.

T1  - The Evolutionary Consequences of the Transition to Non-bloodfeeding in the Pitcher Plant Mosquito <i>Wyeomyia smithii</i>
AN  - 1949404790
AB  - The pitcher plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii maintains a broad geographic range from the Gulf of Mexico to central Canada, and throughout its range is genetically and phenotypically variable, though fully interfertile. Many of the traits that vary across the broad range of this mosquito owe their diversity to selection on populations, which maximize fitness in the unique environment in which each populations finds itself. While a diversity of traits vary by latitude and merit the interest of evolutionary biologists, including critical photoperiod, voltinism, and thermal tolerance, of interest in the following thesis is the variation in blood-feeding propensity within this single species of mosquito. In no other mosquito species are some populations obligate non-biters while in other populations willingly hematophagous. This thesis explores the evolutionary transition from biting to non-biting in the pitcher plant mosquito at multiple levels of biological integration, starting first by establishing a heritable basis for the transition, then moving to the fitness and life historical consequences of both the natural system and of a line artificially selected in the lab. The latter half of this thesis moves on to probe the genetic architecture underlying the shift in phenotype and ends after examining the transition to non-biting at the level of the gene using an RNA-sequencing experiment. The results stemming from this thesis are thoroughly discussed: in short, we find that fitness differs between biting and non-biting populations, that complex genetic architectures underlie the transition to non-biting in nature, but not under artificial selection, and finally, that many candidate loci are differentially regulated in biting populations relative to non-biting populations and that these loci most often cluster with metabolic biological pathways.

T1  - The Ecology and Evolution of Top-down and Bottom-up Control in Mountain Lakes
AN  - 1928596378
AB  - Determining factors that control how biomass is distributed among plants, animals, microbes and non-living components of ecosystems is a major goal of ecology. Theoretical and empirical work have demonstrated that ecosystem structure and function may vary with the environment, but studies often overlook the role of adaptation and shifts in species composition that will occur over longer timescales relevant to climate change. For my doctoral research I used a ‘natural experiment’ in Sierra Nevada mountain lakes to ask questions about the strength of top-down and bottom-up forcing in a natural system where communities have assembled and adapted to differences in the environment over periods from years to millennia.     In Chapter 1 I compare fish and fishless lakes along an elevational gradient, and show that an interaction between fish presence and temperature alters food web structure, ecosystem function, species and trait composition. Top-down forcing from fish on plankton biomass was stronger in warm lakes, suggesting that a warmer climate will magnify the effect of introduced predators on biomass distribution. Fish and warmer temperatures select for the same species and traits of zooplankton in lakes, suggesting that lakes containing invasive predators may be less sensitive to warming. In Chapter 2 I test this hypothesis using a large-scale community transplant experiment, where I transplanted plankton communities that assembled and evolved at different elevations and predator regimes to new elevations and the addition or removal of fish. I found that past exposure to fish caused an evolutionary response in keystone members of the zooplankton community that increased their fitness in environments without fish. This suggests that past selection can change how communities will respond to further environmental change. In Chapter 3, I show that bottom-up processes influence fish growth, with higher growth rates occurring in warmer, clearer lakes. My thesis helps to elucidate the effects of temperature and predators on physiology, evolution, species ranges and community interactions, which is necessary to forecast the response of ecosystems to climate change. My thesis integrates across these levels of organization to understand the origin of ecosystem resilience in a changing climate.

T1  - The Evolution and Genetic Control of Stress Tolerance in a Complex World
AN  - 1925545522
AB  - Natural populations are highly complex and consist of genetically variable individuals that belong to continuously varying age classes. Genotype and age interact to determine how individuals respond to environmental stress, which ultimately determines the evolutionary trajectories and persistence of populations in variable environments. For small ectothermic species, seasonal and diurnal variation in temperature is an important source of environmental stress that impacts activity patterns and suites of phenotypes directly related to whole organism fitness. I used the genetic and ecological model  Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the influence of seasonal and diurnal thermal variability on survival and reproduction in genetically diverse populations. First, I characterized changes in cold tolerance and phenotypic plasticity within a natural population as it responded to seasonal shifts in developmental and short-term acclimation and thermal selection. I found that seasonal variation in cold tolerance was significantly influenced by developmental acclimation that occurred in the field as well as in the lab, where flies that developed under warmer conditions had reduced cold tolerance relative to flies that developed under cooler conditions. Second, I characterized the effect of variation in age on stress response phenotypes in a genetically variable population. I measured genotype- and age-specific responses to multiple environmental stressors, and identified regions of the genome that were associated with age-specific stress tolerance. Genome-wide association mapping revealed that age-specific phenotypes were influenced by distinct sets of polymorphisms and genes, suggesting that the evolution of age-related decline in phenotypes is driven by mutation accumulation within phenotypes, but both mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy between phenotypes. Next, I characterized the costs and benefits of acclimation for survival and reproduction to understand how physiological and behavioral plasticity interact to determine fitness. I found that phenotypic plasticity and the capacity for acclimation significantly influenced behavioral reproductive success, but the thermal cues that led to adaptive acclimation response in survival also led to decreased reproductive success. However, genotypes with the capacity to acclimate were more likely to survive thermal variation and more likely to reproduce, suggesting that genetic capacity for phenotypic plasticity has important implications for whole organism fitness. Finally, I measured the effect of acclimation on the induction of diapause and ability to survive cold stress in the recently introduced invasive species Drosophila suzukii. D. suzukii  is endemic to Asia and was first detected in California in 2008 and in Topeka, KS in 2013. Its recent invasion history thus provides an interesting model to understand the role of plasiticy in the response to a novel and variable environment. I found that diapause was induced through a plastic response to acclimation and short photoperiod, though diapause was more drastically induced by acclimation. Overall, my research provides critical insights into how organisms respond to thermal variation by intergrating quantitative genetics, ecology, evolution, and life history tradeoffs. Collectively, my research demonstrates that the ability of organisms to survive thermal stress is a function of genetic capacity to tolerate stress, genetic capacity for phenotypic plasticity, prior exposure to thermal variation, and the age of the individual.

AB  - The process of adaptive evolution is complex, determined in part by the set of beneficial muta- tions available to adapting populations, the distribution of their effects, and the extents to which pleiotropy and epistasis impact the relationships between genotype, phenotype, and fitness. As- sumptions about epistasis, pleiotropy, and the availability of beneficial mutations are made by theories and models of adaptation and determine their predictions. Through the experimental evolution of bacteriophages, we tested model assumptions and predictions about epistasis, hybrid viability, the causes of parallel evolution, the distribution of beneficial fitness effects, the genotype-fitness landscape, antagonistic pleiotropy, and the cost of complexity. We did this in an effort to answer standing questions in the study of evolution regarding the process of adaptation and the forces that govern it.    To characterize the effects of epistasis on determining the viability and persistence of novel hybrids, we generated experimental hybrids of highly divergent and highly related pairs of phage strains. We found that incompatibilities resulting from disruption of favorable epistatic interactions within the genome manifested as fitness costs, even in very closely related genotypes, but that ancestral fitness levels could be recovered through only a handful of compensatory mutations. Remarkably, we found that by permitting movement over wide expanses of sequence space in a single step—coupled with subsequent adaptation—hybridization allowed one phage genotype to explore a substantially higher and previously inaccessible peak in its fitness landscape. Thus, if conditions permitted hybrid genotypes to persist long enough to allow for compensatory evolution, even very low fitness hybrids could be viable in populations with their ancestral genotypes, potentially facilitating the establishment of stable hybrid zones and the creation of new species.    Competing selectionist and mutationist viewpoints argue that parallel evolution is the result of either selection repeatedly fixing the same, optimal adaptive solution to a recurring evolutionary problem or a product of mutational constraint presenting selection with a biased subset of potentially suboptimal adaptive strategies. To characterize the rate of parallel evolution and the underlying forces driving parallelism, we performed 20 replicate first steps of adaptation for four phage genotypes. We found parallel and convergent adaptation to be common at every level of biological organization both within and among genotypes, from the level of mutational effects to the levels of protein, gene, amino acid, and nucleotide substitution. We also found that contrary to expectations, the mutation of greatest benefit in each genotype was never the most frequently fixed, and only fixed once in each of two genotypes. Patterns of parallel evolution are often offered as strong evidence of adaptation. However, we found that parallelism was driven at least as much by mutational biases and constraints as by selection, indicating that frequent observations of parallel adaptive evolution in natural and experimental populations may not be driven primarily by selection, but rather by selection acting on a biased subset of all available mutations, possibly, as in the case with our results, yielding suboptimal adaptive outcomes. We also fit a distribution to the set of fitness effects for each set of 20 replicates. The form of the distribution of beneficial fitness effects shapes the predictions of models of adaptation and affects the properties of adaptive walks, particularly the average size of mutational steps and the likelihood of parallel evolution. We found that all four genotypes were best described by a distribution of beneficial fitness effects with a finite upper bound, conflicting with the assumption of some models that this distribution is exponential.    In another experiment, we constructed double-mutant genotypes containing all possible pairings of three sets of five beneficial mutations generated under three different selective regimes: selection on growth rate only, selection on growth rate and thermal stability, and selection on growth rate and pH stability. The purpose of this experiment was to characterize patterns of pairwise epistasis for beneficial mutations, and in particular to measure interactions for each of the phenotypes underlying fitness. We found that mutations interacted antagonistically with regard to growth rate and fitness, in line with other recent work which has generally found a trend of antagonistic interactions between beneficial mutations. However, we found that mutations behaved on average more additively with regard to capsid stability. We concluded that mutations interact additively with regard to phenotype when considered at a basic, biophysical level, and that epistasis for fitness emerges from an intermediate phenotypic optimum and pleiotropy between its underlying phenotypes, manifested in adapting populations as a pattern of diminishing returns and antagonism between beneficial mutations.    Finally, we performed adaptive walks for two pairs of wild-type and growth-optimized phage genotypes under selection on growth rate and capsid stability to test the hypotheses that adaptation of these two traits is constrained by antagonistic pleiotropy and that organisms evolving under complex environmental or selective pressures incur a cost of complexity manifested as a lower rate of adaptation. Despite expectations that antagonism would prevent optimization of growth rate and stability, both traits were significantly improved over the course of replicate adaptive walks. Additionally, we found no evidence for a cost of complexity, as the rate of adaptation under complex selection was actually higher than under simple selective conditions and did not require any additional mutational steps relative to one-trait selection. Our results indicated that increased organismal complexity, or an increase in the number of traits under selection, may not decrease an organism’s rate of adaptation, even when mutations affect all of the traits under selection simultaneously, contrary to model predictions.

T1  - Population and Family Effects on Gene Transcriptional Profiles of Eight Hybrid Chinook Salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) Populations: Implications for Conservation and Aquaculture
AN  - 1914904515
AB  - Aquaculture has been the fastest growing food industry worldwide since 1985 and has contributed significantly to the Canadian economy. Thus, methods for increasing aquaculture production are currently being investigated, such as selective breeding programs. Here I developed transcriptional profiles of eight hybrid half-sibling populations of Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and examined them for evidence of local adaptation and as a potential marker for marker-assisted selection method. I found evidence of local adaptation among the populations, further supporting this as a driving force behind the large variation witnessed in Chinook salmon life history variation. I used the transcriptional profiles developed for each population in the freshwater (juvenile) stage and tested for correlations with saltwater performance (growth rate and survival). I found significant correlations between saltwater performance factors and juvenile transcription, suggesting that saltwater performance in Chinook salmon can be predicted using freshwater transcription patterns. There were also significant correlations between freshwater and saltwater transcription, indicating possible mechanisms behind the correlation between freshwater and saltwater traits. Freshwater Chinook salmon transcriptional profiles are a promising novel marker for application in marker-assisted selection breeding programs in aquaculture. Overall, transcriptional profiling using selected known-function genes provide the ability to study both local adaptation and performance in Chinook salmon populations.

T1  - The Combined Effects of Increased Temperature and Ocean Acidification on the Early Life History Stages of Caribbean Coral and Its Implications for the Recovery Potential of Florida Reefs
AN  - 1908617403
AB  - The early life history stages of coral are an essential component determining the recovery potential of coral reefs through sexual reproduction and recruitment. The pelagic larval phase is inherent in all coral species regardless of differing reproductive strategies and is the only time in coral life history where large scale movement is possible allowing for the repopulation of reef areas both within and outside the natal reef habitat. In the face of climate change, the larval dispersal and recruitment phase will take place in a warmer more acidic ocean if we continue on the path of unabated fossil fuel emissions. While much research has focused on how increased temperature or ocean acidification affect coral larvae independently, our understanding of how these factors interact to shape larval response is limited, especially in regards to Caribbean coral species. To gain a better understanding of how the early life history stages of Caribbean coral may be affected by climate change, this dissertation investigates the effects of increased temperature (2.5 °C above historical averages in the Florida Keys) and carbon dioxide levels (900–1000 parts per million CO2) on corals from the Florida Reef tract by investigating the effects on larval metabolism, survivorship, settlement, and post-settlement growth and survival. Additionally, a coupled biophysical model was developed to determine the potential changes in connectivity that may result from the biological effects of increased temperature and ocean acidification on the larval phase. The larval respiratory response of three Caribbean coral species revealed Orbicella faveolata as the most environmentally responsive with significant increases in respiration after 1 day exposure to increased temperature (68% greater than control conditions) with a counteracting effect of ocean acidification significantly decreasing respiration. The changes in metabolism over time correlated with decreased time to competency under elevated temperature in O. faveolata larvae, resulting in a greater number of settlers (76% greater than control) and a relative increase in local retention and self-recruitment rates as revealed by the biophysical model (5 and 7% greater than control respectively). However, when increased temperature occurred in combination with elevated CO2 levels, respiration was not significantly increased relative to control conditions and development of competency is minimally impacted. This resulted in a smaller increase in settlers (13% greater than control) and no significant changes in connectivity patterns. The post-settlement phase was similarly impacted with counteracting effects of increased temperature and ocean acidification on recruit growth. Overall, this dissertation reveals the potential for adaptation to increased temperature in at least one important coral species ( Orbicella faveolata) that is greatly diminished when encountered in combination with ocean acidification. These results encourage the reduction of carbon emissions to give coral species the chance to adapt to elevated temperatures through the recruitment of more resilient individuals without the additional stress of ocean acidification.

T1  - Determinants of Life History Variability in the Chinook Salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) of Western Alaska
AN  - 1896531048
AB  - Chinook Salmon from western Alaska have experienced recent declines in abundance, size, and age at maturity. Declines have led to hardships for the region’s dependent subsistence and commercial users. Thus there is a managerial need to better understand factors effecting life-history expression in these populations. I used retrospective scale analysis and run reconstructions to investigate the causes of declines in age at maturity and the effect of the marine environment on growth, maturation, and survival in two western Alaskan Chinook Salmon populations subject to long-term monitoring: the East Fork Andreafsky River and the Kogrukluk River (tributaries of the Yukon River and Kuskokwim River respectively). The expression of age at maturation exhibited sex-specific responses to variability in growth. Additionally, thresholds for maturation, as described by a newly presented measure of maturation reaction norms that accounts for growth history, were found to have declined in both sexes. This can be interpreted as indirect evidence that observed declines in age at maturity represent an evolutionary response. I also found that sea surface temperatures in the Bering Sea exert strong control on the expression of life history variability. Warmer sea surface temperatures appear to lead to a younger age at maturity, largely through the vector of augmented growth. However, warmer sea surface temperatures additionally appeared to decrease the average age of male recruits by lowering growth thresholds for early male maturation. Despite the demonstrated relationship between Bering Sea surface temperatures and age at maturation, a lack of a temporal trend in sea surface temperatures during the period of analysis (1977–2013) suggests that temperature alone cannot explain documented declines in average age. However, this result suggests that the average age at maturation of western Alaskan Chinook Salmon will continue to decline with future predicted warming of the Bering Sea as a consequence of climate change.

T1  - Effects of Variable and Changing Environments on Demography: Inferences From a Lesser Snow Goose Colony
AN  - 1893751194
AB  - Anthropogenic pressures have caused changes in both the mean and variance of environmental conditions, with associated effects on the demography of natural populations. The demographic effects of environmental change can manifest through direct (i.e., physiological) or indirect pathways (i.e., through shifts in species interactions). For many populations, environmental change will affect multiple life cycle stages simultaneously, thereby altering vital rate correlation structures with potentially important impacts on evolutionary fitness. The effects of environmental change will also often be habitat-specific, particularly when species interactions modify demographic sensitivity to climate. As a result, the effects of climate change are likely to vary across a species range, with important implications for range expansion and population viability.    In chapter 2, I examine the effects of joint vital rate responses to environmental drivers on the evolution of life histories in variable environments. I show that vital rate covariation, generated when multiple vital rates respond to a shared environmental driver, can fundamentally alter evolutionary selection pressures. Negative vital rate covariation promotes the evolution of demographic lability (stronger demographic responsiveness), while positive covariation promotes buffering (weaker demographic responsiveness), altering the range of life histories over which the evolution of buffered and labile vital rates are a predicted evolutionary outcome. By identifying the life histories for which selection pressures are most sensitive to environmentally-driven vital rate covariation, this study provides a richer understanding of both life history evolution and the capacity of species to cope with ongoing changes to contemporary environments.   In chapter 3, I use a long-term study of lesser snow geese to test the hypothesis that demographic and developmental responses to climate will be weakest in habitats where resource diversity is greatest. I find support for this hypothesis, and my results indicate that gosling demography is much more responsive to climate in recently colonized, freshwater habitats where landscape diversity and gosling diet diversity is low. These results underscore the potential importance of accounting for biotic interactions when predicting spatio-temporal responses to climate.   In chapter 4, I quantify the consequences of observed climate change for lesser snow goose population dynamics across habitats. I find that climate change increases population growth in all habitats, but that such increases are disproportionately large in novel inland freshwater habitats. These results suggest that in a warmer and more variable climate, the breeding range and population growth of lesser snow geese is likely to increase, counteracting current management efforts to reduce overabundant populations.

T1  - Using Multiple Methodologies to Understand Within Species Variability of <i>Adelges</i> and <i>Pineus</i> (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha)
AN  - 1889886757
AB  - The species of two genera in Insecta: Hemiptera: Adelgidae were investigated through the lenses of genetics, morphology, life cycle and host species. The systematics are unclear due to complex life cycles, including multigenerational polymorphism, host switching and cyclical parthenogenesis. I studied the hemlock adelgids, including the nonnative invasive hemlock woolly adelgid on the east coast of the United States, that are currently viewed as a single species. I used multivariate morphometric analyses to identify morphological differences among hemlock adelgid lineages. With principal component analyses and MANOVA, the six lineages that were used in this study were found to be significantly different from each other. The findings of this project provide evidence for taxonomic designation of different hemlock adelgid lineages, which will hopefully inform regulation of these distinct lineages, as these distinctions between the lineages of hemlock adelgids could equate to other biological differences, ex. cold tolerance, host specialization, fecundity and dispersal ability. I also investigated the relationship between species  Pineus similis, Pineus abietinus through phylogeny, genetic distances, life cycle and host species. This was done through using three mitochondrial (COI, COII, cytB) and one nuclear (EF1a) gene, in Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses, along with genetic distance measurements. The P. similis and P. abietinus on  Pinus could not be separated within the Bayesian analyses, and  P. similis and P. abietinus on Abies had low calculated distance measurements (2.98%) compared to the average distance between species within the genus (28.07%). These two studies emphasize the current confusion within the Adelgidae family, and the results presented in this thesis stress the importance of using components of multiple species concepts to better understand the systematics of these lineages.

T1  - Evolutionary Innovations in Ants to Thermally Stressful Environments
AN  - 1886408461
AB  - Temperature is a fundamental environmental force shaping species abundance and distributions through its effects on biochemical reaction rates, metabolism, activity, and reproduction. In light of future climate shifts, mainly driven by temperature increases, how will organisms persist in warmer environments? One molecular mechanism that may play an important role in coping with heat stress is the heat shock response (HSR), which protects against molecular damage. To prevent and repair protein damage specifically, Hsps activate and become up-regulated. However, the functional diversity and relevance of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in extending upper thermal limits in taxonomic groups outside marine and model systems is poorly understood. Ants are a good system to understand the physiological mechanisms for coping with heat stress because they have successfully diversified into thermally stressful environments. To identify and characterize the functional diversity of Hsps in ants, I surveyed Hsp orthologues from published ant genomes to test for signatures of positive selection and to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Within Hymenoptera, ants utilize unique sets of Hsps for the HSR. Stabilizing selection was the prevailing force among Hsp orthologues, suggesting that protein activity is conserved. At the same time, regulatory regions (promoters) governing transcriptional up-regulation diversified: species differ in the number and location of heat shock elements (HSEs). Therefore, Hsp expression patterns may be a target for selection in warm environments. I tested whether Hsp expression corresponded with variation in upper thermal limits in forest ant species within the genus  Aphaenogaster. Whole colonies were collected throughout the eastern United States and were lab acclimated. There was a positive relationship between upper thermal limits (Critical Thermal maxima, CTmax) and local temperature extremes. Upper thermal limits were also higher in ant species that lived in open habitats (shrub-oak and long-leaf pine savannah) than species occupying closed habitats (deciduous forest). Ant species with higher CTmax expressed Hsps more slowly, at higher temperatures, and at higher maximum levels than those with low CTmax. Because Hsps sense and repair molecular damage, these results suggest the proteomes of open relative to closed canopy forests are more stable. Although deciduous forest ant species may be buffered from temperature stress, it is likely that temperature interacts with other environmental stressors such as water and nutrient availability that may impact upper thermal limits. I measured the influence of dehydration and nutrition stress on upper thermal limits of forest ants from a single population. Ants that were initially starved were much less thermally tolerant than controls and ants that were initially desiccated. Because ants are likely to experience similar combination of stressors in the wild, upper thermal limits may be severely overestimated in single factor experiments. Therefore, realistic forecasting models need to consider multiple environmental stressors. Overall, adaptive tuning of Hsp expression that reflects better protection and tolerance of protein unfolding may have facilitated ant diversification into warm environments. However, additional stressors and mechanisms may constrain the evolution of upper thermal limits.
