T1  - Thermal biology of the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus
AN  - 2300590765
AB  - Acclimation of adult E. chloroticus for 90 days at projected seawater temperature for the next century (i.e., 24 C) resulted in decreased feeding, respiration, negative growth and complete loss of reproductive output. The thermal limits (median lethal temperature (LT50) and lethal temperature) of adult E. chloroticus were not affected by duration of acclimation at 18 and 24 C (i.e., one or four weeks) or by acclimatization summer (21 C) seasons. However, acclimatization of animals to winter season resulted in lower thermal limits. Expression of hsp70 mRNA in adult E. chloroticus increased with temperature during a thermal shock (1 C day-1) with a maximum expression at ca. 27-28 C regardless of the acclimation/acclimatization temperature. Performance of early development at different temperatures (18, 21, 24 C) was evaluated using gametes obtained from acclimated and non-acclimated wild adults. Development was successful in all treatments, and larvae raised at 24 C developed faster and were larger compared to larvae cultured at 18 and 21 C. Culture temperature did not affect respiration rate, lipid and protein content of the gastrulae, 2- and 4-arm larvae. Whereas for the 8-arm larval stage, larvae cultured at 18 C had more lipid compared to those from 24 C, and larvae cultured at 24 C had more protein compared to those from the 18 C treatment. When cultured at 24 C, both gastrula and 2-arm larvae showed higher LT50. Thermal shock had an effect on the hsp70 mRNA expression of gastrulae, 2- and 4-arm larvae. The genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions during early development of E. chloroticus were evident, with some genotypes performing better than others at higher temperatures. In addition, including a second stressor (i.e., low salinity, 29 ppt) during the first 24 hours of development affected fertilization, development rate, gastrulation success and normal development, with seawater temperature only affecting development rate and gastrulation. Nonetheless, an increase in temperature from 18 to 21 C minimized the negative effect of low salinity on development rate and gastrulation of E. chloroticus. Overall, the sea urchin E. chloroticus may have the potential to adapt to warmer seawater conditions induced by climate change due to the presence of developmental plasticity in the early life stages to withstand higher seawater temperatures and lower salinities. However, adaptation would require the presence of competent reproductive adults able to carry on plasticity through generations. Considering the total loss of reproductive output observed at higher temperatures, an increase in seawater temperature could dramatically influence the persistence of northern populations of E. chloroticus, leading to flow-on effects in the subtidal ecosystem. Finally, the results obtained in this research provide detailed information on the physiological and molecular responses of both adults and early life stages of E. chloroticus under current and projected seawater temperatures in a climate change scenario.

T1  - <b>Next-Generation Salmonid Alphavirus Vaccine Development</b>
AN  - 2564078818
AB  - Aquaculture is essential to meet the current and future demands for seafood to feed the world population. Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout are two of the most cultured aquaculture species. A pathogen that threatens these species is salmonid alphavirus (SAV). A current inactivated virus vaccine against SAV provides cross-protection against all SAV subtypes in salmonids and reduces mortality amongst infected fish. However, protection is not 100% and due to virus growth at low temperature, the vaccine production process is time consuming. In addition, the vaccine needs to be injected into the fish, which is a cumbersome process. The work described in this thesis aimed to increase the general knowledge of SAV and to assess current vaccine technologies, and to use this knowledge in designing next-generation vaccines for salmonid aquaculture. An alternative cell line to support SAV proliferation was identified, however, the virus production time could not yet outcompete the current SAV production system. Making use of the baculovirus insect cell expression system, multiple enveloped virus-like particle (eVLP), and core-like particle (CLP) prototype vaccines were produced in insect cells at high temperature. An in vivo vaccination study showed, however, that these vaccines could not readily protect Atlantic salmon against SAV. The low temperature-dependent replication of SAV was attributed to the glycoprotein E2, and it was found that E2 only correctly travelled to the cell surface at low temperature, and in the presence of glycoprotein E1. The biological impact of this finding was confirmed in the development and in vivo testing of a DNA-launched replicon vaccine. The effective DNA-launched replicon vaccine was extended by delivery of the capsid protein in trans. It was hypothesized that viral replicon particles (VRP) were formed in vivo, which would cause an additional single round of infection and might further elevate the immune response in comparison to the replicon vaccine. A second animal trial indicated that the inclusion of capsid did not yet improve vaccine efficacy. This trial however did show that a DNA vaccine transiently expressing the SAV structural proteins provided superior protection over both replicon vaccines (with and without capsid). In this thesis, some virus characteristics, such as the cause of temperature-dependency of SAV replication, of an unique aquatic virus were further explored. The production and in vivo testing of multiple next-generation vaccines defined the prerequisites for induction of a potent immune response in Atlantic salmon. A prototype DNA-launched replicon vaccine has shown potential for further development. The research described in this thesis contributes to the development of next-generation vaccines in the challenging area of fish vaccinology.

T1  - Genomic Responses to Environmental Variation and Change in the Ocean
AN  - 2447553075
AB  - Human activities are driving dramatic changes in the global environment. One consequence of this change is the rapid warming and acidification of the ocean. Throughout the Earth's history, sudden environmental change has often been associated with mass extinctions. However, in some cases species can adapt to changing environments via natural selection on heritable genetic variation. Most genetic variation, however, is not important for adaptation, and instead reflects the influences of mutation and drift on variants with minimal fitness consequences. For this reason, it has been difficult to assess the adaptive potential of populations and species even when genetic data are available. This thesis uses new genome-wide approaches to the analysis of the functional consequences of genetic variation to determine the spatial distribution and abundance of the functional genetic variation that could drive adaptive responses to environmental change. In the first chapter, I use gene co-expression network analysis to identify gene networks that mediate both fixed and plastic differences between coral colonies of the species Acropora hyacinthus in susceptibility to coral bleaching, the stress-induced breakdown of coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis. In the second chapter, I show that variation in gene expression within and between marine populations, including coral, abalone, mussels, and urchins, is often related to variation in the frequencies of genetic variants that change the expression of the allele on which they are found. In the third chapter, I show that persistent differences in the frequencies of genetic variants that cause changes in gene expression and protein sequence in stress-related genes are associated with the evolution of increased bleaching resilience in a cryptic lineage of Acropora hyacinthus. In the fourth chapter, I use low-coverage whole-genome re-sequencing of 114 coral colonies to identify "supergenes," or closely linked co-inherited sets of multiple genes, that were associated with differences in bleaching outcomes during the third global bleaching event within and between cryptic species of Acropora hyacinthus. Taken as a whole, this thesis demonstrates the existence of high levels of functional diversity spread across contemporary environmental mosaics, and suggests that this diversity will play a critical role in assessing and managing the responses of populations to rapid anthropogenic change.

T1  - Coupling Electrochemistry and Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry to Observe Transient Electrochemical Intermediates
AN  - 2447534191
AB  - The observation of electrochemical reaction species directly after electrochemical generation has been a goal of electrochemists for years, and is a problem that has been approached using many different analytical techniques. The challenge in acquiring faster response times exists in transferring electrochemically generated species quickly from solution to the gas phase for MS detection. The development of DESI allows for analyses to be made on surfaces under atmospheric pressure and at room temperature with a sampling time on the order of milliseconds. In collaboration with Prof. Hao Chen, we present a new DESI-ECMS technique for the mass spectrometric detection of fleeting reaction intermediates in electrochemical reactions utilizing a "waterwheel" working electrode setup is presented here. This setup takes inspiration from DESI-MS to sample directly from the surface of a working electrode for in situ electrochemical mass spectrometric analysis in seeking shorter analysis timescales. A number of systems is presented here verifying the viability of the waterwheel for DESI-ECMS analysis to observe fleeting electrochemical intermediates.

T1  - Electron impact source, development and applications
AN  - 2340437338
AB  - Many modern x-ray instruments are based at synchrotrons, with corresponding limited accessibility and high costs. This has driven the development of imaging/microscopes using table-top x-ray sources. This thesis presents experimental measurements for both electron impact sources and laser plasma source, also it details the developments for the third generation microfocus x-ray source MKIII and associated optical systems for various applications. For non-pulsed radiation, the commissioning and set up of the new third generation microfocus x-ray source MK III is in progress. The Microfocus x-ray source MKI had been characterised and used for imaging biological samples. Absorption and phase contrast images were obtained for biological samples. In addition, for the first time, the MKI device was used to perform experiments to study the phase contrast x-ray image sensing techniques (PCXI), using a sand paper analyser. Images were successfully recorded and analysed using laboratory electron impact x-ray source (MKI) and laser plasma source (Astra Gemini laser at RAL). The PCXI technique can be developed with the new MKIII x-ray source by using two crystals, one a monochromatic and second as a reflection analyser. Additionally, the MKI and MKIII sources can be coupled with a silica mirror or multilayer monochromator and zone plates to provide high spatial resolution images (hundreds of nanometers beam spot sizes) allowing use for various applications. New interchangeable targets (chromium, titanium, and copper) were designed for MKIII and these can provide a range of different x-ray energies, and may allow a considerably smaller x-ray focal spot size ≈ 1 µm, increasing the range of applicability of the source. Furthermore, having different melting points for target materials, a compensation between electron beam size and energy should be taken to avoid exceeding the target melting point. The heat generated at the surface of different targets was calculated and the survival of the present targets (aluminium and carbon) verified. In this MKI regime, an electron beam of 10 keV is focused to a few tens of micrometres diameters on the solid target and x-rays are emitted. The emission spectrum was characterised using mica and KAP crystal spectrometers. The K-edge intensity lines were recorded and analysed for both aluminium and carbon targets using imaging plate and an x-ray CCD camera. Experimental optimisation of the electron gun electrode operating modes was achieved and verified against the literature. The maximum current measured was 250-300 µA. The x-ray spot size was measured and the minimum spot size recorded was 26.1 × 47.9 µm2. Smaller spot sizes are possible but with a low electron beam current. The design of a focusing magnetic lens suitable for use in the new third generation MKIII x-ray microfocus device was undertaken. The focusing lens was designed and manufactured at Imperial College London. A professional software package was used to design the lens through computational modelling. The experimental maximum magnetic field B measured for the focusing lens was 0.512 T at the lens aperture. The aim is to achieve 1 µm electron beam diameter focused at the target surface, although by this computational model, a satisfactory diameter had been achieved ~20-50 µm, but a smaller electron beam could be achieved. The validity of the solutions generated by computational model needs to be precisely experimentally examined in order to achieve the required beam diameter and suitable beam current incident on the target.

T1  - Climate change time machine: adaptation to 30 years of warming in the baltic sea
AN  - 2002486403
AB  - Earth mean surface temperature has increased by 1 °C since the industrial revolution, and this has already had considerable effects on animal and plant species. Ecological responses to the warming climate – often facilitated via phenotypic plasticity – are ubiquitous. However, even though evolution can occur rapidly there are only few examples of genetic adaptation to climate change.In my thesis, I used a near-natural system to study if and how organisms have adapted to 30 years of warming, and how this has affected competitive species interactions. I investigated Baltic Sea populations of the aquatic snails Galba truncatula and Theodoxus fluviatilis, which had been subjected to cooling water discharge from power plants, resulting in water temperatures 4 to 10 °C higher than in the surrounding sea.G. truncatula had high upper thermal limits and large acclimation potential. This plasticity may have helped the species to survive under the new conditions, allowing evolution through natural selection to take place. I found that the populations of the two thermal origins had diverged in SNP markers associated with warmer temperature, whereas divergence in selectively neutral markers was mainly related to geographical distance. Adaptation occurred from standing genetic variation, emphasizing the importance of genetic diversity and population size in enabling the persistence of populations. Changes in thermal sensitivity of growth and survival were subtle yet significant, and complied with theoretical models of thermal adaptation in ectotherms. At the community level, pre-adaptation to warmer conditions aided the native T. fluviatilis when competing with the alien Potamopyrgus antipodarum. However, interspecific competition limited the snails most in those traits favored under warming, highlighting the challenge of adapting to different selecting forces during global change.The persistence of species and populations under climate change depends on several factors - plasticity allowing for initial survival, evolvability in allowing the genetic changes, and species interactions affecting the new ecological niches. The results of my thesis indicate that persistence under climate change is possible when these factors align, but the relative roles of ecology and plasticity may explain why there are so few observed instances of evolution in response to climate change.

T1  - Insect life history responses to global change
AN  - 1937410509
AB  - Understanding life history variation in insects requires an assessment of how resources are allocated between reproductive and somatic traits. Associated data are not only a potential indicator of species adaptation, but also of environmental influences on fitness. So far, however, there is a dearth of data on factors affecting resource allocation, in particular in real environments. Using an integrative nutrient assay protocol, this study assessed the effects of body size and environmental conditions on resource allocation strategies in terrestrial and aquatic semelparous insects: the indian mealmoth, Plodia interpunctella under laboratory conditions, and two caddisfly species (Hydropsyche siltalai and Rhyacophila dorsalis) in the field. In Plodia interpunctella, larger females had higher potential lifetime fecundity due to their prolonged lifespan, while smaller females maintained greater initial egg loads and a shorter life-span. Assays revealed that current reproduction requires greater nutrient allocation in somatic and reproductive tissue, illustrating potentially fundamental factors underlying reproduction-longevity trade-offs. Field studies showed how trichopteran larvae have species-specific responses to physicochemical conditions located along an altitudinal gradient (20 m - 230 m asl) in the River Usk. Nutrient allocation in Rhyacophila dorsalis did not differ between upstream and downstream sites. In contrast, upstream Hydropsyche siltalai emerged with greater nutrient reserves consistent with early reproduction while those in warmer downstream environments must reallocate resources for somatic maintenance reducing available resource for reproduction. Consistent with this result, translocation of late instar H. siltalai over a thermal gradient (1.5 - 4.5 °C) showed how thermal exposure can affect adult fitness by reducing body size and increasing nutrient allocation for somatic maintenance. These results show how insects adjust nutrient balance for reproduction and survival under different circumstances. The most significant result is that global warming might reduce body size and advance reproduction in some species with consequences for fitness. This is proposed as an area ripe for further study to understand the evolutionary consequences of global change.

T1  - Planning and operating energy storage for maximum technical and financial benefits in electricity distribution networks
AN  - 1916426345
AB  - The transmission and distribution networks are facing changes in the way they will be planned, operated and maintained as a result of the rise in the deployment of Low Carbon Technologies (LCTs) on the power grid. These LCTs provide the benefits of a decarbonised grid and reduce reliance on fossil fuels and large centralised generation. As LCTs are close to the demand centres, a significant amount will be deployed in distribution networks. The distribution networks face challenges in enabling a wide deployment of LCTs because they were traditionally built for centralised generation and most are operated passively as demand patterns are well understood and power flows are unidirectional to load centres. The opposite will be the case for distribution networks with LCTs. Utilities that own and operate distribution networks such as the DNOs in the UK will face a host of problems, such as voltage and thermal excursions and power quality issues on their networks. Traditional reinforcement methods will be expensive for DNOs, so they are considering innovative solutions that provide multiple benefits; this is where Energy Storage Systems (ESS) could play a role to provide multiple technical and economic benefits across the grid from voltage and power flow management to upgrade deferral of network assets. This is due to the multifunctional nature of ESS allowing it to act as generation, transmission, demand or demand response based on requirements at any specific time based on the requirements of the stakeholder involved with the asset. ESS is technically capable of providing benefits to DNOs and other stakeholders on the electricity grid but the business case is not proven. Unless multiple benefits are aggregated, investment in ESS is challenging as they have a substantial capital cost and some components will require more frequent replacement than traditional network assets which typically last between 20 – 40+ years. As a result there is a reluctance to include them in future distribution network planning arrangements. IV Furthermore, the electricity regulatory and market design, which was set up in the time of traditional centralised generation and networks, limits investment in ESS by regulated bodies such as DNOs. The regulations and market structures also affects revenue streams and the resulting business case for ESS. This thesis investigates the feasibility of ESS in distribution networks by first studying the effect of current electricity regulatory and market practices on ESS deployment, investigating how ESS can be used under the present rules, and establishing whether there are limitations that can be reduced or removed. Secondly, short and medium term planning is carried out on model Medium Voltage distribution networks (6.6 kV) provided by the IEEE and Electricity North West Limited to establish the technical and financial viability of investing in ESS over conventional reinforcement methods by:  Assessing the impact of the proliferation of LCTs in distribution networks using both deterministic and stochastic methods under different scenarios based on current developments and government policies in the UK. This stochastic evaluation considers both spatial and temporal aspects of LCTs in distribution networks with datasets obtained from real distribution network customers;  Developing and applying ESS voltage and power flow management, and market control algorithms to resolve distribution network issues resulting from growing LCTs and allowing ESS to participate in the electricity spot market over a planning period up to the year 2030;  Providing a framework for assessing the business case of ESS under a DNO or third-party ownership structure where technical and commercial benefits from network asset upgrade deferral, energy arbitrage, balancing market and ancillary services (frequency response and short term operating reserves), distribution and transmission system use of system benefits are evaluated; V  Optimising the operation of ESS considering multiple technical and commercial objectives to establish the technical benefits and revenues that can be obtained from an ESS deployment and the trade-off of benefits that applies for differing ownership types. The simulation results show that, under the scenarios investigated, ESS can be used as a technical solution for DNOs. They show that the ESS capital costs can be offset by aggregating benefits from both technical and commercial applications in distribution networks if regulatory and market changes are made. The conclusions offer a perspective to DNOs and third parties’ considering investing in ESS on the electricity grid as it evolves towards a more active, decarbonised system.

T1  - Phenotypic and genetic variation in the dothistroma-pinus pathosystem
AN  - 1916426147
AB  - Trees and forests are under increasing threat from pathogens which cause huge economic and ecological damage. The unprecedented global movement of pathogens into new areas creates novel pathosystems, while the changing climate affects the dynamics of endemic pathosystems. Co-evolution within endemic pathosystems affects the genetic composition of hosts and pathogens. Spatial heterogeneity in pathogen pressure leads to genetic variation in disease-related traits among host populations. In contrast, novel hosts or populations are expected to be highly susceptible to exotic pathogens as there has been no evolution of defence responses. Host response to disease can therefore be an indicator of a novel or endemic pathosystem. The long term resilience of forests to pathogens depends on the adaptive capacity of both the host and pathogen species. Establishing the extent of genetic and phenotypic variation within both the host and pathogen is therefore fundamental in understanding past, current and future pathosystem dynamics. The most significant current threat to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) caused by the foliar pathogen Dothistroma septosporum which is assumed to be exotic to Great Britain. This study aimed to increase understanding of the genetic and phenotypic variation in this pathosystem. Results from this study show that there are high levels of variation in the Dothistroma – Pinus pathosystem. Genetic variation, elucidated using neutral genetic markers, mating type specific markers and in vitro analysis of phenotypic variation in D. septosporum collected from Scottish pinewoods, was found to be high: there was high allelic diversity, particularly within plantation forests outside the native pinewood range, and high phenotypic plasticity in response to different temperature treatments. Both mating type idiomorphs were found in one forest which demonstrates their potential for sexual as well as asexual reproduction. There is also tentative evidence from this study that the pathogen is either introduced to Great Britain or that endemic pathogen populations have been augmented with introduced pathogens. Artificial and natural inoculations of native Scots pine provenances with D. septosporum indicate that there is considerable variation in susceptibility to DNB across the native range in Scotland and that variation in this trait is both highly heritable and evolvable. Furthermore, provenance mean susceptibility to DNB is negatively and significantly associated with water-related variables at site of origin, a finding that is potentially indicative of a co-evolutionary history between host and pathogen. Genetic differences among individuals which are ‘resistant’ or ‘susceptible’ to DNB were identified in Pinus radiata for which there has been extensive research in this pathosystem, by comparing the transcriptome sequences of the two phenotypic groups. Nearly half of the genetic differences identified among phenotypes were found in genes with a putative defence function. In conclusion, native Scots pine provenances contain the necessary heritable genetic diversity to evolve a decrease in their susceptibility to D. septosporum through natural selection in response to elevated prevalence of this pathogen. However, implementation of key native pinewood management strategies, including encouraging regeneration in particular, are necessary in order to facilitate the adaptive evolution of native forests to increased levels of DNB. The effectiveness of this response will depend on the rapidity of adaptation of the pathogen. Measures to limit adaptation where possible, including the use of pathogen monitoring and control in nurseries and the limitation of pathogen movement into native pinewoods, should be continued.

T1  - Solar energy potential in the kingdom of saudi arabia: a comparative analysis, assessment and exploitation for power generation
AN  - 1896365364
AB  - This research investigates the potential for employing solar energy as a sustainable power generation source in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The work maps the availability of solar energy throughout the country, and investigates the feasibility of implementing the technology at two case study locations. These are the existing power generation grid sites of Wadi Aldawasir (located 20° 23′ 22.00″ N 45° 12′ 32.00″ E), and Shuaibah (located 20° 37′ 22.84″ N 39° 33′ 44.02″ E). The first case study site, Wadi Aldawasir, covers an area of 48,900 m2, where parabolic trough solar thermal technology is proposed for power generation. The second case study site, Shuaibah power plant is one of the largest desalination and fossil fuel plants in the world with a 1,030,000 m3/ day capacity. Both case studies were assessed in terms of site specifications with selection based on Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI). A feasibility study examining Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) potential was conducted for both locations, with analysis of weather data, particularly monthly and annual, global horizontal and beam normal irradiation data. From these data, a reasonable estimate of CSP potential, and viability of the technology was determined. Simulation was then performed using Solar Advisor Model (SAM) and Renewable Energy Technology Screen (RETScreen) software, taking into account the location weather data, (DNI, dry-bulb and dew-point temperatures, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and wind speed), technical specification, (solar field, Solar Multiple (SM) Solar collector Assemblies (SCAs), power cycle and thermal storage) and economic parameters (energy unit cost, maintenance, etc.). Simulation evaluated annual energy performance (solar radiation resource of the solar field, electrical energy delivered by solar thermal plant, system losses, required solar field area), levelised cost of unit of power generated, CO2 emissions savings, and other financial feasibility indicators. The work shows that the energy yield of the new solar power plants using proposed CSP technology in both case studies is feasible.

T1  - Synthesis, characterisation and applications of new polyesters for drug delivery
AN  - 1896109732
AB  - In recent years, a number of reports have focused on the use of polyesters in drug delivery due to their intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this thesis, aliphatic polyesters were synthesized by polycondensation reaction and ring opening polymerization reactions. The properties of the polymers and drug delivery potential of the resultant materials were evaluated. In the polycondensation reactions, a series of aliphatic polyesters of similar molecular weight were synthesized by reacting 1,10-decanediol with different ratios of succinic acid/phenylsuccinic acid and the effects of phenyl group side-chain substitution on polymer properties was investigated. A solvent-free melt polycondensation method using scandium (III) triflate as catalyst at an industrially relevant temperature (120 °C) was used. As the phenyl content increased, the polymers changed from semicrystalline to amorphous in state. The loading capability of polymers was checked by formulating nanoparticles containing coumarin 6 as a fluorescent dye analogue of active drugs. A polymer with a 70/30 ratio of succinic acid and phenylsuccinic acid showed the highest dye loading among the set of materials synthesised. This polymer was found to be degradable over time under selected experimental conditions. Amphiphilic block co-polymers from the PluronicTM class were used to stabilize, in PBS, nanoparticles formed from these polyesters by nanoprecipitation routes. The metabolic activity, cell membrane integrity and lysosomal functions of C3A cells dosed with the polymers were determined to observe the cytocompatibility of the highest dye-loaded nanoparticles. Activity relative to undosed C3A cells was retained at more than 80% in the all of the assays. Imaging of Pluronic coated and uncoated nanoparticles in C3A cells suggested that both types of the nanoparticles were endocytosed in the early stage of the study (within 10 min). The internalization of nanoparticles was increased progressively over the study time. These results indicated the possible utility of the selected polymers in diagnostic and delivery applications. Ring opening polymerization (ROP) reactions were used for the synthesis of a diblock (mPEG-b-PεDL) and a triblock (PεDL-b-PEG-b-PεDL) copolymer from a seven membered ε-decalactone (ε-DL) monomer obtained from renewable sources. A diblock (mPEG-b-PεDL) copolymer was compared with structurally similar mPEG-b-PCL copolymer synthesized via ROP of ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) monomer, which can be considered as a non-renewable monomer. A six membered δ-decalactone (δ-DL) was also used for the synthesis of a diblock copolymer (mPEG-b-PδDL) to compare the reaction kinetics and properties of the copolymers. The copolymers were prepared via bulk polymerisation using 1,5,7-Triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) as a metal-free catalyst to replace the conventionally used stannous octoate [Sn(Oct)2]. A higher polymerization efficiency was achived with TBD compared to Sn(Oct)2 catalyst. However, a notable difference in the reaction temperature required for ε-DL and δ-DL polymerization was observed. The comparison with a structural analogue, i.e. ε-CL, demonstrated that the ε-DL polymerization was inhibited due to the presence of the alkyl chain of ε-DL monomer. However, a higher reaction time (12 h for TBD and 24 h for Sn(Oct)2) in CROP of ε-DL was addressed by using microwave based ring opening polymerization (MROP) reaction. The MROP was adopted as a ‘green’ and cheap heating method alternative to conventional heating (CROP) for the synthesis of mPEG-b-PεDL diblock copolymers using TBD as a catalyst. All the reactions were conducted in bulk. The MROP was designed based on the dielectric properties of all the reacting materials, as it was found that ε-DL monomers showed good absorption of MW radiation (tanδ>0.5). Accordingly, MROP resulted in a higher rate of ε-DL polymerization compared to CROP but comparison of the synthesis of mPEG-b-PCL copolymer by MROP indicated that the presence of the alkyl chain in ε-DL monomer significantly reduced the rate of polymerization. The synthesized mPEG-b-PεDL copolymer was investigated as a potential drug delivery vehicle for solubilization and controlled delivery of indomethacin. The indomethacin loading and release from mPEG-b-PεDL micelles (amorphous core) was compared against well-established mPEG-b-PCL micelles (semicrystalline core). The drug-polymer compatibility was also determined through a predictive computational approach to access the drug solubilisation (or drug loading) into hydrated micelles. The micelles were prepared by solvent evaporation method and characterized for size, morphology, indomethacin (IND) loading and release. Both of the micelle formulations showed a uniform distribution of spherical micelles with size <60 nm. However, a significantly higher size of empty mPEG-b- PεDL micelle was observed compared to mPEG-b-PCL micelles. A higher compatibility of the drug was predicted with PCL core as determined by modified Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (sp) using the Hanson solubility parameter (HSP) approach. The compatibility of the drug was determined for both of the segments (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) of the copolymers and found to be in the order of sp (PεDL)> sp (mPEG)> sp (PCL). The predictions suggested that more IND should encapsulate within the micelles with PCL core compared to PDL core, but the IND loading experiments revealed an overall higher loading in PεDL core (6.55 wt%) compared to PCL core (5.39 wt%) (P < 0.05, unpaired student’s t-test). However, consideration of the IND loading per unit volume of the micelles revealed that the PCL cored micelles was able to load 1.5 times more compared to the PεDL cored micelles. This result illustrated the higher compatibility of the IND with PCL core in accordance with the solubility parameter calculations. These data also suggested that the overall higher IND loading in PεDL core was attributable to the amorphous nature of the core which increased the core volume by 1.81 times compared to the PCL core. Drug release studies showed the sustained release pattern from both of the micelle systems although the semicrystalline PCL core (80% drug release in 110 h) was able to release the drug for a longer period compared to PεDL core (80% drug release in 72 h). Cell viability tests demonstrated the cytocompatibility of the mPEG-b-PεDL polymer. The micelles were internalized effectively in the early stages of the study and progressively increased with time. The results of the present thesis suggested that novel aliphatic polyester can be good candidates for the drug delivery applications and further studies can explore the possible applications of these polymers in the biomedical field.

T1  - Modelling of sorption enhanced chemical looping steam reforming (se-clsr) of methane in a packed bed reactor
AN  - 1874896507
AB  - In the sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR) process, hydrogen (H2) can be produced in concentration up to 98 vol. % (dry basis) in a single reactor packed with a mixture of reforming catalyst and carbon dioxide (CO2) sorbent. This is defined as pre-combustion capturing of CO2 and the high purity H2 produced can be used as a fuel for electricity generation, synthesis of ammonia-derived fertilisers, or hydrotreating of naphtha and other heavy gas oil in petroleum refinery. A cyclic operation between the production of H2 and regeneration of CO2 sorbent is required, but the energy demand for the sorbent regeneration is high. A proposed method to decrease this energy demand is to couple SE-SMR with chemical looping (CL), which naturally separates the nitrogen (N2) from the syngas via the highly exothermic cyclic oxidation with air of a metallic material, which acts as the reforming catalyst when reduced (oxygen transfer material or ‘OTM’). The combination of SE-SMR and CL makes the process energy efficient and eliminates the need for (i) high temperature as compared to the conventional steam methane reforming (SMR) process (typical temperature range is 750- 950°C), (ii) the water gas shift (WGS) reactors downstream of the reformer, and (iii) external heating using the natural gas fuel in the reformer. However the H2 generation of a high purity from one reactor operation is intermittent, as part of a cyclic operation, with the reactor alternately operating in Fuel Reactor mode (FR), with fuel and steam feed or Air Reactor mode (AR), with air feed. Adsorption of CO2 shifts the equilibrium of reaction towards more H2 production and ultimately increases the efficiency of the process towards H2 production. Production of H2, CH4 conversion and overall efficiency of the process depend upon many operating parameters. The effects of inlet temperature, reactor pressure, molar steam to carbon ratio (S/C) in the feed, and gas mass velocity on the SE-SMR and the sorption enhanced chemical looping steam reforming (SE-CLSR) of methane processes is reported in this thesis. The formulation of the SE-CLSR process model requires the modelling of packed bed reactors. This mathematical modelling covers various individual models (sub-models) for; SMR, SE-SMR, OTM reduction and oxidation of reduced OTM. The gPROMS model builder 4.1.0® is used to solve the model equations. In this work, an experimental IV kinetics study and model of SMR process over 18 wt. % NiO/α-Al2O3 catalyst are presented for an adiabatic fixed bed reactor in the temperature range of 300-700°C at 1 bar pressure. The model is validated by comparing the results with the experimental data obtained as part of this work. The simulation results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The equilibrium results are generated using Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) software. The effect of various operating parameters (temperature, pressure and S/C) on the CH4 and water conversion (%) is modelled and compared with the equilibrium values. The mathematical model of SE-SMR was developed based on the industrial operating conditions of temperature and pressure. The 873-973 K was found to be the optimum range of temperature, under the high pressure (30 bar) conditions, for the production of H2 of purity exceeding 85%. The developed model of SE-SMR was validated against the literature data. The mathematical model of SE-CLSR process was developed under adiabatic conditions. This model is the combination of reduction of catalyst followed by oxidation of the reduced catalyst. The individual models of reduction and oxidation are developed by using kinetic data available in the literature and later on validated with experimental results proposed in the literature. The already developed model of SE-SMR process is combined with the OTM reduction model to mimic the dynamic process occurring in the fuel reactor (FR) system. This FR is combined with air reactor (AR) and the combined model is run for 10 cycles. The sensitivity of the process is studied under the various operating conditions of temperature (873-1023 K), pressure (1-30 bar), molar S/C (2-6) and mass flux of the gas phase (Gs = 2-7 kg m-2 s-1). In this work, the operating conditions used for the production of H2 represent realistic industrial production conditions. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the developed model of SE-CLSR process has the flexibility to simulate a wide range of operating conditions of temperature, pressure, S/C and Gs.

T1  - Respiratory responses in the freshwater snail (<i>Pomacea bridgesii</i>) are differently affected by temperature, body mass and oxygen availability
AN  - 1870784393
AB  - Pomacea bridgesii is a snail species native to tropical and sub-tropical regions, where it usually faces variability in water, temperature and oxygen level. This study of the effect of temperature on mass-specific oxygen consumption (M˙O2) and its relation to body weight shows that the M˙O2 of juvenile snails in normoxia (18-21 kPa) acclimated at temperature of 25°C ranged from 5 to 58 µMol O2/g/h, with a mean of 41.4 ± 18.3 µMol O2/g/h (n=7). Adult snails in normoxia at 25°C show less variation, ranging from 13 to 23 µMol O2/g/h, with a mean of 24.4 ± 6.1 µMol O2/g/h (n=12). The Q 10 value for juvenile snails was higher in the interval 25-30°C (Q10=5.74) than in the interval 20-25°C (Q10= 0.286). In adult snails, Q10 was higher in the interval 20-25°C (Q 10=3.19). M˙O2 of P. bridgesii  in relation to body weight showed a negative linear correlation between metabolic rate and body weight with b values between 0.23 and 0.76. Also, both juvenile and adult snails exhibited weak O 2 regulation. In general, the different respiratory characteristics between juvenile and adult snails might be related to the differences of individual life history, which caused them to perform differently in face of temperatures change. Additionally, Pomacean snails species originated in tropical habitats where there is a lack of thermal fluctuation. For this reason, Pomacean snails may be less likely to have evolved effective thermal acclimation capabilities.

T1  - Mechanisms of population divergence along elevational gradients in the tropics
AN  - 1870529705
AB  - Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to population divergence and eventually initiate speciation is a key step for understanding the evolution of biodiversity. Most theories of differentiation and speciation have traditionally focused on geographically isolated populations. However, there is growing evidence that speciation can occur due to divergent selection despite initially high gene flow. My doctoral dissertation project investigates the effects of environmental heterogeneity and geography in promoting phenotypic and genetic divergence along elevation gradients in natural populations of a poison frog,  Epipedobates anthonyi, across the landscape with a focus on environmental variation along elevational gradients. I studied populations distributed along a broad elevational gradient (0–1800 m above sea level) on the western slope of the Andes of southern Ecuador. First, I examined the relative roles of geographic distance and environmental gradients on genetic and phenotypic divergence. I found that populations are phenotypically divergent in size, color, and male advertisement calls, but they exhibit low genetic divergence at neutral loci. There is substantial gene flow between populations throughout the lowlands, but populations at higher elevations are relatively isolated. This is mainly due to a mountain ridge acting as a physical and possibly environmental barrier between northern and southern populations. Within elevational gradients, geographic distance corrected for topography is the main factor explaining both genetic and phenotypic divergence. However, when controlling for the effect of topographic distance, environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation between sites best explain observed patterns of genetic divergence, whereas environmental conditions at a given site best explains differences in phenotypic traits, presumably due to divergent selection pressures.    To study the effect of temperature variation along elevational transects on adaptive divergence, I measured thermal tolerance of tadpoles across elevation. I found that populations from higher elevation had higher cold tolerance, suggesting that changes in temperature along elevation may cause divergent selection in thermal tolerance. Additionally, tadpoles from all sites have the ability to shift their thermal tolerance in response to previous exposure to different temperatures.   Finally, to examine the degree of local adaptation to environmental conditions at high and low elevations, I conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. I evaluated populations from high and low elevations from two elevational transects. Overall, I found that all populations have higher reproduction rates at low elevation. In fact, at high elevation, populations had very low reproductive rates or did not reproduce at all. However, variation in life-history traits differed between transects. Populations from one transect revealed a pattern that was consistent with the expectation under local adaptation, namely, low elevation frogs had higher reproduction than high elevation frogs at the low elevation site. In contrast, populations from the other transect had a pattern that would be expected under countergradient variation, namely higher elevation frogs had higher reproduction at the low elevation site. Intriguingly, low elevation frogs had overall higher reproduction rates than high elevation frogs, suggesting that frogs from low elevation have higher fecundity than their counterparts at high elevation.   Overall, the findings of my dissertation suggest that (i) phenotypic divergence occurs in the face of gene flow, (ii) environmental variation along elevation, particularly temperature, is a force that drives population divergence, and (iii) the influences of environmental conditions on populations are variable at the intraspecific level.

T1  - Potential for Adaptation to Climate Change in Interpopulation Hybrids of the Copepod <i>Tigriopus californicus</i>
AN  - 1865369428
AB  - Accurately predicting how species respond to climate change is increasingly important as current methods suggest most will be unable to adapt. But can organisms respond to climate change faster than studies of selection alone suggest? Here we investigate potentially extreme phenotypes of heat tolerance resulting from complimentary gene action. We do so by hybridizing two populations in allopatry of Tigriopus californicus with high genetic divergence from similar temperature regimes. Parentals as well as F1, F2 and F6+ generations are subjected to acute heat stress at a sublethal and lethal temperature. We also look at life history traits for these hybrids to understand the overall viability of these populations. 8 of the 20 F6+ lines had survivorships significantly higher than parentals after being stressed at the sublethal temperature. 3 of those 8 had significantly higher survivorship after being stressed at the lethal temperature. Aside from breakdown resulting from hybridization alone, no further degradation of life history traits were seen in the 8 lines exhibiting extreme thermal tolerance. These results suggest that hybrids of populations in allopatry can respond faster to climate change than studies on selection alone have suggested.

T1  - Investigation of Lipid Profile Patterns Along Latitude in an Eastern Australian Cline and After Stress Selection in the Laboratory, and Experiments on Stress Tolerance with RNAi Knockdown of Lipid Biosynthesis Genes
AN  - 1859922106
AB  - Homeoviscous adaptation in membranes and changes in energy storage lipids such as triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the two main themes of adaptation to environmental conditions. Basal patterns of lipid compositional profile of Drosophila melanogaster along a latitudinal gradient in the eastern coast of Australia indicate variations of lipidome associated with climatic patterns. Lipidome data were collected for eight locations along the eastern Australian cline for both sexes in D. melanogaster and D. simulans.  To further investigate the relationship between lipidome patterns and environmental factors, we utilized laboratory selection studies using stress conditions including high temperature tolerance, desiccation survival, and chill-coma recovery. Furthermore, to gain insights into possible underlying mechanisms between lipid biosynthesis and stress tolerance, knockdowns using RNA interference (RNAi) for various lipid biosynthesis enzymes were investigated. Observations in geographic patterns in the eastern Australian cline include a higher degree of acclimation in membrane lipids in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE/PC) ratio for higher latitude populations. There are increases of abundance for polyunsaturated and monounsaturated phospholipids as latitude increased Additionally, D. melanogaster populations originated from the only urban population consist of higher abundances for most lipid classes when compared to all other locations along the latitude. In selection studies, PE/PC ratio did not have any noticeable variations under any of the stress selections. There is an increase of diacylglycerols (DAGs) in heat tolerance selected lines, this finding is consistent with the previous study of physiological response to heat stress. Furthermore, there is the unexpected finding of few responses to selection for chill-coma recovery in the laboratory. For RNAi knocked down studies, there is the surprising finding of chill-coma recovery patterns differ significantly between two isoforms of stearoyl-CoA desaturases knockdowns. Moreover, there are decreases in heat tolerance when TAG synthesis was disrupted. The cline study generates patterns of variation in lipids that suggests adaptation in wild populations. Insight into the evolution of lipid composition was obtained from stress-based laboratory selection experiments. Disruptions of lipid biosynthesis pathways provided insight into the relationship between lipids and stress tolerance.

T1  - Lilliput Effect Dynamics across the Cretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction: Approaches, Prevalence, and Mechanisms
AN  - 1858569597
AB  - An organism’s body size entails both physiological and ecological costs. Furthermore, as a parameter in analyzing organisms, it represents a fundamental and essential morphometric character. Reductions in size following mass extinction is a commonly observed phenomenon in the fossil record. This study examines the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon termed the: 'Lilliput Effect' by proposing that it represents a rapid evolutionary response to altered selection pressures during a mass extinction. This primary hypothesis is evaluated against two additional hypotheses of size reduction: 1) stunted growth as a response to stressed ecosystems, and/or 2) mass extinctions are size selective.    These hypotheses were tested using data from shell size measurements and morphology primarily from molluscs and brachiopods from both North America and Denmark. Morphological differences were evaluated using Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) of outline shape in conjunction with Principle Components and Canonical Variate Analysis. The first part of this study provides a detailed methodology for data collection and analysis. New methods were developed which display promise in improving the degree to which differences and similarities in shape can be elucidated using EFA. These methods were then employed to test hypotheses of morphological change through minor events of local significance in the Florida Neogene and following the K/Pg mass extinction. Data sources for the K/Pg mass extinction were from high resolution (10 cm intervals) collection of bulk samples from the Brazos River in Texas as well as reposited museum specimens for the Braggs locality in Alabama and Danish samples.    Study of size and evolution through more minor local events in the fossil record entailed measurements and shape analysis of left valves of bivalves from the genus Chine. Various environmental changes occurred at various points during the Neogene in Florida Neogene, most profoundly documented during the Plio-Pleistocene with accompanying faunal turnover. The  Chione specimens analyzed were derived from a discontinuous sequence encompassing ∼18 Ma and represent material from the Miocene Chipola Formation through to the Recent. The size of Chione increased from the Miocene to the Pliocene and then decreased from the Pliocene into the Pleistocene possibly due to lower primary productivity. The later part of the Pleistocene into the Recent was characterized by increased size relative to the early Pleistocene and size was stable through this interval. Morphologically, Chione changed in shape from the Miocene to the Pliocene, but remained in stasis from the Pliocene to the Recent suggesting that stabilizing selection may work well during periods of rapid, minor, environmental perturbations.    There were a number of global changes occurring within the late Maastrichtian pr and the results of size measurements of molluscs demonstrate a decrease in size prior to the K/Pg mass extinction in Texas likely in response to a number of global scale events occurring towards the close of the Cretaceous that was also associated with morphological evolution in the small bivalve  Breviarca webbervillensis. Paleocene material from Texas was dominated by smaller, newly evolved allochthonous grazing gastropods. These gastropods are thought to be newly evolved lineages as their first occurrence is marked in the Paleocene. Smaller sized nuculid bivalves were also a prominent feature in the Texas Paleocene and showed a rapid size beginning 40 cm above the boundary clay. At Braggs, Alabama, two groups, gastropods and oysters showed decreases in size across the boundary, and these changes are most likely a product of animpoverished Paleocene ecosystem. The pectinids were the only group of bivalve mollusc to reduce in size following extinction in Denmark most likely in response to a reduction in bryozoan substrate which resulted in a very soft coccolith-derived mud substrate in the mass extinction’s aftermath.    Size measurements from the Danish brachiopods showed reductions in size across the boundary in all genera except Rugia. There was a marked size reduction in specimens from the upper Maastrichtian at Stevns Klint as compared to the lower Maastrichtian at Mons Klint. The reasons for this are most likely due to lower temperatures at Stevns based on isotope data as well as lower productivity evidenced by lower δ13C values. There was a change in morphology for Terebratulina chrysalis  in the earliest Paleogene due to shifted selective pressures favoring increased surface area as an adaptation to softer substrates. Size reduction within Danish sequences is evolutionary in nature as the Danian is characterized by different species within existing Maastrichtian genera and two new genera.    The results of this study demonstrate that changes in body size can be a result of evolution from changing selective pressures as well as ecological perturbations. Distinguishing evolutionary forcings from ecological requires the collection and understanding of morphological data. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)

T1  - Population genetic structure and reproductive ecology of <i>Crocodylus</i> across local and regional scales
AN  - 1853072072
AB  - New world crocodilians constitute a monophyletic group comprising four species: Crocodylus rhombifer (Cuban crocodile),  Crocodylus acutus (American crocodile), Crocodylus intermedius  (Orinoco crocodile), and Crocodylus moreletii (Morelet’s crocodile). All of these are in the IUCN Red list of Threatened Species and exhibit geographic distributions covering small to widespread ranges across the Americas and insular Caribbean. With the overarching goal of generating relevant information for the conservation of endangered new world crocodilians, this dissertation integrates genetic and ecological information to provide a context spanning a scale from the species level to specific populations, to analyses of mating systems and breeding strategies in Crocodylus.  In addition, my research applies tools of ecological inference to model the influence of environmental factors and natural habitat disturbances in the reproductive success of Crocodylus using a long-term dataset. This work uses C. intermedius and C. acutus  as model species to explore four focal questions organized in distinct chapters related to the biology and ecology of crocodilians. In Chapter I, I compare previously reported reproductive traits among C. acutus  populations across its geographic range. This comparative analysis reveals a high degree of variability in reproductive traits across  C. acutus range and provides potential adaptive explanations for the patterns observed. Crocodylus acutus appears to be one of the most adaptable of crocodilians in terms of nesting requirements, total nests per breeding season, nest mode (hole vs. mound), timing of egg-laying, female minimum reproductive size, clutch size, female nest defence behavior, and female parental care. Besides regional comparisons, this chapter focuses on the largest nesting population of C. acutus located in southeastern Cuba, where the species still occurs at its natural population numbers.   In Chapter II, I use molecular tools to elucidate the mating system of the Orinoco crocodile in a reintroduced population in the Llanos of Venezuela. Analyzing 17 polymorphic microsatellite loci from 20 clutches I found multiple paternity in C. intermedius, with half of the clutches fathered by two or three males. Sixteen mothers and 14 fathers were inferred by reconstruction of multilocus parental genotypes. Results showed skewed paternal contributions to multiple-sired clutches in four of the clutches (40%), leading to an overall unequal contribution of offspring among fathers with six of the 14 inferred males fathering 90% of the total offspring, and three of those six males fathering more than 70% of the total offspring. Results of this chapter provide the first evidence of multiple paternity occurring in the Orinoco crocodile and confirm the success of reintroduction efforts of this critically endangered species in Venezuela.   In Chapter III, I apply generalized linear mixed models to infer the effect of tropical cyclones and environmental variability on the nesting success of C. acutus in the largest nesting population of the species in southeastern Cuba for a period of 21 years. Results of this chapter report the highest-density nesting for the species documented to date, and one of the highest densities of nesting in relation to other crocodilian species, with an average of 164 nests per year and a density of 17 nests per hectare. Two of the five analyzed nesting sites had consistently higher nests and higher nesting success for the whole 21-year period. Much of the temporal variation in nesting success could be explained by the occurrence of tropical cyclones. I found that occurrence of tropical cyclones within a nesting season negatively affected nesting success, whereas the occurrence of tropical cyclones one or two years before the nesting season positively affected nesting success. Additionally, results of this chapter suggest that higher ambient temperature negatively affected nesting success. Higher-intensity tropical cyclones are expected to strike the coasts of Cuba due to climate change, potentially devastating  C. acutus nests if they occur during the nesting season. As the recruitment of C. acutus populations in Cuba heavily rely on nesting success, we propose incorporating information on crocodilian’s nesting success and density, as well as the impact of tropical cyclones on the latter, as key components of coastal resilience when designing plans for coastal adaptation in the context of climate change.   In the last chapter, I employed data on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and 12 nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the degree of population structure of C. acutus between and among localities in South America, North America, Central America and the Greater Antilles. All analyses for both mtDNA and nuclear markers show evidence of strong population genetic structure in the American crocodile, with unique populations in each of the sampling localities. My research results reinforce previous findings showing the greatest degree of genetic differentiation between the continental  C. acutus and the Greater Antillean C. acutus. Three new haplotypes unique to Venezuela were reported. These were considerably less distant from Central and North American haplotypes than Greater Antillean haplotypes. Overall evidence of this chapter suggests that Cuban and Jamaican  C. acutus share a mtDNA haplotype but currently represent at least two different genetic populations when using nuclear, faster evolving, microsatellite markers. Findings of this chapter offer the first evidence of genetic differentiation among the populations of Greater Antillean C. acutus, the first ever reported haplotypes for the species in Venezuela, and provide important information for the regional planning and in-situ conservation of the species.    In conclusion, research findings of my dissertation are the product of combining ecological data collected in the field, genetic data generated in the lab, and the use of a suite of classic and inference-based methodological approaches to gain a better understanding of the behavior and evolution of crocodilians. The dissertation presents the first genetic research on  C. intermedius, shows the importance of coastal mangrove conservation for the persistence of C. acutus in Cuba, and depicts phylogeographic linkages among distinct C. acutus populations across the Americas and Greater Antilles. The outcomes of this research provide science-based information to influence decision-making processes for the conservation of threatened crocodilians and their habitats across the study areas.

T1  - Osmerozobi smrekov lubadar (<i>Ips typographus</i> (L.)) in z njim povezana subkortikalna entomofavna navadne smreke (<i> Picea abies</i> (L.) Karst.) v altimontanskem pasu Slovenije
AN  - 1850382537
AB  - Ips typographus (European spruce bark beetle) is economically and ecologically a very important species in European forests. As a tree parasite, it causes significant damage to spruce forests in Europe. From the ecological point of view, it is involved in the first step of the decomposition of a weakened or diseased spruce tree. Its development is influenced by abiotic factors, such as temperature, as well as biotic factors, e.g. bark thickness and particularly its predators and parasitoids. The survey was conducted in the altimontane elevation belt of Slovenia (Pohorje), where there are a lot of spruce forests, which is why the area is a potential target for mass attacks of I. typographus. In our study we tried to determine the effects of temperature on the colonization of a felled spruce tree and on the development time of I. typographus. We also analyzed the saproxylic community associated with the European spruce bark beetle. We tried to establish the parasitoid and predatory complex of the discussed species. We also examined the effects of altitude (temperature) and type of forest and the impact of sampling year on the abundance of bark beetles, their predators and parasitoids, as well as the diversity of the mentioned groups of insects. In addition, the effects of natural enemies on the population of I. typographus were assessed. Average daily temperatures of our research locations from mid-May to late August were between 13.1 and 15.5°C. Bark thickness of our samples was between 4 and 7 mm. We had established that the temperature of the microhabitat inhabited by I. typographus  differs from the air temperature in the proximity of the tree by as much as 3°C. Also, temperatures of microlocations on the same trunk were quite different because of their orientation and exposure to direct solar irradiation. The differences were as high as 2.3°C. The European spruce bark beetle prefers to colonize those parts of the trunk that have higher under-bark temperatures, and these were also the locations where the brood developed more rapidly. We found a positive correlation between temperatures and the number of adult specimens of I. typographus. The effective temperature sums needed for development of one generations were 661 degree days. The number of I. typographus adults decreased with increasing bark thickness, however, this was not statistically significant. In Kladje (1304 m altitude), I. typographus developed one generation in the year of our research. The time needed for development of this generation was between 60 and 86 days (73 days on average). In the three years of our research, we found 62 species that inhabit the spruce tree in the first year of colonization. We found 9 species of bark beetles, 12 species of parasitoids and 27 species of predators of bark beetles. The most abundant species was I. typographus with 5216 individuals. The predatory and parasitoid complex of this species was identified. The most important predatory species were Thanasimus formicarius (Coleoptera) (83 individuals) and species of Medetera (88 individuals) and Lonchaea (Diptera) (170 individuals). By far the most important parasitoid was Roptrocerus xylophagorum (Hymenoptera) with 1072 individuals. We found out that the number of predators and parasitoids increased in the second year of our study. In addition, we observed lower parasitoid diversity at highest altitudes and in a spruce monoculture.  I. typographus emerges from the bark at roughly the same time as its most common parasitoid R. xylophagorum, however, predators emerge with one-week delay. Predators and parasitoids had an important impact on population of I. typographus, as it decreased by 40% in the first year and by as much as 68% in the second year. The predators caused 50% of I. typographus’ mortality, while parasitoids only caused 12%.

T1  - The influence of climate change and evolution on mosquito life history traits and pathogen transmission
AN  - 1846950879
AB  - Many aspects of mosquito biology are highly sensitive to variation in temperature, which has led to predictions that climate change will alter the transmission of many vector-borne pathogens.  However, it is unknown how mosquitoes will evolve in response to changing climates.  We utilized common garden experiments and novel time-compressed climate change scenarios to examine standing geographic variation, species variation, and evolutionary change in the temperature dependence of four life history traits of mosquitoes (larval and adult survival, development rate, and biting rate).   First, we quantified spatial variation in life history traits for four populations of Culex pipiens mosquitoes, a primary vector of West Nile Virus in North America, to examine the extent to which mosquitoes might be adapted to local thermal environments.  We found substantial variation in life history traits among mosquito populations that was uncorrelated with local thermal conditions. This variation will shape the response of mosquito species to changing climates and will make the impact of climate change on vector-borne disease more variable and less predictable than previously thought.    Second, we quantified variation in life history traits and vectorial capacity for the two dominant mosquito vectors of Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.  Differences in life history traits were mixed with  Ae. albopictus having faster development, higher larval survival, and more frequent feeding, whereas Ae. aegypti had higher adult survival.  Ae. aegypti was a slightly more efficient vector of all four viruses, and vectorial capacity was highest for yellow fever virus followed by Zika, Chikungunya and dengue.   Lastly, we reared Ae. aegypti under three rates of temperature increase (+2°C, +4°C, and +5°C) and three control conditions (a 2°C decrease, and two temperature profiles with no net change) for one year to examine the potential evolutionary response to climate change.  Although there was significant among-treatment variation in four life history traits between the starting population and the six climate treatments, these differences were uncorrelated with the temperature regime the mosquitoes experienced, suggesting that the mosquitoes were adapting more to the increased variance in temperatures in the experiment than the differences in mean temperature.

T1  - Latitudinal variation of life history strategies in the burying beetle, <i>Nicrophorus orbicollis</i>
AN  - 1845337331
AB  - How organisms allocate resources to growth, reproduction, and body maintenance is expected to vary along latitudinal gradients. Two hypotheses explaining latitudinal variation are local adaptation and counter-gradient variation.  The local adaptation hypothesis proposes that populations do best in their source location and, as a result, do less well in other environments.  The counter gradient hypothesis proposes that one population out performs others across an environmental gradient because the first population’s source location has greater selective pressure than other locations. Temperature is one selective pressure that varies along latitudinal gradients, and life histories are expected to be sensitive to the variation. We test local adaptation and counter-gradient variation in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis. We looked at patterns of reproduction in populations from Wisconsin (high latitude), Indiana (medium latitude) and Oklahoma (low latitude).  Carcass preparation, reproductive success, and developmental timelines were quantified at temperatures representing typical environmental conditions of the breeding months for each population.  Along a latitudinal range  N. orbicollis, show variation in their ability to initiate reproduction, successfully   rear offspring, and the number of offspring they are able to raise on a carcass.  This variation suggest local adaptation in that, (1) beetles are less likely to initiate breeding at extreme temperatures, especially when that temperature is representative of ones experienced in their source range; (2) once beetles initiate reproduction, source populations produce relatively larger broods, and are more successful at source location temperature extremes.  This experiment shows that N. orbicollis is able to use temperature as a reliable environmental cue to determine whether or not reproduction should be initiated, providing unique insight into how behavior modification can be used to avoid costly reproductive attempts.  However, all other measurements of developmental timelines in our experiment (i.e. number of days to prepare a carcass, eggs laid, feeding hole, 1st instar arrival on carcass, and days developing on the carcass) were only affected by temperature.  This suggests a temperature tolerance constraint that may be shaping reproductive behavior and distribution.  This research gives unique insight into how  N. orbicollis cope with temperature conditions along latitudinal gradients by behaviorally avoiding costly reproductive attempts.

T1  - Reproductive and molecular ecology of the european lobster: implications for conservation management
AN  - 1837035094
AB  - The European lobster (Homarus gammarus) is an ecologically important benthic decapod which supports fisheries that are critical to the economic prosperity of coastal communities. However, populations across its range are pressured by rising exploitation, from which management has failed to prevent stock collapses in the recent past. Fisheries management of the species is significantly hindered by deficiencies in our knowledge of fundamental characteristics of population biology, including the connectivity and genetic diversity of stocks. As a result, the effectiveness of strategies designed to conserve recruitment and ensure harvests are sustainable is poorly understood. This thesis focuses on elucidating aspects of reproductive and molecular ecology in H. gammarus which can be used to inform and appraise conservation management initiatives, currently applied via both the regulation of capture and the wild release of hatchery-reared juveniles. The size-specific fecundity of reproducing females was defined around southwestern UK, and spatial variation in clutch size between populations was linked to a longitudinal gradient in oceanic temperature range across Northern Europe. The reconstruction of paternal genotypes show that single males fertilise individual clutches, which hints at demographic stability within a productive Atlantic fishery. Population genetic structure, investigated at a fine spatial scale in the same region, evidenced high connectivity and suggests that the localised interventions of an active hatchery do not lead to juveniles being released beyond areas they might naturally recruit via planktonic dispersal. However, genetic differentiation and isolation-by-distance at a broad geographic scale indicate that direct gene flow between remote populations is limited, so that (i) a failure to maintain spawning stock biomass may negatively affect local recruitment, (ii) the utilisation of non-resident broodstock for hatchery stocking may cause a loss of adaptive potential, and (iii) the recovery of depleted stocks is likely to be problematic. Finally, simulations indicated that genetic parentage assignment will prove accurate in distinguishing cultured individuals from natural stock among admixed populations in the wild, an important development that should facilitate the optimisation of hatchery stocking and lead to rigorous assessments of the conservation value of releasing lobsters reared in captivity.

T1  - Physiological and Ecological Impacts of Changing Environmental Temperatures on Bees
AN  - 1836098609
AB  - In this dissertation, I investigated the mechanistic basis for the effects of changing temperatures on bees. Physiological impacts of changing temperatures on bees were assessed by investigating the levels of energy stores and the composition of lipids and the ecological impacts were assessed by studying the role of temperatures in determining bee-parasite interactions. I developed and validated an optimized protocol for extraction and quantification of three major energy substrates (lipids, sugars and glycogen) for application with bees. The fraction of total energy contributed by lipids, sugars and glycogen varied with body size and across altitude for bumblebees but was invariant for honey bees. Prevalence and loads of Nosema cerana, the only parasite detected in bumblebees, was reduced at high altitudes relative to low altitudes. No parasites were detected in honey bees with the exception of one sample, which likely had Crithidia spp. (to be confirmed through sequencing of the PCR product). Gas-liquid chromatography analysis of fatty acid composition revealed significant differences among bee genera that differed in thermal physiology and feeding behavior. Organisms take advantage of a diversity in lipid types to alter membrane lipid composition thereby maintaining membrane fluidity, and thus membrane functionality across a wide range of temperatures, as proposed by the homeoviscous adaptation (HVA) hypothesis (Sinensky 1974). Bees collected across altitudes and the growing season had changes in lipid composition as would be predicted by the HVA hypothesis, likely in response to colder temperatures at higher altitudes and early in spring and warmer temperatures at low altitudes and later in the summer. These variations in lipid composition (in particular, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, UFA:SFA and the unsaturation index) may arise from variation in the lipid composition of the pollen, the primary food source, or may be a direct physiological response to the temperatures bees experience. I therefore assessed the effects of acclimation to three temperature cycles for four days on lipid composition of bees. I found no change in unsaturation index for these temperature-treated bees but body size was a covariate, which determined the effects of acclimated temperatures on UFA:SFA.   Future studies should go further deeper and assess the quantities of energy in different body compartments as decrease in one substrate in a given part may be contrasted by an increase in quantity of the same substrate in another part. Further, investigation on the effects of temperatures in energy levels and bee-parasite interaction should be conducted at molecular levels with increased sample size. In regards to the fatty acid composition, assessing fatty acid composition in different body parts and using techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to determine actual fluidity of the membranes will provide better insights into the topic. Last but not the least, assessment of acclimation effects on fatty acid composition needs to be rigorously and clearly done over a longer-time period, particularly over generations to get a better understanding into how acclimation to varying temperatures at different time periods affects the fatty acid composition in organisms.

T1  - Genotypic and Phenotypic Dynamics of Adaptation in Experimentally Evolved <i>Escherichia coli</i>
AN  - 1832307839
AB  - Despite its centrality to Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, the process of adaptation is still not fully understood. In particular, the dynamics of the genotypes and phenotypes associated with an adaptive response remain to be fully elucidated. In my dissertation, I utilized laboratory evolution experiments to study how the genotypes and phenotypes of Escherichia coli change over time as they adapted to high temperature.   Chapter 1 explored how metabolic phenotypes of 115 evolved E. coli clones changed as a result of 2,000 generations of adaptation to 42.2°C. Using phenotypic microarrays (Biolog plates), I quantified 94 phenotypes of these evolved clones, as well as their ancestor under stressed (42.2°C) and unstressed (37.0°C) conditions. Comparing the evolved phenotypes to the ancestral phenotypes revealed that adaptation was predominantly restorative, shifting evolved phenotypes from the stress state toward the unstressed state. I also uncovered associations among common genotypic changes found in the evolved clones and their phenotypes.   Chapter 2 investigated the different mutational dynamics in populations traversing two different adaptive pathways typified by mutations in the  rpoB and rho genes, respectively. These genes were predicted to be differentially pleiotropic, and were therefore expected to create differences in compensatory evolution when mutated. I used temporal sequencing data of four rpoB and four rho populations to reconstruct their mutational trajectories over the course of adaptation to 42.2°C. These trajectories revealed that rpoB and rho mutations occurred early on during adaptation, canalizing the adaptive process. Furthermore, rpoB populations accumulated more mutations and experienced more clonal interference over the course of adaptation than rho populations.    Chapter 3 was a study of the Lazarus effect, a phenomenon of population recovery under lethal selection conditions. I evolved ∼300 E. coli populations to the lethal temperature of 43.0°C and measured their cell density over five days. I sequenced those populations that recovered and found mutations in two operons—hslUV and  rpoBC—to be the major drivers of Lazarus events. These mutations differed in their frequency in the experiment, degree of parallelism within and between weeks, and fitness tradeoffs at 37.0°C, suggesting different origins and adaptive dynamics between them.

T1  - Automation, Optimization, and Characterization of Adaptive Laboratory Evolution
AN  - 1828374169
AB  - Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) has emerged as an effective tool for scientific discovery and addressing biotechnological needs. A typical ALE experiment requires significant attention over the course of the experiment and can last up to months. When designing such experiments much consideration is given to the logistics of maintaining the experiment. Due to the difficult logistics, the consistency and throughput are often reduced. Overcoming these shortcoming is now possible with an automated platform. The automated platform was designed and built giving consideration to alleviating the design constraint that the time-sensitive processes impose on the experiment.    Much of ALE’s utility is derived from reproducibly obtained fitness increases. Identifying causal genetic changes and their combinatorial effects is challenging and time-consuming. Understanding how these genetic changes enable increased fitness can be difficult. A series of approaches that address these challenges was developed and demonstrated using Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 on glucose minimal media at 37ºC. By keeping E. coli in constant substrate-excess and exponential growth, fitness increases up to 1.6-fold were obtained over wild-type. These increases are comparable to previously-reported maximum growth rates in similar conditions but obtained over a shorter time frame. Across the 8 replicate ALE experiments performed, causal mutations were identified using three approaches: identifying mutations in the same gene/region across replicate experiments, sequencing strains before and after computationally-determined fitness jumps, and allelic replacement coupled with targeted ALE of reconstructed strains. Three genetic regions were most often mutated: the global transcription gene rpoB, an 82bp deletion between the metabolic pyrE gene and rph, and an IS element between the DNA structural gene hns and  tdk. Model-derived classification of gene expression revealed a number of processes important for increased growth that were missed using a gene classification system alone. The methods put forth here represent a powerful combination of technologies to increase the speed and efficiency of ALE studies. The identified mutations can be examined as genetic parts for increasing growth rate in a desired strain and for understanding rapid growth phenotypes.   The evolution process is increasingly being leveraged in laboratory settings for industrial and basic science applications. Despite an increasing deployment, there are no standardized procedures available for designing and performing adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments. Thus, there is a need to optimize the experimental design, specifically for determining termination criteria and for balancing outcomes with available resources (i.e., lab supplies, personnel, and time). To design and better understand ALE experiments, a simulator, ALEsim, was developed, validated, and applied to optimize ALE experimentation. The effects of various passage sizes were experimentally determined and subsequently evaluated with ALEsim to explain differences in experimental outcomes. Further, a beneficial mutation rate of 10-6.9-10-8.4 mutations per cell division was derived. A retrospective analysis of ALE experiments revealed that passage sizes typically employed in batch culture ALE experiments led to inefficient production and fixation of beneficial mutations. ALEsim and the results herein will aid in the design of ALE experiments to fit the exact needs of the project while taking into account the tradeoff in resources required, and lower the barrier of entry to this experimental technique.   With successful completion of an automated ALE platform and multiple applied cases, there became a need to expand the ALE protocol for variations of ALE. Specifically to accommodate adaptation to environments that cannot initially sustain growth. Two algorithms were developed to implement two variations of ALE, pathway activation of latent enzymes (PALE ALE) and tolerization (TALE). The purpose of the PALE ALE protocol was to adapt and organism to growth using a substrate is it natively is unable to utilize. An algorithm was developed to put significant selection pressure on the population to adapt all while maximizing the amount of genetic diversity being created. The purpose of the TALE module is to adapt an organism to an increasing amount of stress (e.g. temperature, physical, chemical, etc…). The algorithm specifically targeted putting enough stress on the culture as reasonable but also ensuring that the culture is still able to grow. This is critical since if growth is arrested the genetic diversity in the culture drops off significantly. These two algorithms were successfully implemented into the automated ALE platform.

A critical component of leishmanial metabolic machinery is the central carbon metabolism which encompasses a major fraction of metabolites and constitutively expressed enzymes whose localization, function, and manner of regulation in response to changes in nutrient levels in the different host niches, however, remain unclear. In a quest to elucidate how the Leishmania parasites overcome conditions with diminished levels of the primary nutrient D-glucose, a null-mutant cell line that was deprived of the ability to acquire the hexose by genetic ablation of three related glucose transporters was created. As previously shown, the glucose transport deficiency in the null-mutant Leishmania mexicana (Δlmgt) is associated with reduced growth of the promastigote form in an axenic culture and the sand fly vector, no detectable utilization of the sugars D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, D-galactose, and D-ribose, reduced biosynthesis of sugar-containing glycoconjugates and virulence factors, increased sensitivity to nutrient starvation, elevated temperatures, and oxidative stress, and dramatically reduced levels of growth and parasitemia of the amastigote form in an axenic culture and macrophages. Considering all phenotypic characteristics observed previously, the main aims of this study were to determine whether the Δlmgt promastigotes use alternative carbon and energy sources, to investigate which pathways are altered as a result of possible utilization of alternative carbon sources, and to illustrate, as comprehensively as possible, the molecular events behind the changes in the central carbon metabolism in the Δlmgt promastigotes. For that purpose, a number of proteomic and metabolomic techniques were applied to identify and quantify modulations in protein and metabolite abundance in the Δlmgt promastigotes. The results revealed that the main energy and carbon sources for the Δlmgt promastigotes appear to be amino acids, with the tricarboxylic acid cycle playing a central role in amino acid catabolism. Furthermore, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, mannose metabolism, purine salvage pathway, and β-oxidation of fatty acids were also among the pathways affected by the glucose transporter incapacity of the Δlmgt promastigotes. Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis was shown to operate in a gluconeogenic mode and to be used for the synthesis of hexose phosphates. The oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutathione metabolism were found to be down-regulated in the Δlmgt promastigotes, which is believed to be the main reason behind the increased sensitivity of these parasites to oxidative stress. Mannose metabolism, which provides activated substrates for the synthesis of the variety of leishmanial secreted and membrane-bound glycoconjugates and the carbohydrate reserve material and virulence factor mannogen, was also down-regulated and that finding corroborated with the previous observation of reduced glycoconjugate and mannogen synthesis in the Δlmgt promastigotes. Pyrimidine metabolism was not significantly modulated but the purine salvage pathway was down-regulated in the Δlmgt promastigotes. Nonetheless, the Δlmgt promastigotes appear to salvage ribose from nucleotide degradation and recycle it for the synthesis of new nucleotides. β-Oxidation of fatty acids was also decreased in the Δlmgt promastigotes, suggesting that lipids are not a major source of energy for these cells. Altogether, the data showed that the Δlmgt promastigotes i/ decrease high energy-consuming processes such as DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, ii/ rely heavily on amino acid catabolism via the tricarboxylic acid cycle for energy generation, iii/ use alternative carbon sources for the production of biosynthetic precursors, iv/ have reduced capabilities to synthesize key metabolites such as sugar phosphates and sugar-containing macromolecules, and v/ are characterised with impaired regeneration of the antioxidant defence system and decreased production of virulence factors which appear to determine the susceptibility of these organisms to oxidative stress.

T1  - How Salamander Species Can Hybridize Extensively Yet Remain Distinct: Insights from Habitat Data, Molecules, and Behavior
AN  - 1817645690
AB  - This project explores a situation where two distinctive species hybridize extensively at zones of contact yet appear not to be collapsing into a single species. Lack of impending merger is inferred when regions made up of organisms of mixed ancestry (‘hybrid zones’) are not increasing in extent but instead are stable. There is growing recognition that this phenomenon is common nature. Several forces have been proposed to function in preventing lineage merger in these situations. Selection for different ecological conditions (‘exogenous selection’) is widely acknowledged to maintain species limits, especially when the contacting lineages are associated with different habitats. Genome incompatibilities (when hybridization leads to the breakdown of co-adapted gene complexes, or ‘endogenous selection’) have also been cited as contributing to hybrid zone stability. Positive assortative mating, where individuals preferentially mate with similar individuals, has also been put forward as a process that could prevent the merger of species.    Two species of lungless salamanders, Plethodon shermani and P. teyahalee, have parapatric distributions in the southern Appalachian Mountains and form hybrid zones where their distributions meet. I investigated hybrid zone stability and potential factors maintaining species limits between these salamanders. In Chapter 1, I use coalescent simulations to identify a lower bound on the timing of secondary contact, which in turn leads to an expected hybrid zone extent under a model of neutral diffusion. By comparing observed and expected hybrid zone extent, I show that the two species are not in the process of freely merging despite extensive introgression of molecular markers. In Chapter 2, I evaluate predictions of ex- and endogenous selection using ground-level temperature data and character clines fitted to molecular and morphological data. I find evidence for exogenous selection but not for endogenous selection. In Chapter 3 I present data from courtship trials performed in the laboratory that reveal that despite frequent interspecific hybridization, these two species show a preference for conspecifics. These findings shed light on Plethodon hybrid zone dynamics and the maintenance of species limits for hybridizing species.

T1  - Climate, embryonic development, and potential for adaptation to warming water temperatures by Bristol Bay sockeye salmon
AN  - 1816205444
AB  - Rapidly warming water temperatures associated with climate change represent a substantial disturbance to the habitat of aquatic ectothermic organisms. For salmonid fishes (family Salmonidae), early life history survival and timing of reproduction and development are closely tied to temperature, such that altered thermal regimes could alter patterns of survival or shift phenology into a mismatch with the environment. Because temperature is the dominant driver of developmental rates, empirical statistical models have been developed to predict the timing of hatching and fry emergence based on incubation temperature. In this thesis I explored how the timing of hatching and emergence may shift in response to warming temperatures and how spawning timing across an Alaskan landscape is shaped by incubation temperatures experienced by sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) embryos and alevin. Additionally, I quantified the relative roles of genetics and environmentally induced plasticity on the timing of hatching in two populations of sockeye salmon from the Iliamna Lake system, Alaska by rearing them in common garden conditions in the laboratory. To meet these goals I reformulated a widely cited developmental model to incorporate variability in natural regimes and use it to predict hatching timing over the course of the spawning duration for 25 populations of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon. Additionally, I hind- and forecasted lake temperature based off historical and predicted air temperatures to estimate and predict hatching for a single population. I found that predicted hatching timing for wild populations varied between 58 and 260 days, and was largely variable as a result of habitat thermal heterogeneity and parental spawn time. I also predicted a three-week decrease in hatching timing over the course of the next century for a single beach spawning population, which was just beyond historic variability. Counter to expectations, for a subset of populations hatching and emergence timing variability exceeded that of spawning timing, indicating the relationship between spawning timing and incubation temperature may be weaker than expected. The results of the common garden experiment revealed indistinguishable differences between populations in hatching timing across five temperature scenarios, but strong plasticity as timing differed between 74 and 189 days in the warmest to coolest treatment. Furthermore, I detected family-specific differences in hatching timing both within and among treatments, consistent with heritable developmental rates and gene by environment interactions in days to hatch, where the interaction between treatment and family was as high as 10 days difference in hatching. Population or family-specific survival in this experiment did not differ in response to temperature suggesting a lack of thermal adaptation in this regard during this life stage in these populations. Alevin mass and length upon hatching varied little among treatments (<10%), but did significantly decrease with cooling temperatures. Taken as a whole this study indicates that the effects of climate change during the early life history stages may be buffered by phenotypic plasticity and variability in populations and habitats will be important for maintaining diversity in the face of climate change.

T1  - A Qualitative Analysis of the Drivers of Employee Disengagement across Four Generations of U.S. Employees
AN  - 1815535797
AB  - Employee disengagement is an emerging phenomenon in the workplace, and is defined as the absence of engagement.  This generic qualitative study explored the drivers of employee disengagement and whether or not the drivers are the same across the four generations of workers in the United States workforce.  It is estimated that 70 % of American employees are disengaged resulting in lost productivity totaling approximately $450 to $550 billion.  The study explored the drivers of employee disengagement and was conducted through semi-structured interviews of randomly selected workers from each generation residing in the tri-county region of Southern Florida.  The participants were employed in sectors such as Education, Healthcare, Accounting, Information Technology, Hospitality, Sales, Animal Services, Office Clerical, Retail, Library Services and Construction.  The results of the study indicate six emergent themes (1) respect and recognition from management (2) communication between management and employees (3) quality of leadership (4) confidence in management and the delivery of rewards (5) the physical surroundings and the work itself and (6) technology.  The results led to the conclusion that three of the six themes were drivers of disengagement.  Employees tended to disengage when there was a lack of respect and recognition; when communication was inadequate or missing and when the quality of leadership was weak.  Recommendations are for continuous training for managers on the value of showing respect and recognition to their employees; regular meetings should be mandated to improve communication and HRM practitioners should devise a way to quickly enhance or replace any signs of weak leadership within the organization.  Implementation of these measures it is believed would effectively reduce disengagement among workers.  It is also recommended that additional research be conducted from a quantitative approach using a larger sample to establish the validity of the factors as indeed drivers of disengagement.  Future research may also be able to provide valuable information for HRM policy makers as they continue to work towards reducing the impact of employee disengagement in the United States.

T1  - Anthropogenic Impacts on Native Olympia Oysters: Understanding the Roles of Local Adaptation and Multiple Stressors
AN  - 1796044337
AB  - The effects of anthropogenic global change on organismal performance and ecosystem functioning have been investigated across many systems. However, our ability to project future effects is limited by many uncertainties. For example, there is a pressing need to understand how multiple stressors interact and how populations of the same species vary in their response to environmental stress. This dissertation assesses impacts of anthropogenic stressors on the native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), a foundation species of conservation concern in west coast estuaries. In particular, I tested whether populations of Olympia oysters are differentially susceptible to low salinity and predation pressure from invasive species and whether the timing of multiple climate-related stressors affects oyster survival. First, using oysters raised under common laboratory conditions for up to two generations, I assessed whether populations of Olympia oysters are locally adapted to their home sites and whether such adaptive differentiation leads to some oyster populations that are more tolerant than others of extreme low salinity. Field experiments revealed results that were consistent with local adaptation and laboratory experiments demonstrated that second-generation oysters from the site that experienced low salinity most frequently were more robust in the face of extreme low salinity events than oysters from other sites. These results suggest that environmental conditions may select for robust phenotypes in certain regions. Second, I tested whether Olympia oysters could detect and respond to invasive predator cues and whether the response varied among populations based on their evolutionary histories with the predators. All oyster populations detected waterborne predator cues and responded with antipredator morphological changes. However, the magnitude of the response differed among populations with laboratory-reared, second-generation oysters originating from the site with the highest predator density exhibiting the greatest response. The evidence suggests that some oyster populations may have undergone rapid evolution of cue sensitivity in the face of an invasive predator. Lastly, I examined the effects of multiple stressors (low salinity and high air temperature) and different amounts of time between stressors on Olympia oyster survival. When applied coincidentally, these stressors resulted in synergistic effects, with oysters exhibiting higher mortality than expected based on adding single stressor effects. However, when stressors were decoupled by two or four weeks, the synergistic effects were eliminated, suggesting that the temporal patterns of stressors in nature may have profound effects for the vulnerability of organisms. Collectively, my dissertation chapters further our understanding of factors that mediate the response of coastal marine organisms to stress. In particular, the fact that populations of the same species may respond differently to stress is critical in predicting anthropogenic impacts and managing species of concern. Additionally, an understanding of temporal patterning of multiple stressors will likely improve projections regarding how organisms and ecosystems will fare in a rapidly changing world.

T1  - Exercise, Emotion, and Executive Control
AN  - 1795088444
AB  - Both acute and habitual exercise are consistently associated with a number of benefits to physical and mental health, including cardiovascular function, body weight, mood, and cognition. For instance, habitual exercise improves mood, such as depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorders, and acute exercise elevates emotion during and after exercise, particularly in physically fit individuals. Both habitual and acute exercise may also influence domain general cognitive control, such as response inhibition and selective attention, and domain specific cognitive control, such as the cognitive control of emotion. The present series of three experiments evaluated how both habitual and acute exercise relate to mood, emotion, domain general cognitive control, and the cognitive control of emotion, specifically cognitive reappraisal success. The first experiment employed a cross-sectional design and found that habitual exercise predicted lower depression and anxiety and enhanced domain general cognitive control and cognitive reappraisal success. The second experiment utilized near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to track time-dependent changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2 Hb and dHb) levels in the PFC as a function of parametrically manipulated target exercise intensity during relatively short bouts of acute exercise, i.e. 30 minutes cycling. NIRS is an ideal method to measure changes in O 2Hb and dHb levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to better understand the locus of exercise-related changes in emotion and cognitive processes. O2Hb and dHb levels in the PFC, as well as positive emotion, increased as a function of both exercise intensity and duration. The third experiment elongated the exercise duration to a 90 minute run, and found that such endurance exercise elevated positive emotion. The run reduced PFC oxygenation, but did not influence domain general cognitive control or the cognitive control of emotion. In sum, the present experiments suggest that habitual exercise predicts enhanced mood, cognitive control, and the cognitive control of emotion, and whereas acute exercise appears to enhance emotion regardless of the duration, future research is necessary to pinpoint the intensity at which exercise influences domain general cognitive control and the cognitive control of emotion.

T1  - Environmental, biological, and genetic factors influencing local adaptation of Pink Salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</i>) in Auke Creek, Alaska
AN  - 1789908733
AB  - Pacific salmon form distinct, locally adapted populations because of the spatial and temporal precision with which they home to their natal streams. Local adaptation is recognized as an important component underlying the productivity and sustainability of salmonid populations, yet there remains uncertainty of the scale at which it occurs. This uncertainty was addressed by analysis of demographic, genetic, and experimental data collected from seasonally structured brood lines of Pink Salmon that spawn in Auke Creek, Alaska. An extensive background of research on this system has indicated that the timing of the adult and juvenile migrations is closely aligned with fitness and productivity in this stream; this background provided a framework for synthesizing the results of the analyses to address these questions: (1) What ecological factors influence productivity of the freshwater and marine life history stages; (2) Do these factors suggest a mechanism for evolution of migration time; (3) What are the consequences of disrupting fine-scale local adaptation of migration time? Freshwater productivity appeared to be influenced primarily by competition for spawning habitat, rather than variability in environmental conditions. Marine productivity, conversely, was associated with physical processes that influence survival of juveniles in the nearshore environment. Consistent with these findings, genetic evolution of earlier migration time, which was observed in both adults and juveniles over two generations, appeared to be driven by earlier vernal warming of the nearshore environment. Despite these environmental changes and resulting selection against late-migrating fish, recruitment to Auke Creek has remained stable, thereby indicating that seasonal structure of migration time has supported sustained productivity in a changing climate. Experimental relaxation of natural barriers to gene flow that maintain the seasonal structure resulted in intermediate adult migration times in two generations of hybrid fish. These patterns were consistent with an additive genetic basis for migration time and suggest that ecological outbreeding depression is a post-zygotic mechanism that maintains adaptive variation of migration time in Auke Creek. Collectively, these results provide evidence that fine-scale local adaptation can enhance productivity of salmonid populations while providing resilience to climate change.

T1  - The influence of abiotic and biotic environmental factors at high elevation on the life cycle of a facultatively paedomorphic salamander
AN  - 1785854462
AB  - Environmentally cued polymorphisms are excellent models for studying the origins of phenotypic plasticity. Facultative paedomorphosis in salamanders is a form of discrete phenotypic plasticity in which aquatic larvae respond to environmental cues by either metamorphosing into a terrestrial subadult (complex life cycle) or maturing as a paedomorph in the aquatic larval body form (simple life cycle). There are two proposed selective mechanisms for the maintenance of paedomorphosis in salamanders: (1) “paedomorph advantage” (PA), in which a favorable aquatic habitat offers greater fitness to larger individuals than the terrestrial habitat and smaller individuals metamorphose to escape competition and (2) “best of a bad lot” (BBL), in which small individuals maximize fitness in a growth-limiting environment by forgoing metamorphosis thereby allowing reproduction during the first breeding season and large individuals metamorphose to escape the suboptimal aquatic habitat. In this study, I examined the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the life cycles of a facultatively paedomorphic salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum, at the highest elevation within its range in the southern Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina. This species has been studied extensively at low elevations, but the selective factors of the environment may be different at high elevations. This study consisted of three parts: (1) field surveys to characterize the breeding phenology and population structure, (2) a mesocosm experiment manipulating temperature to determine the selective mechanism of facultative paedomorphosis in these populations, and (3) aggression trials between metamorphic A. talpoideum and a fully terrestrial salamander endemic to this region to explore the potential for competitive exclusion of metamorphic A. talpoideum in the terrestrial environment. Field surveys revealed that these high-elevation populations are majority paedomorphic, and paedomorphs can breed after metamorphs have left the wetland. While temperature did not have an effect on the final body size of larvae in the mesocosm experiment, density did. No individuals metamorphosed before the first breeding season, but some metamorphosed the following spring. Individuals that grew to a larger body size were more likely to metamorphose, which supports the BBL selective mechanism for facultative paedomorphosis in these populations. Aggression trials found low levels of aggression between metamorphic A. talpoideum and the fully terrestrial salamander,  Plethodon shermani. This might be because these two species inhabit different spatial niches as they use burrows at different depths. This study suggests that facultative paedomorphosis can have different adaptive mechanisms under a different regime of environmental conditions.

T1  - The mechanisms and consequences of phenological evolution
AN  - 1767456722
AB  - Phenological shifts are clearly biologically important as they contribute to both ecological speciation and persistence during global warming. However, the genetic and physiological mechanisms behind shifts remain unclear. This is due to complicated genetic and genomic bases, as well as the cryptic nature of the phenotype. The consequences of phenological shifts also remain largely unexplored. We expect that a novel temporal habitat will have a different thermal profile than the ancestral habitat due to seasonal thermal variation. Therefore, for successful phenological shifts we predict correlated evolution in thermal tolerance. My dissertation investigates both the mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of phenological shifts, and adds to a growing body of literature on these topics.    I first investigate the physiological mechanism underlying evolution in life-history timing of corn borers. Using metabolic trajectories, I find that variation in the length of the diapause termination phase underlies an ~30-day shift observed in seasonal timing between E and Z-strains. While the E-strain exits diapause within 7 days, the Z-strain remains in diapause termination for ∼30 more days.    These metabolic trajectories are further used to target days for whole transcriptome profiling to nominate molecular mechanisms for the shift in timing. I nominate 48 candidate genes within the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for seasonal timing, and find that shorter E-strain termination is defined by a burst of genome-wide transcriptional activity involved in cell cycling, the stress response, and hormone production.    I next interrogate the genomic architecture surrounding the QTL for differences in seasonal timing. I investigate if a chromosomal inversion could be present near the QTL for timing as previous studies found evidence of a large region of suppressed recombination in this region. Our results confirm that there is evidence for a large-scale rearrangement covering at least 20% of the Z (sex) chromosome that harbors the basis for seasonal timing differences.    A final study looks at the consequences for evolved differences in seasonal timing between corn borer strains. As shifts in phenology displace populations across a season, they also expose populations to novel thermal environments. I find that earlier-emergence from winter diapause is correlated with enhanced cold-tolerance.

T1  - An evaluation of spatio-temporal changes in the population genomics of a butterfly hybrid zone over a thirty year period of climatic change
AN  - 1738861183
AB  - As a result of human activities, changes in global climatic patterns are predicted to dramatically alter contemporary geographic patterns of biological and genetic diversity. However, due to the complexity of biological communities, accurate predictions of species responses will depend on our understanding of the factors influencing these responses. Evolution (adaptation) and species interactions are both factors that have the capacity to mitigate and exacerbate organism’s responses to climate change. Unfortunately our understanding of these factors is still poorly understood. Here, I take advantage of a historically sampled and ecologically well studied butterfly hybrid zone to explore how historical changes in climate have influenced the genetic composition of this hybrid zone across space and through time. Specifically, by combining molecular (genetics and genomics) and simulation modeling approaches I explore how spatio-temporal changes in climate have influenced the geographic and genomic landscape of divergence between these hybridizing species.   First, I characterized the extent of divergence across the hybridizing genomes of P. glaucus and P. canadensis and explored how this divergence varied geographically and with climatic and ecological factors. I found evidence of climate maintaining genome-wide patterns of divergence, particularly on the Z chromosome where divergence was greatest. Next, I determined that the hybrid zone, based on a genome-wide set of genetic and a morphological trait, has shifted northward, coinciding with a lengthening growing season from 1980-2012. Using simulation modelling I discovered that spatio-temporal changes in climate during this period of warming has led to differential phenological responses that were dependent on genetic background. Further, I found that climate-mediated changes in voltinism may be leading to different reproductive phenological pathways that can have a dramatic influence on geneflow across the hybrid zone. Last as part of a working group I researched the capacity of citizen science to inform natural resource management and policy. In short, we found that citizen science has already affected natural resource management and policy in positive and measurable ways and that there is enormous potential for public participation to continue to improve the efficacy of scientific research.

AB  - In this dissertation, the aim was to evaluate and compare the performance of biodegradable mulch relatively to conventional polyethylene. For this purpose three different “mulches” were tested: polyethylene (PE) and two biodegradable "Short Cycle" (SC) and "Salads" (S) developed from the Mater-Bi™ matrix.Escarole (Cichorium endivia L. )crop cycle was monitored along the experimental study implemented at real scale.The monitoring plan was developed to evaluate the crop productivity and the impact of the different “mulches” in terms of moisture and soil temperature.The results achieved during this study showed the adaptability of biodegradable plastics to the soil and weather conditions, checking a significant difference in productivity of plants covered with plastic S relative to the other two modes (PE and SC)Given that to date there is no biodegradation studies in the Alentejo region of Portugal soils, it was also important to check the level of biodegradability of these new plastic films following the norm DIN EN ISO 17556.The results obtained in this work can be concluded that biodegradable plastics seem like a good solution to replace the PE, yet research and development of these new plastics should continue to hold

T1  - Regulation and Natural Functions of Lipopeptide Biosynthesis in <em>Pseudomonas</em>
AN  - 2522175507
AB  - Lipopeptides (LPs) are surface-active, antimicrobial compounds composed of a lipid moiety linked to a short linear or cyclic oligopeptide. In bacteria, LPs are synthesized by large nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) via a thiotemplate process. Compared to the understanding of LP biosynthesis, little is known about the genetic regulation. The aims of this PhD thesis were to identify new regulatory genes of LP biosynthesis and to unravel the natural functions of LPs in plant-associated Pseudomonas species. Using a combination of various ‘omics’-based technologies, we identified two small RNAs, designated RsmY and RsmZ, that, together with the repressor proteins RsmA and RsmE, regulate the biosynthesis of the LP massetolide in the rhizosphere bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SS101. Four other regulatory genes (phgdh, dnaK, prtR and clpA) of massetolide biosynthesis were identified via random mutagenesis. Mutations in each of these four genes caused a deficiency in massetolide production, swarming motility and biofilm formation, two natural functions associated with the production of LPs in Pseudomonas. Results further indicated that the ClpAP protease complex regulates massetolide biosynthesis via the pathway-specific, LuxR-type regulator MassAR, the heat shock proteins DnaK and DnaJ, and proteins of the TCA cycle.
LPs exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and have diverse natural functions for the producing bacteria. LPs of P. fluorescens were shown to play an important role in defense against protozoan predation. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that 55 and 73 genes were up- and down-regulated respectively in P. fluorescens strain SS101 upon grazing by the protozoan predator Naeglaria americana. The up-regulated genes included the LP biosynthesis genes massABC, but also genes involved in alkane degradation and in putrescine catalysis. Putrescine induced encystment of the protozoa, possibly providing a second line of defense against predation. MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) and live colony NanoDesi mass spectrometry further revealed, in real time, site-specific LP production at the interface of Pseudomonas-protozoa interactions. When the closely related strain P. fluorescens SBW25 was exposed to N. americana, similar overall transcriptional and metabolic responses were observed as found for strain SS101, but also strain-specific responses were apparent. These results indicate that closely related bacterial strains exhibit common and unique transcriptomic and metabolic responses to protozoan predation. Next to defense against competitors and predators, LPs are well-known for their role in swarming motility, a flagella-driven multicellular behavior of bacteria. Orfamide-deficient mutants of P. protegens Pf-5, either with deletions in the biosynthesis gene ofaA or in the regulatory gene gacA, cannot swarm on their own but ‘hitch-hike’ with parental strain Pf-5. However, distinctly different spatial distributions in co-swarming colonies were observed for these two mutants, with the ofaA mutant moving behind the wild type and the gacA mutant predominating on the edge of the swarming colony. Subsequent experimental evolution assays showed that repeated swarming cycles of strain Pf-5 drives parallel evolution toward fixation of spontaneous gacS/gacA mutants on the edge, ultimately causing colony collapse. Transcriptome analyses revealed that genes associated with resource acquisition, motility, chemotaxis and efflux were significantly upregulated in these regulatory mutants. Moreover, microscopic analysis showed that gacA mutant cells were longer and more flagellated than wild type and ofaA mutant cells, which may explain their predominance on the edge of co-swarming colonies. Collectively, these results indicated that adaptive convergent evolution through point mutations is a common feature of range-expanding microbial populations and that the putative fitness benefits of these spontaneous mutations during dispersal of bacteria into new territories are frequency-dependent.Alternate abstract:Cyclische lipopeptiden (LPs) zijn oppervlakte-aktieve en antibiotische metabolieten die zijn opgebouwd uit een vetzuur gekoppeld aan een kort lineair of cyclisch oligopeptide. In bacteriën worden LPs gesynthetiseerd door nonribosomale peptide synthetases (NRPS). Ondanks dat de biosynthese van LPs al uitvoerig is onderzocht en beschreven is er nog relatief weinig bekend over hoe de biosynthese van LPs gereguleerd wordt. Het doel van dit proefschrift was om genen betrokken bij de regulatie van LP biosynthese te identificeren en om de natuurlijke functies van LPs geproduceerd door plant-geassocieerde Pseudomonas bacteriën te ontrafelen. Door de combinatie van verschillende ‘omics’-gebaseerde technieken hebben wij twee RNAs, genaamd RsmY en RsmZ, geïdentificeerd die samen met de repressor eiwitten RsmA en RsmE de biosynthese van massetolide reguleren, een LP geproduceerd door de rhizosfeerbacterie Pseudomonas fluorescens SS101. Tevens werden, met behulp van het aanbrengen van random mutaties in het genoom Pseudomonas fluorescens SS101, vier andere regulatie-genen (phgdh, dnaK, prtR and clpA) geïdentificeerd. Mutaties in elk van deze genen resulteerden in een verlies van massetolide productie, alsmede in een verlies van motiliteit en biofilmvorming, twee eigenschappen waar LPs een belangrijke rol in spelen. Ook hebben we aangetoond dat massetolide biosynthese gereguleerd wordt door het ClpAP protease complex via de transcriptionele regulator MassAR, de heat-shock eiwitten DnaK en DnaJ alsmede specifieke eiwitten betrokken bij de citroenzuurcyclus.
LPs hebben antibiotische activiteit en diverse andere natuurlijke functies voor de producerende bacteriën. LPs van P. fluorescens spelen onder andere een grote rol in de verdediging tegen predatie door protozoa. Transcriptoom analyses toonden aan dat 55 genen verhoogd en 73 genen verlaagd tot expressie kwamen in P. fluorescens SS101 in aanwezigheid van Naegleria americana, een protozoa die zich voedt met bacteriën. Naast de massetolide biosynthese genen massABC kwamen ook de genen betrokken bij alkaandegradatie en putrescine catalyse verhoogd tot expressie. Putrescine induceerde cyst–vorming in de protozoa, wat mogelijk een tweede lijn van verdediging tegen predatie biedt. Met behulp van MALDI Imaging Massa Spectrometrie (IMS) en live colony NanoDesi Massa Spectrometrie werd de productie van massetolide in de interactie-zone tussen de bacteriën en de protozoa zichtbaar gemaakt. Vergelijkbare transcriptionele en metabole veranderingen werden waargenomen in experimenten met de verwante stam P. fluorescens SBW25, maar er werden ook stam-specifieke reacties gevonden. Deze resultaten laten zien dat zeer verwante bacteriestammen gelijke maar ook unieke transcriptionele en metabole reacties geven op predatie door protozoa.
Naast een rol in de verdediging tegen predatie en in competitie, zijn LPs zeer bekend vanwege hun rol in zwermen, een bewegingsvorm van bacteriën waarbij de cellen voortgestuwd worden door flagellen oftewel zweepstaarten. Mutanten van P. protegens Pf-5 met mutaties in het LP-biosynthese gen ofaA of het LP-regulatie gen gacA zijn beide deficient in de productie van het LP orfamide. Deze twee mutanten kunnen niet meer zelfstandig zwermen maar kunnen wel ‘meeliften’ met het LP-producerende wildtype Pf-5. Echter, uit onderzoek naar de ruimtelijke verdeling van deze twee mutanten tijdens het meeliften bleek dat de ofaA mutant het wildtype volgde terwijl de gacA mutant zich voor het wildtype bevond aan de rand van de zwermende kolonie. Verdere experimenten lieten zien dat gedurende opeenvolgende cycli van zwermende Pf-5 cellen er spontane gacS/gacA mutanten accumuleren aan de rand van de kolonie, wat er uiteindelijk voor zorgde dat de kolonie zich niet meer kon voortbewegen. Transcriptoom analyses van deze spontane gacS/gacA mutanten lieten tevens zien dat genen geassocieerd met nutriënten acquisitie, motiliteit, chemotaxis en efflux verhoogd tot expressie komen. Microscopische analyses toonden verder aan dat de cellen van deze spontane mutanten langer zijn en meer flagellen bevatten dan wildtype Pf-5 of de ofaA mutant. Dit kan mogelijk een reden zijn waarom de gac mutanten zich voornamelijk aan de rand van de zwermende kolonies bevinden. Samengevat wijzen deze resultaten erop dat adaptieve convergente evolutie door specifieke puntmutaties een algemeen kenmerk is van zwermende bacteriën en dat deze puntmutaties mogelijk een positieve bijdrage kunnen leveren aan de fitness tijdens verspreiding van bacteriën naar nieuwe territoria.

T1  - The Physiology, Evolution, and Genomics of Thermal Tolerance in Reef-Building Corals
AN  - 2507741742
AB  - Increasing temperatures associated with anthropogenic climate change are likely to surpass the thermal limits of many species in the coming decades. Predictions of species response to these changes are predicated on the assumption that heat tolerance is static through time. Countless studies, however, have demonstrated that individual organisms and populations can shift their upper thermal limits through either acclimation, in which individuals exposed to increased temperatures shift their physiology, or adaptation, in which whole populations shift their thermal limits through natural selection for the most heat tolerant genotypes. These processes are especially relevant to foundation species, such as reef-building corals, as these organisms are often sessile, and so cannot easily shift their range. In this dissertation, I examined patterns and processes involved in acclimation and adaptation in reef-building corals, including their impacts on upper thermal limits, the genes and cellular pathways involved, and the relative roles of the two mechanisms over small and large spatial scales. In Chapter 1, I conducted a time series analysis of acclimation. I found an increase in heat tolerance after one week at higher temperatures and a corresponding shift in gene expression, resulting in a dampened response to heat stress. In Chapter 2, I utilized a small-scale natural temperature gradient to search for genetic variants associated with corals adapted to different temperatures. I found 114 genetic variants that differed between warm and cool microclimates separated by less than 1km. In Chapter 3, I tested these variants using a reciprocal transplants between warm and cool microclimates. I found that corals from warm microclimates survived more often, but a subset of genetic variants associated with survival were also associated with lower growth, suggesting a tradeoff in overall fitness. In Chapters 4 and 5, I examined tradeoffs and mechanisms of adaptation and acclimation over a large spatial scale: across latitude. Using a combination of acclimation and heat stress experiments, I found evidence for a high degree of plasticity in upper thermal limit for corals at both low and high latitudes. Despite this plasticity, however, there were still significant fixed effects between locations, suggesting large roles for both acclimation and adaptation in determining heat tolerance across latitude. In Chapter 5, I examined the molecular basis of these shifts in thermal tolerance. I found divergence at both the sequence and gene expression levels for populations from low and high latitude locations, eventually leading to the discovery that the two populations were separate cryptic species: a warm adapted congener and a more broadly distributed congener. This allowed me to compare gene expression patterns between the two cryptic species with different evolutionary histories, finding transcriptional differences across a broad range of cellular functions that could be involved in adaptive thermal tolerance. I also found a set of genes whose expression was tightly linked with bleaching status; these genes are therefore good candidates 'biomarkers' that could be used for prediction of heat stress and tolerance. Together, these studies highlight important roles for both acclimation and adaptation in determining thermal tolerance in corals and provide insights useful for predicting the response of these ecologically and economically important taxa to future climate change.

T1  - Optimising Growth Performance in Juvenile Hapuku (Polyprion oxygeneios): An Insight into the Physiology of a Novel Finfish Aquaculture Species
AN  - 2288612428
AB  - The current study aimed to understand how certain environmental and commercial conditions affect the production performance of a novel aquaculture species in New Zealand, the hapuku Polyprion oxygeneios. Additionally, the current study aimed to construct a simple energetic model for this species by collating the metabolic costs of feeding, growth and swimming within the physiological framework set by aerobic metabolic scope (AMS). AMS represents the physiological capacity for non-maintenance activities by setting the limit for aerobic ATP production. This work was done under the hypothesis that production performance is linked the capacity to perform physiological work and that maximal growth can only occur when AMS is non-limiting. Juvenile hapuku were employed to assess whether respirometric tests and thermal preference methods could be used to resolve the optimum temperature for growth and feed conversion efficiency in novel culture species. The conclusions of this initial study are three-fold: i) hapuku select temperatures that optimise both AMS and growth, ii) AMS and Tpref appear tightly linked with SGR and could be used to predict the optimum temperature for growth in novel species and iii) AMS and Tpref have no utility in predicting the optimum temperature for growth rate and feed conversion ratio, FCR.  Specific dynamic action (SDA) was measured in juvenile hapuku at two temperatures and two different ration sizes: 15 C (0.75 percent body weight [BW] and 1.5 percent BW) and 21 C (1.5 percent and 3 percent BW). Specifically, elevated growth potential through larger SDA responses were present at the higher temperature of 21 C, but the higher maintenance cost (i.e. SMR) of fish at this temperature constrains growth if a restricted 1.5 percent BW ration is delivered. FCR was largely independent of ration size and was significantly less efficient at 21 C, despite fish having a larger SDA response. No single SDA parameter was found to predict the SGR and FCR performance of juvenile hapuku but future research might focus on the SDA response of fish to multiple (vs. single) feeds per day as this conveyed a significant growth benefit to hapuku for reasons not yet explained by metabolism. The applicability of exercise training for juvenile hapuku was examined as induced-swimming can improve the growth and FCR of finfish aquaculture species, such as salmonids and Seriola sp. Combining the SDA of hapuku with the metabolic costs of swimming showed that hapuku have sufficient physiological capacity to support growth and swimming at all ERs. The current study therefore suggests that exercise-induced growth was not limited by AMS and possibly varies as a function of species, life stage and/or inherent growth trajectories.  As a follow on from the exercise trials, the role of exercise in altering the flesh quality of juvenile hapuku was examined. Flesh samples were taken from fish that had been exercised for 8 weeks. Muscle fibre density (MFD) and flesh firmness were negatively related to ER and decreased significantly between 0.0 BL s-1 and 0.75 BL s-1 suggesting a stimulation of muscle fibre hypertrophy with continuous swimming. Fibre size distributions also showed an increase in median muscle fibre size with the increasing exercise regimes. The assumptions of the energetic equations, the apparent discrepancy between digestible energy intake and energy usage and factors that would modify energy usage are all discussed in detail and compared to other species of interest. To conclude, recommendations for farming practice and future work are made based on the empirical data of the model.

T1  - Adjusting to the extreme: thermal adaptation in a freshwater gastropod
AN  - 2002224456
AB  - Temperature is a ubiquitous force influencing biological processes ranging from cellular responses to life span. The thermal environment for many organisms is predicted to change with globally increasing temperatures and studies conducted in natural systems incorporating various evolutionary forces, such as gene flow, is needed. In my thesis, I investigate how snails (Radix balthica) originating from distinct geothermal environments within Lake Mývatn in northern Iceland have adapted, both genetically and phenotypically, to the respective thermal regime. Locations were classified as either cold, warm or seasonal depending on the average and variance in temperature. A high resolution spatial distribution of genetic variation within Mývatn was obtained using both neutral and outlier AFLPs. In addition, the genetic profile enabled me identify warm origin snails irrespective of geographic location in Iceland. Warm environments were often more stressful than cold or seasonal environments but snails originating from a high temperature location benefited from increased performance elsewhere. Patterns of growth were identical in both common garden and reciprocal transplant experiment; warm origin snails grew faster than both cold and seasonal origin snails. This result is in concordance with quantitative genetics models of thermal adaptation but suggesting cogradient rather than countergradient variation. Although warm origin snails generally had superior performance, survival at cold temperatures (< 12 °C) was reduced. All snails matured at similar size in the common garden experiment but cold origin snails were observed to mature later and lay fewer eggs. Also, snails had a common optimum for growth rate at 20 °C irrespective of thermal origin. This is arguably the reason why snails were observed to have a common thermal preference. Interestingly, warm origin snails had a reduced tolerance to high temperatures compared to cold and seasonal origin snails which did not differ in tolerance. Putatively, natural selection has reduced a putatively unnecessary trait (high temperature tolerance in a stable thermal environment) in favour of higher growth rate and performance in warm habitats. In conclusion, the price of high performance in a warm environment was paid in terms of reduced survival at low temperatures and a potential disadvantage of reduced genetic variability.

T1  - Influences of temperature and salinity on asexual reproduction and development of scyphozoan jellyfish from the british isles
AN  - 1827521315
AB  - Jellyfish (Phylum Cnidaria, Class Scyphozoa) play important roles in pelagic ecosystems as predators and prey. Seasonally they form blooms facilitating reproductive success, but that are at times problematic for human enterprise. Medusa abundance has been correlated with environmental variables in several instances. However, the direct mechanisms for changes in medusa abundance are unclear. As global sea surface temperatures continue to change there is increasing concern that warming may enhance conditions favourable for the generation of jellyfish medusae. It is important to understand the ways in which temperature affects all life history stages of jellyfish if we are to begin to understand factors associated with jellyfish bloom formations, but how temperature and salinity affects life history stages of scyphozoan jellyfish from British waters remains largely unknown. In Chapter 1 I provide a general introduction to some key issues important to the formation of jellyfish blooms. In Chapter 2 I present results for experiments testing the effects of temperature on settlement and metamorphosis of planulae larvae of Cyanea capillata, Cyanea lamarckii, Chyrsaora hysoscella, and Aurelia aurita. Chapter 3 reports on the effects of temperature and salinity on survival, and asexual reproduction of scyphistomae of the same species. Chapter 4 reports on the effects of temperature and salinity on growth of newly released ephyrae of each of the above mentioned species, as well as the effects of starvation on survivorship on ephyrae of A. aurita originating from two distinct populations of scyphistomae. In Chapter 5 I provide a brief summary of significant findings for each life history stage, their theoretical implications when taken together, and next steps for future research. I also offer recommendations for ecosystem managers with an eye toward affecting the numbers of near-shore jellyfish medusae generated each season in the waters surrounding the British Isles.

T1  - Arabian gulf food web and the effect of salinity on feeding and growth rate of young threespine sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculeatus)
AN  - 1792787789
AB  - Marine environments are facing several threats from climate change. The threats include changing salinity, temperature and acidity. Changes in these environmental aspects can have an influence on individual foraging and patterns of growth in marine fish and ultimately entire food webs. Understanding the foraging biology of marine fish is important because their feeding habits and their diet selection are vital characteristics of trophic relationships in marine ecosystems. In this thesis, I explored the food web structure of the Arabian Gulf Marine Fishery, the growth rate of estuarine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fish, and their diet choice. The focus for all three studies was the potential threat caused by the elevation of salinity, temperature and associated changes in productivity and diet. In Chapter 2, I present a study on diet selectivity in larval and juvenile G. aculeatus along a salinity gradient of how this environmental parameter along with temperature, prey species richness, prey diversity and productivity affected the diet choice of these fish. I found that prey selectivity, which I defined as the difference between size in gut and size in pond, declines with salinity but that selectivity was unaffected by temperature, productivity, prey species richness, and prey diversity. In Chpater 3 I present a study of how salinity, temperature, productivity and zooplankton food size affects the growth rate of larval and juvenile threespine sticklebacks. I found that salinity, zooplankton prey size and zooplankton species richness all affected the growth rate of these fish, while no effect was observed for temperature, productivity and other features of the environment. In Chapter 4 I present the largest marine food web ever constructed, for the Arabian (=Persian) Gulf. The Arabian Gulf is experiencing increased salinity in spawning ground areas due to alterations of freshwater influx. I examined the structure of this community in comparison to other previously reported marine food webs and found it to be similar. I also explored how the structure of the food web changes when only species were considered (taxonomic food webs) versus of the consideration of life stages as species (disaggregated food webs). I also explored the impact on the food web structure due to the removal of all commercial species from both webs. One of the major findings was that copepods, mainly calanoids, were the most common prey. Thus, their productivity is vital to the fishery. My work in this thesis on larval and juvenile fish growth and on diet choice shows that larval and juvenile fish are sensitive to the changes in environmental parameters, particularly salinity. My work also shows that calanoid copepods are a major prey in a large fishery. In general, this suggests that it is very important to understand the sensitivity of larval and juvenile fish to environmental characteristics and the management of their prey (e.g. copepods).

T1  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics of Great Lakes percid fishes
AN  - 1781122964
AB  - A burgeoning field of research is developing around the theory that evolutionary change can occur much more rapidly than expected, driving population responses to anthropogenic stressors and creating feedbacks on ecological timescales. Many of these rapidly evolving traits represent important life history characteristics, such as maturation, growth, reproductive investment, and offspring size. This dissertation focused on two important aspects of fish reproductive ecology: the process of maturation and the mechanisms driving variation in offspring size and fitness. These traits appear to vary on both spatial and temporal scales, and this variation can be driven by a complex interplay of phenotypically plastic responses to local environments and genetically-based adaptation to changing selection pressures. My research addressed: 1) temporal variation in maturation schedules of Great Lakes yellow perch, with special attention to potential changes in maturation due to commercial fishing; 2) how tradeoffs between growth, mortality, and maturation influenced sex-specific variation in maturation schedules among populations of Great Lakes yellow perch in recent time; 3) the influence of adaptation, plastic responses to thermal conditions, and maternal effects on egg size and intra-female egg size variation among walleye (Sander vitreus) populations, 4) the importance of genetic diversity to early life growth and survival in yellow perch, and 5) how maternal effects may influence life history trait evolution in response to and during recovery from fisheries exploitation. Yellow perch maturation schedules exhibited surprisingly rapid recovery toward maturity at larger sizes and older ages in Lake Michigan during a fishing moratorium, suggesting recovery from fisheries-induced evolution is possible in some fish stocks. Female and male maturation schedules exhibited dimorphic relationships with growth and mortality rates, highlighting how sex-specific variation in life history tradeoffs influences their evolution. Walleye exhibited consistently positive maternal effects on egg size and marked among-population variation in egg size related to average thermal conditions, suggesting adaptation of offspring size to local environments, while intra-female egg size varied plastically with annual temperatures, suggesting conditions regulating both energy acquisition and allocation to eggs influence offspring size in this species. Heterozygosity was significantly correlated with increased size in juvenile yellow perch under harsh environmental conditions, and the largest individuals were also most related to one another, further highlighting the importance of local environments to offspring size and fitness. Finally, an eco-genetic model testing the evolutionary response of life history traits to fishing mortality over various levels of maternal effect showed that positive maternal effects can increase the rate of evolutionary recovery of these traits when fishing is ceased. This research identified important factors that drive life history shifts in fish stocks; vital information as management agencies seek to restore or maintain the valuable fisheries and ecosystem services these species provide. More broadly, analyses of plastic and adaptive change of life history traits in populations experiencing several anthropogenic stressors could improve predictions of population responses to future change.

T1  - Application of the qbd principles throughout the lifecycle of a recombinant protein process
AN  - 1780279833
AB  - The biotech community is under increasing pressure from the regulators to demonstrate effective implementation of the Quality by Design (QbD) principles and hence exhibit greater process understanding. Essential to achieving this goal is the implementation of a systematic framework that integrates experimental and predictive modeling techniques whilst accounting for the inherent variability of biologics. The aim of this thesis was to create a comprehensive framework for applying the principles of QbD throughout the lifecycle of a commercially distributed therapeutic protein produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture. A systematic approach incorporating QbD principles was applied, involving risk assessment of potential process failure points, small-scale model development and qualification, design and execution of experiments, definition of operating parameter ranges and process performance acceptance criteria for validation and classification of operating parameters in the second generation process for this therapeutic protein. This methodology was illustrated through detailed process characterisation of a fed-batch production culture step and a virus inactivation step. One of the most prominent interactions found in the fedbatch production culture model was the three factor interaction of pH × temperature × seeding density. In the virus inactivation model, an increase in temperature (30 °C), incubation time (180 min), a reduction in pH (pH 3.5) at a relatively high protein concentration (5.5 g/L) resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of aggregated protein. Continuous process improvement and robustness are fundamental components in the QbD paradigm and are an integral component in the comprehensive framework described in this thesis. Following commercial implementation, Multivariate analysis (MVA) was employed to build upon the knowledge gained from process characterisation studies by identifying not only the process parameters but also the cell culture factors such as daily nutrient and metabolite levels which influenced protein titre and product quality attributes across scales. This analysis provided valuable knowledge for future troubleshooting and process refinement activities. Application of a statistical tool such as MVA adds scientific rigor to the data analysis thus improving the prediction of scale-up effects on the final product. Process robustness opportunities are often only realised when the process is run over multiple batches at manufacturing-scale. In this process, a perfusion culture which is employed to provide high cell densities to inoculate a production culture was identified as a potential risk to process and product supply and therefore identified as an area of focus for process optimisation activities. Application of a cell conditioning strategy enabled the generation of a seed fed-batch culture which achieved relatively high cell densities to inoculate the production culture. Shorter culture duration in the fed-batch culture also yielded comparable cell culture performance and productivity in production cultures relative to historical process performance. Successful commercial implementation and validation of the second generation process and the subsequent manufacture of hundreds of batches of this therapeutic protein verified the approaches described in this thesis as a suitable model for the development, scale-up and operation of any biopharmaceutical manufacturing process. This methodology is aligned with the QbD principles and can be applied to any biopharmaceutical manufacturing process, thus delivering sustainable, compliant and in-control processes throughout the product life-cycle.

T1  - Effects of heat stress on oocyte quality and embryo viability in swine
AN  - 1776711641
AB  - Heat stress during oocyte maturation causes well-defined changes in the oocyte cytoplasm that leads to reduced developmental potential. Previous work has been done that supports this hypothesis, but the underlying reasons are still not fully understood. Our objective is to determine these underlying mechanisms that contribute to this reduction in overall development potential of the oocytes and the embryos. Oocytes underwent in vitro maturation (IVM) for 40-44 hours in one of two environments: 39°C (control), or 41°C (heat stress). The oocytes underwent multiple experiments: stage of meiosis after maturation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) size, total amount of Ca2+ stored in the ER, pattern of Ca2+ signal following in vitro fertilization (IVF), and embryo development after IVF. After 40-44 hours of IVM, oocytes were stained and their chromatin configuration was recorded. Heat-stressed oocytes showed a significant decrease in the ability to reach metaphase II of meiosis compared to the control group. Heat stressed oocytes also lowered the percentage of embryos developing to the blastocyst stage. Mobilized Ca2+ from the ER affects fertilization and subsequent embryo development. Administration of ionomycin caused oocytes to, in Ca2+-free medium, released Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. The average amplitude of the Ca2+ peaks was significantly higher compared to that of the heat stressed group. However time of release and time to maximum peak did not seem to have a discernable affect between the groups. Lower Ca2+ store content could be caused by one of two events: reduction in ER size or an alteration in ER function. Literature suggests that the ER should emulate a spider web-type structure contained throughout the entire cytoplasm. In some cases, heat stress oocytes exhibited an incomplete reorganization of the ER as compared to the control group.   Fertilization is dependent on the phospholipase C zeta (PLC ζ) content of the sperm to hydrolyze and cleave PIP2 into DAG and IP 3 to cause a release of Ca2+ from the ER. The released Ca2+ triggers a cascade of events that ultimately lead to the activation of the oocyte and subsequent embryo development. Oocyte lipid composition is important for the generation of energy substrates as well as phospholipid second messengers. Lipid analysis experiments did not show a significant difference in fatty acid make up. High amounts of triglycerides are seen in each experiment performed in positive mode. Phospholipids and DAG are in very low concentrations prior to fertilization. The DESI technique may not be sensitive enough to obtain the data from both groups. An alteration in fatty acid content as well as phospholipids can have a detrimental effect on Ca2+ mobilization and entry. Ca2+ transients, after fertilization, are responsible for the lifting of the meiotic arrest and initiation of cell division. When we measured the changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of the oocytes we found that heat stress during maturation caused marked alterations in the mean amplitude of Ca2+ transients during IVF, while frequency of the oscillations remained the same. We believe that the observed changes described above are responsible, at least in part, for the reduced developmental potential of the heat stressed oocytes.

T1  - Functional and Drought Survival Strategies of California Perennial Grasses in the Context of Restoration
AN  - 1775388850
AB  - Over the next 100 years, ecosystems in California are expected to experience warmer temperatures and an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts. California grasslands are also heavily invaded by European annual grasses, and climate change may further favor these exotic invaders over native species.  Restoration efforts in California grasslands would benefit from ways to identify taxa that are best suited to withstand increasing drought stress, including the traits that are common among the most successful drought survivors.   The traits and strategies promoting severe drought survival in native perennial grasses have been relatively little explored, and drought survival is rarely studied in conjunction with seasonal patterns of growth or ecologically important (i.e., "functional") traits.  In the first chapter of this dissertation, we integrated physiological and functional trait-based approaches to characterize seasonal growth dynamics and drought survival strategies in eight California wildland perennial grass species. We paid special attention to summer dormancy, an adaptation to drought that is known to be expressed by several California perennial grasses, but has received very little empirical study.  Summer dormant species in our study were characterized by greater springtime productivity; earlier reproduction; a shallower, finer root system; and high tolerance of tissue dehydration.  Together, these traits suggest that in spring, summer dormant taxa exhibit a resource acquisitive functional strategy, escaping drought via efficient competition for resources and early reproduction. Owing to functional similarity with many exotic annual grasses, we suggest that summer dormancy may play an important ecological role in restoring native perennial species to California grasslands.   Local plant populations are recommended for ecological restoration to avoid maladaptation to current site conditions; however, whether they will be well adapted to future climate scenarios, including increasing drought stress, is a major concern for practitioners.  In the second chapter, we extended the approach from Chapter 1 to characterize intraspecific variation in drought survival, seasonal growth dynamics, and functional traits in a suite of five populations of Elymus glaucus, a native perennial bunchgrass commonly used in restoration.  We chose populations from sites with contrasting climates to determine how trait and environmental variability are related.  We found strong intraspecific variation in dehydration tolerance, which was tightly correlated with summer dormancy.  Dehydration tolerance was associated with a conservative functional strategy, and with increasing summer climatic water deficit at populations’ sites of origin.  Trait variation was most associated with annual climatic water deficit, rather than summer aridity, which highlights the need to measure traits during both the drought period and the more productive growing season when considering species from temporally variable climates.  Our results suggest that restoration practitioners may be able to predict dehydration tolerance from summer aridity alone, but that climate during the growing season may be just as important for ecological restoration.   Local adaptation evolves in response to both abiotic and biotic selective pressures.  Biotic factors like competition have received far less empirical study, but functional ecology predicts that they will be more important in productive environments.  In the third chapter, we used a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine whether patterns of trait variation expressed in Chapter 2 were indicative of local adaptation.  Because populations were collected from contrasting productive and stressful sites, we asked whether intraspecific competition was a more important modulator of plant fitness in productive coastal sites, and whether coastal populations were more competitive. We did not find consistent evidence of local adaptation in our populations.  We found that competition was more important to reproductive output at coastal sites, but only for resident populations.  This result suggests that, especially at coastal sites, receiving all the benefits of locally sourced plant materials in grassland restoration requires careful consideration of the optimal intraspecific planting neighborhood.

T1  - Climate Change and Reproductive Phenology: Context-Dependent Responses to Increases in Temperature and Implications for Assisted Colonization
AN  - 1771301569
AB  - Contemporary changes in climate have rapidly increased temperatures worldwide, extending the length of the growing season and eliciting large shifts in reproductive and growth traits across a diversity of plant taxa. The role of phenotypic plasticity in alleviating immediate changes in selection pressures must be thoroughly explored in order to identify the circumstances under which the survival of particular species may require active management. The major goals of my thesis were to characterize the contexts in which responses to warming occur and are adaptive, and to provide insight on the feasibility of assisted colonization (the movement of species beyond their current range boundary to climatically favorable habitat) and assisted gene flow (the relocation of multiple, genetically distinct populations to facilitate local adaptation).    Focusing on the annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, I applied artificial warming to simple plant communities to mimic the thermal regimes expected by the mid-21st century. Among experiments, I manipulated aspects of the abiotic and biotic environment likely to contribute to variation in plastic responses to warming, including plant genotype, community diversity, population density, internal patterns of resource allocation, and the frequency of rainfall.    Reproductive phenological traits varied in their degree of response to warming, and photoperiodic constraints prevented optimal responses in populations of C. fasciculata from lower latitudes. In all cases, temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity was adaptive or neutral, but only sufficiently alleviated selection pressures in particular situations. Variation in competitive dynamics, pollinator access, and rainfall frequency did not modify responses to changes in temperature.    This work identified barriers to assisted colonization across latitudes that arise when reproductive phenology is dependent on photoperiodic cues. Phenotypic plasticity may ameliorate some of the negative effects of increases in temperature, but persistent, directional selection pressures will require the evolution of life history traits for adaptation to climate change.

T1  - Genetic variation, adaptability and gene expression plasticity in heterogeneous environments
AN  - 1767373344
AB  - Natural environments change over time and space. How populations respond to different forms of environmental heterogeneity has strong impacts on the health and persistence of the populations. In my thesis, I explored the effects of temporal and spatial heterogeneity on several important aspects of populations—levels of genetic variation, the potential of future adaptation, and gene expression plasticity—using replicated experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolving under alternative regimes: constant regimes maintained in either cadmium- or salt- enriched larvae diets (Cad and Salt, respectively) and two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally (Temp) or spatially (Spatial) between the two diets. Whole-genome resequencing of these populations found that for sites likely under differential ecological selection (and those closely linked to them), the pattern of within-population diversity is Spatial > Temp > Salt, Cad. However, for sites that are not affected by differential selection, the pattern is Spatial > Salt, Cad > Temp. Quantitative genetic variance patterns for three fitness related traits are partially consistent with the genomic diversity. Spatial populations tend to harbor more genetic variation than Temp populations or those under a constant environment that is the same as the assay environment. The adaptability of these populations was further assessed by exposing them to high temperature while being maintained in their original larval diet regimes. Both types of heterogeneous populations had a larger adaptive response to high temperature than homogeneous populations for female productivity but not for male siring success. Finally, the transcriptome was measured in both diets for each population to examine gene expression plasticity. Relative to the constant populations, both heterogeneous populations showed increases in adaptive plasticity. Spatial populations are more readily to increase adaptive plasticity than Temp. Whereas for the genes selected for similar expression in both diets, Temp populations more readily evolve to the adaptive state than Spatial.

T1  - Phenotypic variation in cold tolerance of an invasive insect (<i>Epiphyas postvittana</i> Walker): Implications for forecasting risk
AN  - 1762247808
AB  - Predicting the spread and potential impacts of biological invasions is vital to management and policy decision-making. For much of North America, cold temperatures dictate portions of the geographic boundaries of ectotherm survival and are often included as a key component of risk models and maps for invasive insects. However, current risk assessments typically assume an invading species' response to cold and other environmental stressors is immutable over short to medium time horizons, in part due to a paucity of relevant biological data. Such assumptions may lead to mis-estimated probabilities of establishment and spread of invasive insects, such as a recent invader to the U.S.A, the light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana Walker).
My research examined multiple sources of potential variation in cold tolerance of E. postvittana, a species that is predominantly freeze avoidant but also shows some amount of partial freeze tolerance in its overwintering stage. First, I evaluated the effects of larval host plant on direct tolerance to acute partial-freezing in late instars. There was a nearly ten-fold change in survival after partial freezing based on larval host, as well as changes in mean supercooling points. Importantly, the degree of cold tolerance could be predicted by the developmental suitability of a given host.
Second, I compared the fitness tradeoffs following exposure to two subzero temperatures (-10°C or the supercooling point) in late instars and pupae. Both lifestages could survive brief exposure to -10°C without significant fitness cost, and displayed small proportions of partial freeze tolerance. However, individuals that survived partial-freezing did so with a reproductive fitness cost.
Lastly, I conducted a long-term laboratory selection experiment to evaluate the potential for adaptation to partial freezing in late instars. While there did not appear to be sufficient additive genetic variance to see a consistent response to selection, there was considerable variability through time in survival after partial-freezing. Importantly, this variability cycled in a regular pattern (~six generations), driven by a yet unknown mechanism. The variation in E. postvittana cold response seen in this study resulted in different forecasts of geographic distribution, which can have important management and regulatory implications.

T1  - The influence of thermal effluent on life history evolution in the Western mosquitofish, <i>Gambusia affinis</i>
AN  - 1761855870
AB  - The evolutionary consequence of heated effluent on the Western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, was studied at Lake Fairfield, in Freestone County, Texas. The Lake Fairfield reservoir receives heated effluent from Luminant’s Big Brown Power Station. Heated effluent from the power station is discharged into a ‘hot pond’ reservoir before it is allowed to return after cooling to the main reservoir, or ‘main lake’ of Lake Fairfield. Heated effluent elevates the temperature of the hot pond throughout the year and the elevation in water temperature has selected various life history traits in G. affinis that are divergent from the main lake G. affinis population, such as growth rate, clutch size, reproductive allotment, lipid content, and size at maturity. This work builds upon previous research demonstrating evidence for genetic divergence between the two populations of G. affinis residing in the heated and non-heated regions in Lake Fairfield, and takes the logical next step by exploring these same populations for genetic shifts in life history traits that are directly connected to rates of population growth. This was accomplished by examining patterns of phenotypic life history variation (phenotypic assays) in preserved specimens collected monthly over the course of a year, by performing two sets of reciprocal transplant experiments, and a complimentary common garden experiment. The assessment of phenotypic variation between sites revealed that G. affinis in the hot pond exhibit smaller clutch sizes, smaller reproductive allotment, larger lipid stores, and larger male maturation sizes than G. affinis in the main lake. The results of two independent reciprocal transplant experiments as well as a common garden experiment provide evidence for locally adapted differences as mosquitofish fish from the main lake exhibited faster rates of growth than fish from the hot pond and such differences were generally larger when all populations were reared in the main lake. The assessment of environmental parameters between the hot pond and main lake showed that water temperature was consistently higher in the hot pond and that potentially covarying factors, such as dissolved oxygen, conductivity, salinity, and pH, did not differ between the divergent environments. The observed life history differences between the hot pond and main lake are therefore best explained as driven by elevated water temperature due to the release of heated effluent. Given that the Big Brown Power Station commenced operation in 1971 and has been continuously operating since that time, our results substantiate that human driven alteration to thermal regimes can drive significant evolutionary changes within 44 years. This study provides information on the extent to which species can rapidly adapt to increased environmental temperatures in the form of artificial heating and alter the expression of life history traits when isolated in environments that receive heated effluent. The results of this study also represent an important step in the integration of evolutionary biology and conservation science, and offer information to be considered when adopting management plans for conserving aquatic communities.

T1  - Characterizing the genetic basis of susceptibility to atrazine exposure in male <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 1761627798
AB  - Human induced environmental toxicants, such as pesticides, antibiotics and heavy metals, are influencing both target organisms and non-target organisms. Understanding the mechanisms of how environmental toxicants affect different organisms will allow us to better understand the potential for organisms to respond to these environmental changes. One such toxicant, atrazine, is a commonly applied herbicide in the US and has been shown to cause adverse effects on male reproductive performance in a wide variety of vertebrates. Much less is known, however, about the effects of atrazine on invertebrates. Here I use the model genetic system, Drosophila melanogaster, as a toxicology model to identify genes influencing susceptibility to atrazine exposure. I used RNA-seq to identify ninety-eight genes which are putatively differentially expressed in male Drosophila after chronic exposure to food containing 20 ppm atrazine and verified a subset of these genes using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR). As expected, a gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that genes involved in stress response were overrepresented (including three cytochrome P450 genes) but interestingly so were genes involved in reproduction, suggesting that atrazine might also affect invertebrate reproduction. I then selected 50 lines from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP) mapping population and scored male reproductive performance when reared on control food and food containing 2 ppm atrazine. Measures of reproductive performance included mating rate, male-induced refractoriness to remating and measures of male fertility. There was extensive genetic variation for reproductive susceptibility to atrazine exposure and male mating rate showed highly significant line by treatment interactions. The DGRP lines are fully sequenced and I performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for mating rate.  Several genes involved in membrane transport were associated with susceptibility to atrazine including two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits and three ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters. One ABC transporter, CG5789, has a derived, non-synonymous mutation which shows fitness trade-offs in the different environments suggesting a cost to resistance. The mapping results suggest that export of atrazine out of the cells, rather than detoxification is the likely mechanism of resistance.

T1  - Short term adult plasticity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i> and its role in climatic adaptation
AN  - 1759630576
AB  - Adaptation to environmental heterogeneity is a fundamental aspect in evolutionary biology. A constantly changing environment puts continuous stress on organisms, and causes spatially and temporally varying selection regimes where survival depends on responsiveness. Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism enabling this responsiveness, which manifests upon exposure to an environmental stressor and facilitates a more resistant phenotype. Environmental heterogeneity exposure at the adult life stage of an organism produces a plastic response that is important for local adaptation and persistence. Hence, adaptive plasticity is an important mechanism of adaptation to localized environmental variation.  To study short term exposure plasticity, we sampled Northern and Southern populations of Drosophila melanogaster, originating from distinct geographic regions and habitats in eastern North America. To elicit a plastic response these populations were exposed to two environmental variables, temperature and photoperiod, for a short-term (five-day) treatment. Flies that had been exposed to this treatment were then tested for phenotypic stress response using chill coma tolerance, heat shock and starvation resistance assays, all of which act as proxies for fitness. To test their response to the natural environment, the same populations were exposed to outdoor field conditions for a treatment equivalent to that in the lab, after which their stress response to heat and cold tolerance was recorded. Whole genome level plasticity was observed by sequencing the transcriptome of lab flies exposed to the same treatment of crossed temperature and photoperiod regimes as the phenotyped flies; thus, allowing for a complimentary gene expression plasticity study. Geographic origin and temperature treatment determined the phenotypic stress response for the three stress assays. Photoperiod showed significant interaction with temperature, indicating that D. melanogaster is responding to both cues in order to modify its life-history strategies. The field results showed the Northern population had a faster chill coma recovery time when exposed to extreme cold temperatures relative to the Southern population, where this was not observed, suggesting adaptive cold response plasticity is important in the Northern population’s fitness. Lastly, the Northern and Southern populations showed a differential expression plasticity response, which is consistent with the expected patterns based on spatially varying selection.

T1  - Local adaptation and reproductive isolation in the copepod <i> Tigriopus californicus</i>
AN  - 1757808168
AB  - The evolution of reproductive barriers between species, in many cases is a consequence of genetic divergence that evolves between populations that have become geographically isolated. In this case, processes such as local adaptation and genetic drift will contribute to this divergence, to the point where if the populations come into contact again, some form of reproductive isolation between them will have evolved. Understanding local adaptation, and how it affects a population’s ability to deal with environmental changes has also become of interest to biologists, as way to assess how organisms will deal with predict climate changes. In chapter 2 of this dissertation I address how the evolution of reproductive isolation due to intrinsic postzygotic barriers (hybrid sterility and inviability) is affect by the presence/absence of sex chromosomes, which have been deemed important for the evolution of these reproductive barriers. I show that taxa that have heteromorphic sex chromosomes reach higher levels of intrinsic postzygotic isolation at lower levels of genetic divergence. On the other hand, taxa without sex chromosomes remain compatible until much higher levels of genetic divergence. In chapter 3, I look at genome-wide patterns of hybrid inviability in crosses of different levels of genetic divergence between populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Theory and data in other species suggest that the more divergent cross should show higher levels of intrinsic reproductive isolation, caused by a larger number of genomic regions that are incompatible between the hybridizing populations. Results however show that the least divergent cross suffers the largest effects due to hybrid inviability, suggesting that either this cross has a larger number of incompatibilities than the other two crosses, or that the architecture of these incompatibilities leads to a larger inviability effect. In chapter 4 I focus on the effects that differences in local adaptation play on a population’s ability to deal with changes in thermal variability in their environment. The results show the populations studied have very different profiles of gene expression across the different temperature treatments, and changes in thermal variability elicited large differences in transcriptome wide expression changes, especially in the least thermal tolerant populations.

T1  - Assessing the effect of beach dynamics on nest site selection of green turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>) in Playa Cabuyal, Costa Rica
AN  - 1727614765
AB  - Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) across their entire range due to declining population numbers over the past 30 years. This study assessed the effect of beach dynamics, including beach erosion and temperature, on nest site selection across four nesting seasons, at Playa Cabuyal, Guanacaste, Costa Rica (10°67’N, 85°65’W). The study site is located in Northwest Costa Rica on the Pacific Ocean where climate is affected by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The nest locations showed that green turtles at this site had a preference for nesting in Zone 3, the highest nesting area of the beach, under the canopy of trees. This zone was covered with vegetation and had open areas underneath the canopy of trees where the nests would be shaded for a portion of the day. Nesting females also showed a preference for nesting in the southern most portion of Playa Cabuyal designated as Area C, which is made up of the southern third of the beach. Factors studied to be contributing to this nest site preference were tidal inundation, distance from high tide and erosion activities. These were catalogued during the 2014-2015 nesting season to establish a baseline level of these influences by Zone   (sections of the beach, 1-3, from the water) and Area (delineation of the beach from North to South into 3 distinct areas A-C). An inverse relationship was found between number of nests laid in each Zone and the number of erosion and inundation events in each zone. Zone 3 was found to have no erosion or inundation events and had the highest percentage of observed in-situ (nests that have not been relocated) nests. Zone 1 (below the high tide line) was found to have the highest percentage of erosion events and had the lowest number of nests. In addition the turtles had a significant preference for nesting in shaded areas. Shaded portions of Zone 3 had lower nest temperatures than those nests in unshaded areas. This could result in higher production of males and could also affect hatching and emergence success. Additionally, nests underneath trees had a decreased amount of surface roots so nesting females had fewer impediments when excavating a nest cavity. This could increase the chance of a successful nesting attempt and may also increase hatching and emergence success as there are fewer roots to impede hatchling development and emergence. The preference of green turtles for nesting in Zone 3 at this site is different than at other sites such as Colola, Mexico where green turtles show a preference for Zone 2. This is most likely due to the beach in Cabuyal being narrower than the beach in Colola. Turtles also showed a preference for nesting on the southern third of the beach, Area C, for three out of the four years of this study. In the 2013-2014 year there was a preference for the middle third, Area B, of the beach. In all years of the study turtles showed the least preference for the first third of the beach to the far North. These preferences may be a result of the beach being wider on the southern portion of the beach versus to the North where a rock cliff frequently causes the beach to be completely inundated. Although there was a distinct difference in levels of inundation in the three Areas of beach from North to South, the occurrence of erosion events, or seasonal changes in deposition and attrition, was similar in each Area. Site fidelity by females classified into three different categories, those with a high level of fidelity, laying all nests within 100 meters, those with low fidelity, laying all nests greater than 100 meters apart, and clustered, consisting of females with at least two nests within 100 meters of each other. There were no differences in fidelity in between zones. Turtle size was also determined if it was related to nesting strategy but no correlation was found.

T1  - Thermoelectric Properties of Complex Oxide Heterostructures
AN  - 1725907222
AB  - Thermoelectrics are a promising energy conversion technology for power generation  and cooling systems. The thermal and electrical properties of the materials at the  heart of thermoelectric devices dictate conversion efficiency and technological viability.  Studying the fundamental properties of potentially new thermoelectric materials is  of great importance for improving device performance and understanding the electronic  structure of materials systems.     In this dissertation, investigations on the thermoelectric properties of a prototypical  complex oxide, SrTiO3, are discussed. Hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is  used to synthesize La-doped SrTiO3 thin films, which exhibit high electron mobilities  and large Seebeck coefficients resulting in large thermoelectric power factors at low  temperatures. Large interfacial electron densities have been observed in SrTiO3/RTiO 3  (R=Gd,Sm) heterostructures. The thermoelectric properties of such heterostructures are  investigated, including the use of a modulation doping approach to control interfacial  electron densities. Low-temperature Seebeck coefficients of extreme electron-density  SrTiO3 quantum wells are shown to provide insight into their electronic structure.

T1  - Mechanistic modelling of the links between environment, mosquitoes and malaria transmission in the current and future climates of West Africa
AN  - 1707151756
AB  - Malaria transmission in West Africa is closely tied to climate, as rain fed water pools provide breeding habitat for the anopheles mosquito vector, and temperature affects the mosquito's ability to spread disease. This thesis presents a framework of highly detailed, spatially explicit mechanistic modelling to explore the relationships between the environment and malaria in the current and future climate of West Africa. A mechanistic model of human immunity was incorporated into an existing agent-based model of malaria transmission, allowing us to move beyond entomological measures such as mosquito density and vectorial capacity to analyzing the prevalence of the malaria parasite within human populations. The result is a novel modelling tool that mechanistically simulates all of the key processes linking environment to malaria transmission.    Simulations were conducted across climate zones in West Africa, linking temperature and rainfall to entomological and epidemiological variables with a focus on nonlinearities due to threshold effects and interannual variability. Comparisons to observations from the region confirmed that the model provides a reasonable representation of the entomological and epidemiological conditions in this region.   While current generation climate models agree that mean temperatures in West Africa will likely increase by 2 to 4°C in the future by the end of the 21st century, they disagree on the magnitude and the direction of the change in rainfall. We analyzed the performance of CMIP5 climate models in simulating West African rainfall and temperature before selecting the most credible predictions of future climate. We used these predictions to simulate the expected change in malaria transmission in sensitive regions of West Africa. We found that the western subregion of West Africa is likely to become drier in the coming decades. The warmer temperatures will shorten mosquito life spans, and the drying will limit mosquito reproduction. As a result, we expect malaria transmission in this region to decrease. However, the eastern half of the region is expected to become wetter. In some areas, the positive effects of increased rainfall on mosquito reproduction may surpass the negative effects of high temperatures on mosquito longevity, leading to a small net increase in environmental suitability for malaria transmission.

T1  - Tests for Positive Selection on Genes Encoding Heat Shock Proteins in the Marine Slipper Snail, <i>Crepidula fornicata</i>
AN  - 1706877011
AB  - Sedentary organisms that inhabit the marine intertidal zone must be adapted to withstand  forms of environmental stress that are uncommon in other marine environments. Adaptations  to these stressors are apparent in the morphologies, behaviors, life histories, and regulation  and products of genes of sedentary intertidal organisms (Lent 1969; Garrity 1984; Schmidt et  al 2008). However, for those species that have a planktonic larval stage, evolutionary  specialization at the molecular level could be constrained by opposing requirements for larvae and adults that are adapted to very different environments. This constraint would have  been removed in lineages that lost the ancestral larval stage, and reinstated in lineages that  secondarily reacquired a larval stage. A comparative approach using a group in which the  planktonic larval stage has been lost and reacquired could be used to test the hypothesis that  adaptive evolution of stress-related genes accompanies these life-history transitions.     Genes with known roles in physiological stress tolerance include those that encode  the family of 70 kilodalton heat shock proteins (hsp70s ) (Feder and Hofmann 1999).  Statistical tests for departures from selective neutrality were applied to sequence variation in  hsp70  genes of calyptraeid gastropods. The Calpytraeidae include both intertidal and subtidal  species, as well as species that have lost or secondarily reacquired the ancestral planktonic  larval stage (Collin 2003a; Collin et al. 2007). I focused on two species: Crepidula fornicata  and C. atrasolea. Both species are found in low intertidal and subtidal habitats in the western tlantic region. However, whereas the eggs of C. fornicata hatch into planktonic veligers,  the eggs of C. atrasolea develop directly into crawling juveniles. I tested for selection with  statistics that characterize the distribution of sequence variation within and between species,  comparing values for each  hsp70 gene fragment with expectations for selectively neutral loci.

T1  - Population-level consequences of phenotypic plasticity in yellow-bellied marmots <i>(Marmota flaviventris)</i>
AN  - 1694579956
AB  - Individuals vary phenotypically. Phenotypic variation can emerge because of bet-hedging, micro-evolutionary responses, and because of phenotypic plasticity, an important mechanism by which individuals can cope with environmental change. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an individual to respond to environmental variation, can influence demographic parameters (e.g., birth and death rates) that influence population dynamics. I used a population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) as a study system to explore the effect of individual variation due to phenotypically plastic responses on population dynamics. First, I used linear mixed effects models to examine and quantify the plastic responses in a set of morphological, life-history and social traits in response to climatic and social variation. Results showed that individuals have the ability to respond to environmental variation by expressing different phenotypes, and that individuals differ in the nature of their plastic responses. Second, I developed an Integral Projection Model to evaluate the trait-mediated response to environmental variation. Results indicated that variation in survival and reproduction are the main drivers of fluctuation in the population growth rate, and that winter temperature, but not spring temperature and bare ground date, are important environmental drivers of population fluctuations. Furthermore, although variation in a key morphological trait, body mass, does not explain significant variation in population growth rate, it plays an important role in mediating the individuals’ response to the environment. Finally, I developed an Individual Based Model, to incorporate individual differences in the rate at which animals gained mass seasonally, and evaluated the effect of such individual heterogeneity for population persistence. Results indicated that the proportion of individuals in the population that engaged in compensatory growth influenced population dynamics, and the cost of expressing such compensatory responses had a strong effect on population dynamics. If growth rate plasticity varies among-individuals, the population can afford the cost of plasticity; otherwise, plasticity increases the time to population extinction. These findings emphasize the importance of phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism shaping individual variation in a population, and as an important response of a species’ adaptation to environmental change.

T1  - Age and work experience influence on job and organizational engagement in the retail sector
AN  - 1692316570; 2015-99130-494
AB  - The downturn of the economy after 2008 and the increasing number of retiring Baby Boomers has created a shift in the population towards younger workers and values of employees more aligned with this younger age (Bates, 2004; Johnson, 2004). In addition, employees' working beyond the conventional age of 66 has created a workforce that spans four generations (Schullery, 2013). Companies are struggling to find ways to engage employees equally across all four generations (Saks & Gruman, 2011). Studies have shown, partially as a result of these changes in the workplace, that workers are not fully engaged and committed to their companies and are changing job positions and companies at an increasing rate (Johnson, 2004; Mohamed, Taylor, & Hassan, 2006; Saks, 2006; Shaw, 2005). Some have suggested that greater worker engagement in the workplace might mitigate the challenges described above (Mohamed et al., 2006; Saks, 2006). Homans' (1958) seminal study on engagement triggered an increasing realization that one key to creating or increasing retention of workers is employee engagement. Building on Homans' work, Kahn (1990) and Saks (2006) defined engagement as the meeting of employee physical and emotional needs so that turnover is reduced, quality improved and productivity maximized within the workplace as documented by the propensity of employees to commit to themselves and to the employer's vision and strategy. Assessment of engagement factors between 2000 and 2006 regarding retention, quality, and productivity has become increasingly important for companies (Bates, 2004; Johnson, 2004; Kelloway, Day, & Arla 2003; Kelloway et al., 2003; Saks, 2006). Studies on the importance of employee engagement became increasingly important with the decline in the economy in 2007-2008. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Adaptation to climate and climate change in Rocky Mountain butterflies: Morphology, physiology, and behavior
AN  - 1689691159
AB  - Understanding the relative contributions of evolution, plasticity and behavior for local adaptation to climate, and for adaptive responses to recent climate change, is a major challenge for global change biologists. My dissertation explores these issues for Colias butterflies along an elevation gradient. Adults use thermoregulatory behaviors to achieve optimal body temperatures. Past studies show local adaptation in fixed morphological differences in ventral hind-wing melanin and thoracic setal length and a degree of developmental plasticity associated with melanin. My dissertation makes four major contributions. First, reciprocal-transplant and common-garden experiments documented differences in thermal sensitivity for flight initiation between high (C. meadii) and lower (C. eriphyle) elevation species. C. meadii initiated flight at lower body temperatures than C. eriphyle. This result was contrary to expectations that behavior will hinder evolution in fixed physiological differences along climatic gradients. Second, laboratory experiments showed that high-elevation adults had higher survival after heat-shock relative to lower-elevation. In contrast, there were no significant differences in upper thermal limits for eggs from different elevations suggesting the lack of movement did not lead to the evolution of fixed physiological differences in this life stage. Third, I used historic collections of a high-elevation C. meadii to quantify changes over the past 60 years. While mean temperatures during the adult flight have increased significantly, both hind-wing melanin and setal length have also increased. I suggest that this due in part to developmental plasticity; cooler pupal temperature was associated with increased melanin. I propose that this is non-adaptive because pupal temperatures are poor predictors of adult temperatures. Fourth, I quantified seasonal changes in wing melanin for two populations of C. eriphyle. Seasonal change in wing melanin was associated with increases in pupal temperature. In contrast to  C. meadii, pupal temperatures were a good predictor of adult flight season temperature for C. eriphyle. Collectively, my results suggest that behavior does not reduce the importance of physiology and morphology in local adaptation to climate, and that potential for adaptive plasticity in high-elevation ectotherms may be strongly limited by variability and unpredictability in seasonal climate.

T1  - Indigenous Youth as Critical Agents of Biocultural Survivance - Education and Employment in Response to the Challenges of Global Heating and Climate Disruption
AN  - 1686502642
AB  - These are unprecedented times. Like never before, humans, having separated themselves from the web of life through the skillful use of their opposable thumbs, have invented the means of extinction and have systematized it for the benefit of the few at the expense of all else. Yet humans are also designing fixes and alternatives that will soon overcome the straight line trajectory to ugliness and loss that the current order would lead the rest of humanity through. The works in this dissertation are connected by two themes: (1) those humans who happen to be closely connected to the lands, waters and wildlife, through millennia of adaptation and inventive association, have a great deal to share with the rest, who, through history have become distanced from the lands and waters and wildlife they came from; and (2) as the inheritors of all the insults that the current disrespectful and wasteful system is heaping upon all true sensibilities, young people, who are Indigenous, and who are the critical generation for biocultural survival, have an immense role to play—for their cultures, and for all of the rest. The survivance of autochthonous culture through intergenerational conduct of cultural practice and spirituality is profoundly affected by fundamental physical factors of resilience related to food, water, and energy security, and the intergenerational participation of youth. So this work is not so much an indictment of the system as it is an attempt to reveal at least two ways that the work of these young Indigenous people can be expedited: through the transformation of their education so that more of their time as youths is spent focusing on the wonderful attributes of their cultural associations with the lands, waters, and wildlife; and through the creation of a self-sustaining youth owned and operated enterprise that provides needed services to communities so they can adapt to and mitigate the increasingly variable, unpredictable, and dangerous effects and impacts of global heating and climate disruption.

T1  - Evolutionary recovery and the thermodynamic aftermath of horizontal gene transfer in microviruses
AN  - 1685959710
AB  - Experimental evolution has been used to investigate both general and specific evolutionary processes. More recently, it has also been used to resolve protein-protein interactions. Viruses assemble through a series of protein-protein interactions which must remain more favorable than any competing off-pathway reaction. By constructing chimeric viruses with genes or segments of genes from another species, foreign elements are introduced into this system of assembly. Characterization of the resulting chimeras provides information about which proteins interact, the protein-protein interacting interface, the role of particular domains, and the importance of specific residues. Chimeric viruses often exhibit a reduction in fitness, as the foreign element is unable to interact as efficiently in the system as the native element. Through experimental evolution, mutations accumulate that affect interacting partners in the system, leading to a more optimal assembly pathway. The microviruses are well-characterized single-stranded (ss) DNA bacteriophages. They are divided into three clades, represented by &phis;X174, G4, and α3. Incidences of horizontal gene transfer between microvirus clades are unusually rare and may be due to a complex assembly pathway with multiple stages: a foreign element has the potential to disrupt a multitude of morphogenetic steps. In this study, we exchanged major spike genes between the two microvirus species &phis;X174 and G4, then monitored the evolutionary recovery. Results can be interpreted within this thermodynamic paradigm.     Although the G4-&phis;XG chimera could only form plaques at low temperature and exhibited reduced fitness, its evolutionary recovery was relatively straightforward. The other chimera, &phis;X-G4G, could only form plaques when complemented with two wild-type &phis;X174 genes. Isolating a complementation-independent chimera required the passaging of mutants through a series of different environments. The first selection yielded mutations of the largest effects. First, the truncation of a protein involved in DNA synthesis was recovered, resulting in a global decrease in gene expression. Next, a recombination event at the 3’ end of the foreign gene resulted in a modification of the protein’s C-terminus. These mutations were subjected to further analysis to determine why they were so critical at this early stage of experimental evolution. Subsequent passages of the &phis;X-G4G chimera eventually yielded viable strains, with additional mutations affecting stages of late assembly. Overall, results indicate how gene exchange can drastically affect flux through the pathway. When the system is initially perturbed, the process of experimental evolution allows the pathway to return to a normalized state. The mutations isolated during this recovery stage indicates how the flux was initially altered, and how it can be restored.

T1  - The search behavior of sea lamprey during their non-homing reproductive migration in the Great Lakes
AN  - 1680834879
AB  - Non-homing organisms are thought to rely on stable geophysical features (e.g., land-slope), and encounter with distinct attributes of the environment (e.g., landmarks) in a predicable sequence to locate reproductive habitat (e.g., rivers always occur on a coastline). However little is known about how non-homing fishes complete a large-scale migration, as most research has focused on homing fishes that rely on geomagnetic cues to return to a natal spawning site. The invasive sea lamprey offers insight into non-homing migration, as individuals complete a single non-homing migration to rivers following translocation by host fishes in the Great Lakes.      In this dissertation, Chapters 2 and 3, are devoted to developing a framework for describing animal behavior from telemetered observations and development of a standardized approach for assessing and filtering VEMCO Positioning System (VPS) data based on an estimate of horizontal position precision (HPE). This methodology was imperative for exploration of the sea lamprey migration with the underwater VPS telemetry technology.     In Chapter 3, we described how sea lamprey orient to a coast when in a lake and hypothesized that sea lamprey navigate to the nearest coast by (1) orienting to the local bathymetric gradient and (2) maintain straight movements counter to the local slope to move towards shallow water. Three-dimensional (3-D) paths of migrating female sea lamprey were obtained by an acoustic array with 3 km2 of coverage, centered 3.3 km from the coast in Lake Huron. The findings of this chapter indicate that sea lamprey sampled an area of lake-bottom to assess absolute hydrostatic pressure and to select a heading towards reducing pressure (shallower water). In contrast to natal homing migrations, the sea lamprey appears consistent with non-homing orientation to a general region with a simple set of rules based on local topography.     Chapter 4 focused on the sea lamprey migration along a coastline and near a river mouth.  Upon reaching a coastline, sea lampreys move parallel to shore. Prior studies indicated the presence of larval odor in river water increased the likelihood that a migrant entered a river. However, it was not known whether larval odor played a role in navigation (guiding the migrant to the river mouth) or mediated habitat selection by labeling the suitability of a river for spawning. In a two-year study using a 2 km2 acoustic array, the 3-D paths of sea lamprey were documented as they approached, entered, or bypassed the Ocqueoc River in northern Michigan, under one of two conditions: (1) low larval odor; and, (2) higher larval odor, created by increased larval abundance plus the addition of the synthetic larval odor components, petromyzonamine disulfate (PADS), petromyzosterol disulfate (PSDS), and petromyzonol sulfate (PZS) to a 1 x 10 -12 M concentration. A coupled hydrodynamic and dye concentration model predicted the hydraulic conditions experienced by each sea lamprey by estimating water conditions (velocity, temperature, etc.) at each fish position and allowed for assignment of whether a position was inside or outside of the Ocqueoc River plume.  Encounter with river water appears to trigger localized search, regardless of larval odor content. However, when larval odor was abundant, the migrant was more likely to enter the river. Whether a migrant enters a river, is modulated by the presence of detectable larval odor, manipulation of river selection by invasive sea lamprey for management is viable in rivers with high encounter rates. Finally, Chapter 5 covers the implications for how altering migration routes in the sea lamprey via the application of synthesized pheromones contained in larval odor could be profitable for management.

T1  - Living on the edge: tolerance to environmental stressors and reproductive dynamics of the gastropod <i>Crepidula fornicata</i> across the intertidal-subtidal boundary
AN  - 1660534929
AB  - Species' ranges are generally studied on a latitudinal scale, and species are often limited by their tolerance and responsiveness to physical stressors. Many organisms, though, live in the transitional area between terrestrial and marine environments, the intertidal zone. Most of the species that occupy the intertidal zone are of marine descent and many can also be found deep into the subtidal zone where they live their entire lives covered by seawater. Thus, the intertidal zone represents a range boundary for many marine organisms, beyond which they cannot survive. For these organisms, the intertidal range edge is characterized by a suite of stressors associated with aerial exposure that may limit their upper distribution and can ultimately cause them negative physiological impacts; such stressors include desiccation, high aerial temperature, and reduced feeding time, and they are absent only meters away, in the subtidal zone. Comparing particular aspects (e.g. phenotypic traits, fecundity) of adjacent intertidal and subtidal organisms of a single species can provide insight into which factors control the upper distribution of that species in the intertidal zone, the ability of organisms to adapt to stressful intertidal conditions, and the healthiness of the populations that reside there. I investigated some basic biological aspects (thermal tolerance, desiccation tolerance, feeding physiology) of the sessile suspension-feeding gastropod, Crepidula fornicata at Bissel Cove in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA in order to better understand the factors that limit the upper distribution of this species and also the effects of intertidal stressors on the reproductive capacity of these organisms.    I found that high summer temperatures are probably the most important factor limiting the upper distribution of this species, but desiccation stress can be particularly troublesome for very small individuals; reduced available feeding time is probably not a major limiting factor. Intertidal and subtidal  C. fornicata at Bissel Cove had similar upper thermal tolerances, desiccation tolerances, and feeding rates. However, they differed both in their behavior when exposed to the air and in their gill morphology: when immersed, intertidal individuals spent less time with their tissues exposed to the air than did subtidal conspecifics, and intertidal individuals also had relatively larger gills. The stresses associated with intertidal life had no immediate effects on their ability to successfully reproduce. In fact, the breeding season was slightly longer for intertidal individuals of  C. fornicata and their fecundities higher when compared to those of subtidal conspecifics.     Taken together my results suggest that C. fornicata has had a long association with the intertidal zone, and though desiccation and high temperatures are likely keeping them from living high up in the intertidal, the individuals that recruit to the mid/low intertidal are not particularly stressed there as adults. Their high tolerance to environmental stressors and their adaptability may be partially responsible for their extreme success as an invasive species. As global temperatures rise, this species will likely be relegated to the subtidal zone only, but will probably continue to colonize new locations.

T1  - Selective Short Chain Carboxylates Production by Mixed Culture Fermentation
AN  - 2564078323
AB  - The production of short chain carboxylates currently depends on petro-chemical sources. Fossil fuel sources are however depleted fast by growing industry and population. Also, these sources contribute negatively to global warming, climate change and modern human society. Biomass, alternative to fossil fuel, is a sustainable resource and eliminates these negative impacts. Production of organic chemicals from biomass via anaerobic fermentation is not a new technology, e.g. ethanol generation from corn or lactic acid from sugar cane. However, short chain carboxylates are still predominantly produced from oil and gas due to easy accessibility and low oil prices compared to biomass feedstock. Among the biomass resources, organic waste streams are abundant, locally available and have little or no competition with food. Bio-waste, therefore, can be an excellent substitute source for the generation of short chain carboxylates.The current biological processes often convert pure substrates and use single organisms through sterile anaerobic fermentation. This yields high conversion of substrate to a single product in high concentrations and fractions. Substrate cost and sterile operational conditions are two parameters increasing the production cost of bio-based products. In this thesis, the ‘carboxylate platform’ is evaluated as a cost-effective biological technology for the production of short chain carboxylates. The principle of the carboxylate platform is based on the conversion of cheap organic feedstock to a mixture of short chain carboxylates by using non-sterile, mixed culture fermentation.Short chain carboxylates are organic chemicals that can be used in industry directly or as building blocks for other valuable chemicals like alcohols and polymers. Fermentation of biowaste generates abundant short chain carboxylates, acetate, propionate and n-butyrate and a small fraction of valerate, n-caproate and ethanol. The outcome of mixed culture fermentation results in a combination of fermentation products in various amounts, rather than obtaining a maximal total concentration of a single product. It is, thus, important to be able to direct the fermentation process towards a desired major product or combination of products in certain fractions.This thesis describes how mixed culture fermentation processes can be steered towards one specific carboxylate at sufficiently high concentration. Manipulation of environmental conditions or operational parameters and integration of in-situ product recovery technology into the fermentation are considered key parameters to drive the reactions towards a desired end product.In mixed culture fermentation, depending on the substrate type, inocula and headspace composition, and also, process parameters like hydraulic and solid retention time, organic load and pH, carboxylate concentrations and speciation can vary considerably. Thus it is crucial to know how to use these key elements to obtain a desired product or composition of products in the highest concentration(s) possible. Chapter 2 reviews mixed culture fermentations studies dealing with conversion of organic substrates towards carboxylates in batch, fed-batch and continuous reactor configurations. Literature studies report that the use of more concentrated carbohydrate-rich substrates, at longer residence times and at neutral pH ranges stimulates total acid production. The total carboxylate concentration reaches maximum for most of the studies 20 g/L at production rate of 1.5 g/L.h. Exceptionally Fu & Holtzapple (2011) reported a total carboxylate concentration of 40 g/L by eliminating the inhibitory effect of carboxylates on the organisms. They developed a “counter-current” fed-batch operation system to reduce the contact time of carboxylates and organism. Product inhibition was usually reported under too high substrate concentrations at short retention times, or under conditions of feed overloading, and at low pH. When increasing pH to the neutral range, not only total acid concentration, but also acetate and propionate fractions are elevated, though high propionate concentrations and fractions are only reported occasionally. A high n-butyrate fraction > 70% is usually found when pH < 6, at somewhat longer incubation or retention times or high OLRs, under carbon dioxide atmosphere or on high substrates concentrations. Increasing residence times creates a shift from shorter to longer chain fatty acids such as valerate or n-caproate.In this thesis, two major key operational parameters: headspace composition and substrate type were further investigated experimentally in Chapter 3. The aim was to observe to what extent the headspace composition at elevated partial pressures (2 bar) affects the fermentation process, product type and productivity in batch-wise fermentation. Three reactors were adjusted to a final headspace pressure of 2 bar by adding hydrogen, carbon dioxide or a 50:50 (v:v) mixture of these two gases. A control reactor was flushed with nitrogen only at the beginning of the experiment and left it without headspace manipulation. The highest carboxylate concentration was 17 g/L at hydrogen and carbon dioxide mixed pressurized headspace. Here, the acetate fraction reached 85% due to the homoacetogenic activity. However, this condition is not interesting for this study since acetate was formed from hydrogen and carbon dioxide instead of degradation of waste. In the carbon dioxide reactor, the carboxylate concentration was only 3.6 g/L however n-butyrate fraction was 70% at the end of the first week. One of the important targets of this study, the production of one major compound at fractions around 70% from waste streams, was successfully achieved. The carboxylate production in the hydrogen pressurized reactor was 1.5 g/L higher than in the control reactor but product distribution showed equal fractions of acetate and n-butyrate. For the effect of substrate, three different organic waste streams were selected according to their elemental composition and polymer constituents like carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.Carbohydrate waste produced higher carboxylate concentrations compared to protein and lipid wastes. In the protein rich waste, acetate was the main carboxylate and it was produced independently of the headspace. According to literature propionate and i-valerate were the major compounds to be found in protein rich fermentation at neutral pH. In our case the pH was controlled at 5, resulting in mainly acetate production. Lipid rich waste yielded concentrations below 0.5 g/L and was not considered further.In Chapter 4, the study on headspace composition was further investigated at increasing concentration of carbohydrate rich substrate in batch reactor configuration. The concentrations were defined as 8, 13.5 and 23 g COD waste/L. The final target was to define the operational conditions for a continuous process to produce high and stable total carboxylate concentration of a single product with high fraction by mixed culture fermentation. The experiments showed that the most optimal carboxylate production was achieved under the conditions of the highest substrate concentration without any headspace manipulation. Although, the highest carboxylate concentration, 11 g/L, was detected under the hydrogen pressurized headspace, product distribution was not in the direction of a single product. Without headspace control, the total carboxylate level was 9 g/L with 61% n-butyrate fraction. When a continuous reactor was operated at 23 g COD waste/L at 2 days retention time without headspace manipulation, 7 g/L and 71% of stable n-butyrate production over a month of operation was successfully realized.It should be considered that the biological processes can be limited if the final total carboxylate concentration reaches inhibitory levels for mixed culture organisms. In Chapter 5, the process parameters were overviewed for the improvement of carboxylate formation and spectrum with integrated in-situ recovery technology. Here, a novel ‘direct contact' electrodialysis configuration with bipolar membranes was integrated to continuous mixed culture fermentation. The significant achievement of the in-situ integrated fermentation system was that external base addition was completely eliminated; the pH of the reactor was regulated by the bipolar membranes. Preliminary experiments indicated that acetate and propionate productivities were selectively increased among the mixture of carboxylates. The carboxylate productivity only increased 1.5 times, probably because carboxylate levels in the fermenter were lower than expected and the inhibitory effect may thus have been low. The concentration of the product compartment was maximum 3 times the carboxylate level in the reactor. These results were preliminary data of a research on mixed culture set-ups which needs more investigation and optimization.Finally, carboxylate production from organic waste with mixed culture fermentation process was evaluated in Chapter 6. The most important outcome of this research showed that mixed culture fermentation can be steered towards a major short chain carboxylate in fraction of 70% (n-butyrate), by carbon dioxide addition in headspace or high substrate concentrations without headspace manipulation. However, in general total carboxylate concentration doesn’t exceed 20 g/L. In current industrial practice, the concentrations are five times higher. Acetate can be produced at 100 g/L up to 95% by pure cultures. Because products are quite diluted in mixed culture systems, it is required to integrate costly, intensive downstream processing after the fermentation. Mixed culture fermentation should still improve product yields. Finally, mixed culture technologies can be promising if the mixture of carboxylates is used as a precursor for valuable chemical production such as alcohols, polymers or medium chain carboxylates rather than applying complex purifying technologies after the fermentation process.Alternate abstract:De productie van kortketenige carbonzuren gebeurt op dit moment vooral via petrochemische weg. Almaar groeiende wereldbevolking en industrie putten niet enkel de voorraad aan fossiele brandstoffen uit, maar zorgen ook voor opwarming van de aarde, klimaatsveranderingen en een nefaste impact op onze huidige samenleving. Het gebruik van biomassa kan een alternatief voor deze fossiele grondstoffen vormen en op die manier bijdragen tot een duurzame maatschappij.
De productie van organische stoffen uit biomassa via anaerobe fermentatie is geen nieuwe technologie, bijvoorbeeld de productie van ethanol uit mais of productie van melkzuur uit suikerriet. Kortketenige carbonzuren daarentegen worden momenteel in hoofdzaak nog uit olie en gas gemaakt, dankzij de vrije beschikbaarheid en de lage kostprijs van fossiele bronnen in vergelijking met biomassa. Organische afvalstromen zijn het meest overvloedig aanwezig als biomassa bron, ze zijn lokaal beschikbaar en concurreren niet met de voedingsketen. Bioafval kan daarom dan ook bij uitstek als vervanging voor fossiele grondstoffen dienen bij de productie van kortketenige carbonzuren.
De huidige biologische processen gebruiken erg zuivere substraten en reinculturen in zgn. steriele anaerobe fermentaties. Deze zorgen voor een hoge omzettingsgraad van het substraat naar één enkel product in hoge concentraties. De kosten voor het substraat en de steriele procesomstandigheden leiden tot een hoge productiekost van dergelijke bio-gebaseerde producten. In deze thesis wordt het ‘carboxylaat-platform’ geëvalueerd als kosteneffectieve biologische technologie voor de productie van kortketenige carbonzuren. Het carboxylaatplatform is gebaseerd op de omzetting van organische stromen tot een mengsel van kortketenige vetzuren door middel van een niet-steriele fermentatie met gemengde culturen.
Korteketenvetzuren worden in de industrie gebruikt, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij als bouwstoffen voor andere, waardevolle chemicaliën zoals alcoholen en polymeren. Fermentatie van bioafval levert vooral, azijnzuur, propionzuur, n-boterzuur en een kleinere fractie valeraat, n-caproaat en ethanol. De gemengde fermentatie –zoals toegepast in dit onderzoek- resulteert steeds in een waaier aan producten, veeleer dan één bepaalde stof. Daarom is het belangrijk om dit type fermentatie te sturen naar één bepaald product of een combinatie van een aantal producten in bepaalde fracties.
Deze thesis beschrijft hoe gemengde fermentatieprocessen gestuurd kunnen worden naar één specifiek carbonzuur in een voldoende hoge concentratie. Manipulatie van de procescondities en integratie van in-situ product winning in de fermentatie zijn de sleutel om de fermentatiereacties te sturen naar één bepaald product.
In gemengde fermentatie hebben inoculum en samenstelling van de headspace, samen met proces parameters zoals verblijftijd, organische belasting en pH, een belangrijke invloed op het type en de concentratie van de carbonzuren. Het is dan ook van belang te weten hoe deze parameters kunnen gebruikt worden om bepaalde producten te bekomen in zo hoog mogelijke concentraties. Hoofdstuk 2 bespreekt de beschikbare literatuur met betrekking tot gemengde fermentaties waarbij organische substraten worden omgezet in carbonzuren, in batch, fedbatch en continue reactoren. De literatuur beschrijft dat het gebruik van geconcentreerde substraten, rijk aan koolwaterstoffen, lange verblijftijden en neutrale pH de productie van organische zuren stimuleert. De totale carbonzuurconcentratie bedraagt maximaal 20g/l bij een productiesnelheid van 1.5g/L.h. Uitzondering hierop zijn de resultaten van Fu&Holtzapple (2011) die spreken over zuurconcentraties tot 40 g/L wanneer het inhiberende effect van de carbonzuren op de organismen geëlimineerd wordt. Ze ontwikkelden een tegenstroom reactorconcept om de contacttijd van de gevormde zuren met de organismen te beperken. Product inhibitie komt immers meestal voor bij erg hoge substraatconcentratie en korte verblijftijden, bij te hoge organische belasting of bij lage pH. Wanneer gewerkt wordt bij neutrale pH, verhoogt niet alleen de totale zuurconcentratie, maar ook de azijnzuur- en propionzuurfracties, alhoewel hoge propionzuurconcentratie slechts af en toe gemeld worden. Een hoge boterzuurfractie (>70%) wordt meestal ofwel bereikt bij pH<6 en iets langere incubatie- of verblijftijden en een hoge organische belasting, ofwel onder CO2 atmosfeer ofwel bij hoge substraatconcentratie. Verhogen van de verblijftijden levert vooral een verschuiving op van korte naar langere vetzuurketens, zoals valeraat of n-caproaat.
In hoofstuk 3 van deze thesis worden twee belangrijke operationele parameters verder onderzocht en beschreven: samenstelling van de headspace en substraattype. Het doel was om na te gaan in welke mate een verhoging van de partiële druk in de headspace (2bar) bij een batchfermentatie het proces, het product type en de productiviteit beïnvloedt. Drie reactoren werden op 2 bar druk gebracht respectievelijk met waterstof, stikstof en een mengsel van gelijke hoeveelheden waterstof en stikstof. Een controlereactor werd gespoeld met stikstof bij het begin van het experiment en nadien ongemoeid gelaten. De hoogste carbonzuurconcentratie werd gemeten bij de reactor met de waterstof en stikstof in de headspace en bedroeg 17 g/L. In deze reactor bedroeg de azijnzuurfractie 85%, tengevolge van homoacetogenese. Het azijnzuur werd dus in dit geval gevormd werd door omzetting van waterstof en koolstofdioxide in plaats van het de organische componenten, aanwezig in het substraat, wat niet gewenst was in het licht van deze studie. In de reactor onder CO2- atmosfeer, was de totale carbonzuurconcentratie slechts 3.6 g/L; hoewel de butyraatfractie 70% bedroeg aan het einde van de eerste week. Bij deze was ook één van de belangrijke doelen van deze studie –het bereiken van carbonzuurfracties rond 70% bij gemengde fermentatie met afvalstromen- bereikt. De carbonzuurproductie in de reactor gevuld met waterstof was 1.5 g/L hoger dan in de controlereactor, maar met gelijke fracties acetaat en nbutyraat. Om het effect van verschillende substraten na te gaan werden drie verschillende afvalstromen geselecteerd, volgens hun concentratie aan koolwaterstoffen, eiwitten en vetten. Afval met een hoog koolwaterstofgehalte leidde tot hogere carbonzuurconcentraties in vergelijking met proteïne- en vetrijke afvalstromen. Bij proteïne-rijke stromen werd vooral azijnzuur gevormd, onafhankelijk van de condities en samenstelling van de headspace. Volgens literatuur zou in dit geval vooral propionaat en i-valeraat gevormd worden bij neutrale pH. In ons geval werd bij pH 5 gewerkt, wat vooral in azijnzuurproductie resulteerde. Vetrijke afvalstromen leverden carbonzuurconcentraties lager dan 0.5 g/L op en werden dan ook verder buiten beschouwing gelaten in het onderzoek.
Hoofdstuk 4 beschrijft het onderzoek naar de invloed van de samenstelling van de headspace op de batch fermentatie bij stijgende concentratie van het substraat rijk aan koolwaterstoffen. De substraatconcentraties bedroegen 8, 13.5 en 23 g/L. Het doel was te bepalen welke operationele condities nodig zijn in een continu proces om een hoge, stabiele, concentratie van één bepaald carbonzuur te bereiken. Uit de experimenten bleek dat dit het geval was bij de hoogste substraatconcentratie, zonder toevoeging van gassen in de headspace. Alhoewel de hoogste carbonzuurconcentratie (11 g/L) bereikt werd bij toevoeging van waterstof in de headspace werd enkel een mengsel van verschillende organische zuren gevormd, in plaats van één bepaald zuur. Zonder manipulatie van de headspace bedroeg de zuurconcentratie 9 g/L met 61% n-butyraat. Wanneer een continue reactor gedurende een maand werd bedreven zonder toevoeging van gassen in de headspace, gevoed met 23 g/L substraat en een verblijftijd van 2 dagen, kon een concentratie van 7 g/L en 71% n-butyraat bereikt worden in een stabiele procesvoering.
Bij hogere carbonzuurconcentraties kunnen de biologische processen bij gemengde culturen gelimiteerd of geïnhibeerd worden. Hoofdstuk 5 beschrijft de proces parameters bij zgn. ‘in-situ recovery’ van de organische zuren uit het fermentatiemedium met als doel het verhogen van de productiviteit in de reactor. Een nieuwe technologie, ‘direct contact’ elektrodialyse met gebruik van bipolaire membranen werd geïntegreerd in de continue fermentor. Door deze ingreep kon de toevoeging van base in de reactor volledig worden geëlimineerd: de pH werd nu volledig gecontroleerd door productie van base aan het bipolaire membraan. De eerste experimenten toonden dat de azijnzuur- en propionzuurproductie selectief verhoogden ten opzichte van andere carbonzuren. De totale productie van carbonzuren verhoogde slechts met 50%, waarschijnlijk omdat de carbonzuurconcentraties in de fermentor en bijgevolg het inhiberend effect op de organismen lager waren dan verwacht. De zuurconcentratie in het productcompartiment van de elektrodialyse was drie keer hoger dan deze van de reactor. Deze resultaten waren de eerste gegevens in een onderzoek naar koppeling van fermentatie en scheiding in fermentor met gemengde culturen. Verder onderzoek en optimalisatie zijn hier duidelijk aan de orde.
In hoofdstuk 6 wordt de productie van organische zuren uit afvalstromen samengevat. De belangrijkste bevinding uit dit onderzoek is dat de gemengde fermentatie gestuurd kan worden naar productie van één enkel vetzuur, n-butyraat, bij toevoeging van koolstofdioxide in de headspace óf bij toepassing van hoge substraatconcentratie. In deze gevallen wordt een nbutyraat fractie bekomen van 70%. De totale zuurconcentratie blijft echter beperkt tot 20 g/L. Bij de huidige industriële toepassingen liggen de concentraties zo’n 5 keer hoger. Via reinculturen kan bijvoorbeeld 100 g/L azijnzuur geproduceerd worden met 95% zuiverheid. Vermits de producten bij gemengde fermentatie steeds verdund aanwezig zijn is een uitgebreide –en bijgevolg dure- nabehandeling nodig. Ook de opbrengst zou nog verhoogd moeten worden om deze processen industrieel relevant te maken. Gemengde fermentatie kan ontwikkelen tot een veel belovende technologie indien het mengsel van carbonzuren rechtstreeks gebruikt kan worden als precursor voor de productie van waardevolle chemicaliën zoals alcoholen, polymeren of middellange keten vetzuren.

T1  - Advances for the Aquaculture of the Australasian Sea Cucumber Australostichopus mollis
AN  - 2284929958
AB  - In this thesis the response of wild juvenile Australasian sea cucumber, Australostichopus mollis to changes in food availability and temperature was evaluated in the laboratory and used as a proxy for hatchery and grow-out scenarios. The effect of food availability in terms of organic matter content (1, 4, 12 and 20 percent TOM) was evaluated in terms of feeding behaviour (diurnal variation of ingestion rate and digestion), feeding biology (TOM selection from the food and absorption along the digestive tract) and growth. The effect of temperature (15, 18, 21 and 24 C) was evaluated through changes in their metabolism (oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion), feeding behaviour, growth and macronutrient utilization (lipid, protein, and carbohydrate selection from the food and absorption along the digestive tract), with the determination of an energy budget for each temperature treatment. Finally, the effect of temperature and the presence/absence of seawater during the transport of juvenile sea cucumbers were also evaluated by measuring their subsequent feeding activity and overall well-being (i.e., skin lesions, evisceration and survival) after exposure to the different transport conditions. The juvenile sea cucumbers feed more actively during night than day without changing their digestive activity. They are able to cope with a wide variation of TOM in their diet (from 4 to 20 percent TOM) in order to generate similar growth rates. The juveniles were able to compensate for the lower nutrient content and absorption in the 4 percent TOM treatment by increasing their selective feeding behaviour and ingestion rate. However, this was not observed in the juveniles fed with the 1 percent TOM treatment for which their body weight declined during the course of the experiment. Temperature was also found to be an important factor for the juveniles of this species. Temperature of around 24 C turned out to be lethal for the juveniles, and the sea cucumbers responded negatively to increasing holding temperatures from 15 to 21 C, which resulted in increased metabolism, reduced food intake and energy available for growth. The metabolism data showed that the juveniles rely more on protein as an energy source than lipid and carbohydrates regardless of the temperature. In terms of macronutrient selection and absorption, the juvenile sea cucumbers select and absorb lipid more efficiently than carbohydrate and protein at all experimental temperatures. Although selection and absorption of ingested nutrients are negatively affected by an increase of holding temperature from 15 to 21 C, carbohydrate and protein remained as the dominant dietary macronutrients that are absorbed by the juveniles. Higher temperatures (i.e., above 17 C) also proved to be negative for the successful transportation of juveniles due to an increase in their metabolism. However, lower temperatures (i.e., below 10 C) are also detrimental for the feeding activity, increasing the appearance of skin lesions, evisceration and mortality and therefore also affect transportation success. Nonetheless, the results obtained indicate that the juveniles can be transported for short periods of time without seawater if desiccation is avoided. Transport of juveniles for longer periods of time (i.e., more than 8 hours) is possible provided they are kept with seawater and temperature is maintained within a suitable range (i.e., 12 - 15 C). Providing a better understanding of the feeding biology and growth of the juveniles and how they are affected by extrinsic factors, will help not only to improve the holding conditions of juveniles in the hatchery and nursery stage, but also help the selection of suitable aquaculture locations for grow-out, management of stocking densities, feeding regimes and the development of artificial diets.

T1  - Experimental evolution of life-history: testing the evolutionary theories of ageing
AN  - 2002219068
AB  - Ageing reduces fitness, but how ageing evolves is still unclear. Evolutionary theory of ageing hinges on the fundamental principal that the force of natural selection declines with age. This principle has yielded two important predictions: 1) the evolution of faster ageing in populations under high rate of extrinsic mortality; and 2) the evolution of faster ageing in a sex that experiences higher rates of extrinsic mortality. However, an emerging new theory argues that when the extrinsic mortality is not random but instead selects on traits showing positive genetic correlation with lifespan, increased mortality should lead to the evolution of increased lifespan. Such condition-dependent mortality is also expected to increase the robustness in the population, resulting in increased deceleration of mortality in late-life. Similarly, high sex-specific mortality can result in increased sex-specific selection on traits that have positive pleiotropic effects on lifespan in the affected sex. This thesis is based on two experimental evolution studies in Caenorhabditis remanei. The first experiment was designed to disentangle the effects of the rate (high or low) and the source (random or condition-dependent) of mortality on the evolution of lifespan and ageing. Reduced lifespan evolved under high rate of random mortality, whereas high condition-dependent mortality, imposed by heat-shock, led to the evolution of increased lifespan (Paper I). However, while female reproduction increased under condition-dependent mortality, male reproduction suffered, suggesting a role for sexual antagonism in maintaining genetic variation for fitness (Paper II). Besides, long lifespan and high fecundity evolved at a cost of slow juvenile growth rate in females (Paper III). Moreover, high condition-dependent mortality led to the evolution of lower rate of intrinsic mortality in late-life (Paper IV). The second experiment showed that evolution of sexual dimorphism in lifespan is driven by the factors that cause sex-specific mortality and cannot be predicted from differences in mortality rate alone. Specifically, high condition-dependent mortality renders males less prone to ageing than females despite higher rates of male mortality (Paper V). The strength of this thesis is the reconfirmation of the earlier findings combined with support for the new theory. Rather than further complicating the matter, the inclusion of the new ideas should help explain some empirical results that are inconsistent with the classic theory, as well as provide a more comprehensive picture of ageing evolution.

T1  - Plasticity, Intraspecific Variability and Local Adaptation to Climatic Extreme Events of Ecotypes/Provenances of Key Plant Species
AN  - 1966928245
AB  - Climate change, and especially an increase of magnitude and frequency of climatic extreme events such as drought periods or heatwaves, will alter growing conditions for plants in the future. Persistent ecosystems, with long-living organisms, such as forest or permanent grassland will be particularly impacted by this development. The velocity of these changes is likely to occur at a pace which species may not be able to keep track with by natural dispersal or genetic adaptation. Agriculture, forestry and ecosystem management must develop counteracting practices to secure the persistence and functioning of these ecosystems and thus their provision of goods and services. Therefore it is important to develop a better understanding how species and ecosystems may respond to future climatic stressors. Impact assessments, e.g. via climatic envelope modelling are prone to misinterpretations of the adaptive capacity of species, as they do not incorporate the intraspecific genetic and phenotypic differences that exist within the populations across the distribution range of a species. Yet, intraspecific variation may exhibit potential tools for the development of climate change adaptation strategies. Here, I focus on key ecosystems in Central Europe. In particular the selective use of plant provenances or ecotypes may help to make ecosystems climate-resilient without a potentially more problematic introduction of exotic species. Especially provenances from warmer, drought-prone regions, with a current climate similar to the projected one for Central Europe recently came into focus as potential substitutes for local provenances, as they might have developed local adaptations to climate conditions at their location of origin. Insights about the response of these provenances to changing averages and extreme event regimes are crucial for a reasonable use of within-species diversity in climate change adaptation. First, the concept of assisted colonization or migration of species or ecotypes and the role it can play as an adaptation strategy in agriculture, forestry or nature conservation is introduced (Manuscript 1). It is suggested that a focus should be laid on keystone species that ensure ecosystem persistence and functioning as they govern the habitat structure and microclimate of a site. The assisted colonization of pre-adapted ecotypes of keystone species from climates similar to future projections for the target site is proposed. Furthermore, provenances of selected grassland and forest key-species were exposed to drought and warming in two experiments in Bayreuth and Landau, and their ecological responses were analysed. Results suggest that local adaptations to climatic stressors exist. However, the magnitude and direction of responses strongly depend on species and climatic variables. For grassland species, e.g. differences in drought sensitivity could be demonstrated in some cases (Manuscript 4). Fagus sylvatica exhibited differences between the provenances in response to drought conditions, as well (Manuscript 3). It seems that marginal provenances, from the dry margins of the distribution range, show less increment reduction due to the drought treatment. Yet, under more favourable conditions of water supply these provenances did not yield the same high increment rates than more central provenances, indicating a trade-off between stability under stress and yield under non-stress conditions. A pine species that is generally considered to be rather drought-resistant, Pinus nigra, which is a potential substitute for climate-threatened conifers on dry sites in Central Europe, did not show any differences in response to drought and warming (Manuscript 2), maybe due to a weak selective pressure as a result of high drought-resistance across the whole distribution range. The impacts of drought on increment became not visible before the second year after the treatment, stressing the need for more long-time experiments in climate impact research. Even in a generally warmer environment, cold extremes in winter or spring are expected still to prevail in the future. Therefore, the provenances of the selected species were tested for their cold-hardiness and late frost resistance (Manuscripts 5-7). Growth of the grassland species and F. sylvatica were negatively impacted by a late frost event and differences in late-frost sensitivity between provenances or ecotypes were identified. The (sub-) mediterranean species P. nigra showed differences between provenances in their winter cold hardiness. Correlations between performance under cold stress and winter conditions or late frost proneness of the places of origin could be established for almost all species. However, preceding climate experience, such as the warming or drought treatment of the plants altered their reaction to cold extremes compared to the control treatment, indicating the complexity of the interactive impacts of climate factors on ecosystem and plant performance. The uncertainty of climate projections and the multitude of changing climatic stressors, though, make the prospect of an easy and rapid success in the search for single “best-adapted” provenances very questionable. In economics the portfolio effect shows that a diversification of investments decreases the risk of a total loss of profits. Hence, in a modelling procedure based on the increment data from the above mentioned experiment it was tested if a “portfolio investment” in several provenances in one stand decreases the risk of yield losses (Manuscript 8). Results indicate that the higher the number of provenances the higher the chance for a “best-performer” to be included in the set. So the likelihood of higher yields, under different climatic conditions increases, yet the risk of low yields stays stable. Generally, it seems that the selective use of plant species and ecotypes in climate change adaptation can be a feasible tool to maintain ecosystem functionality and productivity. However, the uncertain projections, the multitude of climatic stressors and their interplay with other environmental factors and the potential impacts of assisted colonization of ecotypes on the genetic diversity within species and populations require further research.Alternate abstract:Der Klimawandel, und vor allem Veränderungen in Auftretenswahrscheinlichkeit und Intensität von Extremereignissen, wie Dürren oder Hitzewellen, werden die Wuchsbedingungen für Pflanzen künftig stark ändern. Hochstete Ökosysteme, wie extensiv genutztes Grünland oder Wälder mit langlebigen Organismen werden besonders betroffen von diesen Veränderungen.  Die Geschwindigkeit mit der sich dieser Wandel vollzieht, macht es für viele Arten schwer bis unmöglich durch Arealverschiebung oder genetische Anpassung Schritt zuhalten.  Vor diesem Hintergrund muss die Land- und Forstwirtschaft Gegenmaßnahmen entwickeln, die die Funktion dieser Ökosysteme erhalten und die Erträge und die Bereitstellung von ökosystemaren Dienstleistungen sichern. Das Wissen um die Auswirkungen klimatischer Stressfaktoren auf Arten und Ökosysteme ist daher unerlässlich. Die Einschätzung solcher Auswirkungen, z.B. durch Klimahüllenmodellierung, berücksichtigt die innerartliche genetische Vielfalt und phänotypische Plastizität, die innerhalb und zwischen Populationen existiert, in der Regel nicht, was zu Fehleinschätzungen der Anpassungsfähigkeit führen kann. Diese innerartliche Variation kann jedoch ein wichtiges Werkzeug darstellen, wenn es um die Klimaanpassung von Ökosystemen in Mitteleuropa geht. Dieser Studie konzentriert sich auf Schlüsselökosysteme in Mitteleuropa. Die selektive Nutzung von Herkünften oder Ökotypen wichtiger Schlüsselarten kann eventuell dazu beitragen Ökosysteme resilienter gegenüber negativen Klimaeinflüssen zu machen, ohne dabei die oft problematische Einführung von exotischen Pflanzenarten in Kauf nehmen zu müssen. Dabei geraten besonders Herkünfte aus wärmeren und trockeneren Gegenden, mit Klimabedingungen ähnlich zu den für Mitteleuropa prognostizierten in den Fokus, da diese eher solche Bedingungen angepasst sein könnten. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu wissen, wie verschieden Herkünfte auf sich verändernde Mittelwerte und Klimaextreme reagieren, um dieses Mittel vernünftig einsetzen zu können. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird das Konzept der Assisted Colonization vorgestellt und beschrieben welche Rolle es in Land- und  Forstwirtschaft und im Naturschutz spielen könnte (Manuskript 1). Es wird dargelegt. Dass dabei vor allem Schlüsselarten im Fokus stehen sollten, da sie oftmals Habitatstrukturen und Mikroklima und damit auch Bestand und Funktion von Ökosystemen bestimmen. Die gezielte Einfuhr von angepassten Ökotypen aus Regionen in denen heute Klimabedingungen herrschen, wie sie für die Zielregionen prognostiziert werden, wird hierbei zu Diskussion gestellt.  Weiterhin wurden Herkünfte ausgewählter Grünland- und Baumarten in einem Topfexperiment künstlicher Dürre und Erwärmung ausgesetzt, um deren Reaktion darauf zu messen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es lokale Anpassungen an klimatische Stressfaktoren gibt, diese jedoch artspezifisch variieren und stark von der jeweiligen Klimavariable abhängen. Unterschiede in der Dürreresistenz zwischen verschiedenen Herkünften mancher Grasarten (Manuskript 4), sowie zwischen Herkünften der Rot-Buche (Manuskript 3) konnten dabei nachgewiesen werden. Vor allem bei der Rot-Buche scheinen Herkünfte vom trockenen Rand des Verbreitungsgebietes weniger stark auf Dürre zu reagieren wie Herkünfte aus dem Zentrum des Verbreitungsgebietes. Jedoch konnten diese „Rand-Herkünfte“ unter günstigen, ausreichend wasserversorgten Bedingungen auch nicht so hohe Ertragsleistungen erzielen. Hier geht Stabilität unter Stressbedingungen anscheinend auf Kosten hoher Erträge unter günstigen Bedingungen. Herkünfte der Schwarz-Kiefer, einer generell dürreangepassten Art, die als möglicher Ersatz für gefährdete Nadelbaumarten auf Trockenstandorten in Mitteleuropa gilt,  unterschieden sich nicht in ihrer Reaktion auf Trockenheit und Erwärmung (Mauskript 2), was durch einen schwachen Selektionsdruck aufgrund einer allgemeinen hohen Dürreresistent im gesamten Verbreitungsgebiet erklärt werden könnte.  Die Zuwachsleistung reagierte jedoch erst im zweiten Jahr auf das Dürreereignis. Dies unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit von langfristig angelegten Klimaexperimenten um die Auswirkungen von extremen richtig beurteilen zu können. In einem weiteren Schritt, wurden die Herkünfte der genannten Arten auf ihre Frosthärte und Spätfrosttoleranz getestet, da solche Ereignisse auch in unter höheren Durchschnittstemperaturen dennoch möglich sein werden (Manuskripte 5-7). Spätfrostereignisse führten zu einem geringeren Wachstum bei den Grasarten als auch bei der Rot-Buche und Unterschiede zwischen den Herkünften in der Spätfrosttoleranz konnten aufgezeigt werden. Auch die Herkünfte der (sub-)mediterran verbreiteten Schwarz-Kiefer unterschieden sich in ihrer Frosthärte. Die Performance unter Kältestress korrelierte bei fast allen Arten mit Minimumtemperaturen in Winter oder Frühling in den Herkunftsorten der verschiedenen Provenienzen. Interessanterweise beeinflussten die „Klimaerfahrungen“ der Pflanzen, sprich die vorausgehenden Temperatur- und Dürremanipulationen, die Reaktion auf Frost, was die Komplexität des Zusammenspiels von verschiedenen Klimafaktoren und deren Auswirkung auf Arten und Ökosysteme deutlich macht. Die Unsicherheit der Klimaprojektionen und die Vielzahl sich verändernder Klimafaktoren machen die Suche nach einzelnen bestangepassten Herkünften jedoch nicht sehr erfolgversprechend. In den Wirtschaftswissenschaften beschreibt der Portfolio-Effekt die Risikominimierung durch eine Streuung der Investitionen. In dieser Arbeit, wurde in einem Modell, basierend auf den Zuwachsdaten aus oben genannten Experiment, getestet, ob eine „Portfolio-Investition“ in mehrere Herkünfte innerhalb eines Bestandes  das Risiko von großen Zuwachsverlusten unter Stressbedingungen minimieren kann (Manuskript 8). Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass mit steigender Anzahl von Herkünften die Chance steigt eine „Super-Herkunft“ im „Portfolio“ zu haben. Das bedeutet, dass die Chance auf hohe Erträge unter verschiedenen Klimabedingungen steigt mit steigender Zahl Herkünfte, das Risiko niedriger Erträge jedoch gleich bleibt. Abschließend lässt sich sagen, dass die selektive Nutzung von Herkünften oder Ökotypen durchaus ein geeignetes Mittel zur Klimaanpassung sein kann. Die Unsicherheiten der Klimaprognosen, die Vielzahl klimatischer Stressfaktoren und deren Interaktion mit anderen Umweltfaktoren, sowie die Auswirkung von Assisted Colonization auf die genetische Vielfalt innerhalb von Populationen und Arten, macht jedoch weitere Forschung notwendig.

T1  - Genetic and neuronal systems that are critical for high temperature avoidance in reflexive and learned behaviors
AN  - 1823670029
AB  - In a variable temperature world, there is selective advantage to being able to either tolerate or escape from bad conditions and learn from experience to avoid future bad events. Within species there are multiple strategies to survive and prevent future harmful events, but how organisms allocate genetic resources to tolerance and learning strategies is far from clear. High temperatures can be used to examine multiple genetic bases of tolerance and avoidance of places predictive of aversive high temperature exposure in Drosophila.    Natural variations at the foraging (for) locus provide flies with distinct behavioral strategies for survival.  Drosophila with natural variants of the for locus are known to behave differently in the presence of food; the heat box was used to observe behavior in an aversive environment. I examined locomotion in rover (forR) and  sitter (fors) flies for differences in high temperature induced incapacitation to test the idea that trade-offs in high temperature survival strategies might exist with key polymorphisms at this locus.   Serotonin is one of the primary biogenic amines in Drosophila  implicated in operant place learning. Although serotonergic cell bodies and innervations patterns have been identified, relationships between cell bodies and the associated neurite projections are still not well established. Unambiguously assigning innervation patterns to specific neuronal cell bodies is the first step to understanding the anatomical organization of serotonergic neurons. Thus I have begun to identify subsystems of serotonergic systems by generating transcription activator and repressor elements.   I used the heat box paradigm to investigate both neuronal circuitry and genetic bases for operant conditioning in Drosophila, providing new insight into the fly’s ability to learn and remember to avoid a high temperature-associated place in a simple environment. Using transcription activator and repressor elements, I have identified a subsystem of serotonergic neurons necessary and sufficient for place memory after direct conditioning but not after preexposure to aversive temperatures.   This dissertation work has served to identify both a subsystem of serotonergic neurons involved in learned avoidance of high temperature-associated places and tradeoffs in survival strategies employed by Drosophila when presented with a high temperature.

T1  - Polar bear distribution and habitat selection in western Hudson Bay
AN  - 1784863455
AB  - Sea ice in Hudson Bay is melting earlier and freezing later as the climate warms, resulting in declines in the condition, survival, and population size of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the Western Hudson Bay population. The objectives of this study are to analyze temporal variation in distribution and quantify patterns of seasonal habitat selection for polar bears on the sea ice in Hudson Bay to determine how they respond to changing sea ice conditions. Between 1990 and 2010, 137 satellite collars were deployed on 125 adult females yielding approximately 95 000 locations. Utilization distributions and a habitat selection model were developed. Distribution shifted seasonally and annually, and habitat selection was most affected by ice concentrations. Individual differences were most apparent during ice freeze-up and break-up. This research helps us understand how changes in sea ice alter polar bear habitat use and selection, important for predicting responses to future changes.

T1  - Reproduction in a changing ocean: the effects of ocean acidification and other environmental stressors on the sea urchin paracentrotus lividus and the polychaete ficopomatus enigmaticus
AN  - 1779550844
AB  - Atmospheric CO enrichment is a key factor contributing to global climate 2 change. Major consequences of climate change include increasing sea surface temperature and decreasing seawater pH (ocean acidification) – both of which are predicted to lead to an increase in ocean hypoxic events. Early ontogenetic stages of invertebrates have shown sensitivity to these environmental changes. Previous research has focused on short-term exposure to these environmental factors; however, the long- term and multi-generational effects of ocean acidification on organismal reproduction and development have received little attention. The aim of this thesis is to address this shortcoming for reproduction and early embryonic development of the economically- and ecologically-important sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus (Lamark, 1816) and the reef-forming invasive polychaete, Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel, 1923). Fertilisation success and early embryogenesis of P. lividus were negatively impacted under conditions of increased pCO, at ambient temperature and ambient 2 +2°C after 12 months exposure. Sperm motility – determined by computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) – showed a significant increase in average swimming speed measured as curvilinear velocity (VCL) at increased pCO levels after 6 months but by 2 12 months VCL values had decreased. There was no overall significant effect of pCO 2 on VCL but there was a significant reduction in fertilisation success under hypoxic conditions. Increasing pCO levels appeared to buffer the effects of hypoxia, however, 2 with significantly lower fertilisation success observed only under hypoxic conditions at ambient pCO. Multi-generational experiments examined the effects of increased pCO on 2 F.enigmaticus. Both percentage sperm motility and sperm VCL were similar between experimental treatments, but there was a significant difference between generations 0 and 2. In contrast, fertilisation success was negatively affected by both pH and generation, with a significant reduction seen with pH at all generations and a significant reduction seen between generation 0 and generation 2. Oocyte diameter was also significantly affected by pH and generation, with a significant increase in egg diameter seen at generation 1 in all pH treatments except pH 7.95, which shows a significant increase and generation 2, which suggests differing levels of maternal investment. This research suggests that in the long term, ocean acidification, temperature and hypoxia may seriously impact the reproduction and development of two important marine invertebrate species. This research highlights the need for further long-term investigation involving multiple stressors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term effects arising from changing oceanic chemistry.

T1  - Robustness, Structure and Thermotolerance: Experimental Evolution of the RNA Virus Phi6
AN  - 1660985414
AB  - My thesis used experimental evolution of the RNA virus &phis;6 to examine mechanisms of adaptation. I focused on a trade-off in the virus between the evolution of increased thermotolerance and reduced reproduction on its host. Through the use of structural and biochemical approaches, I was able to trace how a change in the genotype caused a change in the phenotype of the virus. I also examined how genetic and environmental robustness are linked in viruses.    In my introductory chapter, I examined trade-offs in viruses with a particular focus on trade-offs between reproduction and survival. I highlighted how experimental evolution can reveal trade-offs and their associated mechanisms. I reviewed how various factors such as environmental stressors, proteins governing host range and organization of the virus genome affect reproduction/survival tradeoffs. I provided an explanation for why the 'curse of the pharaoh' (viruses with high virulence and extreme stability) would generally only apply to viruses of eukaryotes and not to bacteriophage. Finally, I discussed how a synthesis of comparative biology, experimental evolution and structural biology will be necessary to answer future questions in how viral trade-offs evolve and the constraints on adaptation.   In my second chapter, I experimentally evolved an RNA virus, the bacteriophage &phis;6, to withstand higher temperatures imposed by a heat shock, which caused high mortality. Viruses exposed to the heat shock evolved higher survival at the cost of reduced efficiency of killing their host, Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. I discovered a single amino acid substitution (V207F) in the lysin protein, P5, which was present in all the evolved thermotolerant populations. I demonstrated that this mutation increased the stability of P5 by filling a hydrophobic pocket, which explained the increased thermotolerance in the virus. However, there was no difference in activity between the mutant and wildtype protein. This suggested that the reproduction/survival trade-off in the virus was not mediated by a stability/activity trade-off in a single protein but rather was due to other factors such as capsid assembly or protein-protein interactions. Additionally, crystallization of P5 identified P5 as a lytic transglycosylase.   In my third chapter, I examined how genetic robustness, the maintenance of phenotype despite mutation, affected the rate of adaptation. I took populations of &phis;6, which had previously been characterized as differing in robustness and evolved them through a repeated environmental disturbance: a heat shock. More robust populations evolved faster to withstand the heat shock and achieved relatively greater thermotolerance by the end of the experiment compared to less robust (brittle) populations. Sequencing identified adaptive mutations and showed that a particular mutation was absent in some brittle populations. This chapter showed how increased robustness could lead to increased evolvability as robust populations can more easily access mutations of large benefit.   In my fourth chapter, I examined the relationship between genetic robustness and environmental robustness in viruses. Although the link between these two types of robustness has been demonstrated at other levels of biological organization such as proteins, empirical data is lacking in viruses and other organisms. I took viruses which differed in environmental robustness, as measured by their survival to extreme temperature, and performed a mutation accumulation experiment on 95 individual lines. By measuring the change in fitness of these evolved lines, I showed that more environmentally robust viruses were also more genetically robust as they suffered less fitness loss following mutation accumulation. Finally, I presented a model, drawing on my previous structural chapter, showing how environmental robustness and genetic robustness are linked in viruses.   In my fifth and final chapter, I performed an extended evolution experiment adapting &phis;6 to repeated heat shocks for 140 days. I found many parallel mutations suggesting that at least four different proteins contribute to the evolution of increased thermotolerance. During the course of the 140-day experiment, three out of eight treatment populations went extinct as the heat shock temperature was increased. I showed how initial mutations constrained future adaptation destining these three populations for extinction. The large number of potentially adaptive mutations discovered by this study will provide a springboard for future work, which will allow a mechanistic description of the fitness landscape of mutations in &phis;6 contributing to thermotolerance.

T1  - Introgression, natural selection, and thermal tolerance in blue mussels (<i>Genus mytilus</i>)
AN  - 1655594723
AB  - My dissertation addressed questions of the origin and maintenance of biodiversity, and the genomic response to environmental change in blue mussels (genus Mytilus). In chapters One and Two I explored the nature of species barriers and the consequence of hybridization. The ecological and genetic factors determining the extent of introgression between species in secondary contact zones remain poorly understood. I investigated the relative importance of natural selection and the demographic expansion of invasive  Mytilus galloprovincialis on the magnitude and the direction of introgression with the native M. trossulus in a hybrid zone in central California. I used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to genotype 1,751 randomly-selected single nucleotide polymorphisms and accurately distinguish early and advanced generation hybrids for the first time in Mytilus. I found that ecologically based selection plays only a small direct role in maintaining reproductive isolation in the California hybrid zone, and that colonization history is an important control on the movement of genetic elements (i.e. introgression) during hybridization. Despite only low rates of hybridization between invasive Mediterranean blue mussel (M. galloprovincialis) and native blue mussel  M. trossulus, introgression is occurring, and the geographic spread of M. galloprovincialis appears to drive the majority of introgression into the invasive species. My work reinforces the idea that demographic processes mediate the role played by natural selection in maintaining species barriers.      Chapter Three focused on the genetic consequences of large-scale environmental change. I developed new techniques using mRNA sequencing and ancestral state reconstruction to estimate rates of structurally stabilizing substitutions in blue mussels. I found that warm-adapted Mytilus galloprovincialis  have higher rates of stabilizing substitutions than cold-adapted M. trossulus, which suggests that natural selection can efficiently modify structural properties of proteins to fine-tune thermal tolerance based on small changes in temperature of just several °C. As a whole, my dissertation reiterates the importance of demographic processes in controlling the movement of genetic material during hybridization, indicates introgression may contribute to invasive success, and documents subtle natural selection for changes in protein properties of warm adapted M. galloprovincialis.

T1  - The genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity in natural populations of <i>Drosophila</i>
AN  - 1651241137
AB  - Environment-dependent phenotypic expression, also known as phenotypic plasticity is exhibited to some degree by all organisms. Natural selection can act on the ability to respond to the environment allowing individuals to maintain fitness across heterogeneous environments. However, phenotypic plasticity can also potentially slow the rate of adaptive evolution within a population or result in maladaptive phenotypes. Despite the widespread occurrence and consequence for adaptive evolution, the genetic architecture and specific molecular variants that underlie phenotypic plasticity remain largely unknown. To evaluate patterns of plasticity and the genes that mediate the plastic response this work utilizes Drosophila melanogaster and its close sister specie Drosophila simulans. Individual lines collected from natural populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans have previously been shown to exhibit phenotypic plasticity for several traits in response to changes in temperature and nutrition. However, these studies do not address patterns of plasticity across heterogeneous environments. To establish that the strength of the plastic response varies within and among natural populations isofemale lines of D. melanogaster  and D. simulans were collected from three locations along the east coast and exposed to various larval rearing environment.  The geographic pattern in the strength of the plastic response is only present in some traits and absent in others, which highlights the modular nature of phenotypic plasticity. To identify a gene that is able to modulate plasticity across several life history traits this work takes advantage of a candidate gene approach. A previously identified genetic polymorphism in the  couch potato (cpo) gene in D. melanogaster  mediates the propensity to diapause is shown in this work to affect the individual's ability to respond plastically across several life history traits. The patterns observed in the investigation of cpo parallel the patterns of plasticity observed in natural populations. Thus, polymorphism in cpo gene may play an important role in the meditation of plasticity in natural populations. These findings provide insight into plasticity within natural populations and the genes that underlie the strength of the plastic response.

T1  - Genetic bases and phenotypic consequences of high-temperature adaptation in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
AN  - 1648732462
AB  - Connecting phenotype to genotype and fitness has been a major challenge when studying adaptation. Experimental evolution is a powerful method to facilitate the study of adaptation as an outcome and as a process. This dissertation used 114 clones of Escherichia coli that were evolved independently for 2000 generations under thermal stress (42.2ºC). The goal of my dissertation was to link phenotypes and fitness with specific mutations and to identify the functional mechanisms leading to thermal adaptation.     Chapter 1 focused on a subset of populations that became resistant to an antibiotic, rifampicin, during thermal stress adaptation. Rifampicin resistance was caused by three mutations at codon position 572 of the rpoB gene, which encodes the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP). I used samples from 200 generation intervals to assess the frequency trajectory of rifampicin resistance. I found that resistant mutations typically appeared, and were fixed, early in the evolution experiment. Finally, I confirmed that the three mutations conferred high advantage in glucose-limited medium at 42ºC in the ancestral background.     Chapter 2 investigated the same rpoB mutations in codon 572 to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying their fitness improvement at high temperature. I measured their growth curves and gene expression (mRNAseq) at 42ºC, and compared them to the growth and gene expression of the ancestor at 37ºC and 42ºC. Two rpoB mutations restored the gene expression back to an ancestral state, while one mutation, exaggerated the expression changes of the ancestor at 42ºC. Lastly, I compared the phenotypic characteristics of one single mutant, I572L, to those of two high-temperature adapted clones with this mutation. I concluded that the I572L9 mutation contributed to most of the expression changes while later mutations did not substantially changed gene expression.     Chapter 3 explored the phenotypic consequences of high temperature adaptation in 114 clones. I measured the magnitude of fitness trade-offs across a thermal gradient. I identified two niche dynamics that I associated with two genetic pathways. Overall, my dissertation associates mutations to phenotypes in the context of thermal stress adaptation, and it highlights the difficulties of connecting genotype to phenotype, even if in a "simple" experimental system.

T1  - Rapid evolution and population divergence in response to environmental change in <i>Colias</i> butterlies
AN  - 1648168638
AB  - My dissertation focuses on how environmental change, specifically in temperature and host plants, can drive physiological and morphological differences. I took advantage of historical studies with the Colias system of butterflies to assess adaptation and plasticity in larval performance in response to climatic change and changing host plant abundance. I have found that changing temperatures have affected the adaptation of some larval traits but not others. Specifically, as temperature variability has increased in both California and Colorado populations of Colias, the larval feeding rate has shifted to correspond to the new environmental conditions. Next, I studied how two Colorado populations of Colias eriphyle  cope with repeated exposures to sub-lethal high temperatures simulating multi-day heat waves. I found that the higher elevation population suffered less detrimental fitness effects than the lower elevation population in regards to both short term (heat shock gene expression) and long term (overall growth rate) fitness effects. Building on my interest of how temperature and temperature variation affects multiple life stages I studied the effects of temperature during the pupal life stage on survival, growth and the resultant adult wing morphology. Generally, high temperatures decreased pupal time and less melanic adult wings. Finally, I used the two populations of C. eriphyle to quantify thermal performance differences of fitness when larvae consume different host plants at two temperatures. I found that cooler temperatures increased the difference in performance between populations consuming different host plants and that thermal performance differs between populations.  My research shows that temperature can affect fitness across many life stages and organisms have responded to these changes in temperature over time by adaptation.

T1  - Mantle-crust Interaction in Granite Petrogenesis in Post-collisional Settings: Insights from the Danubian Variscan Plutons of the Romanian Southern Carpathians
AN  - 1647472902
AB  - The issue of granite petrogenesis plays a key role in our overall understanding of the growth and differentiation of continents, as well as in our ability to unravel the tectonic histories of orogenic belts. Granites are ubiquitous magmatic products found in almost all tectonic settings: oceanic and continental rifts (i.e., plagiogranites – extreme basalt differentiates), active continental margins (e.g,. the granitic batholiths of central and southern Andes), continent-continent collision zones (  e.g., the orogenic batholiths of the Himalayas, Western Anatolia), post-collisional settings (e.g., the Variscan provinces of Europe), complex within-plates settings (e.g., Limmo massif, Afar, Ethiopia). Furthermore, granitoids are characterized by considerable petrological and geochemical heterogeneity, as they can form from a vast array of sources: sediments (e.g., pelites, arkoses, psammites), metamorphic rocks (e.g., (mica)schists, gneisses, etc.), and igneous rocks (e.g. andesites, dacites, tonalites, etc.). Aside from fertile sources (i.e., protoliths), granite petrogenesis is dependent upon two critical parameters: temperature (to promote melting of the protoliths) and water availability - either as freely available aqueous solutions/vapors (e.g., water input in subduction zones); or water released via dehydration melting of hydrous minerals (e.g., micas, amphiboles). The presence of water in protoliths depresses the melting temperature of mineral components and provides the environment for redistribution of chemical components.   This bears great importance in our understanding of the evolution of the crust and argues that mantle-crust interactions are responsible for the generation of continental crust even in the latest stages of an orogen.

T1  - Can biochar mitigate nitrogen losses in organic farming systems?
AN  - 1639657420
AB  - Nitrogen (N) management represents a challenge for organic farming systems.  In particular, sufficient N mineralization is not always achieved, timing of N release and plant uptake is often not synchronized, and subsequent N transformations of mineralized N may be lost as environmental pollutants (e.g., leached N and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions). Biochar, the charcoal obtained from the thermal decomposition of biomass waste under limited oxygen supply, has the potential to alter soil physicochemical properties that regulate the retention of soil N. This dissertation evaluates biochar as a means to improve N management in organic farming systems by reducing environmental N losses and stabilizing N within the agricultural landscape. The following three experiments investigated these conditions using a multi-scale approach, including an on-farm trial and greenhouse experiments, high-frequency assessment of greenhouse gases (GHGs), 15N pool dilution techniques, and microbial analysis.      The first experiment examined the effects of a variety of biochar amendments on plant performance, soil properties and N transformation rates in a mesocosm representing an organic lettuce production system (Lactuca sativa ).  N2O fluxes were monitored throughout the growing period as well as functional genes that encode nitrification (amoA) and denitrification (nirK, nirS, and nosZ) enzymes of bacteria. Findings from this study indicate that some biochars may accelerate N mineralization from organic fertilizer and increase net nitrification. Decreases in N2O fluxes were only observed for a short period, not leading to significant effects in total emissions.  The second experiment examined whether biochar amendments reduce N losses from soils and improve plant performance and whether these effects are N level dependent. Fertilizer inputs, N output through harvest, leachate, and N2O emissions were used to assess N utilization and environmental losses of biochar-amended soils. These evaluations were carried out for two growing seasons in a mesocosm representing an organic lettuce production system.  Analyses of plant performance indicate that biochar amendments did not provide any increases in plant biomass in soils that received less than commercial fertilization rates (225 kg N ha -1). At commercial fertilization rates, biochar increased N use efficiency (NUE) and decreased N losses via leaching, which lead to a significant decrease in ratio of N lost over N exported in biomass. N2O emissions were altered by biochar amendments only in soils that received 50% of commercial fertilization rates (112 kg N ha-1), which did not alter the ratio of N lost over N exported in biomass.      The third experiment provides an on-farm high frequency assessment of GHG emissions from biochar amended-soils in an organic walnut orchard, in addition to an estimate of the GHG savings from the conversion of orchard residue into utility grade energy. Despite observed short-term decreases, biochar alone or in combination with compost did not alter total CO2  and N2O emissions from soils; whereas, the conversion of orchard residue into energy and C sequestration through soil amendment lead to a carbon credit of 100.3 Mg CO2-Ceq per year.     In conclusion, biochar did not decrease total N2O emissions from soils, but occasionally reduced N losses via leachate and improved plant utilization of N. A larger long-term environmental benefit of biochar was found to occur when using orchard residue for energy generation and C sequestration in soils.

T1  - Holocene legacy: Evolution of thermal tolerance and bloodfeeding in the pitcher-plant mosquito, <i>Wyeomyia smithii</i>
AN  - 1621504844
AB  - The legacy of historical biogeography impacts many organisms and results in a wide range of character variation over a latitudinal gradient. The pitcher-plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii is one such organism that demonstrates a wide range of phenotypic and genotypic variation over the entirety of its range from the Gulf Coast to Canada. A geographic cline established by the presence and recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet is manifest in the narrow range of thermal tolerance exhibited by different populations and also in the differing propensity of bloodfeeding by these mosquitoes. These contemporary clines were analyzed by a variety of experimental methods ranging from year-long fitness assays, scanning electron microscopy, and RNA-sequencing to determine the patterns underlying the resulting evolutionary differences among established populations.

T1  - Simulated climate warming and mitochondrial haplogroup modulate small non-coding RNA expression in the neotropical pseudoscorpion, <i> Cordylochernes scorpioides</i>
AN  - 1618217333
AB  - While the plight of polar bears in a rapidly warming world is much publicized, recent theory suggests that the organisms likely to be most at risk from rising temperatures are terrestrial arthropods and reptiles inhabiting the tropics. Metabolic rate in such ectothermic species increases exponentially with ambient temperature, and a small temperature increase in a warm environment therefore has a much larger physiological impact than a comparable temperature increase in a cool environment. In a recently published study on the neotropical pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, simulated climate warming significantly decreased survival, average values for morphological traits, and level of sexual dimorphism. However, these effects were minor compared to catastrophic consequences for male fertility and female fecundity, identifying reproduction as the life history stage most vulnerable to climate warming. Still to be investigated, however, was the potential for epigenetically and genetically based responses to elevated temperature. Here, I examined the effects of chronic high-temperature exposure on epigenetic regulation in C. scorpioides in the context of naturally occurring variation in mitochondrial DNA. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and small non- coding RNA (sncRNA) expression, are particularly sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature, which can induce physiological stress and bring about changes in epigenetic states and phenotypes that may be heritable across generations. My results indicate that exposure of male pseudoscorpions to elevated temperature significantly altered the expression of sncRNAs, specifically microRNAs and piwi-interacting RNAs, in testicular tissue. Mitochondrial haplogroup was also a significant factor influencing both sncRNAs and mitochondrial gene expression. These findings demonstrate that chronic heat stress alters epigenetic profiles that may at least partially account for reduced reproductive function in male C. scorpioides.  Moreover, through its effects on epigenetic regulation, mitochondrial DNA polymorphism may provide the potential for an adaptive evolutionary response to climate warming. Since tropical terrestrial arthropods constitute the vast majority of animal species, the results of this study have important implications for understanding the consequences of climate change for global biodiversity.

T1  - Latitudinal variation in the response of tidepool copepods to mean and daily range in temperature
AN  - 1617977147
AB  - Understanding the evolutionary potential of organisms to adapt to a changing climate, and the fitness consequences of temperature fluctuations, are critical to forecasting the future of biodiversity. Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 13 and 25°C  on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 17° of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature.  To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 8°C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that tradeoffs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient. They also indicate that T. californicus  populations can maintain fitness over a wide range of daily variability but are more sensitive to small changes in the mean temperature.

T1  - The Development and Function of the Nasopharynx and its Role in the Evolution of Primate Respiratory Abilities
AN  - 1615100709
AB  - The nasopharynx is a centrally located region of the upper respiratory tract (URT) integral to several physiological functions. However, few have focused on this area within the context of human evolution. This study investigated osseous morphology, soft tissue histology, development, and evolutionary change of the nasopharynx. Multimodal analyses were performed:      Analysis 1: This study tested hypotheses on the morphological relationships of the osseous nasopharyngeal boundaries with the splanchnocranium and basicranium among dry crania representing humans and non-human primates using 3D geometric morphometrics (3D-GM). Results showed that humans, the most orthognathic group, exhibited the widest nasopharynges. Over human development, the nasopharynx grows vertically taller and anteroposteriorly shorter while the path of the cartilaginous Eustachian tube (CET) grows longer and more vertically oriented. Timing of these growth changes coincide with changes in frequency of otitis media.     Analysis 2: The nasopharynx was hypothesized to warm and humidify air only via its bony, non-contractile surfaces. Air conditioning capacity was assessed by presence of submucosal blood vessels, mucous cells, and serous cells on histological slides of nasopharyngeal surfaces. Results indicated that all of these microstructures were present on all nasopharyngeal surfaces, rather than being restricted to non-conctractile bony surfaces.     Analysis 3: Ambient climate was hypothesized to influence URT growth. Two groups of adult male Macaca mulatta raised in Oregon (cold climate) and California (warm climate) outdoor colonies were used. CT imaging and 3D-GM were performed. Results revealed no shape differences but the Oregon individuals exhibited larger airway size and smaller body mass than the California individuals. Thus being raised in cold climates appears related to development of larger URT proportions relative to body size.    Analysis 4: Nasopharyngeal morphology of fossil hominins, including Neanderthals and mid-Pleistocene Homo (MPH) from Europe and Africa, were reconstructed using 3D coordinate data and analyzed via 3D-GM. Neanderthals exhibited greater CET length than MPH and modern humans while the horizontal CET orientation of Neanderthals resembled the human infant condition. Results strongly suggest that Neanderthals possessed CET morphology and physiology distinct from modern humans, likely impacting susceptibility to middle ear disease and supporting species-level distinction.

T1  - Environmental context matters: studies of variation in developmental life-history traits in insects
AN  - 1614209828
AB  - Life history traits influence the survival and reproduction of organisms. They can   vary across organisms based on previous response to selection and based on plastic responses  to abiotic and biotic factors. Here, I examine how life history traits of insects vary in  response to environmental conditions and in response to association with microbial  symbionts. I introduce life-history theory and traits, how traits vary in response to  environment, and the biological systems used in this dissertation. I then use a meta-analytic  statistical approach to estimate the variation in life-history traits of the species within the  Culex pipiens complex. I demonstrate that the temperature of the developmental habitat is a  more significant explanatory factor for development rate variation than sub-species identity.  The effect of temperature, however, is heterogeneous and the residual variation in  development rate is best explained by two factors, density and study methodology. I repeat this approach in another species, Aedes aegypti, where environmental context of temperature  alone is sufficient to explain development rate variation. To test the results, I assess the  impact of three environmental factors over a wide range of values on development in Ae. aegypti. Using this empirical approach, I demonstrate that temperature, diet, and density  interact to explain developmental life-history traits. I also found that the effect of temperature  is mediated by the context of diet and density. Finally, I experimentally consider the impact  of an obligate microbial symbiont on development and survival in a hemimetabolous  stinkbug reared on two alternative plants. I show that host plant context mediates the impact of symbiosis on its stinkbug host's development. These studies illustrate that environmental  context matters for life-history trait variation. The phenotypic expression of these traits is contingent on multiple environmental factors both abiotic and biotic.

T1  - Ecological and evolutionary responses of tropical ectotherms to climate change
AN  - 1613181994
AB  - Despite decades of research, the ability of scientists to predict the responses of ectothermic organisms to climate change remains remarkably low. Though an increasing number of models incorporate mechanistic relationships between environmental temperature and physiology, they often ignore other important pathways by which climate affects organismal fitness. Here, I explore some of these mechanisms, and the ways in which their inclusion can alter model outcomes for a group that is considered particularly vulnerable: tropical ectotherms.    First, I show how models for the responses of populations to climate change must include biologically-relevant measurements of environmental temperature. In the Bay Islands of Honduras, I project warming onto fine-scaled temperature distributions generated from physical models and combine them with thermal performance curves from 5 populations of Anolis lizards. Contrary to the conclusions of previous studies, I show that the these populations may not be extremely vulnerability to warming.    Second, I examine the relative effects of environmental temperature, wind speed, and humidity on the abundance of two lizard species from the island of Cayo Menor, Honduras. Though most models only include the effects of mean temperature, I show that temperature variation and wind speed may be more important drivers of lizard activity levels.    Third, I conduct a field experiment to test the degree to which rapid climate change drives natural selection on thermal physiology. I transplant a population of Anolis sagrei from preferred habitat to a warmer, more thermally variable site and measure viability selection. Relative to a reference population studied in a less stressful thermal environment, the transplanted population experienced strong, directional selection on thermal performance traits.    Finally, I examine the degree to which insular populations of  A. sagrei in the Bahamas are locally adapted to their thermal environment in the face of gene flow from geographically disparate populations. Despite extremely high rates of gene flow across the archipelago, I find that the thermal optima of populations are positively correlated with both the mean and maximum environmental temperatures of each island. This suggests that metapopulation structure is unlikely to increase the vulnerability of  A. sagrei to climate change.

T1  - The evolutionary genetics and genomics of physiological adaptation in Drosophila
AN  - 1566514325
AB  - To fully understand the process of adaptation, we must connect genetic variation to phenotypes that impact fitness. The outcomes of selection can depend on a number of factors including the population genetic environment experienced by genes that encode phenotypes of interest, the degree of pleiotropy, and whether alleles at different loci interact to impact trait values. Here, I use a variety of approaches to evaluate the evolution of physiological strategies at the genomic, cellular, protein, and whole organismal levels in experimentally evolved and natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster.  The holometabolous Drosophilid flies inhabit a range of environments with populations distributed from Tasmania in the south to Finland in the north. Flies experience strong selection to adapt to temperature and to environmental toxins found in their necrotic developmental environment (e.g., ethanol). I demonstrate that variable temperatures favor genotypes with a greater capacity to remodel their cell membranes in response to thermal change. Alleles with greater environmental sensitivity appear to underlie this response, which increases components of fitness. While evolutionary models assume genetic independence of developmental and reversible plasticity, I show that cell membrane plasticity covaries positively across life stages. However, within the adult stage membrane responses to warm and to cool thermal shifts are genetically decoupled. I then present evidence that pathway flux better explains survival under ethanol than do the activities of any single enzyme in the ethanol detoxification pathway. Finally, I show that despite the small effective population size, lack of recombination, and elevated mutation rate of the mitochondria, genes encoded in this small genome do not harbor an excess of deleterious polymorphisms relative to their nuclear counterparts. Together the results of my dissertation provide insight into the evolutionary genetics of physiological adaptation in D. melanogaster from nucleotide sequence to cellular, protein, and fitness phenotypes.

T1  - Adaptation and Specialization in the Evolution of Bacterial Metabolism
AN  - 1557744839
AB  - Specialization is a balance of evolutionary adaptation and its accompanying costs. Here we focus on the Lenski Long-Term Evolution Experiment, which has maintained cultures of Escherichia coli in the same, defined seasonal environment for 50,000 generations. This dissertation explores the extent and means by which metabolic specialization occurs over an extended period in the same environment.    Chapter 1 provides an overview and introduction of the problem.    In Chapter 2 we investigated the acquired dependence on citrate for optimal growth of some of the adapting populations. Earlier work uncovered that one of the adapting populations gained the ability to utilize citrate as a sole carbon source. We showed that in addition to this population, three other lineages evolving in parallel began to rely on citrate as a chelator of iron for optimal growth on glucose. This specialization seemed to have occurred through loss of function, most consistent with the accumulation of mutations in iron transport genes that were obviated by abundant citrate.     In Chapter 3 we examined changes in fitness of the evolving populations on carbon sources other than the glucose on which they adapted. We demonstrated that declines in performance were much less widespread than suggested by previous results, and surprisingly accompanied by improvements on a variety of substrates. Strains with higher mutation rate exhibited significantly more declines, and these were ameliorated by growth at lower temperature. These findings suggested that specialization does not mainly result as a consequence of adaptive tradeoffs, but rather due to the gradual accumulation of disabling mutations in unused portions of the genome.    In Chapter 4 we tested the ability of Flux Balance Analysis models to predict evolved changes in central metabolism. We measured metabolic fluxes for evolved populations from the Lenski experiment, and compared them along with datasets from two other experiments to flux predictions. We found that improved growth largely derived from increased rate of substrate use. Flux predictions were more accurate for two experiments initiated with relatively sub-optimal ancestors, whereas ancestors near the optimum tended to move away from predictions over experimental evolution.

T1  - Dispersal Potential Impacts Size Clines of Grasshoppers Across an Elevation Gradient
AN  - 1553455386
AB  - Body size is an important life history trait that determines reproductive success of insects through its effects on their physiology, ecology, and behavior. Changes in body size may have both a genetic component when local conditions select for optimal body size and an environmental component when it is influenced by temperature, food availability, and other environmental factors. Along elevational gradients converse Bergmann clines, a decrease in body size with an increase in elevation, are commonly observed within insects when seasonality is present. No cline may also be observed when insects compensate for an abbreviated season by increasing their growth rate at high elevations or when environmental conditions fail to produce an effect. However, a key trait that has not been previously considered to influence the observed size cline of an insect is dispersal potential. Here, I hypothesize that an increase in dispersal potential, which suggests an increase in gene flow, impacts the type of size cline exhibited by grasshoppers across an elevation gradient. The impact of dispersal potential on two key life history traits associated with body size, reproductive potential and reproductive output, is also examined. I use two long winged species,  Melanoplus sanguinipes and Camnula pellucida, to represent the high dispersal group and two short winged species,  Aeropedellus clavatus, and Melanoplus boulderensis, to represent the low dispersal group. My findings support the hypothesis that dispersal potential influences the body size-elevation relationship and reproductive potential of a grasshopper species across an elevation gradient. However, my findings fail to show dispersal potential impacts reproductive output. This study suggests dispersal potential may influence the evolution of body size of insect species and should be considered in future studies.

T1  - Impact of genome content on the distribution and physiology of marine Cyanobacteria
AN  - 1524266184
AB  - The ocean plays a key role in the global carbon and nutrients cycles and account for 50% of the world's carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere converting it to oxygen. Two central players in the ocean carbon and nutrient cycles are the smallest but predominant marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus  and Synechococcus. Together, they are responsible for 25.2% of the ocean's net primary productivity. Their abundance relies heavily on environmental nutrient concentrations, in particular nitrogen and phosphorus, temperature and light availability. Changes in environmental conditions are a threat to global ocean cycles and could potentially alter their activity, distribution and diversity in the oceans.    Genomic studies provide detailed information on the many genes that drive biogeochemical patterns and serve as an important step toward understanding the role of marine cyanobacteria in ocean environment. Moreover, we have evidence that biogeography linked with environmental variables can influence the diversity and distribution of marine cyanobacteria. Therefore, the goal of my dissertation has been to understand the impact of genome content on the distribution and physiology of Prochlorococcus and  Synechococcus. I used a combination of laboratory experiments and field metagenomics to link variations in genome content with changes in physiology and distribution. I first examined how variations in growth rate affect the physiology of Synechococcus strains in a chemostat experiment under phosphate limitation. We found that there are physiological differences between strains related to growth at difference phosphate levels and we estimated new Ks,p value and C:N:P ratios for Synechococcus that can be use to better parameterize ocean biogeochemical models. We suggest that differences in genome content could potentially be responsible for physiological differences. Previous studies in natural populations have found differences in physiology between different strains of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus but whole genome content variations have never been investigated in Synechococcus field populations. In order to assess genomic diversity associated with Synechococcus  we developed a method for targeted metagenomic sequencing of marine cyanobacteria. We combined cell sorting and metagenomics to improve on current methods and resolve phylogenetically field populations of interest as well as specific genes. We then applied our method to assess the genomic diversity of Synechococcus populations in the Western North Atlantic Ocean. We found that we can distinguish spatial and temporal variations of  Synechococcus clades and genome content that are correlated to ambient nutrient concentrations, temperature, and depths.   These results suggest that genome content along with environmental variables shape the diversity and distribution of marine cyanobacteria. Thereby, through my dissertation I linked genetic adaptation, physiology and ocean biogeochemical cycles to help understand how changes in ocean environment could affect the distribution and diversity of the most dominant and ecologically important marine cyanobacteria.

T1  - Experimental evolution and intragenomic homologous recombination in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
AN  - 1504639674
AB  - Intragenomic homologous recombination (IHR) is a critical mechanism of DNA repair that can result in genome rearrangements. Like all mutations, genome rearrangements, i.e., large-scale deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations, can be harmful, of neutral effect, or beneficial. To evaluate the role of genome rearrangements in bacterial evolution, I inserted the bacteriophage P1 ref gene into the Escherichia coli lac operon to create a strain with an elevated rate of IHR. I then maintained small populations of E. coli initiated either with the constructed strain (high IHR populations) or with the wildtype (low IHR populations) for 500 generations in a novel environment, characterized by glycerol minimal medium and periodic heat stress. Fitness assays using the generation 500 populations revealed that fitness gains were rapid, but did not differ in magnitude between the low and high IHR treatments. However, the high IHR populations followed adaptive trajectories that were significantly less variable than the low IHR populations. This reduced variability suggests that the evolution of the high IHR populations may have been more deterministic than that of the low IHR populations, due to an increased mutation supply rate. To elucidate the genetic basis of the adaptation to the novel evolution experiment environment, I fully sequenced the genomes of two clones, one low ref-  and one ref+, from the endpoint of the evolution experiment. I found that the two clones had acquired non-overlapping sets of point mutations and rearrangement breakpoints, suggesting that they took alternate routes to adaptation. These studies represent the first steps in validating the lac<>ref system for use in studying IHR, and in assessing whether IHR rate has the potential to modulate adaptive evolution in small bacterial populations.

T1  - The Plastic and Evolutionary Responses of Fish to Anthropogenic Stressors
AN  - 2700376937
AB  - Ecosystems are being altered at unprecedented rates with little knowledge of the potential impacts on biodiversity. Two of the most pressing contemporary anthropogenic stressors are pollution and global warming. Species can respond to these stressors via dispersal, phenotypic plasticity, or evolutionary adaptation. Many species, especially aquatic organisms, experience ecological or physical barriers to dispersal and will therefore have to respond via phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary responses. I examined the responses of multiple traits associated with fitness in fish to pollution and increased temperature using a 2 × 2 common garden experimental design. I examined the effects of pollution on behaviour in a natural population of brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus), and increased temperature on population demographics, life history traits, reproductive traits, and the immune response in experimental populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata). The plastic responses to pollution were increased locomotion and decreased aggression and the plastic responses to increased temperature were decreased age at maturity, sperm length, sperm velocity, and sperm path linearity. These results are indicative of stress responses by the fish and could potentially decrease reproductive success and survival. Next, I measured reproductive output in experimental populations of guppies and found that, after many generations in elevated temperature, females produced fewer, smaller broods than control populations. However, I found no effect of temperature on census population size, survivorship, sex ratio, size-at-age, or the immune response, indicating that, despite the decreased reproductive output, guppies appear to cope with the increased temperature. Additionally, genetic diversity in the elevated temperature populations decreased more rapidly than control populations, and was equivalent to one quarter the effective population size relative to the controls. This latter result shows a clear signature of selection. Indeed, I found that sperm length displayed an evolutionary response in an estimated 2-3 generations. And in a natural population of bullheads, after an estimated 33 generations, I found an evolutionary response in locomotion and aggression. However, the reduced genetic diversity could lower the adaptive potential of populations to future stressors. I discuss these results in the context of the scope of organisms to rapidly respond to anthropogenic stressors.

T1  - Exploring Information Generation and Propagation from the Point of Installation on Construction Jobsites: An SNA/ABM Hybrid Approach
AN  - 1826526832; ED564574
AB  - Construction requires the knowledge and experience of craftsmen. The knowledge and experience is gained through local coordination and local adaption at points of installation, which classifies the work as complex production. Information generated at these points of installation can be valuable in understanding how and why workers make decisions, especially at points of improvisation when they encounter obstacles. However, this information often goes unrecognized at least in explicit form by the workers themselves, and is therefore not documented and not captured. The author's experience and observations on construction jobsites, combined with literature review, show that the information generated from the point of installation has not been extensively studied or modeled in construction. However, other industries characterized as complex production have seen improvements by studying and modeling the information generated and propagated from the point where the knowledge and experience of skilled craftsmen do their work. The research postulate studied herein is that if this information is modeled and understood, the impact it has on jobsites would be known and work performance could improve. The literature shows that observation-based studies of information generation at the worker and crew level have only recently been conducted, and not from the standpoint of information propagation. In addition, the literature led to identification of agent based modeling (ABM) and social network analysis (SNA) as sound approaches for modeling the information generation and propagation from the point of installation. The research method included developing a conceptual information model, evaluating and improving the model based on pilot jobsite observations; data collection and observations used to develop a representative model of the information generation and propagation from points of installation. A unique approach of an SNA-informed ABM was used to simulate the final model, and test the result with select jobsite scenarios. The data collected showed that information is indeed generated and often not captured or reported from the point of installation. Workers encounter obstacles in 89% of their scheduled activities, and information about those obstacles only propagates beyond the crew level 50% of the time. The simulated SNA-informed ABM based on the data collection and conceptual model showed that there are differences in how workers handle obstacles in early vs. later stages of the jobsite, and also on large vs. small jobsites. Workers are more influenced by others in the early stages of a job and on jobsites with fewer workers. In conclusion, by studying the information generation and propagation from the point of installation with empirical data collection, observations, and conceptual model building, a simulation showed how this information could impact work performance. In addition, explorations of the simulated model showed how the information available from the point of installation propagates and influences jobsite outcomes.

T1  - Three Essays on Estimating Causal Treatment Effects
AN  - 1697500384; ED554499
AB  - This dissertation is composed of three distinct chapters, each of which addresses issues of estimating treatment effects. The first chapter empirically tests the Value-Added (VA) model using school lotteries. The second chapter, co-authored with Michael Wood, considers properties of inverse probability weighting (IPW) in simple treatment effect models with selection bias. The third chapter, co-authored with Guanglei Hong and Heather D. Hill, explores unbiased estimation of treatment effect models with mediators. VA is designed to estimate the treatment effects of schools and teachers on students' academic outcomes. They rely on a conditional independence assumption that is not testable within-sample: students are not sorted to schools based on unobserved components of their test score. There has been an extensive debate in the economic and education policy literature regarding this issue but very few empirical tests, especially for school--as opposed to teacher--VA. This chapter directly tests the assumption using school lotteries, in which students are randomly assigned an offer from a charter school. First, I formally link VA to a model for the Intent to Treat (ITT) effect of winning the lottery. Next, I show how the ITT parameter can be expressed as a linear combination of parameters from VA. I then replace those parameters with estimates from estimating the VA model on the full sample of students and schools in the district, and show that this VA-based estimate of the ITT parameter will be unbiased if the VA school effect estimates are themselves unbiased. My results fail to reject the null hypothesis that estimates from VA are unbiased. I test a number of different VA models used frequently in the literature, and also discuss the implications of my results for teacher VA models. The second chapter explores the performance of IPW as a treatment effect estimator in linear models with selection bias. IPW has been presented as an estimator that has the advantage of being non-parametric. However, its advantages over ordinary least squares (OLS) may turn into a disadvantage in the presence of selection bias, which will frequently occur in observational settings. IPW may inflate selection bias by giving the greatest weight to observations that contribute most to bias. We present our intuition, and then provide a proof that verifies this and other conjectures. Using simulations and real data, we compare the bias of IPW, OLS and other re-weighting estimators that we introduce. We allow for heterogeneity in the treatment effect, and suggest how researchers may be able to differentiate between heterogeneity and misspecification. The third chapter introduces and applies an innovative weighting approach to causal mediation analysis. This method allows for a treatment-by-mediator interaction, unlike other techniques for estimating the effects of mediators. Applied to the setting of a welfare-to-work experiment, our weighting method decomposes the treatment effect into direct and indirect effects, and demonstrates how to estimate these effects using ratio of mediator probability weighting. We also employ simulations to test the robustness of our estimators to misspecification of the propensity score model.

T1  - Language Arts Achievement of Fourth Grade Students with Regard to Gender, Ethnicity, and Socioeconomic Status
AN  - 1697493277; ED554924
AB  - This study was conducted to see if a difference exists in the language arts proficiency levels of 2,080 fourth grade students with regard to gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status from 2010 through 2012 on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program. Specifically, this study considered the possibility that a difference existed in language arts proficiency levels between males and females. A quantitative study was used to find differences in the language arts proficiency levels from 2010 through 2012 for males and females in the fourth grade in an upper East Tennessee urban school system. A quasi-experimental design was selected because preexisting data were collected on 2,080 fourth grade students enrolled and assessed in 2010, 2011, and 2012 in an upper East Tennessee school system. The language arts proficiency levels from the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) were collected for each of the students in the study. This study found a significant difference in the language arts proficiency levels with regard to gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program from 2010 through 2012 for 2,080 fourth grade students in an upper East Tennessee School district. In general males and females tended to score in the basic and below basic proficiency levels. White males and females generally scored in the proficient and advanced levels while males and females from the other ethnic groups scored in the below basic and basic levels. Students who received free or reduced lunch benefits scored at the below basic and basic levels of proficiency regardless of gender. Students who did not receive the same benefits were generally proficient or advanced on the language arts portion of the TCAP. White students as a group generally scored higher than students from other ethnic groups. Students who received free and reduced lunch benefits generally received lower proficiency scores than their peers who did not receive the same benefits.

T1  - III-V Micropillars on Silicon for Large Scale III-V Photovoltaics and On-Chip Optical Communication
AN  - 1667442845
AB  - The synthesis of III-V nanowires and pillar-structures on silicon is a promising approach for realizing low cost, large scale III-V photovoltaics.  However, performances of III-V nanowire solar cells have not yet been as good as their bulk counterparts, as nanostructured light absorbers are fundamentally challenged by enhanced minority carriers surface recombination rates. The resulting nonradiative losses lead to significant reductions in the quantum yield for external spontaneous emission, which, in turn, manifest as penalties in the open-circuit voltage. In this work, calibrated photoluminescence measurements are utilized to construct equivalent voltage/current characteristics relating illumination intensities to Fermi-level splitting ΔF inside InP microillars. Fermi-level splitting is a good indicator of what voltage can be achieved in a given material. Under 1-sun, we show that splitting can be close to ΔF~0.89eV in undoped pillars. Several strategies to increase the external quantum yield are tested. By cleaning pillar surfaces in acidic etchants the splitting can be increased to ΔF~0.96 eV. Pillars with nano-textured surfaces can yield splitting of ΔF~0.92 eV. Finally, by introducing n-dopants, ΔF greater than 1eV can be achieved, which is due to larger a wider bandgap energy in n-doped Wurzite InP, the increaesed brightness of doped materials, as well as the extraordinarily low surface recombination velocity of InP. These results provide further evidence that InP micropillars on silicon could be a promising material for low-cost, large scale solar cells with high efficiency. Furthermore, strategies for mitigating shunt-path formation in pillar devices have been studied; during the growth of pn-junctions care has to be taken that the core-shell growth mode of the micropillars will not result in a pn-junction where both sides of the junction will be in direct contact with the substrate. It was found that regrowth can be used to prevent such shunt paths between the substrate and the shell of the pillars. Under monochromatic illumination equivalent to 1 sun, open-circuit voltages of larger than 0.604 V could be achieved, which is compares well to other state-of the art results for III-V nanowire solar cells. The discrepancy between the achieved open-circuit voltage and the results from the contactless I-V measurements is explained with unoptimized device design. For further improvement it could be necessary to bury the pn-junction inside higher bandgap materials, and to use n-doped InP material as the light absorber.     Akin to Moore's law in the IC industry, it is believed that next-generation optical components will become more and more integrated onto chips, and perhaps even become integrated with silicon CMOS-electronics. The core-shell growth mode allows for the synthesis of single-crystalline III-V pillar-structures on silicon substrates, offering a pathway for monolithic, CMOS-compatible on-chip integration of active optical components. The viability of the pillar approach has been previously underlined by demonstration of lasers, light emitting diodes, and avalanche-photo-detectors. In this work, the modes of nanopillar lasers are studied in detail; it was found that modes with high azimuthal quantum numbers can exhibit quality factors of the order of 10 2, which is sufficiently high to achieve lasing at room temperature under pulsed optical pumping. Continuous-wave operation of optically pumped lasers could be demonstrated at 4K temperature as well. The radiation pattern of lasing modes are observed in experiments, and in combination with polarization measurements and Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations all quantum numbers of the modes could be identified. Strategies to enhance the quality factor for modes with low azimuthal quantum numbers are discussed as well.     The atomically sharp tips makes nanoneedles attractive for applications requiring electric field enhancements such as Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). The possibility of using the nanoneedle structure for Superfocusing was studied in simulations. In FDTD simulations it was found that the needles could allow for electric intensity enhancements of the order of 10 6, showing that nanoneedles could be a promising structure for delivering optical power to nanoscale dimensions.     Due to the Wurtzite crystal structure nanoneedles exhibit selection rules for nonlinear light generation that are different from selection rules of bulk III-V materials, which exhibit the more common Zincblende phase. Polarization measurements were performed to confirm the Wurtzite selection rules in the pillar material. Potential applications for nonlinear light generation using nanoneedles could be in imaging. Another nanophotonic structure attractive for nonlinear optics are high-contrast gratings. In this work, second harmonic generation from AlGaAs near-wavelength high-contrast gratings was studied in polarization-dependent reflection measurements. The grating design was found to be critical in determining the strength and polarization dependence of the second harmonic signal. The second harmonic response was enhanced by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to flat AlGaAs surfaces without gratings. These enhancements are due to the diffractive nature of the gratings, specifically their ability to change the direction of light waves.

T1  - Factors influencing retreat site selection in the Scorpions <i>Vaejovis cashi</i> and <i>V. electrum</i>
AN  - 1525997766
AB  - The Madrean archipelago of the Southwestern United States contains six morphologically distinct species belonging to the genus Vaejovis, informally known as the 'vorhiesi' complex. These scorpions shelter under rocks and other surface debris, but, as for other scorpions, it is unclear whether these species select retreat sites randomly. Furthermore, little is known about the thermal preferences of scorpions, and no research has been done to identify whether gravidity affects their thermal preferences. The species in this study were Vaejovis cashi and V. electrum, and the objectives were to (1) identify physical or thermal characteristics between cover objects occupied by scorpions and those not occupied; (2) determine whether retreat site selection differs between the two study species; and (3) identify whether thermal selection differs between gravid and non-gravid females of the same species. At each mountain range, rocks that were occupied by scorpions were measured and compared to a subset of rocks that were not occupied by scorpions to determine whether retreat site selection occurred randomly. Temperature loggers were placed under a subset of occupied and unoccupied rocks for 48 hours to identify and compare the thermal characteristics of these rocks. Scorpions were then transported back to Tennessee Technological University to be subjected to thermal gradient trials before parturition and after dispersal of young in order to identify whether gravidity influences thermal preference. Both sky island species selected retreat sites non-randomly, choosing rocks that were larger and thicker than the mean for each habitat. These larger rocks had a significantly higher ΔT and thermal variance than smaller rocks, although there was no significant difference in mean temperature among the various rock sizes. Vaejovis electrum selected larger rocks than V. cashi, but differences in retreat size choice were probably due to the Chiricahua site containing a smaller percentage of large rocks than the Pinaleño site. Gravid V. electrum selected a significantly higher mean temperature than gravid V. cashi in the thermal gradient, but non-gravid congeners did not differ significantly from each other. Neither species, however, appeared to be influenced by reproductive condition when paired tests were conducted, although V. cashi approached significance. Additionally, gravid individuals selected hotter temperatures in the thermal gradient than in the field, and it is possible that compromised health or differing amounts of food offered in the laboratory could have raised metabolic demands. The results indicate that these sky island scorpions select larger sized retreat sites due to the thermal stability, although other biotic factors could also be involved. Future studies should focus on identifying the various biotic factors that could influence retreat site selection in scorpions, as well as determining whether reproductive condition affects thermal selection in other arachnids.

T1  - Generational differences within a corporate workplace
AN  - 1500562762
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine generational diversity issues within the corporate workplace in order to develop strategies that can be employed to increase intergenerational understanding, morale and, improve productivity. The theory used to frame this study is the Communication Accommodation Theory. This theory allowed for a better understanding of specific challenges and opportunities that can occur when working in a multigenerational workforce. It is important for corporations to effectively address these differences in generations and take advantage of the values and expectations of each generation to keep a happy and healthy workplace.  Data for this study was collected through an online survey questionnaire completed by retail banking employees. Findings suggest generational differences do exist and that the corporate workplace can improve morale and productivity by understanding and incorporating these differences.

T1  - The ecological and evolutionary effects of fire on the genus <i> Pinus</i> and boreal systems
AN  - 1499241646
AB  - Fire has a major impact on many of the world's ecosystems.  In addition to being an important part of many landscapes, fire has had a long presence in natural systems.  In order to persist amid fire, many plant species have evolved various strategies to deal with fire.  Many members of the genus  Pinus are associated with fire-prone systems and exhibit a wide range of fire strategies.  In Chapter 1, we explored the parallel (or repeated) evolution of fire strategies within the genus Pinus and reconstructed the geographic center of origin within the genus.  We congruently examined the reconstruction of the origin of fire strategies and geographic center of origin to discuss potential relationships between evolution of fire strategies and geographic distribution.  Our analyses revealed a complex evolutionary history of fire strategies within the genus Pinus.  Independent evolution of fire strategies were observed throughout the genus, especially in subgenus Pinus.  Our reconstructions of geographic origin suggest that extant pines share a common North American ancestor.  Major geologic events (e.g. Western Interior Seaway) had a large impact on the evolutionary trajectory of pines.  These results help to elucidate both the biogeography and evolutionary history of this important genus.     In fire-prone areas, plant species with adaptations that allow individuals to persist following a fire have an advantage over those species that lack these mechanisms.  This observation led Mutch to propose the hypothesis that fire-adapted plants may benefit by increasing the flammability of their litter, reducing competition from non-fire-adapted neighbors.  While enhanced flammability has been demonstrated to increase fitness for species that have mechanisms to persist following fire, immature individuals of fire-adapted species generally do not posess these persistence mechanisms.  In Chapter 2, we present a hypothesis regarding the relationship between enhanced flammability and age among fire-adapted and non-fire-adapted species.  Additionally, we were interested in exploring possible leaf traits that might explain differences across age classes.  To test our hypotheses, we conducted an experiment using four North American pines, two considered fire-adapted and two lacking any adaptation to fire.  We observed significant differences between fire-adapted and non-fire-adapted species.  As predicted, there was a greater difference in flammability traits between mature and immature fire-adapted needles than between mature and immature needles of non-fire-adapted species.  This evidence points toward a relationship between age and flammability, especially in those species that exhibit fire-adapted traits, such as thick bark and self-pruning.       The effects of fire on the landscape may interact with other ecological processes to greatly affect the composition and structure of the vegetation present, especially in fire-prone areas such as the Alaskan boreal forest.  In addition to fire, the presence of discontinuous permafrost on the landscape greatly influences the vegetation, causing the buildup of undecomposed organic material (O.M.).  When a fire occurs on the landscape, the O.M. is combusted removing the insulation that protects permafrost from thaw.  Previous work has suggested that a threshold of O.M. (between 10-15 cm) exists above which permafrost is sufficiently insulated against warmer temperatures.  In Chapter 3, we test for the presence of the hypothesized threshold of O.M. depth on soil temperatures in burned areas.  A manipulative experiment was conducted to manually change the depth of O.M.  Additionally, an observational study was conducted in which temperature loggers were buried at different depths to record soil temperatures.  In both studies differences between maximum daily and minimum daily temperatures were quantified to describe the degree of insulation provided by different depths of O.M.  Results from the manipulative experiment suggest that below 14-16 cm there is little fluctuation between maximum and minimum daily temperature, which corresponds roughly to the proposed threshold found in the literature.  The presence and identification of this threshold may allow researchers and managers to predict where discontinuous permafrost is more susceptible to thaw following a fire.

T1  - The Genetic Basis of Local Adaptation to Thermal Stress in the Intertidal Copepod <i>Tigriopus californicus</i>
AN  - 1494800706
AB  - Populations of the intertidal copepod, Tigriopus californicus,  vary in their tolerance to thermal stress.  In this study, the genetic basis of these differences was examined by generating interpopulation hybrids between a northern and southern population; hybrids were then exposed them to multiple generations of heat stress. At each generation, changes in allele frequency of six candidate genes were monitored. Although allelic frequencies did not change in response to thermal stress, there was evidence of intrinsic selection due to Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities against the southern allele in several of these genes. This observation has important implications for understanding genetic incompatibilities between populations, and the trade-offs between thermal tolerance and overall fitness.

T1  - Galápagos climate and flora during the past 26,000 years: The importance of microrefguia
AN  - 1473901555
AB  - The Galápagos Islands have been a premier laboratory for the formulation of the theory of evolution and subsequent research on evolutionary responses to climate change. Desert lowlands in the archipelago contrast with mesic uplands offering a diversity of habitats for specialization. These communities have experienced periods of aridity on centennial and millennial scales over the past 26,000 years.    I tested vegetation community responses to millennial-scale droughts during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the Mid Holocene Dry Event (MHDE), as well as the major centennial droughts of the last 1000 years, the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA). Data were derived from a highland bog, Paul's Bog, on Santa Cruz and a lowland hypersaline lake on Genovesa. Sediment cores were raised and studied through grayscale and fossil pollen analyses for floristic responses to these droughts. Pollen traps were used to determine if the modern pollen spectra from the major vegetation communities matched lake and bog cores taken from these sites.    The last glacial maximum (LGM) was previously interpreted to have been a time of aridity that caused wholesale extinction of the highland flora. Pollen data from Paul's Bog recorded background dry conditions, but persistence of the endemic highland flora throughout the LGM. The theory of highland flora extinction during the LGM was not supported and should be revisited. I hypothesized that garúa fog remained on high windward-facing (≥ 800 m) slopes, generating moist pockets that were climatic microrefugia during LGM aridity and buffered the highland flora from aridity associated with the MHDE.    High-resolution pollen and grayscale analysis from Genovesa detected a 3-8 year ENSO signal and variability in ENSO over the past 1100 years. The MCA was a period of drought and reduced ENSO activity that lowered lowland productivity. Productivity in the lowlands was not reduced during LIA aridity and was probably buffered by sustained ENSO and increased El Nino events.    The modern pollen trap data were divisible into vegetation communities, but the pollen spectra from the highland sites were not analogs for past pollen spectra from Paul's Bog. Modern pollen inputs were dominated by invasive exotic species that transformed the Galápagos highlands into a non-analog system. Contrastingly, the modern pollen spectra from Genovesa closely resembled the pollen from the lake core over the last 1100 years.    The persistence of the highland flora to drought over the last 26,000 years highlighted the transformative effect invasive species have had on the Galapagos. The arid regions of the Galapagos have survived drought and have remained untransformed by plant introductions, while the highlands no longer resemble the community composition from the past century.    Comparing floral assemblage changes at Genovesa with previously published pollen data from the highlands of San Cristobal highlighted the divergent response of the highlands and lowlands to droughts and ENSO variability. The highland communities were drought stressed during periods of increased El Niño events (i.e., LIA) but were buffered against drought by strengthened garua when SST was lowered and ENSO reduced (i.e., MCA). Lowland productivity was reduced during droughts, but heightened by El Nino rain events. This observation highlighted the antiphased response of the vegetation communities under models of future climate change that predict warmer SST and increased El Nino events.    The results of this study are beneficial to the Gálapagos National Park Service as they make future plans for areas of habitat preservation and protected corridors within the archipelago under future climate change scenarios. LGM microrefugia could present ideal preservation sites and areas of focus for limited habitat-restoration funds.

T1  - Phage life history traits: Regulation of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and evolution of phage resistance within the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> host environment
AN  - 1469017810
AB  - Due to the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria, there has been renewed interest in using bacteriophage to treat bacterial infections (phage therapy). This body of work examined different aspects related to the interaction between bacteria and phage within a host using the system of Drosophila melanogaster infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is then treated with lytic bacteriophage. Using this system four specific areas were addressed: I) How in vitro phage life history traits may be predictive of in vivo therapeutic efficacy, II) How the in vivo phage/bacteria dynamics differ for two different phages throughout the course of infection, III) How modification of phage life history traits alters phage therapeutic ability and IV) The variable costs of phage resistance within P. aeruginosa .      The results show that not only can phage therapeutic ability be predicted by phage in vitro fitness, but therapeutic ability can be altered and improved using simple in vitro serial transfer methods.  Treatment with different phages shows different dynamics within D. melanogaster as well as bacteria having different levels of phage resistance evolving. Despite phage resistance evolving, we found phage resistance does incur a cost to the bacteria, which results in a decrease in within-host virulence.      In conclusion, addressing these questions not only illustrated the use of D. melanogaster as a good model system for phage therapy, but also provided insight into the complexities of the phage/bacteria interaction within a living host. In addition, beginning to understand the variable costs of phage resistance has extended the knowledge of the complexities behind phage therapy.
