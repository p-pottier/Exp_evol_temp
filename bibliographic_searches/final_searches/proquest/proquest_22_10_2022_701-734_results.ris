T1  - THE RIIA, RIIB, AND 32 CISTRONS OF BACTERIOPHAGE T4: GENE EXPRESSION AND INTERACTIONS WITH BACTERIAL MUTANTS
AN  - 303256720
AB  - Suppressors of the bacteriophage T4 rIIB toxic polypeptide encoded by the rIIB frameshift mutation FC238 were investigated. I found suppressors that eliminate the toxic polypeptide by creating new translational termination codons, that diminish the toxicity of the polypeptide by altering the amino acid sequence of the toxic protein, that alter the rIIA protein so as to influence toxicity, and that diminish the amount of toxic polypeptide by reducing the quantity of gene expression from the rIIB (FC238) gene. I propose that the toxicity of the FC238 polypeptide derives from its peculiar, bipartite structure and high membrane avidity. Suppressors that detoxify the FC238 polypeptide by missense probably disturb the bipartite structure and/or the affinity for the membrane.    Mutants of Escherichia coli B (called TabR) that restrict the growth of bacteriophage T4 rII mutants at high temperature were isolated. I selected pseudorevertants of rII deletion mutants that grow on TabR at high temperature; tk (thymidine kinase) is a component of one class of these pseudorevertants. T4 strains harboring mutations in genes 12, 16, 25, 34, 36, 45, and 63 were also specifically restricted on TabR strains at high temperature. A model for the mechanism by which TabR strains might exert their restriction is presented.    Gene 32 of bacteriophage T4 codes for a single-stranded DNA binding protein. I have isolated mutants of E. coli (called Tab32) that specifically restrict the growth of gene 32 missense mutants and allow normal growth of T4('+). During infections of Tab32 with 32tsL171, large amounts of DNA are synthesized and late proteins are made, but very few progeny phage are produced. At least two bacterial mutations are necessary for the restrictive phenotype; these mutations have been mapped to about min 41 and min 64.    The Tab32 strains have been used to isolate and characterize about 30 new gene 32 mutants. The characterization (described in Chapter IV) has included analysis of DNA synthesis, fidelity of replication, capacity to repair damaged DNA, and ability to autoregulate the synthesis of gene 32 protein. Based on these results, the role of the gene 32 protein in T4 replication is discussed.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF LOW TEMPERATURE ON THE SURVIVAL, REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF APHID VECTORS OF POTATO VIRUS DISEASES IN SCOTLAND. (VOLUMES I AND II)
AN  - 303192109
AB  - Because of the importance of the winter survival of potato aphids to the spread of potato virus diseases, investigations were made into the effects of low temperature on the survival, reproduction and development of clones of potato aphids from Scotland, where there is a large acreage of seed potatoes.    The categorisation of these clones of Myzus persicae and Aulacorthum solani provided information on the abundance and distribution in Scotland of populations with various annual cycles and levels of organophosphorus (OP) resistance. Clones of M. persicae and A. solani were exposed to various low temperature regimes (all with a 16-hr photoperiod) in an attempt to relate their low temperature survival, reproduction and development to their origins, annual cycles or OP resistance. Acclimation in which individuals were reared for one month at 10$\sp\circ$C before exposure to 5$\sp\circ$C, affected the two species differently. When reared for a second generation at 5$\sp\circ$C both species had less efficient nymphal development and M. persicae also had less efficient adult reproduction compared with the first generation at this temperature. At sub-zero temperature, A. solani proved to be less able to survive than M. persicae. A temperature of $-15\sp\circ$C for one hour appeared to be near the limit of survival for both species, and this was supported by the supercooling points determined as $-17.17\sp\circ$C and $-14.85\sp\circ$C for M. persicae and A. solani respectively.    In addition to the low temperature studies, observations were made on the recovery of clones at 20$\sp\circ$C after exposure to $-10\sp\circ$C, and also over three generations at 20$\sp\circ$C, after rearing at 5$\sp\circ$C.    During the low temperature and recovery experiments, morphometric parameters and alate production were monitored.    Scottish field studies carried out over two years provided information on the temperatures experienced by potato aphids in the field. All stages of M. persicae, A. solani and Macrosiphum euphorbiae were found overwintering on brassica and weed hosts. Temperature recordings, however, indicated that the winter hosts only provided shelter for the aphids, when they themselves were in a highly sheltered position, such as a glasshouse or covered frame.

T1  - EVALUATIONS OF GENETIC CONTROL, SELECTION PROCEDURES AND RESPONSES TO SELECTION FOR IMPROVED EMERGENCE OF COMPACT CUCUMBERS
AN  - 303186797
AB  - The compact plant type in cucumbers is of interest for high-density, mechanically-harvested plantings. Although compact, cpcp, plants generally exhibit very poor emergence, considerable variability for emergence characteristics was evident within a heterogeneous compact population. Reciprocal crosses were utilized to determine that this variation is controlled by broad-sense maternal effects and is not influenced significantly by the genotype of the embryo. Reciprocal differences were not found in the open-pollinated F(,2) generation, indicating that they were not cytoplasmically inherited. The heritability of the maternal influences on emergence percentage was estimated as .26 (+OR-) .12, based upon parent-offspring regression.    Numerous seed harvesting aand handling parameters were investigated to determine if they appreciably influenced emergence percentage. The dramatic effects and interactions between fruit maturity, fermentation duration, seed storage time and emergence temperature indicated that failure to carefully control any of these factors could seriously affect the ability to discriminate genetic differences in emergence evaluations.    Thirty-five sets of compact and vining F(,4) "isolines" were developed by single-seed descent and evaluated in two environments for a number of characteristics affected by the compact locus. Although all characteristics exhibited continuous variation and most exhibited moderately high heritabilities within each plant type, the correspondence between compact and vining "isogenic" lines was very low for many traits. This indicated that trait performances of vining inbreds would be of little value in selecting desirable genetic backgrounds for the compact genotype. Instead, selection to overcome undesirable effects of the compact locus would be best achieved within populations of cpcp genotypes.    Three cycles of mass selection for emergence percentage were conducted between open-pollinated maternal seedlots within a heterogeneous compact population. Selection cycles were evaluated in several seed production and emergence environments. A highly-significant linear response to selection was observed with an average gain of 4.4% emergence/cycle. Although production and emergence environments exhibited large and significant effects, selection response was consistent across all environments. Correlated responses to selection were observed for fruit length/diameter ratio, seed weight, percent "normal" seeds, emergence rate and emergence uniformity.

T1  - AN EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE GENETIC BASIS OF LIFE HISTORY VARIATION IN MESOCYCLOPS EDAX (CRUSTACEA: COPEPODA) (FLORIDA, MICHIGAN)
AN  - 303169239
AB  - The main intent of this study was to examine the genetic basis of life history variation in populations of the freshwater copepod Mesocyclops edax. Field collections revealed considerable variation in the fitness components body size, clutch size and egg size in populations inhabiting lakes of different seasonalities (Lake Thonotosassa, Florida and Douglas Lake, Michigan). Rearing both populations through two generations under common laboratory conditions revealed whether differences in maturation time, body size and clutch size had a genetic basis, while using a range of environments (15, 25 and 30(DEGREES)C) allowed assessment of genotype-environment interactions. An additional population from each locale was reared at 25(DEGREES)C to assess local variation. Heritability analyses provided estimates of the additive genetic variance present in several life history traits, from which speculations were made regarding the nature and intensity of the selective regimes. In situ culture of the Thonotosassa population provided estimates of means and variances of several traits under near natural conditions, as well as insight into sources of natural mortality.    Overall, Thonotosassa individuals matured more rapidly, and exhibited larger body sizes and clutch sizes than did Douglas individuals when reared at the three experimental temperatures. Only body size exhibited a genotype-environment interaction: Thonotosassa females exhibited a proportionately greater decrease in body size from 25 to 30(DEGREES)C relative to Douglas individuals. Some local variation was evident at both locales.    Considerable additive genetic variance was revealed in female and male body sizes of the Thonotosassa population, and in female and male maturation times in the Douglas population. Female maturation time and clutch size in the Thonotosassa population, and female body size and clutch size in the Douglas population exhibited, low additive genetic variance.    This study documents genetic differentiation among populations with respect to several life history traits. The possible roles of temperature, food level, and predation in molding copepod life histories are discussed.

T1  - GEOGRAPHICAL ADAPTATIONS AND SEASONAL TIME MEASUREMENT OF THE SOUTHWESTERN CORN BORER, DIATRAEA GRANDIOSELLA DYAR (LEPIDOPTERA: PYRALIDAE) (MEXICO, MISSOURI)
AN  - 303164322
AB  - Geographical adaptations and seasonal time measurement of the southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) obtained from south-central Mexico (ca. 19(DEGREES)N latitude) and southeast Missouri (ca. 37(DEGREES)N latitude) were examined. The mature larval diapause of both populations was programmed by daylength and temperature. The critical daylength for diapause induction was 13 hrs light/day for the Mexican population and 15 hrs light/day for the Missouri population at 20(DEGREES) to 30(DEGREES)C. Diapause induction was a function of the phase relation between thermoperiod (20(DEGREES)/30(DEGREES)C) and photoperiod. A high incidence of diapause of the Missouri population occurred under a thermoperiod and continuous darkness up 16 hrs warm phase per 24 hrs. The diapause response of the Missouri population, observed under symmetrical and asymmetrical skeleton photoperiods, showed that photoperiodic time measurement was very sensitive to temperature. Larvae of the Mexican population displayed a less intense diapause than did those of the Missouri population. Diapause development of larvae of the Mexican and Missouri populations was accelerated at daylengths of > 13 hrs and > 15 hrs, respectively, at 25(DEGREES) and 30(DEGREES)C. The rate of diapause development of the Mexican population was unaffected by chilling at 10(DEGREES)C, whereas that for the Missouri population continued at a low rate at 10(DEGREES)C. Diapausing larvae of the Mexican population showed high mortality below 5(DEGREES)C, whereas those of the Missouri population showed limited coldhardening at 0(DEGREES)C. Under moist conditions at 23(DEGREES)C LD 12 hr:12 hr, diapausing larvae of the Mexican population underwent stationary ecdyses more frequently than did those of the Missouri population. The insect's phenology in Mexico was predicted based on photoperiodic and climatic data. A diapause strain was obtained by selecting D. grandiosella from Mexico for four generations at 25(DEGREES)C LD 12 hr:12 hr. A diapause-free strain of D. grandiosella from Missouri was selected over 12 generations at 30(DEGREES)C LD 14 hr:10 hr. Adults of D. grandiosella from Mexico and Missouri were crossed to examine the genetics of the diapause response.

T1  - ANALYSIS OF A SOUTHERN PINE CONEWORM (DIORYCTRIA AMATELLA)-EGG PARASITOID (TRICHOGRAMMA MINUTUM) PRODUCTION SYSTEM UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS (FLORIDA)
AN  - 303148704
AB  - The southern pine coneworm, Dioryctria amatella (Hulst), is the most important insect affecting slash pine seed orchards in northern Florida. Biological control using the egg parasitoid, Trichogramma minutum Riley, is considered here. A prototype system to produce the egg parasitoid in eggs of the coneworm is proposed and studied through system analysis.    A conceptual model was developed for the production system. Two main subsystems were identified: SPC and Tm for the coneworm and the parasitoid, respectively; then each one was subdivided into age classes. Population processes were identified, described, and then interconnected to obtain the conceptual model. Delay associated with development in each age class was accounted for by a delay network of specified order. These networks are formed by stores and developmental inertia processes, and the order is given by the number of stores and inertias used in the network.    Continuous-dynamic mathematical models, in the form of systems of first order differential equations, were derived from the conceptual model using delay networks of various orders (first-, third-, tenth-, and twentieth-order). Parameters of the models were estimated from experiments at different constant temperatures: development times, threshold temperatures, survival, sex ratio, oviposition rates, and parasitism rate. Optimal reproductive parameters occurred at 27(DEGREES)C; therefore, this temperature was selected for operation of the system and collection of data to evaluate the performance of subsystems. The tenth-order delay network gave a close approximation to developmental delay in both subsystems.    Operation of the SPC-Tm production system was analyzed through computer simulations. Control of the daily transfer of SPC-eggs and harvest of parasitized eggs was imposed to maintain nearly constant coneworm and parasitoid populations compatible with specified daily harvest of parasitoid eggs. Surplus coneworm eggs were transferred to the Tm-subsystem for reproduction. Harvesting of parasitized eggs was initiated 30 days after initiation of host egg-transfer, and the optimal harvesting level of parasitized eggs was 98.5%. The model developed here is a useful tool for predicting system behavior and analysis of management strategies for the SPC-Tm production system.

T1  - Genetic Variation and Non-Visual Selection in the Land Snail <em>Arianta arbustorum</em> (L.)
AN  - 2424422249
AB  - A general study of non visual selection in Arianta arbustorum has been undertaken. The behavioural responses of the brown and yellow morphs In different habitats in the field were studied using spots of a paint which fades in sunlight. There was shown to be a clear difference between morphs: the paint on the yellow-shelled individuals faded more than that on the brown shelled ones. Some observations have been made on the diurnal activity of these morphs at an open site at Hall Green near Millers Dale, Derbyshire. There is very strong tendency for the yellow morph to be more active than the brown during the afternoon and, this difference may be responsible for the difference in fading between the two morphs. Non-visual selection by a number of selective agents (adaptation temperature, relative humidity, environmental temperature, and the time of acclimatization) is the cause of the behavioural, physiological and ecological differences between the two shell colour morphs A. arbustorum. These were found in a series of laboratory experiments. The details of those differences were determined largely by studying the response of the two morphs to microclimatic conditions by measuring nocturnal activity (N.A) food consumption (F.C), assimilation efficiency (A.E) oxygen consumption (O.C.) and mortality rate (M.R). The species is very responsive to changes in the physical conditions. Change in adaptation temperature resulted in highly significant differences in response in three out of five physiological parameters: N.A, F.C & O.C. There is also a very strong effect of relative humidity in four out of five cases N.A, F.C, A.E and M.R. Environmental temperature has highly significant effects in the two cases studied: O.C. and M.R. Acclimatization to these several microclimatic conditions also showed a general trend in the three cases used: N.A, F.C and A.E. The experiments summarized above were carried out in order that comparisons between the performances of the brown and yellow morphs could be made. The brown morph consumes' a nearly significantly higher amount of food than the yellow morph at cold adaptation temperature, 5°C, whereas the yellow morph shows significantly higher A.E and O.C. than the brown morph at this temperature. The yellow morph also shows a significantly higher O.C. and lower M.R than the brown morph at 14°C. It also shows a nearly significantly higher rate of F.C. and significantly higher O.C. than the brown one at 20°C. The yellow morph is more active at night and shows a higher rate of A.E and O.C. than the brown morph at the high humidity (98% At high temperatures the yellow morph has higher rate of O.C than the brown morph. Similar results were obtained, from M.R. data. The yellow morph shows a significantly lower M.R than the brown one at 29°C. The results are discussed in the light of maintenance of the polymorphism in this species. A biotelemetrlc technique was used to measure differences in temperature of free-living Helix aspersa. It was also used to study the effects sunshine and shade on heat exchange between indviduals with shells painted black or white. A stepwise multiple linear regression computer program was used to interpret the relationship between the weight loss of three species of helicid snails and a set of variables.

T1  - THE NEURAL BASIS OF THE MOTOR PATTERN FOR GRASSHOPPER OVIPOSITION DIGGING
AN  - 303241070
AB  - Mature female grasshoppers display a highly specialized oviposition behavior that is based upon both structural and functional adaptations. Using rhythmic movements of the ovipositor appendages they dig holes in the ground, 3X the length of the abdomen, for egg deposition. The functional anatomy of the ovipositor, which is driven by ten pairs of muscles, and the electromyographic activity underlying digging, are described for the grasshopper Schistocerca americana.    The ovipositor is controlled by the caudal-most ganglion of the central nervous system. Severing the ventral nerve cord rostral to this ganglion results in ovipositor movements that continue for as long as the animal survives. The electromyographic activity recorded is comparable to that of the intact animal. Furthermore, the rhythmic output is retained when all sensory input is removed by ablation, showing that oviposition digging is driven by a central pattern generator that is located in the terminal abdominal ganglion.    Pattern generation for oviposition digging was found to be exclusively interneuronal because its timing could not be reset by current injections into motoneurons. The pattern generator delivers rhythmic depolarizing waves to motoneurons, generating bursts of impulses alternating with silent periods during each cycle of approximately 5 s. duration.    There appears to be inhibitory control of the motor pattern by rostral neural centers. Not only is severing the nerve cord always followed by appearance of the patterned bursts but also electrical stimulation of the cut end suppresses it, presumably by mimicking the activity of descending input. Intracellular recording showed that motoneurons are hyperpolarized during electrical stimulation of the nerve cord. A temporary cold block applied to the nerve cord to block conduction was followed by appearance of oviposition activity, reversibly.    Severing the nerve cord of larval grasshoppers also elicited patterned bursts of neural activity similar to those of oviposition as recorded from developing ovipositor muscles. No movements were associated with the electrical activity. Likewise, severing the nerve cord of young adults before the onset of sexual maturity was followed by patterned activity resembling oviposition in ovipositor motoneurons. This neural activity failed to produce ovipositor movements. Only at maturity do the ovipositor muscles show mechanical activity.

T1  - THE INHERITANCE OF LATE-BREAKING PARTIAL MALE FERTILITY IN THE INBRED MINN. A632 IN PR CYTOPLASM
AN  - 303230650
AB  - When backcrossed into C cytoplasm many maize inbreds exhibit a late-breaking partially male fertile phenotype. The inbred Minn. A632 typically exhibits this phenotype. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inheritance of late-breaking partial fertility in A632 in C cytoplasm. A study of the effects of growing temperature on the expression of late-breaking partial fertility was also performed.    Lines of A632-Pr were obtained after 15 backcrosses of A632 into Pr cytoplasm. Pr is a member of the C group of cytoplasms.    The inheritance of late-breaking fertility was studied in two ways. First, selections were made for fully male sterile lines and highly male sterile lines of A632-Pr. After 8 cycles of selection comparisons were made among selected lines and with their progenitors for degree of fertility. Differences among selected lines were observed. Improvement in the percent of male sterile plants in the population was achieved through selection. 8% of the plants in the original population was fully male sterile while 91% of the selected population was male sterile. Selection for high fertility was not successful. A heritability for fertility vs. sterility of 86% was calculated using parent offspring regression. Second, crosses were made between selected A632 lines and W182BN-Pr, a highly male sterile line, and between male fertile and sterile selections of A632-Pr. Segregation patterns in the F(,1), F(,2), Bc(,1), Bc(,2) populations were observed. It was found that late-breaking partial fertility is polygenically inherited, one of the few known examples of a cytoplasmic trait being modified by nuclear polygenes. It was observed that A632 lines were heterogeneous and heterozygous after 15 generations of backcrossing and selection.    The effects of growing temperature on late-breaking fertility were studied using growth chambers; days 29(DEGREES)C, nights 18(DEGREES)C or 10(DEGREES)C. Sterile and fertile selections of A632-Pr were grown under both night temperatures. All plants were more fertile when grown in cooler nights. Thus, late-breaking partial fertility in A632 may be modified either environmentally or genetically.

T1  - DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A CULTURE SYSTEM SUITABLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF GULF KILLIFISH (FUNDULUS GRANDIS BAIRD AND GIRARD) FOR LIVE BAIT IN THE THERMAL EFFLUENT OF A POWER PLANT
AN  - 303098975
AB  - Investigations concerning spawning, hatching and grow-out of Fundulus grandis were conducted in 0.1-ha brackish water ponds in Texas. Studies focused on developing economical feeds, increasing production through improved management techniques and evaluation of economic feasibility.    Eggs collected on spawning mats were hatched and fry stocked in grow-out ponds when they average .5 g. The bimodal spawning cycle extended from February to October and highest egg production was in late March-early April and late August-early September. In ponds, spawning activity did not increase at lunar syzygy but spawning readiness increased especially among wild fish. Increasing the ratio of females to males among brood fish resulted in increased egg production. Harvested eggs per 0:1-ha pond for 1M:1F (male:female), 1M:2F and 1M:3F sex ratios were 31,648, 36,546 and 41,817, respectively. Egg to fry survival averaged 76%.    Embryonic development and larval survival in the laboratory were not affected by salinities from 10-30 ppt. Newly hatched larvae acclimated to 23 C could withstand prolonged exposure to temperatures up to 38 C. Acclimation and test salinities had a significant effect on the response to elevated temperatures.    In ponds stockes at 200,000 0.5 g fry/ha, marketable size (3.15 g and 63.7 mm TL) was reached in 70 days when either trout feed, minnow feed or a 1:1 mixture of cottonseed meal and wheat shorts at 5% of body weight daily were fed. Lack of a significant difference in growth (P (LESSTHEQ) 0.05) between fish fed trout feed and the 1:1 mix possibly indicated the importance of natural food in pond production. Survival averaged 85.5% with 1.91 found conversion ratio and 538.8 kg/ha production. Fish obtained from Alabama did not perform as well as Texas fish in egg production, fry survival and growth to a marketable size, indicating either detrimental effects resulting from lower spawning salinities or poor adaptability to local conditions.    Economic profit, break-even analysis and net present value were used to evaluate economic feasibility of a commercial operation. Based on a stocking rate of 400,000/ha, 85% survival of stocked fry and two crops per year, substantial returns were predicted for a 24 hectare (60 acre) facility.

T1  - ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF 5-BROMOURACIL-TOLERANT MUTANTS OF E. COLI
AN  - 303079028
AB  - 5-Bromouracil, an analog of thymine, which occurs only in DNA, has been very successfully used in many studies of thymine metabolism and DNA structure and function. However, previous studies using this compound with prokaryotic strains have been restricted to short periods of growth because the strains used have died after two to three generations of growth in the presence of this compound. The mutants described here are capable of prolonged growth (10 to 20 generations) in the presence of 5-bromouracil, although they still require some thymine for survival.    The mutants were isolated on solid media containing thymine and 5-bromouracil. After 5 to 7 days of incubation, the mutants were purified and initially characterized by determining their plating efficiencies on solid medium containing various concentrations of thymine plus 5-bromouracil. Three classes of mutants were identified in this way. The mutants of Class I are only slightly tolerant, and were not studied further. Class II mutants are of intermediate tolerance and Class III mutants are the most tolerant. When the mutants were characterized in liquid media, long periods of growth (10 generations) were required in order to detect differences in response to various concentrations of thymine plus 5-bromouracil. The 5-bromouracil tolerance characteristic does not affect mutability, UV sensitivity, thymineless death, or temperature sensitivity.    DNA incorporation studies show that the mutant strains are able to distinguish between thymine and 5-bromouracil, while the parental strain is not; this preference is at least partly mediated by alterations in the K(,m) and V(,max) of thymine and 5-bromouracil transport. Class II mutants contain one genetic marker for 5-bromouracil tolerance, while Class III mutants contain two, one the same as in Class II mutants. Both are insertions, the one that is unique to Class III mutants probably being a tandem duplication of the deo through trpR region of the E. coli genetic map.    These strains should prove useful in studies of various facets of thymine and DNA metabolism. It should now be possible to study the long-term effects on metabolism of altered protein-DNA binding in vivo corresponding to previous in vitro studies, and to determine those functions for which 5-bromouracil is not an adequate substitute for thymine in prokaryotes, since prokaryotes seem to require at least a small amount of thymine for survival.

T1  - AN EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF HABITAT SELECTION IN TEGENARIA DOMESTICA (ARANEIDA: AGELENIDAE)
AN  - 303062647
AB  - During this study, captive and wild-caught spiders, Tegenaria domestica, were tested for their responses to various environmental factors that might affect web-site selection. These included temperature, humidity, air currents, light, vibrations, substrata, electrical and magnetic fields, gravitational cues, and atmospheric pressure. The spiders were subjected to choice trails during which they had an opportunity to build a web funnel under various environmental conditions.    Temperature, humidity, air currents, light, substrata, and gravity were found to affect the spiders' web locations. Sexual differences were found for response to sound and spider silk cues.    Extensive records were kept on the growth in terms of carapace length, weight, and instar duration on over 400 captive spiders. Additionally, comparisons were made between the growth and size of female and male juveniles and adults. Dates of first cocoon, clutch intervals, numbers of eggs per cocoon, and numbers of cocoons were recorded for adult females. Experiments were conducted on the outcome of encounters between pairs of adults confined in cages with only one web funnel per cage.    The data gathered from the choice trials and the life history records will be a foundation for field and laboratory experiments on survival, reproductive success, influence of the environment on growth, and species density correlations with environmental variables.

T1  - PREDICTING BIOLOGICAL EVENTS IN THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE PECAN NUT CASEBEARER USING A DEGREE DAY MODEL
AN  - 303212783
AB  - A degree day model for predicting overwintering and 1st summer generation pecan nut casebearer (pnc), Acrobasis nuxvorella Neunzig (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), activity was developed. The starting date and base temperature resulting in the most accurate predictions was determined at College Station, Texas using temperature records from Climatological Data (1918-1923) and field data from Bilsing (1926, 1927) in 1918-1923. Model predictions were compared to the mean calendar date of activity, the model using temperature records from hygrothermographs and the model using a sine curve modification.    The model was verified at Shreveport, Louisiana and Brownwood, Texas using pnc black light trap catch data (Calcote, unpublished data). Start dates were observed to vary while base temperature exhibited little variation. An average number of 2.72 frost free days (ffd) were required for a 1 day change in the start day.    The model was generalized using ffd and tested on data obtained from the literature.    Results of application of the model on a real time basis were determined using start dates based on ffd and linearly interpolated temperature normals when actual daily temperature records were unobtainable.    While several clusters had 2 eggs, they were seldom oviposited on the same nut. Oviposition occurred on the tip of the pistil and the calyx lobes only.    Insufficient evidence was obtained to reject the null hypothesis that nut entry by the 1st summer generation pnc and physiological drop were independent. Nut entry occurred over ca. 1200 degree days at College Station, Texas in 1980 and 1981. The average number of nuts destroyed/cluster by the 1st summer generation pnc ranged from 1.72-2.55 and the average number of nuts undamaged/cluster ranged from 0.52-3.1. Significant differences in cluster size and nut position in relation to nut infestation were not obtained. The 1st summer generation pnc prefered to enter the proximal end of the nut adjacent to the peduncle.    Overwintering generation male pnc moths emerged and were caught prior to females; however there was little difference due to sex. The observed sex ratio for overwintering generation pnc moths approximated a 1:1 ratio (males to females).

T1  - FUNCTION AND ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF ESTERASE 6 ALLOZYMES IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER REPRODUCTION
AN  - 303150032
AB  - Reproductive functions of the seminal fluid enzyme esterase 6 in Drosophila melanogaster are examined with attention to the adaptive significance of widespread genetic variation at this enzyme's structural locus. Ejaculate esterase 6 aids in sperm use by females, increasing the rate of sperm release from storage organs. Progeny production following single matings does not differ in response to this sperm use effect, due to the high degree of sperm redundancy. However, females remate sooner when receiving esterase 6 from males, causing significantly lower reproductive fitness for these males. This earlier remating is a direct consequence of different levels of sperm storage in the female's ventral receptacle, probably due to a neurally-mediated response by females to sperm motility. Esterase 6 variant males do not differ in sperm competitive abilities when mating with inseminated females, although variants at other loci do have strong effects on sperm competition. D. melanogaster males do not displace sperm when copulating with an inseminated female, suggesting that their fitness is related to direct competitive function of the sperm. Reproduction at low temperature is reduced and altered in form from that at optimal temperature. In this environment, esterase 6 contributes significantly to increased productivity of matings, probably through its action to increase sperm motility. In an experiment designed to test for effects of the single locus variants on quantitative traits in relation to background genetic variation, the common fast and slow allozymic forms of esterase 6 significantly affected mating speeds. In this experiment, the esterase 6 enzyme activity did not differ for fast and slow allozymes, although additive and sex-linked variation at other loci did affect esterase 6 production. Gene frequencies for esterase 6 and alcohol dehydrogenase were differently selected by temperatures in caged populations, constant with predictions from the studies of low temperature reproduction for esterase 6 and with other evidence for alcohol dehydrogenase. As well, significant sex differences and Hardy-Weinberg deviations were also found for esterase 6, but not alcohol hydrogenase, gene frequencies. These results together suggest that maintenance of esterase 6 polymorphisms in natural populations of Drosophila are due to a complex form of sexual selection.

T1  - VARIATIONS IN THE LIFE HISTORY STRATEGY OF DAPHNIA PULEX ALONG A LATITUDINAL GRADIENT
AN  - 303127863
AB  - Observations of life history strategies of populations of a species along a latitudinal gradient allows comparisons of organisms with similar morphological, physiological, and genetic constraints but adapted to different environments. Four predictive models for life history characteristics of the cladoceran Daphnia pulex along a latitudinal gradient were tested. These models were based on temperature physiology, the size-selectivity of predation, and deterministic and stochastic life history theory.    Two clones of cladocerans were isolated from animals collected at Frobisher Bay (63(DEGREES)48'N), Churchill (58(DEGREES)40'N), and Windsor (42(DEGREES)19'N), Canada, and at Lincoln, Nebraska (40(DEGREES)49'N). After acclimation newborn individuals were isolated and reared in environmental chambers which simulated arctic (24:0 LD, 14(DEGREES)C) or temperate (14:10 LD, 18(DEGREES)C) conditions of photoperiod and temperature.    Each pair of clones was found to have a unique suite of life history characteristics. The arctic clones took longer to mature and had few, small broods of large offspring; the temperate clones took less time to mature and had many broods of small offspring. Arctic clones appeared to be sensitive to the difference in photoperiod in the two simulations, producing only resting eggs in the temperate simulation. The particular suite of traits remained the same in both environments for all sets of clones which suggests that there is a genetic component to the life history strategy of Daphnia.    The stochastic model was least accurate in predicting the life history characteristics observed. The other models predict similar traits so that the observed suite of traits could be the result of interactions between many factors including temperature physiology, the effects of size-selective predation, and density dependent/independent mortality factors (the deterministic model).

T1  - THE EFFECT OF THE FREQUENCY OF A SPECIES IN COMPETITION ON THE EVOLUTION OF INTERSPECIES COMPETITIVE ABILITY: AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST WITH DROSOPHILA WILLISTONI AND D. PSEUDOOBSCURA
AN  - 303118837
AB  - In this study two separate experiments on competition between laboratory populations of Drosophila willistoni and D. pseudoobscura were designed to:  (i)determine the temperature range over which the two species would coexist in mixed-species culture and (ii)test the predictions of a hypothesis on the evolution of interspecies competitive ability proposed by Pimentel, Feinberg, Wood and Hayes (1965). The first experiment was a preliminary experiment which determined the temperature conditions to be used in the latter experiment.    In the preliminary experiment it was found that at the highest temperature tested (25(DEGREES)C) the tropical species, D. willistoni, competitively excludes the temperate zone species, D. pseudoobscura. At the lowest temperature (18(DEGREES)C) the converse is observed, and at several intermediate temperatures (19-22(DEGREES)C) the two species coexist.    The second experiment was designed to test the hypothesis proposed by Pimental et al. (1965) which predicts that natural selection will increase the interspecific competitive ability of a species which occurs at a low frequency in competition. The hypothesis also predicts that selection generally will not improve the interspecific competitive ability of a competitor which is maintained at a high frequency. The authors proposed that such evolutionary changes in competitive ability would promote the coexistence of interspecific competitors. In order to test this hypothesis Drosophila willistoni adults were maintained at fixed frequencies of 20, 50 and 80 percent in competition with D. pseudoobscura. These selection conditions were maintained for 84 weeks (approximately 30 generations). In these cultures genetic changes in competitive ability could occur within the willistoni populations in response to competition with pseudoobscura. Control cultures in which willistoni was maintained at a fixed density in single-species culture were also kept over the 84-week period of selection.    At the end of the selection period tests were completed to measure genetic changes in the interspecies competitive ability of each of the willistoni selection lines. In these tests the survivorship of the adults and the total number of progeny produced over a five-week period was measured for each willistoni line when placed in mixed-species culture with pseudoobscura. The results of the tests show that evolution has proceeded in the opposite direction of that predicted by the hypothesis of Pimental et. al. Those selection lines which were maintained at frequencies of 50 and 20 percent willistoni have evolved a lower competitive ability than the 80 percent lines. The competitive ability of the control cultures is also higher than the 50 and 20 percent lines.    It is proposed that interspecific competition with pseudoobscura may have been relatively unimportant in determining the observed evolutionary changes. Selection may have acted to reduce the deleterious effects of intraspecific competition between genotypes within the willistoni populations maintained at the highest levels of crowding. The results of past studies which have examined the evolution of interspecies competitive ability in laboratory populations of insects are discussed. These past results and those of the present study indicate that it is unlikely that the evolutionary increase of the competitive ability of a rare competitor would be a consistent mechanism for promoting the coexistence of interspecific competitors.

T1  - THE ROLE OF TRANSOVARIAL TRANSMISSION IN THE NATURAL HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS IN CALIFORNIA
AN  - 303116621
AB  - Female Aedes melanimon from California infected either parenterally or orally transmitted California encephalitis (CE) virus transovarially. Transmission rates for females collected in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys were similar, 20 and 18%, respectively, and transmission was equal to progeny of both sexes.    Vertical transmission was relatively inefficient when females were infected orally with a low viral dose, and more efficient with large viral doses. Rates were indistinguishable when females were infected orally with a high viral dose or by intrathoracic inoculation.    Vertical transmission rates ranged from 9 to 29% in Aedes dorsalis inoculated with CE viral strains isolated from Ae. melanimon collected in California. The month or year of viral isolation had no effect on the efficiency of vertical transmission. However, a viral strain isolated from Inyo County was less efficiently transmitted than strains from the Sacramento Valley, and strains from the San Joaquin Valley were intermediate in efficiency.    In one experiment, a temperature sensitive mutant of CE virus was transmitted vertically to adult progeny when they were reared at 18C, but not when reared at 27C. Larvae were infected at both temperatures. In later experiments, there tended to be a reverse effect, with higher infection rates in adults reared at higher temperatures.    Aedes melanimon eggs retained infectious virus for at least 8 months, even when repeatedly frozen and thawed. Infection rates were similar in eggs hatched 3 weeks or 8 months after oviposition. Embryos survived best when eggs were stored at 4C, however, storage temperature had no effect on infection rates in surviving embryos. Infection with CE virus did not affect survival of embryos, larvae, or adults, but infected larvae pupated later than uninfected larvae. All infected females, from whom 10 or more progeny were examined, transmitted virus transovarially.    Three subpopulations of Ae. dorsalis developed vertical transmission rates over 90%. Infected progeny in these subpopulations transmitted virus at similar rates through 5 generations. Female Ae. dorsalis transovarially infected through 5 consecutive generations transmitted virus by bite.    California group viruses are probably mosquito viruses maintained in nature in subpopulations of the vector with highly efficient veritcal transmission. Transovarially infected females infect vertebrates by bite, and there may be little need for an amplification of the vector viral prevalence by a mosquito-vertebrate cycle.

T1  - DIALLEL ANALYSIS AND RESPONSE TO SELECTION FOR LOW TEMPERATURE SPROUTING ABILITY IN TOMATO POPULATIONS
AN  - 303024883
AB  - Parental, F(,1), and F(,2) families of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) derived from a 6 x 6 diallel were evaluated for low temperature sprouting ability in laboratory and field environments to determine the mode of inheritance of low temperature sprouting ability, to assess the reliability of laboratory tests in predicting field emergence, and to characterize the response to selection.    The diallel analysis of variation among parental and F(,1) or F(,2) families indicated that differences attributable to additive, dominance, maternal, and residual effects were fairly consistent over laboratory and field experiments. Additive effects were the most important source of variation in both laboratory and field experiments, accounting for 46% to 85% of the total variation among families. Dominance effects specific to parents or hybrid families were significant in all laboratory experiments but accounted for less than 12% of the total variation among families. Maternal effects were the second largest source of variation among F(,1) families (28%) and among F(,2) families in the field experiments (8% and 18%), but accounted for less than 3% of the family variation in the F(,2) laboratory experiments. Pearson product-moment correlations between F(,2) laboratory experiments (0.84, 0.87, and 0.94) were higher than between field experiments (0.56). Laboratory and field correlations were also higher than between field experiments. The lowest correlations were observed between F(,1) and F(,2) experiments.    Response to selection in field and laboratory environments for low temperature sprouting ability in parental and F(,2) families was evaluated. Treatment sum of squares due to variation among parental and F(,3) progeny selections was partitioned into average effects, and into linear and quadratic responses to selection. Average variation due to parents was significant in laboratory and field selections, but linear and quadratic responses were not, indicating no response to selection among the parents. Means of parents and F(,3) progeny were not significantly different from each other in either field or laboratory selections. Average linear and quadratic effects in field and laboratory F(,3) progeny selections were significant. General (GCA) and specific (SCA) effects were significant for average sprouting time of F(,3) progeny selections in both field and laboratory. GCA effects in laboratory and SCA effects in laboratory and field selections for linear response were also significant. Response to selection was generally greater in crosses between cold (CT) and non-cold type (NCT) sprouting parents, but exceptions to this trend were observed in some NCT x NCT progeny.    Results of this research indicate that low temperature sprouting ability is polygenic, primarily additive, and determined by recessive genes; initial selections for ability to sprout at low temperature may be made more efficiently in laboratory evaluations in controlled environment chambers, but final selections should be conducted in the field over several planting dates; F(,3) progeny selections showed significant linear and quadratic responses to selection, and maximum response was generally observed in F(,3) progeny derived from crosses between CT and NCT parents.

T1  - THE CONTROL AND IMPACT OF LYGUS LINEOLARIS (P. DE B.) ON FIRST-YEAR PEACH SCION STOCK IN MISSOURI
AN  - 303018235
AB  - Insecticide trials were conducted with systemic insecticides to control tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris (P. de B.)) damage on first-year peach scion stock at Stark Bro's Orchards and Nurseries in Louisiana, Missouri. Metasystox('(REGTM))-R 2E, Cygon('(REGTM)) 2E Furadan('(REGTM)) 4F, Temik('(REGTM)) 10-G, and Vydate('(REGTM)) L were tested. The 1979 data showed that one soil-incorporated application of aldicarb at the lowest recommended rate, 560 g a.i./linear km, significantly reduced damage to apical meristems for ten weeks. The other compounds were applied as foliar sprays and were ineffective.    Bioassay tests with Lygus lineolaris and the convergent ladybeetle, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, demonstrated that soil applications of aldicarb resulted in the translocation of some aldicarb and/or its metabolites into the exudate of peach leaf nectaries. Mortality of H. convergens was lower with the higher aldicarb rates, suggesting a feeding inhibition response. Chemical analyses of the exudate revealed the presence of seven carbohydrates, 18 amino acids and seven fatty acids.    Previous researchers' work on the development of Lygus lineolaris at different temperature regimes was analyzed to determine base developmental thresholds for the egg and all numphal stadia. Centigrade degree days (CDD) were calculated using a sine wave accumulation method with a 10(DEGREES)C base temperature. Using published laboratory results, the CDD between generations, in the laboratory tests, ranged from 532 to 709 CDD at constant temperatures.    Analyses of sweep net data accumulated during the three year study showed that the CDD between peaks of the late (fourth + fifth nymphal stadia) instars of the second and third generations in 1977 and 1978 Louisiana, Missouri, ranged from 512 to 724 CDD. Analysis of population frequency polygons and degree day data indicated three generations per year with a partial fourth generation. Analysis of weekly damage ratings showed plant bug damage was severest from mid-June to mid-July with slight variations. Damage coincided with the peak abundance date of the first generation adults and continued until the appearance of the early second generation adults. In terms of CDD, significant damage ((LESSTHEQ) 10% of meristems stunted) during the three years, began at 185 to 247 CDD after the first generation of late instars reached peak abundance.

T1  - BIOLOGICAL STUDIES ON CULEX PIPIENS L. AND CULEX RESTUANS THEO. (DIPTERA, CULICIDAE) IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO
AN  - 303018132
AB  - Culex pipiens and C. restuans had three generations per year in southern Ontario. Eggs for the first generation of each species were laid from mid-May to early June, the second generation from early June to mid-July and the third generation from mid-July to early August. The third generation of C. pipiens and the second of C. restuans were usually the largest.    Oviposition by each species was greatest within two hours of sunset with a secondary peak at sunrise. No oviposition occurred between four hours after sunrise and sunset. Decanoic acid was not an effective ovipositional attractant for these species.    Overwintered females of C. pipiens and C. restuans produced ca. 185 eggs per blood meal. This was significantly lower than that of the summer generations (C. pipiens ca. 315, C. restuans ca. 220). This may have been due to a change in physiology associated with winter survival. Egg production per blood meal by each species declined in late summer possibly due to an ageing of the reproductively active portion of the populations or development of larvae under high densities. Temperature during ovarian development did not affect the number of eggs produced per blood meal. However, the development of larvae of C. pipiens under crowded conditions did reduce egg production. Ovarian development by C. pipiens was correlated positively with air temperature.    The rate of embryonic development of each species was similar and was correlated positively with temperature. The rate of development of larvae plus pupae of each species was also correlated positively with temperature but correlated negatively with larval density. Water temperature was more important than larval density in determining the developmental rate of C. pipiens. However, the opposite was true with C. restuans. Survival of larvae and pupae of each species depended on larval density and not water temperature. Survival of each species was similar; however, the development rate of C. restuans was slower than that of C. pipiens when raised at high densities.    Diapausing C. pipiens and C. restuans had ratios of follicle:germarium length of less than 2.0:1.0. Culex pipiens began to enter diapause in early July with more than 90 per cent in diapause by mid-August. Onset of diapause in C. restuans was also in early July with greater than 80 per cent in diapause by late July. The induction of diapause was an important factor influencing the number of generations per year and the size of the third generation in each species. The incidence of diapause in C. pipiens was increased when larvae were raised at low water temperatures or high larval densities.    Diapausing female C. pipiens entered overwintering sites in Guelph from mid-September to mid-October. Greater than 95 per cent mortality occurred in most sites. Ovarioles of diapausing females did not develop from the diapause to the nondiapause state by the end of overwintering. Surviving females left their overwintering sites at approximately the time of the soil temperature inversion.    Based on biological and epidemiological factors the most efficient control procedure to reduce the possibility of an outbreak of Saint Louis encephalitis is larval control from late May through July.

T1  - BIONOMICS OF ATAENIUS SPRETULUS (COLEOPTERA: SCARABAEIDAE) ON SOUTHERN OHIO GOLF COURSES
AN  - 303061164
AB  - The black turfgrass ataenius, Ataenius spretulus (Haldeman) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is an important pest of golf course greens, tees, and fairways in Hamilton and Clermont Counties, Ohio. Eggs average 0.75 x 0.52 mm and are deposited in clusters of 11-12 in the thatch and thatch-soil interface. Head capsule widths of larvae average 0.5 mm for first instars, 0.83 mm for second instars, and 1.3 mm for third instars. Mature larvae are ca. 8.5 mm long and possess teges of 40-45 hamate setae on their rasters. The root-feeding larvae have caused wilt or death of host turf-grasses, Poa annua L., Agrostis species and Poa pratensis L. Pupae average 4.7 x 2.5 mm and occupy cells excavated 1-8 cm deep in the soil.    There are two generations per year in southern Ohio. Oviposition periods began in May and July. First generation adults emerged in late June-early July; second generation emergence occurred in August. The sex ratio in samples was ca. 1:1, but favored females slightly.    The dispersion pattern of infestations in sampling sites best conformed to a highly contagious or logarithmic distribution for all age classes.    Second generation adults overwintered after copulating (89.7% of females inseminated), exhibiting a survival rate of 93 (+OR-) 3%. Winter is passed beneath duff and in soil at the tree line of wooded areas in and surrounding golf courses. Males and females survived winter with equal success. Population density of overwintering beetles reached 264/929 cm('2).    A day degree system of predicting A. spretulus activity and development in the field was based on a flight activity threshold of 13(DEGREES)C. Seasonal life history of the insect was also correlated to plant phenology. Oviposition of first generation eggs occurred after 100-150 day degrees when Spiraea vanhouttei (Briot) Zabel and Aesculus hippacastanum L. reached full bloom and Robinia pseudoacacia L. began to blossom. Appearance of second generation eggs occurred after 650-710 day degrees when Hibiscus syriacus L. began to blossom.    Generation periods of 60-70 days were observed in the field, where soil temperatures approached or exceeded 30(DEGREES)C. The time from adult eclosion to oviposition was ca. 20 days. Laboratory-reared A. spretulus required ca. 53 days to develop (oviposition to adult eclosion) at 23 (+OR-) 2(DEGREES)C and 68 (+OR-) 12% R.H. The time from adult eclosion to oviposition was ca. 20 days. Survivorship of reared insects averaged 17%.    Incidence of milky disease at sampling sites ranged from < 1% in May and June to 29% in October.

T1  - ENRICHMENT FOR TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE MUTANTS IN TETRAHYMENA THERMOPHILA
AN  - 302993736
AB  - Two techniques for the enrichment of ts mutants in Tetrahymena thermophila have been developed. These are the first ts mutants enrichments to be characterized in Tetrahymena.    Enrichment was obtained by treatment with BUdR and black light (BL). Parameters were determined for the preferential killing by BL irradiation of cells that had incorporated BUdR. As BL alone was found to be toxic to cells irradiated in growth medium, the cells were washed into a non-nutrient buffer prior to irradiation. Mutants defective in division at a restrictive temperature were isolated both from mutagenized cultures that had undergone BUdR/BL treatment and from mutagenized cultures that had no such treatment. The number of ts mutants that stopped division within several cell generations was increased five to six times after BUdR/BL treatment; those that stopped within one cell generation after the temperature shift were enriched even more. A mutant that immediately stopped macromolecular synthesis and cell division upon being placed at the restrictive temperature was approximately 1000-fold more resistant to BUdR/BL treatment than wild-type. A technique was developed for quickly screening a large number of ts mutants for those that stopped DNA replication but not RNA (or protein) synthesis. All ts mutants isolated that stopped DNA replication at the restrictive temperature also stopped RNA and protein synthesis.    The second enrichment for ts mutants was that obtained by 8-hydroxy-quinoline (Hq) treatment. The effects of the chelating agent Hq on wild-type and mutant T. thermophila were examined in the hope that certain types of ts mutants show increased resistance to this drug. In wild-type, cell division, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis were completely and nonselectively inhibited by 5 (mu)g/ml Hq. This inhibition was reversible after 6 h of Hq treatment. At concentrations above 20 (mu)g/ml, a 10,000-fold decrease in survival was seen after 2 h in the drug. Mutants that were unable to divide at the restrictive temperature but which continued macromolecular synthesis were found to be resistant to Hq treatment. Under certain conditions more than a 1000-fold difference in survival was seen between this class of mutant and the wild-type strain. The effect of Hq on three other classes of ts mutants was also examined.    Five strains (tdr-1 through tdr-5) defective in the phosphorylation of TdR and BUdR were independently isolated after they survived BUdR/BL treatment or toxic amounts of BUdR alone. All alleles code for unconditionally defective gene products except the tdr-3 which codes for a ts function unable to phosphorylate TdR or BUdR at 38(DEGREES) but able to phosphorylate these compounds at 29(DEGREES).    The effects of FUdR and methotrexate on Tetrahymena were examined. A low concentration of FUdR coordinately inhibited all macromolecular synthesis. A mutant (tdr-1) unable to phosphorylate TdR and, presumably, FUdR was more resistant than wild-type to FUdR and FU when grown in defined medium with Urd as the sole pyrimidine but not when grown in a complex medium containing TdR. A mutant (fur-1) was isolated that was resistant to FU and FudR in the complex medium but not in defined medium. These and other results imply two modes of inhibition by FU and FUdR in Tetrahymena    The effects of MTX on cell division under different conditions are discussed. No preferential inhibition of RNA, DNA or protein synthesis was observed in wild-type or tdr strains when MTX was added to cells growing in a complex medium. Two mutants resistant to MTX have been isolated (mex-1, mex-2).

T1  - LIFE SYSTEM OF STEGASTA BOSQUEELLA (CHAMBERS) ON PEANUTS IN OKLAHOMA
AN  - 288394847
AB  - Scope of Study. The rednecked peanutworm, Stegasta bosqueella (Chambers) is the most common lepidopterous insect pest on peanuts, Arachis hypogaea L. in Oklahoma. It can cause considerable defoliation and stunting of plants when population densities are high. The purpose of this investigation was to develop life tables in order to follow the development of this insect in the field and determine the impact of larval feeding on peanuts. Eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults were reared in the laboratory at constant temperatures to establish developmental thresholds and thermal requirements for development. Field sampling for larvae, pupae, and adults was conducted in order to construct life tables of this insect. Artificial and actual rednecked peanutworm damage was inflicted on field grown peanuts to ascertain the plant response to foliar damage.    Findings and Conclusions. Eggs, larvae, and pupae had developmental thresholds of 11.7(DEGREES)C, 11.0(DEGREES)C, and 12.2(DEGREES)C, respectively. The mean C(DEGREES) day accumulations required for completion of life stages were: 66.5 - egg, 156.0 - larva (to prepupa), 25.1 - prepupa, and 94.2 - pupa. None of the life stages completed development at 12.8 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C. There were no significant differences (P = 0.05) between the degree day accumulations required for completion of life stages at 18.3 (+OR-) 1, 23.9 (+OR-) 1, and 29.4 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C. The total generation time for S. bosqueella was calculated to be approximately 440(DEGREES)C days. Life table studies of S. bosqueella indicated that 3 generations a year occur in Oklahoma. Larval numbers were very great at times (over 3 million/hectare) and typically reached maximum numbers in the second generation. Twelve parasitic species were recovered from this host, the most numerous being Orgilus modicus Mues., Chelonus (Microchelonus) sp., and Invreia spp. Disappearance was the major cause of S. bosqueella mortality and appeared to be a combination of biological and climatic factors. Peanut plant response to foliar damage varied with the type of damage inflicted. Although simulated rednecked peanutworm damage appeared very similar to actual damage caused by larval feeding, the plant response was not the same. Artificially damaged plants produced significantly fewer (P = 0.05) pegs, nuts, and terminals and reduced weight of leaves than plants damaged by larval feeding. However, peanutworm damaged plants produced significantly shorter stems as compared to artificially damaged or undamaged plants. Peanut leaflets demonstrate the ability to compensate for damage as they enlarge from terminals. Damage to very small leaflets (area < 150 mm('2)) results in much more compensation than the same extent of damage to larger leaflets (150 - 450 mm('2)). Feeding of S. bosqueella through the larval stage results in a mean reduction in mature leaf area of 3993 mm('2) (ca. 4 leaflets)/individual. The potential for economic damage to peanuts from foliar feeding of the rednecked peanutworm appears to be minimal except for the period of time when plants are 50 - 90 days of age.

T1  - DEMOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES FOR SMALL HUMAN POPULATIONS: AN EXAMINATION OF SEVERAL COMMUNITIES FROM EARLY CONNECTICUT, 1633-1849
AN  - 302925177
AB  - The potential of demographic research within the field of anthropology is just beginning to be realized. The application of classical demographic models will further anthropological understanding of evolutionary change at the population level. The main emphasis of this dissertation was to examine the applicability of several demographic methods to the study of small human populations. Four diversified settlements of early Connecticut were chosen as research areas. This pre-1850 analysis focused on the towns of Windsor, Litchfield, Mansfield, and New London. The research strategy also observed the relationship between historical and biological change in a community.    Population size, density, and change were shown to be useful demographic measures. New London registered the highest growth rate, largest population density, and lowest dependency ratio.    Fertility trends were measured through both vital and census records. Vital records yielded birth totals that were fairly accurate before 1820, and very underregistered after then. Crude and refined rates based on vital data were inaccurate due to underregistration. Fertility rates based on census records were very useful, and showed that fertility had declined during the first half of the nineteenth century. Early Connecticut's peak birth season was February to April, and consistent for the four towns. The adverse effect of summer heat on infants and the agriculturalist's yearly work cycle seem related to this pattern.    Marriage results were also drawn from vital records. Registration was very poor prior to 1821, but due to new registration laws, fairly accurate after then. Litchfield had the most marriages, and coupled with its low fertility, had the smallest mean family sizes. Marriage age was found to be consistent between the four towns, but somewhat higher for the male population. Marriage distances were similar for the towns, especially considering the differences in outside contact. Marriages were highest in October through December, probably resulting from harvest and Christian holiday celebrations.    Mortality data were derived from both vital records and gravestones. Gravestones were found to be the most reliable indicator of past mortality, especially in the very young populations. August through September was the highest period of mortality, probably relating to the influence of gastrointestinal illnesses killing proportionately more people during these months.    Several indices were used to measure the biological conditions of the four towns. Reproductive potential and biological state were lowest in New London. Mansfield had the lowest depletion of potential fertility. Selection intensity was highest in New London, and lowest in Windsor and Litchfield. An inverse relationship was noted for the indices of biological state and selection intensity. Index of life expectancy results showed New London had gained the greatest mean lifetime of the towns from 1750-1799 to 1800-1849. It was suggested that New London's earlier discrepancies in infant mortality had been overcome, and thus the existing life expectancy differences had decreased. The decline in autumnal diseases, due to improved living conditions, was a major force in the mortality decline. The use of indices that measure biological change in a population was felt to be very helpful to the consideration of cause and effect relationships in human biology.    The future of anthropological demography rests upon the continued use and refinement of the techniques of classical demography and population genetics. Only through the continued applications of these methods will come a better understanding of the mechanism of human biological change.

T1  - Structural and spectroscopic studies of lysozyme
AN  - 1771542036
AB  - The characterisation of productive enzyme-substrate complexes stabilised by sub-zero enzymologic methods in the crystalline state is considered for application of electron spin resonance (ESR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) methods. To this end model compounds are investigated as substrate analogues of lysozyme by x-ray diffraction and magnetic resonance methods. Aromatic-linked mixed disaccharides corresponding in chemical structure to Î²(aryl)-4-0-(2-deoxy-2-acetamido- D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucopyranoside are synthesised as substrate analogues of lysozyme to serve as phosphorescent triplet state spectroscopic probes. The stereochemistry and molecular structure of Î²(1-naphthyl)-D-glucopyranoside- 2',3',4',6'-tetra-0-acetate is determined by application of direct methods of structure determination and crystallographic least-squares refinement. The detailed molecular structure of this carbohydrate derivative is compared to that of other glucopyranosides, and the compatibility of the incorporation of the molecular structure of the naphthyl-glucopyranoside moiety only into aromatic-linked mixed disaccharide compounds for purposes of a triplet state spectroscopic probe of lysozyme action is tested by molecular model building studies. ESR and optical detection of magnetic resonance techniques are employed to evaluate the electronic structure of the phosphorescent substrate analogue of lysozyme. incorporation of the structural unit of the Î²(1-naphthyl)-D-glucopyranoside chromophore into a variety of hydrophobic and hydroxylic environments causes readily detectable alterations in the zero-field splitting parameters of the phosphorescent triplet state of the naphthyl group. The zero-field splitting parameters and transitions of the naphthyl-glucopyranoside in these environments are readily distinguishable from those of the expected hydrolysis product Î±-naphthol. These results indicate that the triplet state properties of phosphorescent aromatic groups are sufficiently sensitive to environmental influences and can be employed as direct spectroscopic probes of enzyme action when suitably incorporated into synthetic substrate analogues. The spin-label inhibitor of lysozyme Î²(2,2,6,6- tetramethyl-4-piperidinol-1-N-oxyl)-D-(2-deoxy-2-acetamido-glucopyranoside) is also synthesised as a spectroscopic probe of the active site. ESR and x-ray diffraction studies of single crystals of tetragonal hen egg white lysozyme show that the spin-label is bound in the enzyme crystal. The principal axis corresponding to the gzz-direction is identified by ESR. Application of ENDOR to this orientation results in three types of ENDOR lines arising from interaction of the nitroxide group with nearby hydrogen nuclei. This interaction is analysed in terms of an anisotropic dipole-dipole mechanism. interpretation of the ENDOR spectrum suggests that (i) a protein residue is within 3.7 Ã… of the nitroxide nucleus along the molecular z-axis of the nitroxide group and (ii) the nitroxide group is substantially exposed to the solvent channel or surface of the enzyme. The three-dimensional structure of the spin-label complex is determined by difference Fourier methods. The spin-label binds anomalously across subsites C and B of the lysozyme molecule in a configuration apparently stabilised by binding of the acetamido group in the specificity site in subsite C and by hydrophobic interactions between the methyl groups of the spin-label and Tryp-62 of the enzyme. The structural features of the complex determined by diffraction methods confirm the interpretation of the ENDOR spectrum. Furthermore, the ENDOR results indicate that specific proton sites can be detected in the active site regions of crystalline enzymes as a sensitive means to dilineate stereochemical configurations and structural binding relationships. Since an enzymatically active form of crystalline lysozyme is prerequisite to further spectroscopic and structural study, the catalytic activity of crystalline human lysozyme is assessed. With use of a p-nitrophenyl-linked mixed disaccharide derivative, human lysozyme in orthorhombic crystals is demonstrated to be enzymatically active only when the crystals are equilibrated with a mixed cosolvent medium containing 2-methyl-pentan-2,4-diol. These solvent conditions have negligible effects on the crystal structure and are suitable for preserving the crystal structure at cryogenic temperatures at which ESR and ENDOR techniques must be generally applied. To evaluate conditions appropriate for assaying the enzymatic activity of crystalline enzymes, the catalytic efficiency of crystalline enzymes is analysed mathematically as a function of the diffusion of substrate into crystals and of the kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction in solution. Relationships are derived to demonstrate that crystal dimensions control the influence of diffusion in measuring the catalytic efficiency of crystalline enzymes and that the critical dimension for onset of rate-limiting diffusion can be predicted on the basis of measurable kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction in solution and the invariant diffusion coefficient of the substrate. The catalytic efficiency of crystalline enzymes reported hitherto in the literature is analysed on the basis of these mathematical relationships. Except for the case of papain, it is concluded that the results of all other studies are reported for conditions of rate-limiting diffusion of substrate and are consequently inconclusive in comparing the catalytic activity of the enzyme in crystalline and solution states. In addition, the appropriate chemical conditions are determined for generation and stabilisation of oxymyoglobin in single crystals with use of ferrous D(+)-tartrate in alkaline ammonium sulphate solutions under conditions suitable for high resolution x-ray structural studies.

T1  - The Biology and Population Dynamics of <i>Phyllonorycter oxycanthae</i> (Frey) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) on Hawthorn
AN  - 2232213037
AB  - The biology and population dynamics of the Gracillariid moth Phylloalacter oxvacanthae (Frey) were studied on a small hedgerow of hawthorn (Crataequs mongyna Jacq.) at Bollington, Cheshire. All the leaf mining species on the study hedge were identified, some aspects of their biology studied and their times of appearance recorded. Phyllonorycter oxyacanthae is bivoltine with a facultative diapause about in winter. In spring, the adults start to emerge about the second week of May. Summer adults start to emerge about the first week of July. In both generations, emergence occurs over a period of two to three weeks. Mating appears to provide the main stimulus for oviposition. Nourishment is not essential for oviposition to commence and it does not seem to improve fecundity or increase the life span of a female significantly. The females start to oviposit about two to three days after emergence. Eggs are laid singly on the undersurfaces of hawthorn leaves, a few millimetres away from a main vein. The larvae are led miners feeding on liquid nutriment in the spongy mesophyll tissue in the first three stages and on the palisade tissue in the next two stages. The first instar mine commences as a flat, linear sub-epidermal track which develops into a blotch mine (stigmatonome) when the larvae begin to feed radially. The third instar larva like the two preceding instar larvae has a dorsoventrally flattened body and forwardly directed mouth parts, which are adaptations for living in e flat mine. At the third moult the larva undergoes a remarkable morphological change accompanied by changes in feeding habits and a change in the form of the mine. The fourth instar larva has a cylindrical body, downwardly directed mouth parts, feeds on palisade tissue and converts the blotch mine into a tent mine (ptychonome). The fifth instar larva resembles the fourth. Pupation takes place within the mine which is lined with silk, partly by the fourth instar larva but mainly by the fifth. Frame particles are pushed to a corner of the mine and sealed off from the future pupal chamber with silk by the fifth instar larva just prior to pupation. When the adult is ready to emerge, the pupa "pecks" a hole in the mine floor using its pointed, heavily sclerotized frons and anchoring itself with the cremastral hooks, pushes itself halfway out of the mine. A split occurs on the vertex along the epicranial suture and it forks and continues backwards laterally upto the end of the mesothorax. The imago emerges leaving the pupal case protruding through the hole in the mine floor. The first generation adults emerge from pupae that have overwintered in mines in the leaf litter. The second generation adults emerge in the mid summer from mines in leaves still attached to the bushes. Parasitism and "host predatism" by parasitic Hymenoptera were the main causes of mortality in the immature stages of the first generation. Two species of chalcid wasps of the family Eulophidae, Enaxama atoms (Walker) and Syrapiesisseliceicornis (Nees), were the major parasites of the three generations studied. Other parasites recorded were Pniealio Realinicornis Cirros ilus vittatus (Walker), Ehusocharis laomedon (Walker), Chrysocharis neohereus (Walker) (all Eulophidae), Diadegma nana (Gravenhoita) (Ichneumonidae) andpaanIfles circumperintus (Nees) (Braconidae). Forficula auricularia (C) (Dermaptera) was identified as a predator of the late instars of P. oxyacanthae; it was present on the bushes in spring and summer and also in the leaf litter in winter. Parasites also cause heavy mortality in the second generation. In the winter of 1973, mortality factors operating in the leaf litter took a heavy toll of pupae which had escaped parasitism and predation on the bushes. The centipede Lithobius duboscqui Brolemann was identified as a predator of pupae of P. oxyacanthae and its parasite Enaysma atys, in the litter. It seems likely that some overwintering pupae of P. oxyacanthae fail to enter diapause and are killed by sub-zero temperatures. The population size of the two spring generations studied was much smaller than that of the summer generation. The adult moths appear to be weak fliers and no migratory tendencies were observed during the period of study. Only short flights about the hedge were seen, but it is possible that the moths are dispersed more widely in windy conditions.

T1  - Intra-Specific Mechanisms Regulating the Numbers of the Lime Aphid
AN  - 2100628307
AB  - Populations of the lime aphid, Eucallipterus tiliae. L. were monitored weekly on five lime trees in Glasgow in 1970 and 1971 and the weight of alate virginoparae present on the trees and their reproductive rate recorded. Results for the same trees in I969 are also included. In addition, traps were erected in 1971 to catch aphids falling from three of the trees and flying from one of them. The amount of movement of aphids between leaves on all five trees was recorded daily in 1971.    Populations were also studied on six saplings, caged individually in an insectary such that no immigration could take place from a population and all emigration could be measured. These populations were monitored and alate virginoparae weighed weekly. The caged populations mimicked the field populations, thus the results from the caged populations together with results from laboratory experiments were used to determine the causes of changes in numbers of the lime aphid in the field, and the importance of intra-specific mechanisms in the regulation of these populations.    Fluctuations in aphid numbers are the result of changes in the balance of losses from, and income into the populations. Analysis showed that alate loss by flight from a population, contributed most to the total 'mortality' the amount and direction of change in alate loss and total mortality being similar. Alate flight was density dependent and was mainly a response to the density present at the time of flight and was the result of mutual interaction due to intra-specific competition for space and possibly food. The number of nymphs that fell off the trees was however proportional to density.    The income into a population is determined by the number of alate virginoparae left on a tree after the density dependent flight response, and also on the reproductive rate of those that are left. The reproductive rate and the length of the pre-reproductive delay of an alate virginoparae ace determined mainly by its weight, which is dependent on the density of aphids present during its development and during the development of previous generations. Reproduction also increased with temperature, but this effect was minor when compared with the effect of weight in determining the number of nymphs produced.    The effect of density on weight is the result of intra-specific competition for food which appears to create a nutrient drain and thus a reduction in the amount of food available per individual, and also intra-specific competition for space which leads to a reduction in the time spent feeding. The density experienced during their development also appears to affect the weight of adult oviparae and through this the number of eggs they produce. Once small aphids have been produced as the result of high densities, it would take several generations under favourable conditions for aphids to regain a large size.    In years when the number of fundatrices is high, populations attain an early high peak and then decline rapidly only recovering later if predators are absent (as in the caged populations). When few fundatrices are present, the populations remain low only attaining a small peak late in the season. Markedly fewer eggs per fundatrix are produced in a year when the number of fundatrices is high than when they are low, thus few fundatrices are present in a year following one in which many fundatrices were present. This is an overcompensated density dependent response which,after a disturbance,would result in the population fluctuating with decreasing amplitude from year to year.    The overcompensated response is the result of the effect of intraspecific competition on the weight, and thus the reproduction of alate virginoparae and the egg production of oviparae, and also on the percentage of alates that leave the population. The presence of predators can result in an even more overcompensated response since they further reduce the production of oviparae in years when the number of fundatrices is high. Regulation of populations of E.tiliae thus appears to be mainly effected through intra-specific mechanisms.

T1  - The biology of capitella capitata (fabricius) and a review of the genus capitella blainville
AN  - 1818738613
AB  - The thesis is concerned with the biology of Capitella capitata in British waters and the validity of the genus Capitella throughout the world. Material from Europe, America and Australia has been examined and an extensive review of the literature on the taxonomy of Capitella has been made. As a result the generic description has been modified to include the genus Capitellides. The description of C. capitata has been widened to account for variations between populations and the subspecies C. capitata ovincola and C. capitata tripartita have been elevated to specific level. An ecological study of some British populations has been made and it is shown that while C. capitata will occur under a wide range of conditions, it is predominant where other polychaetes are less common. The life history has been investigated and it has been shown to reproduce in Britain throughout the year. Two larval types have been found. The effects of various ecological factors have been studied in the laboratory. Both adults and larvae were found to be resistant to conditions of low salinity and, especially, low oxygen tension. The species is, however, very sensitive to increases in temperature. The feeding biology has been studied and an estimate of the available organic content in the substrate made. The relationship of the species to polluted conditions is discussed. In conclusion it is noted that C. capitata owes its worldwide distribution to its adaptability allowing it to penetrate a variety of habitats. This same lack of specialisation, however, makes it unsuccessful as a competitor with species more narrowly adapted to particular sets of environmental conditions.

T1  - The energetics of colpidium campylum stokes with a note on the vertical distribution of ciliophera in the mud of loch leven, kinross
AN  - 301410906
AB  - The energetics of, the holotrich ciliate Colpidium campylum fed on the bacterium Moraxella sp. at 10°C, 15°C and 20°C were investigated. The parameter used for ascertaining growth. was the volume of protoplasm produced measured by means of a Coulter Counter with a mean cell volume converter attachment. Growth and consumption were measured in relation to food availability as indicated by the ratio of bacteria: protozoan. Mean cell volume variation and reproduction were also measured in relation to food availability and energy consumed. Protozoan and bacterial material were harvested by centrifugation and freeze-dried for dried weight determinations and calorimetry studies. The energy content of Colpidium and its food source was determined with a Phillipson microbomb calorimeter. Respiration was measured in a Warburg respirometer. Oxygen uptake in relation to population density and cell size was considered as well as the production of information concerning the heat lost during respiration for incorporation into energy budgets. Energy budgets of. two types were constructed: a 24-hour energy budget for an individual and the life-span or generation energy budget for an individual. Gross growth efficiencies, net growth efficiencies and assimilation efficiencies were considered in detail. In addition to laboratory work the vertical distribution of Ciliophora in the mud of Loch Leven, Kinross, Scotland, was also considered; three sites, two shallow and one deep, being sampled with a core sampler over a 12 month period.

T1  - Some aspects of the effect of temperature on the respiratory and cardiac activities of the Cichlid Teleost <i>Tilapia mossambica</i>
AN  - 2131777773
AB  - The importance of the cichlid teleost Tilapia mossambica as a protein source, coupled with its remarkable adaptability, has resulted in its introduction into many water systems throughout the tropical, sub-tropical and even temperate regions of the world. However, its successful exploitation of these waters is dependent very largely upon the value of minimum temperatures and their duration. For e.g. Long et al (1961) has drawn attention to the tremendous mortalities of T. mossambica that occur in shallow water bodies during the precipitous temperature decreases that accompany the winter monsoons in Vietnam and other eastern countries, even at temperatures as high as 14 or 16°C. Coehe (1967) does not recommend stocking with T. mossambica where temperatures are not above 14°C all the time. Ailanson et al (1962) conclude, after an experimental study, that low temperatures (13°C or lower) in South African highveld dams in winter are certainly an important factor in the extensive mortalities of T. mossambica that have been reported from these dams. Jubb (1961) also reports that this species is often killed during a severe winter in Rhodesia.

T1  - The effects of temperature on certain life stages of Simuliidae (Diptera)
AN  - 2101922183
AB  - The present study considers, on a systematic basis, the relationship between the development and altitudinal distribution Prosimulium hirtipes (Fries) larvae and the thermal sums to which the larvae are exposed during their developmental period. It will be shown that development of these larvae is very closely related to the thermal sum and that the completion of development occurs at a later date at the higher altitudes. The altitudinal distribution of P. hirtipes larvae in the stream is compared with those of the larvae of other black-fly species present in the stream during the period of study and an attempt is made to give an explanation for their different altitudinal distributions.  An attempt has also been made to explain the absence of P. hirtipes from the stream during the period of higher water temperatures during the Summer months, while other species of larvae are present at the same altitudes, and are able to complete Summer generations. The study has, for convenience, been divided into two sections, Section 1 dealing with the field studies, and with the larval temperature-mortality experiments,and Section 2 describes laboratory experiments investigating the relationship between air temperature and the activity of the adult flies of Simulium ornatum Meig. This study was carried out from Summer 1956 to Summer 1957.

T1  - The Life-History of the Potato Tuber Moth <em>Gnorimoschema operculell</em> (Zeller) and Its Control in Storage
AN  - 2396739891
AB  - The life history of the potato tuber moth Gnorimoschema operculella (Zell.) and its chemical control in storage have been studied in the present investigation. The period required for the development of one generation was found to vary inversely with temperature. In winter the period was found to vary between fifty and fifty-nine days, while in summer it varied between twenty-four and thirty-three days. The optimum temperature for reproduction and egglaying was found to be about 28 to 29°c. Under the prevailing weather conditions in Lebanon there is a possibility of having more than 7 to 8 generations a year. For the control of the moth in storage three contact insecticides, DDT, Sevin and Lindane, have been used as water dilutions at two concentrations each, in which the empty b~gs of potatoes were impregnated. The treatments have been replicated three times. The three insecticides showed equal effectiveness in fully controlling all the moths, which resulted in 100 per cent protection of stored tubers.

T1  - Biology of wheat -stem maggot <i>Meromyza americana</i> Fitch in relation to the preference for different cereals especially wheat varieties in Kansas
AN  - 288057733
AB  - The wheat-stem maggot Meromyza americana Fitch (Dipt. - Chloropidae) is a well known and widely distributed insect pest in North America injuring wheat, barley, rye and a great range of grasses.    In several oviposition tests is the greenhouse it could be proved that preference during oviposition was involved. The soft wheat variety Harvest Queen was repeatedly the least preferred variety, whereas the hard wheat varieties Ponca, Pawnee and Comanche were attractive and Red Chief and Cheyenne took an intermediate position. Balbo rye was not very attractive. The two barley varieties Reno and Dictoo carried only a few eggs. On the oat varieties Cherokee, Kanota and Mo.0–250 no oviposition could be observed at all. The range of preference in the wheat varieties mentioned above was changed when the flats were exposed to different light sources involving the colors yellow, red and blue. No evidence of adverse effects on the developing larvae could be demonstrated in the wheat varieties involved in the tests.    In a date-variety-test in the greenhouse it was demonstrated that oviposition is also influenced by the growth stage of the host plants, since in three out of six varieties the more advanced plants got twice as many eggs as the later plants. It is suggested that the range of wavelength of the light reflected from the host plant and the stage of growth may act separately, or together, or in turn, probably with additional unknown factors to cause preference during oviposition.    The presence of inflated femora in the adults of M. americana  would suggest a great leaping ability similar to that known in flea beetles. However, leaping only occurs over distances of a few millimeters. In flies, the wings of which were cut off, leaving does not occur. The swollen femora together with the curved tibiae were demonstrated to provide an efficient mechanism for cleaning and stretching the wings. The flight is strongly limited to temperatures above 13°C. The possibility of rearing M. americana  in the greenhouse continuously over several generations is positively discussed. Attention is focused upon the question whether M. americana  might transmit western wheat streak mosaic, since abundance of adults in early sown wheat and its activity, as for instance the feeding on honey-dew of aphids and on guttation water, makes it highly suspicious in this regard.
