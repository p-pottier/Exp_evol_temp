T1  - Oviposition behavior along a temperature gradient in Drosophila melanogaster
AN  - 304133156
AB  - Oviposition behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster were investigated by testing wild-type flies along a temperature gradient. Individual females were tested and the mean temperature of the substrate in which eggs were oviposited was used to estimate the oviposition temperature preference. Adult acclimation temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30$\sp\circ$C) during the 72 hours prior to the assay had a significant effect on the mean oviposition temperature and the two were positively correlated. Developmental temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30$\sp\circ$C), from egg to adult had no effect on this behavior. Low genetic variability was found for this trait. Heritability ($h\sp2$) was estimated to be 0.04 for the strain tested with a mother-daughter regression. Also, no difference was found among four strains from different geographic origins (two tropical and two temperate). However, after one year, flies from populations reared at 30$\sp\circ$C had a significantly higher mean oviposition temperature preference than those reared at 15$\sp\circ$C. Crosses between these two populations, reared at both 15 and 30$\sp\circ$C, indicated significant effects due to both genetic and environmental influences. Analysis of locomotor behavior during the assay indicated a difference between the substrate temperatures preferred for oviposition versus that for a resting location by the females. The females select oviposition sites with temperatures that are higher than the temperatures at which they prefer to rest. Discussions include the optimal strategies for oviposition site temperatures and the possibility of bet-hedging strategies for this behavior.    The behavior of inserting eggs into the substrate was also investigated. Significant differences were found among the four geographic strains tested. The strain from the location with the highest average temperatures throughout the year inserted the highest percentage, while that from the location with the mildest temperatures inserted the least. After several generations at 15 and 30$\sp\circ$C, flies inserted a lower percentage of eggs than in the initial generations. The percentage of eggs inserted at different temperatures along the gradient was analyzed. This revealed a general trend of increased insertion percentages at higher temperatures. Results support the hypothesis that the insertion of eggs into the substrate is a mechanism to prevent desiccation.

T1  - Marine cladocerans in Narragansett Bay
AN  - 304129009
AB  - This dissertation examines feeding and population dynamics of marine cladocerans. Feeding rates of Podon polyphemoides on Gymnodinium sanguineum at 1-100 cells $\cdot$ ml$\sp{-1}$ (6-638 $\mu$g C $\cdot$ l$\sp{-1}$) increased with food concentration, and ranged from 1.4 to 20.2 cells $\cdot$ animal$\sp{-1} \cdot$ h$\sp{-1}$, equivalent to 3-30% of body C $\cdot$ h$\sp{-1}$ at 18$\sp\circ$C. In consecutive experiments, P. polyphemoides fed in the light, but not in the dark. P. polyphemoides fed on G. sanguineum in a natural plankton assemblage, but not on Skeletonema cosfatum. P. polyphemoides, at 14-22$\sp\circ$C, had good survival to birth of the first brood when fed C. sanguineum, but little growth and no reproduction on Cryptomonas baltica or Skeletonema. Generation times for P. polyphemoides decreased from 12 days at 10$\sp\circ$ to 3 days at 22$\sp\circ$C.    Population dynamics of cladocerans were studied at a station in the West Passage of Narragansett Bay. Evadne nordmanni, Podon polyphemoides P. leuckarti, P. intermedius, and Penilia avirostris were collected in quantitative sampling. E. nordmanni and P. polyphemoides, the most abundant, had late spring-early summer and fall periods of abundance, separated by midsummer population collapses, and fall reappearances. Each period of occurrence was characterized by a decline in brood size, and by appearance of sexual individuals. When E. nordmanni and P. polyphemoides co-occurred, brood sizes were correlated between species, but negatively correlated with abundance of adult calanoid copepods (summer only). Both species showed increased fecundity during a bloom of heterotrophic gymnodinioid dinoflagellates. In summer, mortality was correlated with decreasing population growth rates of E. nordmanni and P. polyphemoides. The summer collapses were due to increased mortality, possibly due to predation. The late fall declines of Podon and Evadne were associated with declining birth rate, due to low water temperature and high incidence of sexual reproduction. Production of P. polyphemoides was estimated at 79 mg C $\cdot$ m$\sp{-2}$ in 1988 and 533 mg C $\cdot$ m$\sp{-2}$ in 1989.    Cladocerans of the family Podonidae are characterized by high feeding rates and short generation times, resulting in high birth and population growth rates. These life history characteristics may contribute to their drastic population fluctuations.

T1  - Interspecific competition between native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in streams
AN  - 304126145
AB  - Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are thought to be negatively impacted by introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in many eastern North American streams. I attempted to determine whether (1) the longitudinal pattern of brook trout and rainbow trout abundance in streams was due to competition, (2) temperature had an effect on aggressive interactions between the species, and (3) selection of stream positions was affected by competition. Through field sampling and observation in a small Pennsylvania stream I found the typical pattern of brook trout occurring more abundantly upstream and rainbow trout becoming more abundant downstream. Habitat observations indicated that rainbow trout adults obtained access to preferred deep-water habitats during summer low flows, while the two species occurred in similar habitats in spring when space was more abundant. Individually enclosed age 1 fish of both species exhibited similar survival and growth rates at upstream and downstream locations. These findings suggest that for age 1 fish, neither brook trout nor rainbow trout possess an inherent advantage at the stream locations in which they predominate, and that fish $\ge$ age 1 may compete for habitat. The lab experiments conducted at 13$\sp\circ$C and 18$\sp\circ$C indicated that brook trout were more aggressive and had higher growth rates than paired rainbow trout, but there was no difference in foraging success between the two species. I found temperature to have little effect on the interaction among native brook trout and rainbow trout. However, both species grew equally well when held separately, which suggests neither species possess an inherent physiological advantage at these stream temperatures. Positions selected by brook trout and rainbow trout in multiple-fish pools were directly related to fish size, but there was no correlation between fish position and fish size in single fish pools. The field experiment involving removal of rainbow trout from interspecific pairs demonstrated that brook trout did not shift positions if they were more aggressive, but those that were not aggressive did shift positions. The results suggest that brook trout and rainbow trout actively compete for stream positions, with fish size and aggressiveness important factors determining outcomes of the interaction.

T1  - Effects of heat, lactic acid, and modified atmosphere packaging on Listeria monocytogenes on cooked crawfish tail meat
AN  - 304120829
AB  - The generation time of L. monocytogenes was calculated to be 72.2, 28.5, 17.01, and 6.9 h on crawfish tail meat held at 0, 4, 6, and 12$\sp\circ$C, respectively. Potassium sorbate (PS) (0.3%) spray treatments on crawfish held at 4$\sp\circ$C, extended the lag phase of the bacterium. However, once exponential growth began, a generation time not significantly different (P $>$ 0.05) than that of untreated crawfish was observed. Samples sprayed with 0.3% citric acid (CA) and held at 4$\sp\circ$C supported growth of the bacterium equally well as that of untreated samples.    Thermal inactivation of L. monocytogenes using a three neck reactionary flask method yielded D$\sb{55,60,65}$ values of 10.23, 1.98, and 0.19 min, respectively. A z value of 5.5$\sp\circ$C was calculated. Polybag and cellulose casing methodology yielded significantly higher (P $\ge$ 0.05) D$\sb{60}$ values of 4.68 and 3.84 respectively, for the bacterium. D$\sb{60}$ values for L. monocytogenes decreased as the percent lactic acid (LA) spray treatments levels were increased. Increasing sensitivity to heat with LA was not solely due to a reduction of pH. D$\sb{60}$ values for the bacterium on samples packed in air, O$\sb2$, CO$\sb2$, or N$\sb2$ were not significantly different (P $>$ 0.05), however, D$\sb{60}$ of samples packed under O$\sb2$ were lowest.    Generation times for heat damaged L. monocytogenes on crawfish meat stored at 4$\sp\circ$C and packed under air, O$\sb2$, CO$\sb2$, or N$\sb2$ was determined. Twenty percent of the cell population was damaged when thermally treated at 60$\sp\circ$C for 12.5 min. The bacterium consistently grew slowest in CO$\sb2$ and O$\sb2$. Samples receiving a treatment of 1% LA, packaging under either of the 4 different atmospheres, and storage at 4$\sp\circ$C, were lethal to the bacterium.    These studies indicate that post-packaging heat treatments of 60$\sp\circ$C or greater in the presence of CO$\sb2$ or O$\sb2$, and the addition of 1% LA sprays, would be detrimental to the survival of L. monocytogenes on crawfish meat.

T1  - Meiotic chromosome abnormalities in a laboratory stock of the crane fly Nephrotoma suturalis
AN  - 304108035
AB  - Spermatocytes in a laboratory stock of the crane fly Nephrotoma suturalis (designated the JD stock) expressed a statistically significant higher mean number of meiotic chromosome abnormalities (15.7%) compared to progeny of Wild derived Nephrotoma females (1.2%). These abnormalities occurred in Meiosis I. Anaphase bridges lacking acentric fragments were the most prevalent abnormality, followed by autosomal univalents, and chromatids and fragments. The chiasma frequency of this laboratory stock (5.15 chiasmata) was not statistically different from the chiasma frequency of progeny from wild-caught N. suturalis females (5.35 chiasmata). Survival of the JD stock was significantly reduced compared to the survival of Wild derived progeny. The developmental rate of the JD stock was significantly slower than the Wild derived progeny during the early part of the life cycle.    Among the hypotheses tested were that location and temperature caused the higher number of chromosome abnormalities in the JD stock of N. suturalis. However, the number of chromosome abnormalities in the JD stock of N. suturalis was not significantly altered in four locations for two generations. Also, two temperature environments did not significantly change the number of chromosome abnormalities in the JD stock or in Wild derived progeny. Since these environmental factors did not affect the occurrence of meiotic abnormalities in the JD stock of N. suturalis, the alternate hypothesis of a genetic mechanism prevailed.    The most promising hypothesis to explain these meiotic abnormalities was a meiotic/mitotic mutation. The consequences of a mutation affecting DNA topoisomerase II, or the regulation of DNA topoisomerase II, corresponded well to the cytological characteristics of the meiotic abnormalities in the JD stock of N. suturalis. Assuming such a mutation, a model was developed to estimate the mutant allele frequency in the JD stock. The estimated mutant allele frequency range was 0.38 to 0.62. With this mutant allele frequency range and survival data of the JD stock and Wild derived progeny, an Average Fitness range of the JD stock of N. suturalis was calculated at 0.44 to 0.63.

T1  - A study on the ecology of katle, Neolissochilus hexagonolepis (McClelland), in a Nepalese reservoir and river
AN  - 304104766
AB  - A study on feeding, age, growth and reproductive biology of katle, Neolissochilus hexagonolepis, was conducted in the newly created Indrasarobar Reservoir and in the Tadi River in Nepal during January, 1988, to December, 1990. The objective was to assess katle's adaptability from a riverine to a lacustrine environment.    Monthly samples of katle were collected. Volumetric gut content analysis revealed katle's euryphagous nature. Animal matter, plant matter and detritus and soil constituted 21.8, 68.8 and 9.4% respectively of the gut contents of fish from the river, and 29.0, 56.0 and 15.0% in the reservoir. One annual peak of feeding intensity was observed in both systems, as well as seasonal variation in diet composition. The contribution of plant food increased with the size of the fish. The gut length of katle was allometrically related to its total length in both habitats, more strongly in the reservoir population. This appears to be a major adaptation to the reservoir in the feeding ecology of katle.    Age determinations showed that one annulus was formed in the bony parts of katle annually. Oxytetracycline marking confirmed the validity of ages derived from pectoral fin rays. Females attained a larger size than males. The annual length increment was high for the first four years of life and declined after maturity. Growth data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth model. The estimated maximum lengths L$\sb{\infty}$ for females (73 cm for the reservoir and 45 cm for the river) were higher than those for males (41 and 26 cm). The K values were higher in males (0.195 yr$\sp{-1}$ for the river and 0.135 yr$\sp{-1}$ for the reservoir) than in females (0.089 and 0.120 yr$\sp{-1}$). A positive correlation was observed between the average area of the reservoir during the warm months (April to October) and annual length increments in reservoir katle of specified age.    Radio telemetry studies of female katle revealed their upstream pre-spawning migration. Quantitative studies on the gonadal maturation cycle revealed that katle are partial spawners of low fecundity.    This study has shown that katle is a euryphagous, slow growing, long living and multiply spawning hill stream cyprinid that has adapted well to the lacustrine environment of the Indrasarobar Reservoir.

T1  - Genetics of sex ratio and other life history traits in the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch)
AN  - 304101332
AB  - The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is a very costly pest of more than 150 agriculturally important plant species. It is characterized by a high intrinsic rate of increase and rapid evolution of resistance to pesticides. Sex ratio is an important life history trait which affects population dynamics, intrinsic rate of increase, dispersal, colonization ability and speed by which this important pest species responds to environmental changes.    This study has shown progeny sex ratio to be entirely under maternal control; sires did not affect their progeny sex ratio. A slight sire effect on early fecundity was observed, but mixed results were obtained, with only one of two replicates attaining statistical significance. Sex ratio regulation was shown to be moderately heritable, with heritabilities ranging between 0.48-0.61. Thus sex ratio had sufficient additive genetic variance to respond to either natural or artificial selection.    Sex ratio regulation was also shown to effect both means and variances, responding to changes in the environment. When temperatures were elevated, mean progeny sex ratio decreased, resulting in a larger proportion of males within the progeny set; sex ratio variance increased. It was believed that females at high temperature increased the number of haploid recombinant genotypes exposed to selection, in the form of hemizygous males, thus increasing the rate of response to selection in suboptimal conditions. Evidence presented herein suggested that environmental sensitivity, or phenotypic plasticity, of sex ratio was also heritable. The heritability of progeny sex ratio was found to increase in response to elevated temperatures, thus exposing more additive genetic variance to selective forces.

T1  - Studies in biological control of the pepper-tree psyllid, Calophya rubra (Blanchard), in the San Francisco Bay Area
AN  - 304076981
AB  - Studies were carried out on the three-species system resulting from the introduction of the exotic ornamental tree Schinus molle L., the accidental arrival of the pestiferous psyllid Calophya rubra (Blanchard) and the importation of the parasitoid Tamarixia sp. nov. as a biological control agent. The goal of these studies was to describe the impacts both of the psyllid on the tree and of the parasitoid on the psyllid.    Neither a survey of owners of mature urban pepper-trees nor an exclosure experiment with younger trees demonstrated any continuous negative impact of the psyllid on the tree. Rather, both methods revealed the same seasonal pattern consisting of a period of noticeable winter damage followed by a period in which damage was not detectable.    Intensive censusing of plant parts, psyllids and parasitoids suggested that the insect populations reflected the yearly cycle of the tree, but with pronounced time-lags. Neither the psyllid nor the parasitoid showed a strong density-dependent response to changes in the availability of its food source. Pest density peaked in November and reached a low point in May, while percent parasitism peaked in March, August and December and reached a low in June.    Laboratory measurements showed that the lower temperature threshold for the tree (11 C) was below that of the insects (13 C). At 23 C, generation time for the parasitoid was shorter (26 d) than that of the psyllid (49 d), but the psyllid appeared to have higher fecundity. Innate capacity for increase therefore was similar in the two species.    The results of these studies suggest that, in the San Francisco Bay Area, seasonal environmental fluctuation keeps the parasitoid from having a great impact on the psyllid, but at the same time, it keeps the psyllid from having a great impact on the tree. This occurs because neither insect's population is able to keep pace with the maximum growth of its food source.

T1  - Thermal Evolution In Drosophila Melanogaster
AN  - 301568958
AB  - The experiments reported in this thesis examined the effects of laboratory thermal selection on a range of characters in two sets of three replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster, maintained at 16.5°C and 25°C for over four years.The duration of developmental stages in males and females from both selection regimes was greater when reared at 16.5oC than when reared at 25oC.  An evolutionary response of development times to temperature was also evident.  Times to pupariation of 25oC selected larvae were longer than those of 16.5oC selected larvae, when reared at 16.5oC or 25oC.  Times to adult eclosion were longer for 25oC selected lines compared to 16.5oC selected lines, when both were reared at 16.5oC, but the situation was reversed at 25oC.  Pre-adult survival was higher in selected lines when they were reared at their own selection temperature.  This is clear evidence of rapid thermal evolution and adaptation in the selected lines.Larval growth patterns were also examined.  Larvae from both selection regimes reached a higher weight, and took almost twice as long to develop, when reared at 16.5oC rather than 25oC.  At both growth temperatures, 16.5oC selected larvae had higher mean weights at almost all sampling intervals in comparison to 25oC selected larvae.  Starvation experiments showed that larvae from the thermally selected lines had higher critical weights for pupariation when reared at the temperature at which they had been selected compared to larvae from the other selection regime reared at the same temperature.  Results suggested that 16.5oC selected lines may be allocating more nutrients to growth as opposed to somatic maintenance.

T1  - Form, function and energetics of the early life history of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)
AN  - 250805933
AB  - The physiological energetics of the early life history of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua were investigated in laboratory studies for two genetically discrete populations (Newfoundland and Scotian Shelf), by integrating information from the fields of ecology, physiology and functional morphology. Laboratory studies were designed to simulate temperatures that eggs and larvae of different stocks experience in the ocean. Functional morphological landmarks important to feeding and respiration were derived from specimens treated by clearing and staining, histology, and scanning electron microscopy. These landmarks defined 12 developmental stages at two temperatures, 5$\sp\circ$C and 10$\sp\circ$C, from hatching to metamorphosis, in larval cod. Results showed that staging is a more accurate way of determining developmental state than days post-hatch or degree days. Staging of specific structures such as the jaw and alimentary canal illustrated that variation in structural complexity may be influenced by intrinsic (genetic) factors and/or extrinsic (environmental) factors. Detailed anatomical and functional analysis revealed that while the yolk-sac serves as a food resource, primary skeletal structures and mechanisms for feeding are simple and non-integrated and respiration is cutaneous. As ontogeny progresses, requirements for exogenous food are met by the development of new skeletal elements, ligaments and muscles. Together these changes allow increases in jaw coordination and suction pressure generation necessary for prey capture and eventually for branchial respiration.    Landmarks and developmental stages were also used to mark major life history transitions in energy acquisition. At these transitions, changes occur in the allocation of finite energy resources between growth and activity metabolism. In addition, the energy allocated to growth and activity metabolism differed between populations. Larvae from the Newfoundland population were more cost-effective in conditions that reflected their native environment; these larvae appeared to be physiologically 'cold-adapted'. In contrast, larvae from the Scotian Shelf population appeared to be 'warm-adapted' but spent more energy on activity metabolism and less on growth at all temperatures. This suggests that the physiological energetics underlying the dynamics of production and survivorship are different between cod populations in Canada.

T1  - Studies to Optimise the Culture Conditions for <em>Penaeis indicus</em> from the Saudi Arabian Coast of the Red Sea
AN  - 2490131562
AB  - On the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia ponds utilising seawater drawn from wells have an average salinity of 43%o and temperatures ranging from 23-33°C.The present study has demonstrated that yields of up to 4.3 tonnes ha-1 of the Indian white shrimp Penaeus indicus at 20 g size may be obtained in these ponds. P. indicus was isolated from local stocks (Gizan) and has now been cultured through several generations at the Fish Farming Centre.Present work has determined that the optimal salinity for larval culture is 30960 and for nursery culture 25-30960. The best stage for transfer from nursery to growout pond (43960) is about PL25. Comparison with biological data for P. indicus cultured elsewhere indicates that Red Sea populations may be preadapted to tolerate high salinities.The potential for artificial feeds to replace live feeds in P. indicus larval culture from Z1 to PL1 and PL5 using microencapsulated feeds, Nippai and Frippak has been investigated. Results reveal that 50% replacement with Nippai and Frippak is possible giving comparable growth to the control, but poorer survival.Also comparative growth trials were conducted with post larval P. indicus (PL5-PL30) spawned from Red Sea stock and cultured through larval stages on five feeds (Chaetoceros, Tetraselmis and Artemia). Post larvae were reared on commercial feeds: Taiwanese, Nippai, Frippak and 4 formulated feeds based on locally available ingredients at 28-30°C and at 3016 and 42% salinities. Feeding trials at 42% produced poor survival, but at 30% all treatments gave over 50% survival to PL25, at which stage shrimp are ready for stocking in growout ponds. Although the Taiwanese feed produced the overall fastest growth, it was not significantly better (P>0.05) than two locally formulated diets (FFC1,4) or Frippak. Survival rates of over 60% where achieved on all diets with the exception of Nippai and Taiwanese feeds. Yields were significantly higher (P<0.05) on one of the locally prepared diets (FFC1) than Taiwanese and Nippai, and Taiwanese than Nippai. All diets yielded significantly more shrimp biomass at 30% than 42% (P>0.05). The relative costs of imported and locally produced diets are discussed and it is concluded that it is possible to produce cost-effective nursery diets in Saudi Arabia.A growout feeding study for P. indicus juvenile utilising 4 locally formulated diets compared with a Taiwanese diet revealed no significant difference (P. >0.05) in survival nor in growth or yield amongst all diets. However growth was slow due to low pH and high ammonia levels.Finally shrimp density production trials at 20, 40, 60 and 80m-2 during winter and summer were conducted in cages placed in a rubber lined pond. For all densities; yields were significantly higher in summer than winter with an overall average of 3.41±1.5 tonnes and 4.04±2.36 tonnes 180 days-1 for winter and summer respectively. Yield at 80m-2 was highest but was not different from yield at 60m-2. Based on average harvested size and market price the density of 60. =was regarded suitable for growout culture.

AB  - On the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia ponds utilising seawater drawn from wells have an average salinity of 43 parts per mil. and temperatures ranging from 23-33 degrees C. The present study has demonstrated that yields of up to 4.3 tonnes ha-1 of the Indian white shrimp Penaeus indicus at 20 g size may be obtained in these ponds. P. indicus was isolated from local stocks (Gizan) and has now been cultured through several generations at the Fish Farming Centre. Present work has determined that the optimal salinity for larval culture is 30 parts per mil. and for nursery culture 25-30 parts per mil. The best stage for transfer from nursery to growout pond (43 parts per mil.) is about PL25.

T1  - Specialists and generalists in changing environments: The evolution of thermal sensitivity
AN  - 304091364
AB  - Temporal variation in the physical environment limits the ability of animals to perform fitness-enhancing activities, such as growth, mating, and oviposition. The organism's sensitivity to these environmental changes can be described by a performance curve, a plot of performance against an environmental variable. I address two questions in the evolution of performance curves. First, what is the optimal performance curve for a given pattern of environmental variation? Second, how does the genetic variation for the performance curve evolve? I use the thermal sensitivity of insect locomotion as a model system to develop theory to address these questions, and to empirically examine the key assumptions of the models.    I developed optimality and quantitative genetic models of the evolution of the performance curve. The models measure fitness as fecundity or mating success, and examine what phenotypes are favored under different combinations of cyclic within-(WG) and among-generation (AG) environmental variation. WG variation tends to reduce the fitness differences among phenotypes, and AG variation alone favors broader performance curves. In combination, WG and AG variation interact to allow the evolution of specialists, with narrow performance curves, even in the most variable environments.    Increasing the amplitude of fluctuations in the environment helps maintain genetic variation in the performance curve. The rate of performance curve evolution, however, is much slower than anticipated. Non-linear performance curves and reaction norms impose functional constraints that limit the efficacy of selection in moving a population towards its fitness optimum, thereby slowing the rate of evolution.    The key assumption in these models is a trade-off between maximum performance rate and the breadth of performance. This "jack-of-all-trades is master of none" constraint has rarely been tested. I quantified the trade-off at both the genetic and phenotypic levels in the parasitic wasp, Aphidius ervi, and at the phenotypic level in Drosophila melanogaster. Strong evidence for the "jack-of-all-trades" was found at the phenotypic level in both species, and genetic trade-offs were found in male A. ervi. Parental and developmental temperature effects on the adult locomotory performance curves in Drosophila were also examined; developmental temperatures have the greatest effect on adult performance.

T1  - Life history and evolutionary adaptation of Pacific salmon and its application in management
AN  - 304087245
AB  - An approach to understanding and managing anadromous salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus spp.) based on life history and evolutionary adaptive capacities of species and stocks is presented. Species, stocks, and local populations are viewed as systems that are continuously adapting to changing environmental conditions. They have the potential capacity to evolve in different ways in different environments through both life history and evolutionary adaptation. Habitat organization forms a template for genus, species, stock, and local population life history organization. Harvesting, habitat alteration resulting from land use practices and other human activities can alter the organization and adaptive capacities of species and stocks, and thus their long term persistence.    The adaptive capacity of Oncorhynchus relative to its habitat and management environment is examined at the species, stock, and local population levels. Life history characteristics of representative stocks and local populations are analyzed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DECORANA). Fresh water migration distance and latitude are used to "explain" ordination patterns of Oncorhynchus species in the North Pacific Basin. Fresh water migration difficulty and mean annual runoff are used to interpret life history patterns of Columbia Basin chinook salmon stocks. Upstream migration difficulty and fall water temperatures are used to explain the ordination patterns of local populations of Willamette spring chinook salmon. Fishery management practices are examined in terms of their impacts on the organization and adaptive capacity of species, stocks, and local populations of Oncorhynchus.    Management generalizations and guidelines derived from the life history theory are applied to management of Willamette spring chinook salmon. Maintaining habitat changes in the Willamette Basin within the historic range of fluctuations will tend to maximize co-organization of local populations. Management activities should provide relatively constant habitat and fishery conditions for natural selection processes to "organize" life history traits over a period of at least a few generations. Fisheries should selectively harvest local populations that show a high degree of realization of their adaptive capacity. By focusing instead on maximizing the co-organization of stocks, their habitat and fishery environments, and protecting the adaptive capacities of stocks, we will go a long way toward providing long-term sustainability for social communities dependent on fisheries.

T1  - Empirical and theoretical investigations of Colorado potato beetle adaptation to insecticides
AN  - 304085782
AB  - Computer simulation and field studies were conducted to better understand the process of insecticide selection and insecticide resistance evolution in Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). A simulation model (REPO--Resistance Evolution in Pest Organisms), which is specifically relevant to Colorado potato beetle on potato, was developed to predict the rate of resistance development given various genetic, biological and management conditions. REPO is different from other resistance management models in that it is temperature-driven, considers age-specific selection, describes the pattern of immigration of adults colonists, and uses survivorship functions to describe dynamic relationships among genotypes during insecticide selection. Foremost among ecological and management factors influencing the rate of adaptation in REPO were the arrival period of colonizing beetles, timing of insecticide applications, action thresholds, and age-specific selection.    Fitness studies were conducted in the field using permethrin-resistant, susceptible and hybrid strains of Colorado potato beetle. Survivorship results indicated that there is significant selection against susceptible genotypes during all larval stages and the adult stage.    In another set of experiments, viability of 1-d-old larvae and fecundity and viability of adults were estimated when beetles were placed on foliage at various intervals (2, 5, 8, and 13 d) after permethrin application. Selection against susceptible 1-d-old larvae was strongest when placement was 2 d after application and selection diminished on subsequent placement dates but remained significant for the duration of the experiment. When selection was intense (on early placement dates) most survivors of the hybrid strain were males, which is consistent with the reported sex-linkage of this trait in Colorado potato beetle. Differences were not detected in survivorship and fecundity of adults of the three strains placed on plants at various intervals after insecticide application.    Using information on the population genetics of permethrin from the field studies discussed above, another simulation model, REPO-PERM, was developed specifically to study resistance development to permethrin in Colorado potato beetle. Model explorations indicated that sex-linked traits respond to directional selection faster than autosomal traits, and that position of individuals in the plant canopy can influence selection intensity and the rate of adaptation. Model predictions for rates of adaptation to permethrin under conditions typical of Virginia and North Carolina are consistent with documented development of resistance in these areas.

T1  - Use of a self-fertilizing hermaphroditic fish, Rivulus marmoratus, as an animal model for life history and ecotoxicological studies
AN  - 304067160
AB  - The mangrove-dwelling fish, Rivulus marmoratus, is the only vertebrate known to be a naturally synchronous, internally self-fertilizing hermaphrodite. Despite its unique reproductive mode which makes it produce nearly homozygous offspring with very little genetic variation, R. marmoratus have been reported to have a high strain composition in the field. In the first part of my study, I conducted experiments to: (1) demonstrate the degree to which phenotypic plasticity responds to environmental variation, and (2) explain the existence of numerous strains in the field. I studied both growth and reproduction among five strains of R. marmoratus for two consecutive generations. I varied temperature, salinity and food ration to simulate natural abiotic and biotic conditions in the first generation study and focused on the effects of parental food level in the second generation study. All three environmental factors and several interactions among them had significant effects on overall growth and reproduction. There was a significant parental effect on growth and reproduction of their offspring (the second generation).    I estimated the net reproductive rate, R and found that each strain had different fitness values in different environments and no strain had the highest fitness estimate across all the environments. These results illustrate the considerable degree to which abiotic and biotic factors may interact to determine the phenotypic expression of traits and, ultimately, to affect the fitness of the strain. This feature and genetic variation among strains may explain how this species can survive and even prosper in an extremely variable and stressful environment.    To evaluate Rivulus marmoratus as a possible animal model for ecotoxicological studies, in the second part of my study, I conducted: (1) 96h LC$\sb{50}$ tests of Cd toxicity, (2) interstrain variation test, and (3) 96h LC$\sb{50}$ tests of each of the three heavy metals, Cd, Cu and Zn, for both Rivulus marmoratus and Fundulus heteroclitus, a standard bioassay fish. I concluded that R. marmoratus, with its easy husbandry in the laboratory, the high repeatability in acute metal tests, especially within each strain, and similarity in toxicological response by two species have made it a very promising species for bioassay studies.

T1  - Behavioral thermoregulation of the water snake Nerodia rhombifera
AN  - 304062914
AB  - Temperature directly affects physiological performance and indirectly influences individual fitness. Ectotherms predominantly use behavior to regulate their body temperature (T$\sb{\rm b}$). Behavioral thermoregulation can thus maximize individual fitness by enhancing reproductive success, food gathering and processing, and predator avoidance. Different physiological processes may have different thermal optima. Consequently, preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$ may shift as a result of pregnancy, feeding, diel or seasonal cycles, sex, body size, molting, etc.    Temperature selection of diamondback water snakes (Nerodia rhombifera) was measured in thigmothermal gradients with a 30 gauge copper-constantan thermocouple placed in the cloaca. Gravid snakes were identified with ultra-sound scanning. Snakes were acclimatized to certain photoperiods and temperatures for more than 2 weeks before experimental use.    Pregnancy had significant impacts on thermoregulation. Gravid snakes spent longer times at higher temperatures and had a higher mean T$\sb{\rm b}$ than nongravid or postparturition females. The diel cycle of T$\sb{\rm b}$ in gravid animal was abolished when compared with the diel cycle of nongravid and postparturition snakes. Gravid snakes thermoregulate more precisely than nongravid and postparturition individuals.    Satiated snakes were left in the gradient for six days; I found no significant postprandial thermophily. However, thermoregulatory precision varied among the six days of testing and was most precise during the first day (24-48 hours after feeding).    In summer, shortened photoperiod did not influence the mean T$\sb{\rm b}$ but did reduce the amplitude of the diel cycle. On the contrary, decreased acclimation temperature lowered mean preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$ but the amplitude of the daily rhythm remained unchanged. Paradoxical combinations of photoperiod and temperature (e.g., short day length and low temperature in summer) did not alter overall T$\sb{\rm b}$ but did influence the amplitude of the daily cycle. Season had a significant influence on preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$. More precise thermoregulation was observed during scotophase than during photophase in summer with normal acclimatization (longer daylength, higher temperature). Photoperiod had no effect on thermoregulatory precision but lower temperature reduced precision.    No difference in preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$ or thermoregulatory precision was observed between sexes. Neither male nor female snakes had correlations between body size and preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$. During ecdysis, snakes did not select a significantly different T$\sb{\rm b}$ from non-shedding individuals.

T1  - Remote sensing and ecosystem simulation modeling of the intermountain sagebrush-steppe, with implications for global climate change
AN  - 304044897
AB  - Three papers are presented that focus on remote sensing and ecosystem simulation modeling of the Intermountain Northwest sagebrush-steppe ecosystem. The first utilizes Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data to derive seasonal greenness indices of three predominant vegetation communities in south-central Washington, U.S.A. Temporal signatures were statistically separated, and used to create a supervised classification for the three communities by integrating Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices over the growing season. The integrated classification scheme accuracy was 75% when compared to 53 ground-truthed sites, but was less accurate (62%) when applied to a more topographically variable region.    The second paper develops a logic for treating the intermountain sagebrush-steppe as a mosaic of distinct, hydrologically partitioned vegetation communities, and identifies some critical ecophysiological considerations for process modeling of arid ecosystems. Soil water and nutrient dynamics of an ecosystem process model were modified to simulate productivity and seasonal water use patterns in Artemisia, Agropyron, and Bromus communities for the same south-central Washington study site. 60 year simulations maintained steady state vegetation productivity while predicting soil moisture content for 56 dates in 1992 with R$\sp2$ values ranging from 0.93 to 0.98.    In the third paper, the model was used to derive projections of the response of the ecosystem to natural and general circulation model (GCM)-predicted climate variability. Simulations predicted the adaptability of a less productive, invasive grass community (Bromus) to climate change, while a native sagebrush (Artemisia) community does not survive the increased temperatures of the GCM climates. High humidity deficits and greater maintenance respiration costs associated with increased temperatures limit the ability of the sagebrush community to support a relatively high biomass, and substantial increases in soil water storage and subsurface outflow occur as the vegetation senesces.

T1  - Development of genetic transformation methods for the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari: Phytoseiidae)
AN  - 304043051
AB  - The goal of this thesis was to develop a method for introducing heterologous DNA sequences into the genome of the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Phytoseiidae). Phytoseiid mites are important biological control agents in numerous crops. Development of a generic DNA delivery system, independent of species-specific vectors, may be widely useful among the members of this important family.    The first chapter provides an introduction to biological control, the Phytoseiidae and an overview of the current status of genetic transformation of arthropods. The chapter provides an understanding of the place phytoseiids have occupied in agriculture as well as an overview of previous research on these predators. The overview of genetic transformation of arthropods provides a context for the thesis.    Chapter two describes a method for transient transformation of larval phytoseiid mites. I also provide evidence that the Drosophila heat shock70 promoter (hsp70) functions in two species of phytoseiids, M. occidentalis and Amblyseius finlandicus. Additionally, the Escherichia coli $\beta$-galactosidase gene (lacZ) is useful for expression assays in these two species.    In Chapter three, the DNA delivery system, maternal microinjection, was developed. The plasmid pJKP2, containing the Drosophila hsp70/E. coli lacZ fusion, was injected into gravid M. occidentalis females. Plasmid sequences in the progeny of injected females were revealed by $\beta$-galactosidase activity. Hemi-nested PCR revealed plasmid sequences in the sixth generation after microinjections. Although Southern blot analysis is required to confirm the chromosomal location of the plasmid sequences, the evidence strongly suggests the mites were stably transformed. Maternal microinjection may provide a generic DNA delivery system for phytoseiids and may also be useful in other arthropods.    Chapter 4 examines the persistence of microinjected DNA in M. occidentalis females. I also investigated, in both M. occidentalis and A. finlandicus, its transmission to eggs deposited after microinjection. The presence of plasmid sequences was determined by hemi-nested PCR. Microinjected DNA persists in M. occidentalis females for more than 24 hours. In the A. finlandicus study, the plasmid sequences are found in 1-25 eggs deposited after microinjection. The results suggest maternal microinjection is an efficient method for introducing foreign DNA into predatory mites.

T1  - Phenology of Empoasca fabae (Harris) (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), and development of springtime migrant source populations
AN  - 304039373
AB  - Oviposition among laboratory-reared Empoasca fabae under various photoperiods and temperatures was recorded for 40 d of adulthood. Short daylengths decreased the proportion of females ovipositing, increased the preoviposition period, and decreased the rate of oviposition. The photoperiodic response is evidence of diapause induction. Late instar E. fabae collections from New York were field-reared for a heat-unit accumulation sufficient for reproductive maturation under non-diapause inducing conditions. The percent females becoming reproductively mature declined to $<$50% after mid-July.<p>    Overwintering females collected 15 Jan. 1991 had no mature oocytes. In the laboratory, short daylengths and low temperatures helped maintain this state. Most females (65%) collected in late February had mature oocytes. It is inferred that diapause was broken in field populations between mid-January and late February. Winter field surveys revealed diapausing adults on a variety of primarily exotic herbaceous legumes in areas near the Gulf Coast, and on native evergreens, especially pines, almost throughout the southern pine region. E. fabae caged on branches of Rb-enhanced loblolly pine contained high Rb levels, suggesting that pines may be used for food. Surveys of pines and legumes in 1992 indicated diapause was broken in mid-February, when E. fabae moved to leguminous hosts for oviposition. Spring generations were also produced on many deciduous trees. These results indicate that E. fabae is well-adapted to native conditions in temperate North America, and suggest that its phenology includes a return migration to overwintering areas.    Populations presumed to be Empoasca fabae were collected from various host plants and locations, then electrophoretically assayed for 12 enzyme loci. No genetic differentiation between populations was evident. Diagnostic alleles were found to distinguish E. fabae from E. erigeron, E. cf. perlonga and E. kraemeri.    In laboratory and field studies, E. fabae development time between different springtime leguminous host species varied only slightly. Predictions of five published temperature dependant models of development were generally within 10% of the true mean. In the field, model accuracy varied only slightly with different sources of temperature data. Any of three models are recommended for use with temperature data from standard weather stations for predicting mean development time of migrant source populations.

T1  - Lizard reproductive ecology: Sex determination and parental investment
AN  - 304036438
AB  - Two modes of sex determination occur in lizards: genotypic sex determination (GSD) and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Within each of these two major modes, there are many different variants, or mechanisms. Male heterogamety, female heterogamety, multiple sex chromosome systems, and homomorphic sex chromosome systems are all types of GSD found in lizards. Two patterns of TSD have been reported.    Less than 50 lizard species have been investigated, but there is considerable diversity in the sex-determining mechanisms reported thus far. Apparently, TSD (and/or GSD) has evolved multiple times within a given taxon. Presently, both GSD and TSD are found in the Agamidae, Eublepharidae, and Gekkonidae, and possibly in the Iguanidae and Lacertidae as well. Only GSD has been reported for the Scincidae and Teiidae.    Correlations within the Eublepharidae (Coleonyx, Eublepharis, Hemitheconyx) suggest an adaptive explanation for the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms; a shift from male-larger dimorphism to female-larger (or no sexual size-dimorphism) is accompanied by a shift in sex-determining mode. These shifts are in agreement with similar correlations observed in turtles.    Differential growth between animals from different incubation temperatures has been proposed as one mechanism by which TSD might be selectively advantageous over GSD. Growth studies conducted on two members of the Eublepharidae (Coleonyx variegatus and Hemitheconyx caudicinctus) indicate that in these species, TSD may offer differential advantages to the sexes that GSD cannot provide.    Factors leading to evolutionary shifts in sex-determining mode may also lead to parental determination of offspring sex ratio. In Anolis carolinensis, larger mothers produced a higher proportion of males than smaller mothers. Larger mothers also produced larger eggs, and thus larger offspring. Consequently, the average size of male hatchlings was greater than that of female hatchlings. Because bigger males mate more frequently than do smaller males in this polygynous species, larger male hatchlings should have a selective mating advantage, assuming that large hatchling males attain larger size more quickly than small males. We believe this to be the first evidence of parental control of offspring sex ratio in lizards.

T1  - Factors influencing selfing and outcrossing in the hermaphrodite, bulinus truncatus
AN  - 301488551
AB  - Phally, a genital dimorphism found in some species of self-compatible simultaneous hermaphrodites, presents an opportunity to examine factors maintaining outcrossing within an animal species in the presence or recombination.  Both aphallics and euphallics can self-fertilise, but aphallics cannot donate sperm because they do not develop a functional penis and prostate.  This thesis investigates proximate and ultimate factors maintaining euphally within populations of aphallics in the African freshwater snail, Bulinus truncatus (Audouin).  Laboratory and field data suggest that parasite pressure due to trematode infection plays a role in maintaining the potential for outcrossing in B. truncatus.  Chapter 1 provides a phylogenetic analysis of gastropod taxa where loss of male outcrossing ability has been reported.  Such taxa are rare and occur near the tips of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that aphally is an unstable trait with limited evolutionary potential.  Male outcrossing ability has been lost at least 13 times.  Sister-taxa comparisons reveal no significant association between aphally and body size, habitat, distribution or ploidy level.  Chapter 2 reports estimates of the heritability of phally in a laboratory population of B. truncatus from northern Nigeria.  Contrary to previous investigations of B. truncatus, results here provide no evidence of a heritable component and strong evidence of an environmental component to phally determination.  Chapter 3 demonstrates that phally was largely determined by temperature during egg and hatchling stages in two laboratory populations, with warmer temperatures favouring the loss of male outcrossing ability.  Chapter 4 provides evidence that temperature during phally development influenced phally determination in natural populations of B. trunctus in northern Nigeria.  By drawing an analogy with adaptive arguments for the maintenance of environmental sex determination, I suggest that temperature determination of phally will be favoured by selection if temperature predicts whether future conditions will favour outcrossing more accurately than current conditions.  Chapter 5 evaluates field evidence for alternative ecological hypotheses that might explain the maintenance of outcrossing.  A significant correlation between prevalence of trematode infection and proportion of euphallics across populations suggests that parasite pressure may generate selection for euphally, as predicted by hypotheses which stress the role of antagonistic coevolution in the maintenance of outcrossing.(D174516)

T1  - The physiology, biochemistry and toxicity of the marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum hoffmannianum Faust (Pyrrophyta), and its role in seafood-borne human diseases
AN  - 304036660
AB  - The probable ciguatera causing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum hoffmannianum (SIU 364 & 882a) was examined in a series of culture experiments to optimize growth and toxin production. The results from this study suggest that P. hoffmannianum growth in culture can be stimulated by careful selection of culture medium. A comparison of eight culture media revealed that maximal growth (0.20 division$\cdot$day$\sp{-1}$) was achieved in h/2 enriched natural seawater medium with the addition of 0.903 ppm ammonium. Significant variation in growth and concentrations of the major intracellular macromolecules during acclimation indicate that acclimation has a profound effect on overall cell fitness. Based on pre- and post-acclimated reproduction rates, P. hoffmannianum cells appeared to acclimate to new environments after about one generation regardless of temperature or light intensity. In addition, significant variation in growth and potency over seven light (250 to 5000 lux) and three temperature regimes (22, 25 and 29$\sp\circ$C) shows that P. hoffmannianum cells have the ability to adjust to a wide range of environmental conditions. Consequently, growth and/or potency can be increased by complete acclimation of the cells to a given set of environmental conditions. Further examination of the changes in cell physiology and potency in P. hoffmannianum during one complete growth cycle revealed significant variation in total intracellular protein, carbohydrate, lipid, pigment and toxin content. The patterns of toxin synthesis for a fast-acting toxin(s) (FAT) and okadaic acid (OA) were similar to those of other cellular constituents, although toxin production showed the best correlation with lipid biosynthesis (r = 0.90). Maximal toxin content was found in late log to early stationary phase. Toxin synthesis was arrested along with the other primary metabolites in stationary phase. The discovery of two potent toxins in P. hoffmannianum cells (i.e. FAT and OA), an abundant primary producer in ciguatera-endemic regions of the world, suggests that P. hoffmannianum is a major contributor of toxins to the ciguatera syndrome in humans.

T1  - Ecology and comparative demography of the lizard Sceloporus grammicus: Life history of an altitudinal generalists on the eastern slope of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, Puebla, Mexico
AN  - 304011575
AB  - Population studies on the high altitude lizard Sceloporus grammicus were conducted using mark-recapture methods on two study sites located at 3,700 m elevation (low altitude site) and 4,400 m elevation (high altitude site), on the eastern slope of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, Puebla, Mexico, over a four year period to assess differences in thermal biology, growth rates, and demographic characteristics. Regardless of contrasting differences in environmental conditions between study sites, individual lizards maintained similar active body temperatures, growth rates, and population parameters.    Active body temperatures at both study sites were approximately 32$\sp\circ$C. However, individual lizards at the low elevation site showed a greater resistance to high temperatures than individual lizards at the high elevation site. Acclimation to higher environmental temperatures at the low elevation site may explain the greater heat tolerance.    Females in both populations grew slower and attained asymptotic sizes earlier in life than males (0.0025 mm per day and 49.7 mm snout-vent length for females vs 0.0027 mm per day and 53.2 mm snout-vent length for males). Growth rates of neonates were between 0.10 and 0.15 mm per day in both sexes and sites. Differential cost of thermoregulatory behavior, and differences in the number of predators and competitors between study sites are possible explanations for similar growth rates at both sites.    Individual lizards at both study sites attained maturity at about 14-15 months of age. Females body size at this age was about 39-40 mm at both study sites. Females produced a single litter per year and litter size depended on female body size. Females at low elevation produced an average 3.64 $\pm$ 0.10 young per litter and at high altitude 3.31 $\pm$ 0.129 young per litter. Survivorship was slightly greater at the low elevation site, however, average survivorship for all years of data combined was not significantly different between study sites. Two different predation indices, percentage of broken tails and flushing distance, were greater at the low elevation site than at the high elevation site.    Biotic factors reflected in higher syntopic competitors and higher predation indices appear to be responsible for population regulation at the low elevation site. Abiotic selective factors, especially low temperatures and shorter growing seasons, probably regulate population size at the high elevation site.

T1  - Physiological, population, and genetic responses of an aquatic insect (Isonychia bicolor) to chronic mercury pollution
AN  - 304001827
AB  - Responses to sublethal concentrations of mercury were determined and compared for several populations of the mayfly, Isonychia bicolor from sites on two mercury polluted rivers in Virginia (USA). Results from laboratory respiration experiments indicated that small nymphs were more sensitive to mercury than larger nymphs, and that sensitivity increased with temperature. In addition, mayfly nymphs from polluted sites on the less contaminated South River were found to be more resistant to sublethal doses of inorganic mercury than nymphs from a reference site as indicated by smaller changes in respiration following exposure. Results of preexposure treatments suggested a genetic basis for the observed tolerance. No evidence of tolerance was observed in nymphs from the more contaminated Holston River.    Field surveys revealed no significant differences in age structure, growth, or survival between populations at reference and polluted sites on the South River. However, growth and survival of nymphs from the polluted site on the Holston River were significantly slower than at the reference site during the summer. In fact, shortly after the summer generation hatched, nymphal density at contaminated sites declined to zero. This apparent local extinction may have been due to increased toxicity of mercury at warmer temperatures.    Results of reciprocal transplant experiments conducted at sites on the South River suggested that population differences in maintenance costs observed in short-term laboratory experiments, may have been reflected by population differences in fecundity in long-term field experiments. When nymphs from the reference site on South River were transplanted and allowed to develop at a contaminated site, lower fecundities were observed than for the native population. No population differences in fecundities were observed on the Holston River.    The relationship between allozyme genotype to survival of I. bicolor nymphs to acute mercury exposure was also tested. The probability of survival and individual times to death (TTD) were found to be significantly different among genotypes at the Glucose Phosphate Isomerase (GPI) locus. This was true at both summer and winter temperatures and for populations from two separate, unpolluted streams. However, genotypes identified as sensitive and tolerant in these experiments showed no consistent relationship with environmental mercury levels in polluted rivers. Therefore, the use of allozyme variants as a biomarker to assess evolutionary change in populations due to mercury pollution may be impractical in freshwater systems.

T1  - Colorado potato beetle populations in eastern North Carolina: Insecticide resistance detection and seasonal history
AN  - 304001579
AB  - Results from a residual bioassay procedure for monitoring insecticide resistance in populations of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), for the purposes of predicting control failures, were related to insecticide efficacy in North Carolina potato, Solanum tuberosum L., fields in 1989 and 1990. A binomial classification, where each bioassay unit was classified as resistant or susceptible by visual inspection, provided a rapid and accurate method of predicting mean mortality in the bioassay. The proportion of units in a sample classified as resistant was the criterion used to predict the likelihood of a control failure. In 1991, this approach was validated, and additional tests revealed that a higher bioassay concentration would more reliably and easily predict the likelihood of a control failure. The utility of our approach to evaluating resistance monitoring data and a two concentration bioassay strategy are discussed. Further analysis of bioassay data from 1987 to 1990 studies revealed significant correlations between mean bioassay mortalities for different insecticides which were concluded to be cross-resistance between insecticides within the same insecticide class (carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids) and multiple resistance between insecticides from different classes.    Studies of the seasonal history of Colorado potato beetle populations in eastern North Carolina were conducted from 1989 to 1991. Emergence of overwintered adults and population trends were related to heat unit accumulation. Beetle and host plant densities were low throughout the summer after potato harvest. First generation adults fed potato plants oviposited and were more active than tuber fed adults which never oviposited. Adult overwintering survivorship varied by food source: potato plants (66 to 70%), tubers (0 to 14.3%), and no food (0 to 8.3%). Intensive sampling of commercial potato fields in 1990 and 1991 indicated that adult colonization and oviposition patterns varied with crop rotation but that infestations began at field edges and progressed inward. Management of potato beetle populations is discussed in light of these findings.

T1  - Thermal and spatial ecology of a northern population of snapping turtles, Chelydra serpentina
AN  - 303989285
AB  - Temperature selection and space use by free-ranging snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in Algonquin Park was studied over four years using radiotelemetry. The mean temperature experienced by turtles during the annual activity period (May-August) was 22.3$\sp\circ$C, and they utilized only 12.7% of opportunities to maintain body temperatures at or above preferred body temperature (PBT). Recently fed turtles did not bask nor did they select warmer temperatures than nonfed turtles. Fed turtles characteristically retired to shallow water and buried in the substrate for up to 48 hours after eating. While their eggs were forming, female turtles did not select warmer temperatures than nor bask as often as males.    The annual pattern of space use was divided into three components based on seasonal differences in resource requirements: hibernacula, reproduction-related resource area (RRA) and food-related resource area (FRA). Seasonal differences in activity and space use were observed between males and females. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Factors affecting the rotational use of insecticides for the management of resistance in mosquitoes
AN  - 301477627
AB  - The rotation of the use of chemically unrelated insecticides has been advocated to delay the build up of resistance. To examine this concept in the laboratory, Anopheles albimanus and Culex guinquefasciatus were subjected to two kinds of rotational selection which may be referred to as short term pre-planned rotation and "opportunistic" rotation. No difference was observed between these two methods in term of the time for each resistance level to reach 5Q%. The effectiveness of selection for resistance depends on the protection conferred by resistance genes and this was tested by laboratory releases of the DDT resistant and susceptible homozygotes and heterozygotes of An. gambiae into DDT sprayed and unsprayed miniature huts. All the genotypes were killed with freshly applied DDT but survivors were observed from month 2, 3 and 5 onwards for RR, RS and SS genotypes, respectively. Persistence of DDT on the sprayed wall and roof of the mud hut was studied by bioassays and biochemical assays on scrapings from the wall and roof. Linkage between resistance genes could effect the rotational use of insecticides. No linkage was found between propoxur and dieldrin resistance genes by combining bioassay and biochemical methods. As a preparation for a field studies in Malaysian field collected Aedes aegypti and Culex guinguefasciatus larvae were selected with temephos and Bti. Cx guinguefasciatus responded to temephos selection but Ae. aegypti did not respond to temephos and neither species responded to Bti selection. ~ Caged adults were exposed to thermal fogging in the field. The partially resistant Cx guinguefasciatus strain hardly survived any better than susceptible strains. Resistant and susceptible larvae were exposed to water samples from containers which had been treated with temephos sand granules. 100% mortality was obtained for all the strains up to week 6. Resistant Culex started to survive at week 7 but susceptibles did not do so until week ten. The prospects for the various proposed strategies for resistance management are discussed.

T1  - The rickettsia-like organisms of Glossina spp.
AN  - 899759334
AB  - The rickettsia-like organisms  (RLO) of tsetse flies (Diptera:  Glossinidae) have been isolated and cultured  in vitro  from haemocytes of seven species and sub-species of tsetse.  The symbionts have been identified by morphological, biochemical and pathological studies as members of the genus  Wolbachiae , of the order  Rickettsiales .  The organisms are shown to be immunologically distinct from the midgut mycetome bacteroids, (symbiotes) of tsetse.  Differences in protein composition have been detected between RLO from different subspecies and species of tsetse.  These differences are not detectable by DNA restriction enzyme analysis and three specific DNA probes have been produced to identify unambigously RLO in tsetse tissues.  RLO which are inherited through the egg cytoplasm have been associated with susceptibility to midgut infection with trypanosomes which is also cytoplasmically inherited in tsetse.  Studies of RLO frequency indicate large differences occur between species which are reflected in the vectorial capacity of teneral flies.  Increased susceptibility to trypanosome infection in a selected line of  G. m. morsitans  is shown to be a teneral phenomenon.  RLO are shown to produce chitinase which digests chitin, the products of which are N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D+  glucosamine.  Both of these carbohydrates are shown to increase the susceptibility of teneral and previously fed tsetse by inhibiting the trypanocidal midgut lectin produced in flies in response to a blood-meal.  Antibiotic and temperature treatments were used to reduce the numbers of RLO in flies.  Decrease in RLO numbers was accompanied by a loss of susceptibility to trypanosome infection in teneral flies suggesting a causal relationship.  The relative advantages and disadvantages of RLO infection of tsetse are discussed and a mechanism is suggested for the role of RLO in tsetse susceptibility to trypanosome infection.

T1  - Interaction of dwarfing genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and their adaptation to high temperature.
AN  - 899758735
AB  - Four Pakistan semi-dwarf sping varieties Blue Silver, Faisalabad, Barani and Kohinoor were crossed with four selection lines from the cross Falchetto X Mexicani (32-6-5-8, 36-17-17, 147-12 and 149-1-5).  GA3 insensitivity tests demonstrated that the spring varieties Blue Silver and Faisalabad carry Rht2Rht2, Kohinoor Rht1Rht1 semi-dwarf genes from Norin-10 and Barani Rht1SRht1S from Saitama-27.  The semi-winter lines 32-6-5-8 and 36-17-17 carry Rht1Rht1, 147-12 was heterozygous for Rht1rht1 and 149-1-5 is a double dwarf line with Rht1Rht1 and Rht8Rht8.  All the semi-winter lines were homozygous for the D2D2 grass dwarf gene except 147-12 which was heterozygous.  All the spring varieties used in this investigation did not carry grass dwarf genes except Barani which carries a potent D1 gene.  Vernalization and photoperiod studies demonstrated that all the Pakistan varieties are spring genotypes and some are insensitive to day length.    In the F3 yield trial conducted in a high temperature greenhouse environment (> 26oC) the spring parent varieties were not significantly different and had the lowest yield, the semi-winter F3 hybrid lines were ranked as intermediate and the semi-winter parent lines gave the highest yield per plant due to an increased number of spikes.  Tip sterility was observed in the semi-winter line 147-12 and was severe in same progeny in all the Faisalabad crosses except 32 X Faisalabad.  The tip sterility was due to an interaction between certain genotypes and temperatures above 26oC.    Greenhouse studies of the F4 hybrid lines and their parents have shown that temperatures maintained above 24oC compared to lower temperatures (16-26oC) reduced the yield and its components of all the genotypes but the semi-winter double dwarfs (Rht1Rht2) were particularly susceptible.  The semi-dwarf gene Rht1 probably had an additive interaction with grass dwarf genes (D1D2) reducing the vigour and height of grass dwarf plants.  The F3 grass dwarf lines selected from crosses between Barani and four semi-winter lines were not significantly different for yield and yield components when grown at 26oC probably due to the very low yield potential of the environment.    Genotype X environment interaction studies of four spring varieties and semi-winter parent lines were conducted in high temperature environments at Close House 1988 and 1989, Rajshahi (Bangladesh) 1989 and 1990, and Faisalabad (Pakistan) 1989.

T1  - Physiological characterization of lactic acid bacteria. Malolactic fermentation in Lactobacillus plantarum CECT 220
AN  - 303961935
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in winemaking because they are responsible for malo-lactic fermentation (MLF). MLF is the decarboxylation of L-malic acid to L-lactic acid and CO$\sb2$; this process produces an increase of environmental pH.    After alcoholic fermentation LAB can proliferate to carry out MLF. pH, temperature, CO$\sb2$, ethanol and SO$\sb2$ are the main parameters that affect the growth of LAB in wine. The influence of the four first parameters on the growth of six selected LAB strains isolated from musts and wines have been studied. Both strains belonging to Lactobacillus plantarum species were the most resistant to adverse conditions of pH, temperature and ethanol. Growth of L. plantarum CECT 220 was inhibited by increasing percentages of CO$\sb2$ in the incubation atmosphere. Both strains belonging to L. plantarum species and the wild strain belonging to Leuconostoc oenos species were the most resistant strains to high percentages of ethanol (up to 14% v/v). The growth of the heterofermentative species, Lactobacillus brevis and L. oenos was enhanced by increasing the percentage of CO$\sb2$ in the incubation atmosphere.    MLF produces neither energy nor redox potential itself. Thus, the role of this process in LAB metabolism is still poorly understood. Since MLF increases external pH, it seems to be involved in protecting cells from deleterious effects of acidic environments. MLF is also involved in the maintenance of a higher pH gradient that provides an energetic advantage to the cell, enhancing cell viability at acidic pH values when L-malic acid is degraded. Energy production from L-malate degradation by L. plantarum CECT 220 seems to be related to the ability to degrade lactate by this microorganism.    L. plantarum CECT 220 is able to generate a pH gradient at pH 3.0 both in presence of L-malate or glucose and this gradient is not dissipated by DCCD. This could suggest that at very acidic pH values, pH gradient could be established by a secondary unknown mechanism.

T1  - Sexual maturation and smoltification in Baltic salmon (Salmo salar): Alternative life histories in male parr
AN  - 303944905
AB  - The thesis deals with the interactions between growth, early sexual maturation, and smoltification in salmon (Salmo salar) male parr.    Methods. Individual tagging techniques (PIT-tags, Carlin-tags), implantation of androgens, radioimmunoassay, castration, manipulation of food ration and temperature, seawater challenge test, registration of migratory behaviour, and river releases of individually tagged fish.    Main results. The probability for maturation among 1+ male parr was positively related to the size at the end of the first summer. Maturing males grew slower than immatures after the onset of gonadal growth. The androgens testosterone (T) and 11-ketoandrostenedione (OA) had a seasonal effect on growth. From late June onwards, androgens depressed growth in immature fish. In contrast, the effect was positive in spring and early summer. The aromatizable androgen T, but not OA, stimulated gonadal growth in 1+ male parr.    During the smoltification period previously mature males split into two groups, one which developed seawater adaptability (SWA) comparable to immature fish whereas the other did not. The latter group had higher gonadosomatic index than the former. Androgens inhibited both seawater adaptability and downstream migratory behaviour in immature fish. Spring-time castration of mature males did not improve seawater adaptability. Thermal treatment of previously mature male parr during winter-spring increased SWA and migratory capacity and decreased their propensity for sexual rematuration after transfer to net pens. Previously mature males released in the river had lower adult recapture rate than immature fish. The adult recapture rates were highest for fish released two weeks before the time of optimum SWA. I suggest that previously mature males have to chose between sexual rematuration and smoltification in spring, and that the decision is affected by body size and the conditions for growth over winter prior to smoltification.    In hatcheries the incidence of sexual maturation a among male parr may be minimized by restricted feeding during spring and early summer. Furthermore, the proportion of smolting previously mature males may be enhanced by rearing them over winter in elevated water temperature.

T1  - Genetic studies on the Escherichia coli NusA transcription elongation factor
AN  - 303941109
AB  - The E. coli nusA gene product, NusA, which is known to influence transcription elongation, is essential for both bacterial viability and growth of lambdoid phages. NusA is relatively large protein which binds to RNA and RNA polymerase. The experiments described in this thesis were undertaken to investigate further the role of NusA in cellular function and in the growth of bacteriophage lambda.    The E. coli conditionally lethal nusA10 cold-sensitive allele was cloned and sequenced. Changes from nusA$\sp+$ were observed at nucleotides 311 and 634. Functional studies showed that both nucleotide changes are necessary for the cold-sensitive phenotype, although bacteria with the change at nucleotide 634 grow more slowly at 30$\sp\circ$C than do the nusA$\sp+$ controls. The change at nucleotide 634 has a slight effect on the growth of some lambda derivatives. Revisions were made to the published DNA sequences of both the E. coli and the S. typhimurium nusA genes.    A region of the E. coli NusA protein that can support bacteriophage lambda's N mediated antitermination reaction was defined by the construction of a hybrid S. typhimurium-E. coli nusA gene.    The NusA protein is implicated as playing a role in plasmid stability by the observation of pUC18's instability in a nusA10 mutant. A chromosomal suppressor of this instability phenotype was selected and the responsible mutation was mapped to the 3 minute region of the E. coli chromosome. The suppressor mutation is recessive to wild-type.    A gene was selected from a Bacillus subtilis DNA library that suppresses the E. coli nusA10 cold-sensitive mutant's lethality at 30$\sp\circ$C. The isolated suppressor gene is not the B. subtilis nusA gene. The deduced protein encoded by the B. subtilis gene does, however, show a large percentage amino acid sequence identity (56%) to the deduced protein sequence from a previously identified open reading frame in E. coli, orfE. The E. coli orfE gene does not suppress the lethal effects of the E. coli nusA10 mutation at 30$\sp\circ$C. Neither the B. subtilis orfE gene nor the E. coli orfE gene provides an essential function for vegatative growth, or in the case of B. subtilis, a function required for sporulation.

T1  - Winter survival strategy of freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) in the upper Mississippi River
AN  - 303938094
AB  - An annual winter and early spring peak in numbers of impinged freshwater drum at Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station on Pool 14 of the Mississippi River has been observed. Most of the impinged fish, drawn in with cooling water from the main channel border, were less than 160 mm total length. Prior to impingement most fish were dead or moribund. Those that were still alive were incapacitated, i.e. weak and disoriented, and unable to resist even the slowest currents. Sampling in channel habitat revealed several fish species, including freshwater drum, drifting down river. Laboratory studies strongly indicated that exposure of small freshwater drum to temperatures at or near freezing caused incapacitation. Other potential causes including energy store depletion and disease were not related to incapacitation. Field studies confirmed that water at 0$\sp\circ$C was present in channel habitat for extended periods during winter. Lentic riverine habitats, e.g. sloughs, exhibited thermal stratification with water as warm as 5$\sp\circ$C available to fish. Heat stored in the substrate was believed to be the primary source of the higher temperatures in lentic habitats. Large numbers of small, healthy freshwater drum were found in the thermal refuges provided by sloughs.    However, dissolved oxygen concentrations in some sloughs fell below those required by many fish species, while concentrations in the main channel remained high. Other measures of water quality were not adverse to fish. Two mechanisms could account for the presence of freshwater drum in the drift of the channels. First, dissolved oxygen depletion could force fish from the warmer sloughs into the 0$\sp\circ$C water of the channel. Second, colder water of the channels inundated some sloughs in late winter and early spring as ice and snow melt increased pool levels. Fish requiring the thermal refuges of the sloughs could be incapacitated and carried to the channel by the resulting current. The occurrence of several other fish species in the drift suggests that intolerance of winter channel conditions may not be limited to freshwater drum, which is recognized as a eurythermal species. If other species cannot survive exposure to 0$\sp\circ$C, the freshwater drum serves as a model for adaptation to riverine winter conditions through temperature-related habitat selection.

T1  - Physiological and behavioral consequences of reptilian life in the slow lane: Ecology of beaded lizards and rattlesnakes
AN  - 303923760
AB  - Although reptiles are well known for their low energy requirements and high efficiencies of biomass conversion, few studies have addressed the ecology and energetics of species with very low activity levels. I investigated the ecology and energetics of two such reptilian groups: helodermatid lizards, and viperid snakes. I radiotracked Mexican beaded lizards and three rattlesnake species in their natural environments to determine their activity patterns, the time and energy they invest in activity, home ranges, thermal biology, habitat and other resource use, and behavior. I measured metabolic rates in the laboratory to determine rates of energy use.    Beaded lizards had a mean home range of 21.6 ha, an activity peak at 1800 hrs and traveled, on average, 25.3 km during approximately 121 h of surface activity over the year. They had very low metabolic rates during rest. However, helodermatids had maximal rates of oxygen consumption that were among the highest of any lizard measured, a trait that may be adaptive during their intensive male-male agonistic behaviors. Males had significantly higher capacities for aerobic activity than did females. Heloderma horridum can fulfill its annual maintenance energy requirements with a quantity of prey equivalent to approximately 1.4 times its body mass.    Rattlesnakes had a mean home range size of 4.6 hectares and traveled, on average, 12.4 km over approximately 95 hours of annual surface activity. Rattlesnakes spent considerable time inactive on the surface, whereas Heloderma spent the vast majority of their time resting in shelters. Heloderma and Crotalus had similar body temperature preferences for activity (around 30 C). Like Heloderma, Crotalus had very low rates of metabolism during rest. A 300-g rattlesnake had a standard metabolic rate only 40% that of other squamate reptiles of similar mass, and could fulfill its yearly maintenance energy requirements with a prey quantity equivalent to 0.93 $\times$ its body mass, which could be met with 2-3 large meals.    After feeding, free-ranging rattlesnakes exhibited thermophilic responses that varied, in part, due to their reclusive behavior, and thermal constraints in the environment. The temperatures selected for digesting and activity are apparently similar in rattlesnakes.

This is a common migrant species which is distributed throughout the palaearctic.  Individuals make regular, seasonal migrations into areas at more northerly latitudes where they are unable to breed continuously.  Individuals migrate into Britain each spring, and after one, two or three generations, offspring of the spring migrants return to over-wintering areas in North Africa and the Middle East.  Evidence for this long-distance movement is reviewed and light-trap records from a number of countries are presented.    Migration usually occurs pre-reproductively and so the length of the adult pre-reproductive period (PRP) is a measure of the potential time available for migration.  The length of the PRP varies from 1-11 days.    Individuals reared in outdoor cages in Bangor in autumn had longer PRPs than individuals reared outside in summer.  Laboratory studies showed that PRPs were extended at low temperatures and under short photoperiods.  Access to sugar solution also influenced the length of the PRP.    Evidence for genetic regulation of the PRP was obtained from full-sib correlations and selection experiments.  Two selected lines were established, on the basis of female PRP, for early and late reproduction.  After two generations, the PRP distributions of the two lines were significantly different.  The mode of inheritance of the PRP was investigated by sib-analysis experiments and parent-offspring regressions.  X-linked genes were shown to have the greatest influence on PRP, although there were also autosomal influences.  Geographic variation in the PRP was shown in samples from Britain, Morocco, Germany and Sweden.  There was some evidence of a genetic cline, with individuals at higher latitudes having longer PRPs.  Data obtained from 17 families showed significant genotype-environment interactions, with certain families being more sensitive to photoperiodic cues in the control of the PRP.    The results of this study are discussed in relation to the evolution of migration in A. gamma.

T1  - The viability of energy plantations in Thailand: an energy system approach using alternative conversion pathways
AN  - 900246031
AB  - Since the oil crisis in the mid 1970s and the recognition of impending fuelwood shortages in many developing countries, increased emphasis has been placed on the development of renewable energy sources such as biomass from energy plantations.  As there has been considerable speculation regarding the economic attractiveness of energy plantations in developing countries, the objective of this thesis is to develop an approach to assess the viability of a hypothetical energy plantation in Northeast Thailand within a framework encompassing the price structure of alternative fuels.  An integrated energy system approach has been developed for this project.  The approach is based on the premise that the value of plantation biomass is not only based on the inherent properties of the feedstock but also on the efficiency and cost configurations of the energy conversion systems in which it is utilized.  The approach encompasses a free standing plantation simulation model and an array of energy conversion models used in the analysis account for the cost and heat content of alternative fuels and the scale, efficiency, cost configurations and fuel requirements of the conversion systems.  The integrated approach permitted observations to be made of the extent prices of traditional and modern fuels affect the viability of energy plantations.  When the value of plantation biomass was based on the price of fuelwood used for household cooking, the return on the plantation was unattractive.  This finding illustrates a classic common property resource problem when the price of fuelwood from natural forests does not reflect the cost of growing wood or an impending fuelwood scarcity.  The highest internal rate of return on equity capital for an industrial end-use was 15.1% obtained from plantation biomass used for electric power generation.  Findings from the project suggest that energy plantations could be a valuable component of a long term strategy to develop socially acceptable renewable energy projects in Thailand.

T1  - LABORATORY STUDIES ON THE REGULATION OF MIGRATION IN THE COTTON BOLLWORM, HELIOTHIS ARMIGERA (HB.) (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE)
AN  - 303946177
AB  - This study investigated two life-history traits of importance in the regulation of migration by Heliothis armigera (Hb.)--the pre-reproductive period (PRP) and flight.    The first phase of this study involved improving the existing culture technique so that different geographical strains of H. armigera could be kept indefinitely and with confidence. Progress was achieved by containing the spread of disease, improving larval nutrition and increasing the mating success of H. armigera in the laboratory.    Migration is thought to occur pre-reproductively in the Noctuidae. The PRP, therefore, represents the time window in which migration can take place. H. armigera has been considered previously to be a facultative migrant and therefore abiotic and biotic factors were investigated for their influence on the PRP. Neither high temperatures ($>$30$\sp\circ$C) nor high vapour-pressure deficits ($>$23 mm. Hg.) acted to lengthen the PRP. Access to a source of sugar solution (10% w./v.), however, was found to have a marked influence on the PRP.    The PRP distributions of Indian and Malawian female H. armigera were compared and found to be significantly different. A sib-analysis experiment confirmed the genetic influence on the female PRP and showed the mode of inheritance to be X linked. Male H. armigera were also found to have a range in PRPs, the distribution of which was not significantly different to that of their female siblings.    A selection experiment was carried out on the basis of female PRP only, to produce both an early and a late-maturing line of females. After just two generations of selection the PRP distributions of the males in the early and late-maturing lines were significantly different, with the divergence occurring in the same direction as for females. This result suggested that the same group of X-linked genes controls the rate of reproductive maturation in both males and females.    The flight ability of both Indian and Malawian H. armigera was assessed using a tethered-flight system. Flight ability conformed to the typical pattern of the 'oogenesis-flight syndrome' with immature moths flying significantly more than either mature or mated moths. The heritability of tethered flight was investigated for Malawian H. armigera and the results were consistent with autosomal inheritance (h$\sp2\sb{(\rm Total\ Flying\ Time)}$ = 0.39 $\pm$ 0.083). The ability of the tethered-flight apparatus to identify migratory-flight behaviour by H. armigera is discussed.    The results of this study are considered in relation to the evolution of migration in H. armigera.

T1  - Predation and diel vertical migration in zooplankton
AN  - 303912147
AB  - Of the several hypotheses put forth to explain the adaptive significance of diel vertical migration (DVM) in zooplankton, predator evasion is perhaps the most common. However, direct evidence for this hypothesis remains elusive. This dissertation probes the predator evasion hypothesis, as well as alternatives, by combining a series of field and experimental studies.    Results from four field studies are presented. First, variable DVM in the copepod Calanus pacificus in Dabob Bay, Washington is shown to be statistically significantly related only to the abundance of planktivorous fish, and not to any of several other environmental parameters (i.e., degree of thermal stratification, phytoplankton stock, and copepod egg production rate). Second, variable DVM in Acartia hudsonica in Jakles Lagoon (San Juan Island, Washington) is likewise shown to be statistically significantly related to only predator abundance, and not to either secchi disk depth or degree of thermal stratification. Third, the strength of reverse DVM in the copepod Pseudocalanus newmani in Dabob Bay is shown to be statistically significantly related to the potential predation intensity of invertebrate predators, with an occasional role for planktivorous fish. Fourth, variable DVM behavior in adult female Euchaeta elongata is related to differential susceptibility to planktivorous fish: nonovigerous females enter the surface layer only under the cover of darkness, whereas the more susceptible ovigerous females almost never do so, remaining at depth both day and night. These four field studies marshal evidence that support one hypothesis, to the exclusion of alternatives, for the adaptive significance of DVM in zooplankton: predator evasion.    In an effort to go beyond the correlative approach inherent in such field studies, a series of experimental predator-prey manipulations in large in situ enclosures were undertaken. These experiments provide unambiguous evidence that DVM in A. hudsonica is an evasive response to its naturally occurring predator, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Furthermore, this response is shown to result from individual copepods exercising phenotypic plasticity in their migration behavior, and not from a population-genetic level response to selective predation. These responses are likely elicited by visual cues or mechanical stimuli, rather than by chemical cues.

T1  - Effects of dehydration on ratings of perceived exertion at the lactate and ventilatory thresholds
AN  - 303911620
AB  - Depletion of body water leads to a reduction in physical performance capacity. It has been hypothesized that alterations in anaerobic function, thermoregulation, or perception of effort may be responsible. Mean ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) at the lactate threshold (LT) and ventilatory threshold (VT) have been reported to be relatively constant. Whether or not RPE at LT and VT are altered by dehydration is not known. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of varying levels of dehydration on RPE at LT and VT.    Nine male subjects completed three progressive cycling tests under three hydration conditions. Two days prior to each test subjects exercised in a warm (38$\sp\circ$C) environment for 1.5 hours on both days. Food and fluid intake was controlled to achieve either a 0%, 3%, or 6% loss in body weight. During each test, ventilation (Ve), oxygen uptake (VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate (HR) and rectal temperature (Tr); plasma concentrations of hemoglobin (Hb), free-fatty acids, (FFA), glucose (Glu) and glycerol (Gly); blood lactate concentration (La); and hematocrit (Hct) were measured. LT was determined by computer from plots of log lactate to log VO2. VT was determined visually from plots of Ve/VO2 and Ve/VCO2. The significance of mean differences among dehydration conditions for responses at selected submaximal exercise intensities, and at the LT and VT was determined using a repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc tests.    During submaximal exercise, at intensities between 40 and 80% of VO2max, RPE, VO2, RER, Ve, HR, La, FFA, Gly, Hct and plasma volume change were not significantly different among treatments. Significant differences were observed in (Hb) between the 0%- and both 3%- and 6%- dehydration conditions. Dehydration of 6% caused a significant increase in Glu compared to the 3%- and 0%- dehydration conditions. A significant difference in Tr was observed between the 0%- and 6%- dehydration conditions. Dehydration did not significantly alter LT or VT, or the cardiorespiratory, metabolic and perceptual responses at LT or VT.    It was concluded that up to 6% dehydration does not alter ratings of perceived exertion, lactate threshold or ventilatory threshold, and the rating of perceived exertion at lactate threshold or ventilatory threshold.

T1  - Quantitative genetic analyses of the photoresponse in the Djungarian hamster, Phodopus sungorus
AN  - 303891176
AB  - Species living in temperate and arctic regions are faced with seasonal changes in the environment, such as temperature and food availability. Many of these species are photoperiodic. The short-day (e.g., 9 hours of light per day) response of the Djungarian hamster, Phodopus sungorus, is usually characterized by weight loss, molt to a white pelage, gonadal regression, increased thermogenesis and daily torpor. However, not all hamsters respond to short-day photoperiod; preliminary studies suggested that there was genetic influence on photoresponsiveness (see Lynch et al (1989) J. Comp. Physiol. A 164:475).    This study confirms that photoresponsiveness is a heritable character in the Djungarian hamster. Both parent-offspring regression and replicated bidirectional selection on a photoresponse index (PI = body weight loss (in grams) + 2 x molt index after 12 weeks of short-day exposure) indicated a significant additive genetic component of phenotypic variance in photoresponsiveness (b$\sb{\rm op}$ = 17% in females, 46% in males; R/S (high lines) = 39% in females, 36% in males; R/S (low lines) = 37% in both females and males). Significant heritabilities were estimated by parent-offspring regression for other measures of photoresponse (i.e., body weight loss and molt index after 12 weeks in short-day photoperiod, and threshold for responsiveness (as measured by PI and molt index)). Four generations of selection on PI significantly altered the percentage of responsive individuals relative to nonselected control hamsters (89.6% responsive in high lines, 77.5% in control lines and 55.1% in low lines); however, analysis of variance indicated that neither the degree nor the timing of the response was significantly changed by selection. Analysis of variance in the control lines also indicated that the number of responsive parents does not influence the degree of response in responsive offspring, although it does affect the percentage of responsive offspring (27.9%, 66.7% and 77.2% with 0, 1 or 2 responsive parents, respectively). Although the threshold for photoresponsiveness appears to be related to at least two aspects of the circadian system (free-running period and phase angle to lights-off), the degree of response does not correlate with either of these circadian characters. Therefore, it appears that the underlying threshold for the photoresponse is genetically and physiologically independent of degree of response.

T1  - Ultrametamorphism and anatexis of the continental crust: An experimental and theoretical study
AN  - 303887213
AB  - The generation of silica-rich magmas by anatexis of metamorphic rocks in the continental crust constitutes an imprecise boundary between metamorphism and igneous activity. This diffuse boundary spans the transition between different modes of mass and energy transfer in the crust and can cause profound changes in the mechanical behaviour and chemical constitution of the continental crust. I have pursued two complementary approaches, with the goal of fostering our quantitative understanding of the chemical and physical aspects of crustal anatexis. The first approach is an experimental investigation of the compositional controls on melt productivity from metapelitic rocks and of the effects of thermodynamic intensive variables on the compositions of melts and coexisting mineral phases. The other approach is a theoretical study of the relationships between the thermal structure and evolution of the crust, metamorphism and anatexis. Numerical simulations of thermal regimes during orogenesis show that anatexis is the expected end product of Barrovian metamorphism in thickened continental crust. Experimental results demonstrate that bulk composition of the source material is the overriding factor controlling the amount of H$\sb2$O-undersaturated melt formed at the temperatures (850 to 950$\sp\circ$C) that can normally be attained in continental crust subject to tectonic thickening. Melts formed in this temperature interval have a restricted compositional range and are notably silica-rich and felsic (68-73 wt.% SiO$\sb2$; MgO + FeO* + TiO$\sb2$ less than 3 wt.%). Melt production by dehydration-melting is maximized from protoliths whose modes coincide with the stoichiometric coefficients of the melting reactions, because generation of low-temperature granitoid liquids requires both quartzo-feldspathic components and H$\sb2$O (from hydrous minerals). Anatectic melts coexist in my experimental products with mafic and aluminous restitic mineral assemblages, which accommodate the excess refractory components present in the protolith. Pressure has a limited effect on melt fraction and composition, but affects the composition of biotite and the nature of the predominant ferromagnesian phases in restitic assemblages. My results show that anatexis can lead to internal differentiation of the continental crust, by generating a felsic and alkali-rich fusible fraction and a mafic and alumina-rich refractory fraction.

T1  - Physical and genetic analysis of the Bacillus subtilis (natto) fertility plasmid pLS20
AN  - 303879817
AB  - The 64.2-kilobase Bacillus subtilis (natto) plasmid pLS20 encodes functions required for conjugal transmission of plasmid DNA among a variety of Bacillus species. Localization of the transfer region on this plasmid was accomplished via the generation of transposon insertions and subsequent deletion analysis. Utilization of the temperature-sensitive transposition selection vector pTV1 allowed the isolation of a collection of pLS20::Tn917 derivatives. Insertion of Tn917 outside of the 10.8-kb BglII fragment of pLS20 did not affect the transfer abilities of the host cells harboring these plasmid mutants. Insertion of the transposon within the 10.8-kb BglII fragment led to the identification of two distinct regions of pLS20 involved in plasmid-mediated DNA exchange. Insertions into one portion of the 10.8-kb BglII fragment abolished the ability of pLS20 to transfer itself but did not affect the plasmid's ability to mobilize the tetracycline resistance plasmid pBC16. Mutants with insertions in another region of this fragment were almost completely transfer-deficient.    Certain of the transposon-tagged derivatives, namely pLS20.3 and pLS20.4, incurred specific deletion following growth of host organisms for several generations in the presence of inhibitory levels of erythromycin. Deletion analyses revealed that loss of ca 15 kb of DNA encompassing of 10.8-kb BglII fragment results in total loss of conjugal transfer ability. Confirmation that this 10.8-kb BglII fragment contained all the DNA sequences necessary for conjugal DNA transfer came from cloning the fragment in the B. subtilis cloning vector pBD64. B. subtilis transformants carrying the pBD64 containing the cloned fragment were able to transfer the recombinant plasmid by conjugation at frequencies comparable to those obtained with B. subtilis donors carrying nondefective pLS20 or pLS20::Tn917 plasmids.    The same region of pLS20 that is involved in transfer functions was also found to be involved in the suppression of motility of host organisms. Cells harboring pLS20 or the non-defective transposon-tagged derivatives appeared non-motile on 0.4% agar plates, and electron photomicrographs revealed the absence of flagella. However, cells cured of the plasmid or cells harboring the transfer-defective deletion derivatives pLS20.3$\Delta$1 and pLS20.4$\Delta$1 were flagellated and motile.

T1  - Factors influencing consumer potato storability in the warm tropics
AN  - 303841535
AB  - This study was done to determine the feasibility of and explore ways to store consumer potatoes in the warm tropics and reduce storage losses to acceptable levels.    The research was done during 2 years, 1988 and 1989, at the mid-elevation jungle research station of the International Potatoe Center located at San Ramon (800 m elevation), Peru.    Pathogen induced rotting is the major cause of loss during storage in the warm tropics. Studies were done to evaluate the storage potential of clones adapted to the warm tropics and determine if any significant relationship existed between storage potential and rotting response to Erwinia and Fusarium spp. when inoculated separately and simultaneously. Finding a suitable relationship would simplify screening in breeding programs to identify progeny with good storage potential. Some of the more suitable clones that were identified for storage in the warm tropics were Desiree, Kufri Jyoti, Serrana, LT-5 and B71 240.2. A significant relationship between storage potential and rotting induced by inoculation was only obtained when the Erwinia and Fusarium spp. were inoculated simultaneously.    Since rapid wound healing is essential to reduce pathogen invasion and rotting, the rapidity of wound healing was evaluated. Thirteen of 15 test clones showed over a 90% reduction in F. solani induced dry rot after only 6 days at 25 C. Thus, this evaluation is probably not sufficiently sensitive to differentiate clones in their storage potential.    Delaying harvest for 8 days after vine senescence to allow skin setting was slightly beneficial during the dry season but was detrimental during the wet season. A hazard of delaying harvest is the possibility of increased potato tuber moth (PTM) infestation.    Removing visibly diseased, insect infested and damaged tubers before storage was very effective in reducing storage losses due to rotting and PTM infestation.    Dipping potatoes in solutions of sodium hypochlorite and thiabendazole was very detrimental. However, dusting with thiabendazole just after harvest and dusting with chloro-isopropyl-phenyl-carbamate (CIPC) after 4 weeks was beneficial. CIPC did not reduce sprouting but completely controlled PTM infestation.    This research has shown that it is possible to store potatoes in the warm tropics using the proper clones and procedures.

T1  - Petrology and geochemistry of mid-Pleistocene lavas from Seguam Island, central Aleutian Islands, Alaska: Implications for the chemical and physical evolution of oceanic island arc magmatic centers
AN  - 303838312
AB  - Theoretical, field, and laboratory investigations herein examine the origin and evolution of mid-Pleistocene magmas erupted from the central Aleutian volcanic center of Seguam Island. Thermal modeling demonstrates that repeated magma ascent and heating of the lithosphere is a dynamic process, which over the lifetime of a volcanic center may alter the crystallization and hybridization history of successive eruptive products. Superimposed on this thermal and chemical evolution, intra-arc extension has modified the thermal and mechanical properties of the central Aleutian lithosphere.     K-Ar dates verify that voluminous tholeiitic basalt and basaltic andesite and subordinate andesite and dacite lavas erupted 1.07 to 0.07 Ma. Mineralogic evidence for closed-system equilibrium crystallization, low abundances of K2O, Na2O, Rb, Ba, Sr, and LREE, and uniform but anomalously high 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/ 204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/ 204Pb ratios and remarkably low 143Nd/144Nd ratios indicate that Seguam basalt is unlike other Aleutian basalts. Seguam's geochemical uniqueness corresponds to its unusual position atop strongly extended arc crust. Extended and presumably hotter lithosphere allowed basaltic magmas to crystallize under closed-system equilibrium conditions at ca. 1200°C and <8 kb and to erupt readily at Seguam. Extensive plag+cpx+mt+/-ol+/-opx fractionation at 1200-1000°C and 1-4 kb produced the evolved lavas. In contrast, basalts from adjacent volcanic centers on unextended and presumably cooler lithosphere crystallized under disequilibrium conditions, at higher pressures, assimilated lower crustal and upper mantle rocks, and rarely erupted.     The source of central Aleutian basalts may reside in the mantle wedge or subducted crust. Seguam basalt compositions cannot be derived by eclogite melting, but are consistent with partial melting of depleted peridotite plus a small fraction of subducted sediment. Along arc variations in the composition of the mantle wedge (proportion of fertile/depleted peridotite) or the subducted crust (fracture zone peridotite beneath Seguam, eclogite beneath Adak and Atka) may explain geochemical differences between these centers. Superimposed on this potential source variability are contrasting styles of magma ascent, i.e. open vs. closed system evolution, which may be facilitated by differing degrees of intra arc extension.

T1  - Growth of Larval and Juvenile Newts
AN  - 2327378762
AB  - In smooth newts (Triturus vulgaris), adult body size is determined by mainly by growth during the pre-maturity stages. Adult body size is frequently related to reproductive success and hence fitness. This project examined factors affecting growth during the prematurity stages. Chapter 2 reviews the literature on the effects of adult body size on reproductive success in urodeles with particular reference to newts of the Triturus genus. This review identifies the need to experimentally test and further quantify body size effects. Two such studies are reported in Chapter 3. Chapter 3 examines the relationship between female body size and fecundity in female smooth newts and also examines short-term mating capacity in males. Female body size is strongly related to fecundity but there is only a weak relationship between male body size and the number of spermatophores deposited. Chapter 4 describes the pattern of growth of newt larvae (T. alpestris, T. cristatus and T. vulgaris) grown in the laboratory. Variation in larval period explains most of the body size variation at transformation. Chapters 5, 6 and 7 report studies investigating the effects of temperature, food availability, larval density, maternal effects, population effects and timing of oviposition on the growth of T. vittatus and T. vulgaris larvae in the laboratory and semi-natural conditions. Chapter 8 investigates growth during the eft stages of T. cristatus and T. vulgaris. The rank ordering of body sizes of individuals at transformation is preserved during the eft stage in T. vulgaris and T. cristatus, and to adulthood in T. cristatus. Variability between growth strategies of individual newts may have been naturally selected as a response to larval life in a variable and unpredictable environment.

T1  - Genotype-environment interaction study on sesame (Sesamum indicum L.)
AN  - 230837063
AB  - Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is a tropical oilseed found growing in the mid-altitude ($<$1700 m.a.s.l.) regions of Ethiopia. Recently, there has been an attempt by settler farmers from the Ethiopian plateau to expand sesame cultivation in the low altitude areas ($<$800 m.a.s.l.). A genotype-environment interaction study on sesame lines developed through progeny selection originating from a bulk of landraces was carried out at six environments in Ethiopia. The environments selected were believed to provide a wide variation in temperature (altitude), moisture and soil. The objective of the study was, therefore, to select a line or lines widely adaptable over these environments for variables seed yield, oil and protein content as well as fatty acid composition. Two statistical methods, namely, the regression model and the procedural approach of superiority measure were used to estimate line adaptability. Several lines were identified which were adapted over the six environments while others were specifically adapted to low- or high-yielding environments. Lines showing wide adaptation for one variable were not always widely adapted for others. In addition, the two parametric statistics used to analyze the data did not always agree for each variable.

T1  - Population and behavioral ecology of the dragonfly Sympetrum danae (Sulzer) (Odonata:Libellulidae)
AN  - 303850829
AB  - This study describes the population and behavioral ecology of a non-territorial dragonfly and explains behavioral variation by means of biotic and abiotic characteristics of the individual's environment. Data were collected by means of capture-recapture techniques and observations under natural conditions and in a field-cage.    S. danae adults emerged asynchronically between in July-August. The population density peaked mid-August. The larger individuals emerged first, dispersed more when immature, and lived longer than the smaller ones. Matures showed a high tendency to disperse at an age of 25-30 days.    Males and females showed significant differences in activity patterns: in males time and place were adjusted to the likelihood of encountering receptive mates, while females showed a pattern that resulted in a maximal male avoidance.    77% of the pair-formation occurred away from the water and before noon. The other pairs were formed at the pond around noon.    Copulation lasted 15-20 min and shortened with time, temperature and the copulation sequence number for the male. Males removed 44-87% of the sperm from the female sperm-storage organs by means of their specialized penis, yielding 95% fertilization precedence. This explained the high degree of post-copulatory guarding: oviposition always started immediately upon copulation, and invariably started in tandem position. Tandem duration lasted longer at higher male densities.    Oviposition sites with Sphagnum were preferred for oviposition. At high temperatures North oriented sites were chosen, while at low temperatures selected sites were South oriented. During oviposition frogs killed 10-14% of all females and only 3% of the males in tandem pairs. Pairs were attracted by one another and post-tandem females showed a high degree of site-fidelity. This was interpreted as an adaptation that reduced frog-predation.    Mating success was not randomly distributed on a lifetime scale, nor on a daily scale. Males showed a higher variance than females. Larger males were more active and aggressive, and got more matings. No trade-off in terms of a shorter lifespan existed. Female mating success was limited by egg-production and depended mainly on lifespan. In both sexes the relative presence of the own sex reduced the mating probability.

T1  - Factors influencing photoperiodic control of egg diapause in Aedes albopictus (Skuse)
AN  - 303823562
AB  - In August of 1985, an infestation of Aedes albopictus, an oriental mosquito, was first found in Harris Co., Texas. The mosquito has since spread throughout the southern states as well as extending north to Chicago and Baltimore. The mode of introduction of this Stegomyia mosquito into the United States was through scrap tire shipments from ports in temperate Asia.    Sensitivity to photoperiod was determined for temperate strains of Ae. albopictus. When females of temperate Ae. albopictus are exposed to short day lengths, they lay eggs that fail to hatch. Strains of Ae. albopictus from the tropics and subtropics, do not demonstrate sensitivity to photoperiods.    All of 17 strains from the U.S. showed photoperiod-induced diapause; The Critical Photoperiod (CP) ranged between 13 and 14 hours of light. These strains were collected at latitude 26$\sp\circ$N through 42$\sp\circ$N; they showed a definite, albeit poorly defined, cline with regards to photoperiod. A more sharply defined cline is evident in Ae. albopictus strains from Japan.    High temperatures (28$\sp\circ$-30$\sp\circ$C) overrode sensitivity to photoperiod for all strains examined. Diet caused a shift in CP. The CP was lengthened by 15 minutes when adults were starved as larvae.    Aedes albopictus populations from Brazil (like populations from tropical Asia), are not photosensitive; they are biologically distinct from temperate populations. However, an hypothesis is proposed for a temperate origin for these populations.    Response to laboratory selection for nondiapause in the TOKYO strain was fast and occurred within 5 generations.    Aedes albopictus strains successfully overwintered in northern Indiana in the winters of 1986-88. Overwintering success is enhanced by photoperiod-induced dormancy and prolonged cold-conditioning. This has serious implications for the northward expansion of Ae. albopictus. A north-south cline in cold-hardiness is also suggested among populations in the U.S.    An hypothesis is presented for diapause induction in Ae. albopictus. Data from transfer studies suggest that the accumulation of a 'product' produced by adults in short photoperiod ultimately induces diapause.

T1  - Pilot plant treatment of urban wastewater with macrophytes: Biochemical study and mathematical modeling
AN  - 303799059
AB  - The main objective of this study is to improve the quality of stabilization pond effluents through the use of macrophytes, especially with respect to the content of suspended solids.    The experimental facility consisted of three channels operating in parallel which received raw wastewater coming from Cartagena (Spain). The macrophyte species selected initially for this study were Phragmites communis Trin and Lemna gibba L. The third channel was used as a control and was thus maintained as a microphyte wastewater pond throughout the experiments.    The evolution of the wastewater in the pilot plant was monitored through the measurement of 21 parameters. The productivity and composition of the macrophytes have also been studied.    A unidimensional simulation model of the resulting artificial wetland has been developed. The model consists of thermal and biochemical submodels. Mass balances were written for every one of the parameters, as well as an energy balance for the temperature calculations. Every balance involved diffusion, advection and transformation processes. The resulting system of non-linear, partial differential equations has been solved numerically using a finite differences scheme.    The simulation model predicts the influence of several meteorological variables, as well as the composition of the influent, on the evolution over time of macrophytes, microphytes, zooplankton, bacterial biomass, COD, dissolved oxygen, nutrients and detrital mass. The agreement between computed and experimental data has been satisfactory.    The results obtained in this study allow us to conclude that wastewater treatment with Pragmites communis is an efficient method that significantly reduces the effluent content in suspended solids. Other positive aspects of this system are the potential use of the biomass and the ecological value of biotope regeneration.

T1  - The Fertility Capability Classification System (FCC) - 3rd Approximation: A technical soil classification system relating pedon characterization data to inherent fertility characteristics
AN  - 303795113
AB  - Presented is a comprehensive review of the Fertility Capability Classification System encompassing the components of the system, their criteria, and management statements. The focus and intent of each component is stated and pertinent literature is reviewed to justify the criteria used to define each component. Several revisions or refinements of the original criteria are presented.    New components are proposed including the R$\sp-$ subsurface type indicating the presence of a root restricting layer within 50 cm of the surface that can be ripped and produces a greater rooting depth. Proposed condition modifiers include the d$\sp{+}$ modifier separating the aridic (torric) soil moisture regime from the d modifier now indicating presence of an ustic or xeric regime; i$\sp{+}$ modifier indicating potential toxic levels of reduced iron in soils that are flooded for long duration; i$\sp{-}$ modifier separating high P fixing soils (due to high crystalline iron mineral presence) that have had their P fixing property ameliorated through large P applications; n$\sp{-}$ modifier recognizing ESP values of between 6 and 15; x$\sp{-}$ modifier recognizing moderate to high P fixing soils that do not qualify as having an i or x modifier; s$\sp{-}$ modifier recognizing EC values of between 2 and 4 dsm$\sp{-1}$; t modifier separating temerate region soils from those in the tropics; and the t$\sp{+}$ modifier separating those soils that have perennial cold temperatures that prohibit crop production.    Management statements have been provided for these new components and additional statements have been included for existing components. Statements have also been added that are to be generated for the classified soil that serve to define the parameters querried by and therefore the scope of the system.    Lastly, tables have been created stating the general adaptability of selected crops, and tropical and subtropical tree and pasture species to selected FCC parameters.

T1  - HOMEOVISCOUS ADAPTATION TO TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE: A BIOPHYSICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL STUDY (TEMPERATURE ADAPTATIONS, PRESSURE ADAPTATIONS, BIOPHYSICAL STUDY)
AN  - 303768972
AB  - Animals have invaded habitats with widely varying conditions of temperature, pressure, salinity, pH etc. Underlying the survival and "fitness" of animals in potentially hostile environments are a suite of physiological adaptations which allow vital physiological processes to proceed where they would otherwise fail. Two main groups of animal can be classified according to the strategies used to maintain "normal" physiological and biochemical function in the face of environmental change: (1) Regulators--maintain a constant internal environment of temperature, pressure, osmotic pressure etc. (2) Conformers--are unable to regulate their internal environment and therefore external conditions act directly at the cellular level (1,2). These animals adapt to their external environment by adapting cellular processes to function under variable conditions. This is manifested in two ways, firstly, by modifying the ability of animals to withstand the lethal effects of temperature extremes (resistance adaptation), and secondly, by adaptive strategies in response to normal environmental fluctuations (capacity adaptation).    Adaptive responses occur over at least two distinct time scales: (1) Evolutionary adaptation occurs over many generations whereby the survival and reproduction of individuals possessing favourable characteristics for a particular environment is greater, resulting in favourable genetic characteristics being retained. (2) Seasonal responses or "acclimatisations", are restricted to the lifetime of an individual in response to natural environmental fluctuations. The adaptive state is reversible depending upon the circumstances but is not passed on through generations. The mechanism underlying the adaptive process is, however, inherited. Acclimation refers to the process by which an organism is subjected, in the laboratory, to a single aspect of environmental stress without the associated changes in other environmental conditions experienced in natural surroundings (3).    In principle, the same problems apply to adaptation over both time scales, and often the same solutions are apparent. In certain instances, the genotypic adaptive responses may outweigh acclimatisation such that different species can evolve into habitats that no single species can acclimatise to. For example, active arctic species have developed specific peptide and glycopeptide "antifreezes" to prevent ice formation in body fluids (4), while those species remaining dormant in the cold have developed the ability to tolerate extracellular ice formation in order to prevent its formation intra-cellularly.

T1  - Evolutionary consequences of limited dispersal and environment heterogeneity in Tigriopus californicus life histories
AN  - 303734333
AB  - The consequences of population structure and environmental heterogeneity on the evolution of life-history traits depends on several ecological and genetic conditions which I explore in the philopatric marine copepod Tigriopus californicus (Crustacea, Harpacticoida). This benthic species is restricted to tidepools that vary over a wide range of salinity. At Bodega Bay, California, the habitat is subdivided at several spatial scales between which dispersal is unlikely: between rock outcrops along the open coast, and between an open coast site and a protected site. Pools at the open coast site exhibit the widest spatial and temporal variation, and often dry completely. In contrast, a pool on one open coast outcrop is continuously fed by freshwater from seepage, and does not evaporate. Similarly, pools at the protected site are located on level rock shelves, and frequently receive oceanic water during most high tides.    Patterns of phenotypic variation in nature between rock outcrops of the open coast showed differentiation in only one of three life-history traits. Common garden lab experiments indicated little genetic differentiation, and that most life-history variation was explained by plasticity in response to laboratory-controlled temperature and salinity. However, between the protected and open coast sites, there was life-history differentiation in nature; but the genetic component of variation in the lab was distributed among families, not site of origin.    Phenotypic plasticity can evolve in fine-grained, spatially heterogeneous or temporally variable environments. One outcrop at the open coast site is characterized by high and variable pool salinities; the other outcrop and the protected site are not. These salinity differences have a selective impact; they increase juvenile mortality, age of first reproduction, and interclutch interval. The similarity of allozyme frequencies among the populations from different outcrops at the open coast site suggested that plasticity may have evolved because dispersal occurs over selectively different environments. However, dispersal does not occur between protected and open coast sites, and the protected site is temporally constant compared to the open coast site; these conditions should favor genetic divergence.    A quantitative genetic analysis of life-history traits of the protected-site population suggests that divergence may be limited by genetic constraints on the response to selection. Although genetic correlations among traits are consistent with a proposed fitness model for this selective environment, the analysis suggests that the heritable proportion of phenotypic variation in nature may prevent response to all but the most severe selective differences, hence the lack of divergence.

T1  - Genetic and environmental correlates of shape variation in the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea
AN  - 303727280
AB  - It is often proposed that the shape of animals evolves as a correlated response to selection on life history traits such as whole body growth and differentiation rates. This scenario is certainly true for shape variation that is an allometric consequence of body size variation, because body size is determined by growth and differentiation rates. However, we are aware of few examples in which development rate variation is correlated with body size-independent shape variation. In this study on the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea, we test whether that fraction of the variance in tibiofibula length and head width that is left after removing snout vent length as a covariate is correlated with either genetically or environmentally based variation in development rates.    Size-adjusted tibiofibula length and head width at metamorphosis are both positively genetically correlated with larval period length. Thus, relative limb and head proportions in adult treefrogs could evolve as a correlated response to selection on a larval life history trait. Neither larval growth rate nor juvenile growth rate is significantly genetically correlated with the morphological traits. The two size-adjusted morphological traits are strongly genetically correlated with each other, a situation which could either hinder or accelerate their joint evolution, depending on the directions of selection.    The growth rate of larvae raised under different food levels and temperatures had no effect on their size-adjusted head width or tibiofibula length at metamorphosis. The food-controlled rate at which small juveniles became large ones also had no influence on their shape. However, the head width versus snout vent length relationship among metamorphs has a shallower slope than the same relationship within growing juveniles. Thus, size at metamorphosis alone controls head width at a given larger body size. To our knowledge, we are the first to identify this difference in allometries as a potential source of size-independent shape variation in adult frogs.

T1  - Thermal preferenda and behavior of Atlantic eels (Genus Anguilla) in relation to their spawning migration
AN  - 303703608
AB  - This study addressed the thermal behavior of Atlantic eels (Genus Anguilla) with respect to their migration from freshwater and estuarine habitats to the spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. The overall objective of the study was to relate the responses of eels to thermal conditions in order to infer the effect of temperature on migratory metamorphosis, timing and depth of migration, sexual maturation and spawning.    Chapter I describes laboratory experiments in which thermal preferenda of four sequential adult life history phases of American eels were determined using a horizontal thermal gradient. Long-term chronic tests of 48 h duration were used to obtain estimates of individual final preferred temperatures (FPTs). Mean FPTs for all four phases were between 17 and 20$\sp\circ$C and were not significantly different. There was no significant difference between temperatures selected during light and dark portions of LD 12:12, 16:8 or DD photoperiods. Light appeared to inhibit behavioral thermoregulation by promoting shelter-seeking. Thermal behavior of eels was highly variable, both between individuals of the various test groups and between repeated tests of single individuals. The strong eurythermality observed in eels may facilitate their occupation of thermally diverse and unpredictable habitats.    Chapter II integrates the laboratory findings of Chapter I with observations of eels in the North Atlantic. The following inferences are drawn: (1) decreasing temperatures may initiate downstream migration of freshwater silver eels, (2) latitudinal differences in temperature, photoperiod and distance from the spawning area may affect the timing of downstream migration and contribute to the synchronization of arrival of eels at the spawning area, (3) yellow and silver eels may select temperatures close to their FPT in thermally stratified environments, but will tolerate higher and lower temperatures depending on illumination or other physical constraints, (4) the oceanic phase of the migration to the Sargasso Sea takes place mainly at relatively shallow depths in the open ocean, presumably within the upper 1000 meters. Eels may use temperature as an orientation cue in their spawning migration, but probably only on a local scale that allows them to identify strong thermal gradients or water masses of differing temperature.

T1  - Genetic and environmental effects on sex determination in Gammarus duebeni (Crustacea, amphipoda).
AN  - 301445927
AB  - Gammarus duebeni Liljeborg is a brackish water shrimp with a photoperiodically mediated sex determining mechanism (environmental sex determination).  There is adaptive variation in sex determination in this species in response to changes in the population dynamics; in seasonal northern populations environmental sex determination is adaptive but in non-seasonal southern populations environmental sex determination is inferred to be non-adaptive.  The reportedly bimodal dynamics of a southern population of G. duebeni at Totton Marsh, Southampton are investigated.  Contrary to expectations the life cycle is annual and growth and reproduction are almost but not completely continuous.  Fluctuations in the adult sex ratio are due to the production of males and females at different times of the year:  males early in the season, females later.  Photoperiod determines the sex of animals from Totton Marsh in the laboratory:  more males are produced under longday than under shortday conditions.  However, this cannot solely account for the pattern of sex differential production in the field where males are produced in excess in the shortdays of winter.  A potential role for temperature is discussed.  Response to photoperiod in these southern animals is predictably less as a consequence of the longer breeding season than in northern populations.  In addition, no critical threshold is identified at Totton Marsh; the proportion of males increases gradually with the length of the photophase.  Data from other Gammarus duebeni populations provide evidence to suggest there is an association between the degree of environmental sex determination and the length of the breeding season.  Males have to be born early so that they are larger than the females they pair with.  Mate choice experiments on size controlled males and females confirm previous reports that males benefit more from large size than females and indicate large male size is maintained through both natural and sexual selection.  Response to photoperiod is highly variable.  Heritability estimates using parent/offspring regressions and sib analysis indicate that there is a substantial genetic component to sex ratio control.  A polyfactorial system is proposed.  A functional model for the genetic basis of environmental sex determination in Gammarus duebeni is presented.  This model accounts for the adaptability and flexibility of the trait in this species.  It has applications to other species with environmental sex determination and suggests comparisons with the mechanisms of diapause.(D78175)

T1  - Investigations related to genetic sexing in the Mediterranean fruit fly ceratitis capitata (wied.) aimed at increasing the economic viability of the sterile insect technique.
AN  - 301412052
AB  - The medfly Ceratitis capitata (Wied.) is a notorious pest, especially of stone and citrus fruits, which infests the warmer areas of every continent and incurs enormous expense annually. Traditionally control has been by insecticides; more recently the sterile insect technique (SIT) has been used and the application of potentially environmentally damaging insecticides has been reduced. An important area of research in connection with SIT is `genetic sexing', the production of males for sterilization in the absence of females. This study investigated three aspects of genetic sexing. (i) The effect on sex ratio of incorporating the amino acid threonine into the larval medium. No consistently significant effect of threonine on either sex ratio or mortality was observed at the levels used (0 g l-1-10 g l-1). The consistency of the medium, however, was found to have a small but significant effect on sex ratio. (ii) Selection for increased expression of the temperature-sensitive meiotic drive factor (MP) in isofemale lines derived from strain A425 which showed holandrically inherited sex ratio distortion in favour of males. Selection combined with appropriate temperature treatment led to an increase in the expression of MP and the establishment of strain H1 which showed a fluctuating equilibrium at 32% females. The presence in males of X chromosomes sensitive to the driving Y was not found to compromise fitness. The most sensitive X chromosomes to date are those of strain H1, isolated in this study. (iii) Effect of parental age on sex ratio in two isofemale lines derived from strain A425. This was assessed by dividing single-pair progenies into age bands corresponding to the order in which eggs were laid. Although there was variation in sex ratio between families, there was no statistical evidence that sex ratio was influenced by the age of the parents and there was no optimum parental age for producing highly distorted lines.

T1  - The evolution of growth rate in Sceloporus lizards: Environmental, behavioral, maternal, and genetic aspects
AN  - 303727138
AB  - I use comparative and experimental analysis to examine the causes of geographic variation in life history attributes of hatchling Sceloporus lizards. Mean clutch size among populations of Sceloporus occidentalis increased to the north (7 vs. 12 eggs/clutch; California vs Washington), whereas egg size decreased (0.65 g vs. 0.40 g). Among populations at different latitudes, egg incubation time was positively correlated with egg size, and juvenile growth rate was negatively correlated with hatchling size.    In Chapter 1, I analyze latitudinal and elevational patterns of egg life history characteristics among populations of Sceloporus occidentalis and experimentally manipulate egg size and hatchling size by removing yolk from eggs. Experimentally reduced eggs demonstrated (i) that some of the latitudinal differences in egg incubation were due to egg size and (ii) that some of the differences in juvenile growth rate between high- and low-elevation populations in California were due to egg size, but that some were due to genetic differences in growth. (iii) In contrast, differences in growth rate among populations at different latitudes were largely due to genetic differences in growth rate and not egg size.    In Chapters 2 and 3, I examine the contribution of thermal environment and thermal preference to variation in growth rate in Sceloporus hatchlings. I reared hatchlings from a northern and southern population of S. occidentalis in a cycling thermal regime in one of three experimental treatments differing in access to radiant heat. I also measured the thermal preference of each individual. Growth rate varied positively with duration of access to radiant heat. Within treatments, individual growth rate was positively correlated with preferred body temperature. Moreover, the difference in growth rate between northern and southern populations was due in part to evolved differences in thermal preference between populations--northern populations which grew more slowly had a lower thermal preference. Variation in thermal preference was associated with family membership, suggesting that thermal preference has a genetic basis. A laboratory study compared growth rate between two congeners from the same latitude, but different elevation in southern California (Sceloporus occidentalis (low elevation) and S. graciosus (high elevation).

T1  - Life histories, interspecific competition and regional distribution of three rockpool Daphnia species
AN  - 303715177
AB  - This dissertation is a study of the factors responsible for the regional distributions and dynamics of three coexisting Daphnia species in a patchy rockpool environment. It is focused mainly on the effects of interspecific competition. A combination of laboratory studies, long-term outdoor experiments and longterm observational studies has been used.    According to life-table studies in the laboratory D. pulex (de Geer) and D. magna (Straus) were more 'r-selected' than D. longispina (O. F. Muller), which showed life history traits customarily believed to be evolutionary responses to size-selective predation on larger individuals. Laboratory experiments showed relative competitive abilities in the species to vary with food density and temperature. The large D. magna was the better competitor under high-food conditions and at 15$\sp\circ$C, while the other small species were superior under low-food conditions at 20$\sp\circ$C.    Interspecific competition was studied in artificial rockpools for 4 years. Analysis of population dynamics and reproductive indices showed that interspecific competition was intense during substantial parts of the year. Rates of extinction were higher in three-species than in two-species experiments. Extinction rates also decreased with increasing water volume. Nonetheless, coexistence of two competing species for 4 years was the rule.    A review of competition experiments between cladocerans showed that none of the following hypotheses for competitive dominance among zooplankton had general support: the size-efficiency hypothesis, the r-max hypothesis, the 'low-food efficiency' hypothesis, and the hypothesis that small species are superior competitors. Single factors such as body size could not be used as general predictors of exploitative competitive ability. Many experiments showed varying outcomes under different environmental conditions, suggesting that the paradox of the plankton is a reality in many zooplankton communities.    Distributions of Daphnia spp. in rockpools in two areas on the west and one area of the east coast of Sweden were influenced by several factors, e.g. salinity, interspecific competition, unpredictable desiccation events, and most probably also predation.

T1  - Repression of transposable element activity in Drosophila melanogaster
AN  - 303685809
AB  - The regulation of transposable P element activity was examined in an M$\sp\prime$ strain of Drosophila melanogaster. This strain, called B 13, varied considerably in its ability to repress P element activity in hybrid offspring. Repression ability was evaluated by crossing B13 females to males from the $\pi\sb2$ strain and determining the degree of gonadal dysgenic (GD) sterility in their hybrid daughters. This measure of repression potential was found to be highly correlated with repression of P transposase activity. Forty inbred lines were derived from the B13 strain by 20 generations of sib mating. These lines varied from high to low repression potential, with an overall distribution similar to the base stock. Most of these lines retained considerable within-line variation which may have been caused in part by P transposase activity during inbreeding. A more detailed study of twelve inbred lines provided evidence that both maternal and zygotic effects contributed to the repression of GD sterility in hybrid females. The maternal inheritance of repression potential through two generations was demonstrated in six lines, indicating the involvement of cytoplasmic repression factors; however, in the remaining six lines these factors were not detectable. Molecular analyses demonstrated that most of the P elements in the twelve inbred lines were nonautonomous; there were estimated to be only 2 to 4 potentially complete elements out of at least 30 elements per genome. Few differences in P element composition were detected among lines with high, intermediate or low repression potential. Therefore, the large differences in repression ability may have been brought about by small changes in the number or location of repressor-producing P elements.

T1  - Ecology of the San Jose Scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock) (Homoptera:Diaspididae), and its Encarsia perniciosi (Howard) (Hymenoptera:Aphelinidae) parasitoid in North Carolina orchards
AN  - 303677413
AB  - Of the ten parasitoid species collected at an unsprayed experimental apple orchard in 1986 and 1987, and a sprayed commercial peach orchard in 1987, two species, Coccophagoides murtfeldtae (Howard) and Encarsia sp. were attracted to black traps significantly more than to other colors. Aphytis diaspidis (Howard) was attracted to yellow and black traps in significantly greater numbers than white at both orchards in 1987. Significantly greater numbers of E. perniciosi (Howard) were attracted to the combination of trap color plus San Jose scale (SJS) pheromone baited traps than to colored traps without pheromone indicating that SJS pheromone is a kairomone for the parasitoid. Data from constant temperature studies of E. perniciosi development were utilized to develop linear degree-day (DD) and nonlinear models of parasitoid development. Development from egg to adult stage with a five-temperature linear model for E. perniciosi reared in male and female hosts combined required 648 DD$\sb{-0.2}$, while 362 DD$\sb{9.9}$ were required with a three-temperature linear model. Simulations based on the linear and nonlinear models were validated by comparison with peaks of adult parasitoid activity in three orchards during 1986 and 1987. Data from constant temperature studies of SJS development were utilized to develop linear (DD) and nonlinear models of scale development. A three-temperature (555 DD$\sb{10.3}$) and a five-temperature (714 DD$\sb{7.8}$) linear model were developed to model SJS development from crawler to crawler and male to male, and a four-temperature (330 DD$\sb{9.4}$) linear model was developed to model development of SJS through the embryonic period. The models were most accurate at simulating the first generation male flight peak when the overwintering male peak was used as biofix, second generation crawlers when a first generation crawler peak was used as biofix, and the first generation crawlers using overwintering male peaks as a biofix. The inaccuracy of the models to simulate first-generation crawler peaks for the two orchard-year combinations is thought to be due to the coexistence of crawlers of the Forbes scale, Quadraspidiotus forbesi (Johnson), along with SJS crawlers. The ability of these models to forecast SJS phenological events in the F$\sb1$ and F$\sb2$ generations for accurate timing of postbloom applications of insecticide is discussed.

T1  - LABORATORY STUDIES ON THE REGULATION OF MIGRATION IN THE ORIENTAL ARMYWORM, MYTHIMNA SEPARATA (WALKER) (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE)
AN  - 303643652
AB  - The present study investigated two major aspects of adult life of the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, --pre-calling period and flight--in relation to the insect's migration.    Pre-calling period (emergence to first release of pheromone) of females of M. separata showed clear diurnal periodicity. They initiated their calling behaviour only in the second half of the scotophase. Onset of calling was correlated with the physiological progress of ovary maturation.    Substantial variation in pre-calling period was observed. Two lines were established in a selection experiment by inbreeding in the first generation of selection--an early-caller (EC) line calling on nights 2-4 (mode values) and a late-caller (LC) line calling on nights 6-9. Reciprocal crosses were carried out in the 6th generation and the results provide evidence of a sex-linked major gene effect so that the onset of calling in female offspring is determined by genes inherited from their male parent. Data from field-collected samples showed that moths which were the offspring of seasonal immigrants into northern areas had a higher proportion of late-callers than those from further south.    Pre-calling period was extended at low temperatures and by decreasing photoperiod from the pre-pupal stage to adult emergence. Some EC, but no LC females were able to achieve oocyte maturation without feeding.    Estimation of heritability of tethered flight duration (flight ability) by offspring-parent regression showed that only male offspring had a significant regression with their parents, which indicated the possible existence of sex-linkage or sex-limitation of this trait. Female moths from the EC line flew significantly less than those from the LC line on night 4 when the teneral stage is supposed to be over, although no such difference was found with males. Flight ability was reduced in females which had called compared with others of equivalent age which had not, showing a clear 'oogenesis-flight syndrome'.    The effects of larval phase on adult life were investigated. Neither flight ability nor lipid reserves were affected by larval density. However, larval phase did show a significant effect, though small, on pre-calling period (female from gregaria larvae called later). (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Inter- and intraspecific variation in introduced and native parasites (Hymenoptera:Aphidiidae) of the pea aphid in North America: Life history traits, thermal coefficients and morphology
AN  - 303640251
AB  - This study was a first attempt to investigate, a posteriori, the possible reasons for the continent-wide decline of Aphidius smithi Sharma & Subba Rao, an introduced parasite of the pea aphid in North America. Two hypotheses, among many possible, were tested. First, because A. smithi was established with small founder population, it was hypothesized that the resulting genetic impoverishment may have precluded its long-term establishment. To test this, divergence levels in quantitative characters among three populations each of two introduced species, A. smithi and Aphidius ervi Haliday, were compared with each other and with those among three populations of a native species, Praon pequodorum Viereck, to detect any evidence of random genetic drift. Second, because A. ervi rapidly became the dominant species of the pea aphid subsequent to the decline of A. smithi, the possibility of displacement due to difference in life history traits was tested.    Intraspecific studies indicated that the divergence level between populations of the two introduced species did not consistently differ from each other. But the distance between any two populations of the introduced species was consistently greater than that between corresponding populations of the native species in both life history and morphological traits, suggesting drift of alleles affecting these two characters. The results suggest the possibility of drift of other alleles which may have also contributed to the decline of A. smithi. The drift does not appear to have affected the establishment of A. ervi, probably because of larger and more diverse founder populations. In addition, A. ervi appears to possess a "general purpose" genotype as evidenced by its predominance of the parasite guild of aphids infesting alfalfa in a wide range of climates. Both these factors may have enabled it to overcome any deleterious effects on adaptation of random genetic drift.    Interspecific comparison of life history traits indicated that A. smithi is superior, or at least at no obvious disadvantage, relative to A. ervi, Aphidius pisivorus Smith or P. pequodorum. It had a higher fecundity, a shorter developmental time and generally performed better than any of the above species under the experimental conditions. This suggests that differential reproductive capacity and thermal coefficients did not contribute significantly to the decline of A. smithi. The protocol for the introduction, and the dynamics of the pea aphid parasites in North America, suggest a strong need for pre- and post-release studies on introduced biological control agents.

T1  - THE VIABILITY OF ENERGY PLANTATIONS IN THAILAND: AN ENERGY SYSTEM APPROACH USING ALTERNATIVE CONVERSION PATHWAYS
AN  - 303603547
AB  - Since the oil crisis in the mid 1970s and the recognition of impending fuelwood shortages in many developing countries, increased emphasis has been placed on the development of renewable energy sources such as biomass from energy plantations. As there has been considerable speculation regarding the economic attractiveness of energy plantations in developing countries, the objective of this thesis is to develop an approach to assess the viability of a hypothetical energy plantation in Northeast Thailand within a framework encompassing the price structure of alternative fuels.    An integrated energy system approach has been developed for this project. The approach is based on the premise that the value of plantation biomass is not only based on the inherent properties of the feedstock but also on the efficiency and cost configurations of the energy conversion systems in which it is utilized. The approach encompasses a free standing plantation simulation model and an array of energy conversion technologies considered appropriate for a developing country. The energy conversion models used in the analysis account for the cost and heat content of alternative fuels and the scale, efficiency, cost configurations and fuel requirements of the conversion systems.    The integrated approach permitted observations to be made of the extent prices of traditional and modern fuels affect the viability of energy plantations. When the value of plantation biomass was based on the price of fuelwood used for household cooking, the return on the plantation was unattractive. This finding illustrates a classic common property resource problem when the price of fuelwood from natural forests does not reflect the cost of growing wood or an impending fuelwood scarcity.    The highest internal rate of return on equity capital for an industrial end-use was 15.2% obtained from plantation biomass used for electric power generation. Findings from the project suggest that energy plantations could be a valuable component of a long term strategy to develop socially acceptable renewable energy projects in Thailand.

T1  - Kp element regulation of p-m hybrid dysgenesis in drosophila melanogaster
AN  - 301488595
AB  - Hybrid dysgenesis is the term given to a series of related germline abnormalities observed in the progeny of crosses between certain strains of Drosophila melanogaster. These abnormalities include temperature sensitive gonadal sterility, illicit male recombination, chromosomal rearrangements and increased mutation. The most intensely studied system of hybrid dysgenesis in this species, the P-M system, is caused by the mobilisation of members of the P family of transposable elements. However, P elements are not usually mobilised within strains due to the existence of a repression system termed the P cytotype. Cytotype involves a complex interaction between chromosomal P elements and the cytoplasm, and is inherited maternally.Analysis of the P elements in natural populations has shown that the P family is heterogeneous, consisting of conserved, autonomous elements and non-autonomous deletion derivatives. One particular deletion derivative, the KP element, is present in high copy number in D. melanogaster strains of diverse geographic origins and in this respect appears to be unique, other deletion derivatives generally being present in one or a few copies per genome. One strain which contains KP elements has been shown to possess intermediate levels of P regulation which, unlike P cytotype, is inherited chromosomally.I have engaged in a molecular and phenotypic analysis of natural populations and laboratory strains to test the possibility that KP elements are responsible for the chromosomally inherited regulation seen in strains which contain these elements.I conducted a survey of British D. melanogaster populations and have confirmed the generality of previous work. First, all British populations contain the KP element in high copy number, and secondly they exhibit intermediate levels of P regulation which is transmitted through both sexes.I have looked at the effect of chromosomes carrying KP elements on the evolution of lines where active P elements have been artificially introduced and have shown that a single chromosome can repress the phenotypic effects of P element movement. This repression is inherited chromosomally and the copy number of the KP element increased in lines which possessed this repression.Using the same experimental design I have analysed the effect of a single KP element on the evolution of such lines. Those lines initially containing one KP element show little evidence of P element movement after 10 to 12 generations. The repression observed in lines with KP elements is inherited through both sexes and Southern analysis of these lines shows that during the evolution of this repression the copy number of the KP element increased at least 20 fold. Control lines, without KP elements, developed the P cytotype. This result is fully consistent with a KP element model of P regulation but inconsistent with other currently available models.Returning to the analysis of natural populations I have concentrated on Q strains. Q strains appear to be neutral in the P-M system in that they possess strong regulation but are not capable of inducing the most extreme traits of hybrid dysgenesis. American Q strains are known to possess the P cytotype mode of regulation, but many Q strains contain multiple copies of the KP element. This implies that all Q strains do not possess P cytotype and I have analysed the inheritance of P regulation in Q strains to test this. Extensive qualitative variation exists in the inheritance patterns; all Q strains with KP elements inherit some, or all, of their P regulation chromosomally whereas three out of four Q strains studied which lack KP elements inherit their regulation entirely maternally.These results, taken as a whole, strongly suggest that the KP element is responsible for a second system of P regulation which is distinct from P cytotype. Thus, the geographical distribution of the KP element can be explained by natural selection favouring this element d

T1  - The life-history strategies of two species of stream-dwelling freshwater snails.
AN  - 301450979
AB  - The objectives of this study were to observe the life-cycles of freshwater snails from different populations and use the results to test a prediction of the Sibly-Calow (1985) life-history model; that where conditions for juvenile growth are good, the animal should produce smaller offspring. Two species of snail were studied, five populations of Theodoxus fluviatilis and seven populations of Ancylus fluviatilis, between 1984 and 1986. Theodoxus was found to have a biennial semelparous life cycle in all cases. The life cycle of Ancylus was also semelparous, but the number of generations per year varied between site and year and was related quite strongly to temperature. The Sibly-Calow model assumes a negative relationship between fecundity and hatchling size. However a positive correlation was found between fecundity and offspring size in both species when comparing different populations. This rules out a straightforward application of the model to data derived from different populations. Theodoxus hatchling size varied significantly between sites and a negative trend was found between hatchling size and juvenile growth rates in accordance with the naive predictions of the Sibly-Calow model. In Ancylus significant differences were found in egg-capsule size, number of hatchlings per capsule and hatchling size between sites and years. A negative trend was apparent between hatchling size and growth rate from dif_erent populations. Comparisons between different generations of Ancylus were made in a small chalk stream with a dense population of Ancylus that went through five generations during the study. No relationship was found between fecundity and hatchling size or hatchling size and juvenile growth rate. However a significant positive correlation was found between hatchling size and parental growth rate. These results contradict the predictions of the Sibly-Calow model. The relationship of log10 snail length against log10 body weight and log10 shell weight was also investigated. The regression coefficients for both body and shell weight were constant within a species. The body weight intercepts varied significantly between sites and seasons for Ancylus, although no consistent pattern emerged, but not for Theodoxus. Little variation was found in the intercepts for shell weight in either species.

T1  - The impact of hydrocarbon pollution on meiobenthic production within an estuarine mud-flat.
AN  - 301381475
AB  - This thesis describes the effect on the production ecology of the meio-fauna resulting from the discharge of effluents by British Petroleum subsidiaries, onto the mud-flats at Kuineil in the Firth of Forth. The effluents contain hydrocarbons, and other organic and inorganic chemicals, and exert a high B.O.D. and C.O.D. loading on the surrounding mud-flats.Three stations were selected for routine meiofaunal sampling, at approximately the same tidal level, between MTL and MHWS. Analysis of the physico-chemical qualities of the sediments showed a gradient in sediment aliphatic hydrocarbon concentrations, and in the depth of the Redox Potential Discontinuity from station A (most polluted) to station C (least polluted). The sediments at stations A and C were poorly-sorted muds, and that at station B a poorly-soited muddy-sand. A sinusoidal model was fitted to observed water temperature data in order to correct laboratory derived growth rates to field temperatures.Routine sampling for meiofauna, was conducted on fourteen occasions from April 1984 to April 1985, using 5.5cm2 sawn off syringes. Eight samples were then pooled and a sub-sample of appropriate size taken using a low cost sub-sampling device described. This technique was shown to give higher precision in determining mean abundances than from single cores, for a given expenditure of effort.Nematode body masses were estimated using species specific predictive regression equations relating maximum body width to volume. The relative precision and cost, of alternative methods of determining nematode body mass from geometric figures was investigated.Laboratory culture of the dominant meiobenthic copepods was conducted in order to identify the naupliar stages. The gross morphology of the nau-plii of Stenhelia palustris, Amphiascoides limicola, Platychelipus littoral is, Nannopus palustris, Mesochra lilljeborgi and Microarthridion fallax is described. The Belehradek function D = a.(T-a)b relating development times D (nauplius to nauplius) to temperature T, was fitted to availablegrowth data for M. lilljeborgi (D = 132O.(T - 2)-l-0&), and A. limicola {D = 334.(T -3)-°&7g). The predicted generation times for M. lilljeborgi are longer than literature values, suggesting that culture conditions may be limiting.A simple developmental model assuming constant proportional increase in mass at each moult except for egg/Nl and N6/C1, has been developed in order to predict the masses of the developmental stages of the common species of harpacticoid copepods, from literature values for adult and egg weights. The model was validated by fitting to literature data.A marked seasonality was observed in the abundance of virtually all species at all stations. At the most polluted station (station A) there is a severe depression of the abundance of both nematodes and copepods in late summer and early winter. At the station receiving intermediate pollutant loadings (station B) densities are enhanced during the early summer period. Despite the seasonality, Detrended Correspondence analysis (ordination) reveals that the principal source of variation in the species composition is explained by the spatial axis. Station B was faunistically more similar to station A than to station C. This pattern was not revealed by trends in species richness. Shannon- Wiener diversity and Pielou evenness. The ordination identified Diplolaimella ocellata and Monhystera disjuncta as characteristic of station A. D. ocellata attained very high dominance at this station in late summer. Tripyloides spp., Hypodontolaimus balticus, Daptonema spp., Mesochra lilljeborgi, Platychelipus littoralis attained their maximum abundance at station B; and Ptycholaimellus ponti-cus, Sabatieria pulchra, Atrochromadora microlaima, Sphaerolaimus spp., Stenhelia palustris and Amphiascoides limicola at station C.Production figures were derived for the dominant nematode species using P/B ratios of 8.4 (Warwick and

T1  - Yield stability in cowpea as influenced by five drought resistance mechanisms
AN  - 303656525
AB  - Cowpeas, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., are considered relatively drought resistant as compared to other grain crops, yet substantial seed yield reductions in response to drought stress, especially during reproductive development, are commonly observed. Among the many mechanisms studied in grain crops, 5 drought adaptive or resistance mechanisms have been hypothesized to play key roles in maintaining seed yield in grain legumes under drought including, earliness of reproductive development, greater partitioning of dry matter to developing seeds, longer pod-filling period, longer duration of viable (green) canopy during pod-filling, and maintenance of moderate to high levels of N$\sb2$ fixation during late pod-filling.    The purpose of this investigation was to identify high-yielding cowpea genotypes with superior seed yield stability under both dryland and irrigated conditions, and to determine whether genotypes which expressed superior seed yield stability utilized one or more of the 5 drought-adaptive mechanisms associated with leguminous species.    Field experiments were conducted using either 20 or 14 genetically diverse, indeterminate, cowpea genotypes under both dryland and irrigated conditions. Intraspecific variability for maintenance of seed yield potential during drought was observed. Genotypes identified as drought resistant initiated reproductive growth earlier, and partitioned larger quantities of dry matter earlier and more rapidly than drought-sensitive genotypes, but the duration of the pod-filling period was similar in all genotypes. Furthermore, resistant genotypes produced smaller green and total canopy areas as compared to susceptible genotypes, but maintained a higher percentage of green leaf area late in the pod-filling period. Moderate drought stress was sufficient to inhibit N$\sb2$ fixation activity in all genotypes.    Separate greenhouse experiments were conducted in two successive years to determine whether 2 F$\sb7$ lines, produced by repeatedly selecting for differential maintenance of larger green canopy area, expressed higher pod yield under warm, dry conditions as compared to plants which displayed normal leaf senescence. Nonsignificant differences between selected and normally senescing genotypes suggested that maintenance of green canopy did not improve pod yield response in any treatment combination.

T1  - EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE LIFE CYCLE OF MELOIDOGYNE CHITWOODI RACES 1 AND 2 AND M. HAPLA ON RUSSET BURBANK POTATO
AN  - 303631276
AB  - Meloidogyne chitwoodi race 1 (MC1) had a wider optimal temperature range for penetration of Russet Burbank potato roots than M. chitwoodi race 2 (MC2) or M. hapla (MH). MC1 penetrated roots best at 18, 24 and 30 C; MC2 at 24 and 30 C; and MH at 30 C. The minimum temperature for penetration by MC1 and MC2 appears to be between 3 and 6 C. Penetration by MH was variable at 6 C.    MC1 took 93, 54, 39 and 42 days or 651, 702, 741 and 1,050 degree days (DD); MC2 95, 59, 39 and 39 days or 665, 767, 741 and 975 DD; and MH 106, 72, 44 and 35 days or 212, 576, 616 and 700 DD to complete their life cycles (second stage juvenile (J2) to J2), respectively, at 12, 18, 24 and 30 C. None were able to complete their life cycles at 6 C in 115 days. MC2 had a wider temperature range for development to females than MC1 or MH. Optimum temperature for reproduction at the end of the first generation for MC races was between 12-24 C and for MH 30 C.    Embryonic development for free eggs of MC1 and MC2 required 55, 24 and 13 days at 12, 18 and 24 C, respectively, and MH 60, 26 and 15 days. None were able to complete embryogenesis at 6 C. A higher percentage of MC1 and MC2 eggs hatched at 12 to 24 C than MH, and vice versa at 30 C. The optimum for hatch appeared to be 18 and 24 C for all three nematodes. Similar results were obtained with egg masses, except that the MC races appeared to hatch at 6 and 30 C.    Based on a 180 day growing season, MC1 and MH were able to complete approximately 3.2 and 2.8 generations, respectively, on Russet Burbank potato in field microplots.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF WAVE ACTION ON THE BIOLOGY OF THE INTERTIDAL SNAIL NUCELLA LAPILLUS
AN  - 303581426
AB  - Nucella lapillus is a widely distributed intertidal gastropod that exhibits remarkable variability in morphology, physiology and life history traits among populations differentially exposed to wave action. This work explores the ecological and evolutionary factors responsible for generating this variation. I quantified patterns of life history variation among populations. Exposed shore individuals grew slower, terminated growth at a smaller size, suffered higher mortality rates primarily in the larger size classes, became sexually mature at a smaller size, produced more but smaller offspring and devoted more energy to reproduction. Juvenile and adult whelks reciprocally transplanted between an exposed and protected shore or reared on specific diets in the laboratory indicated that depressed growth on exposed coasts reflects reduced foraging time imposed by high wave energies.    Nucella lapillus on wave swept shores produced a larger foot and required a greater force to dislodge. The difference in tenacity was strictly a function of pedal surface area. Pedal surface area did not differ among populations as hatchlings emerged from egg capsules or when reared in the laboratory suggesting variation between morphs does not represent genetic differentiation. Both exposed and protected morphs reared intertidally produced a larger foot than those from the laboratory suggesting that foot morphology is plastic. A reciprocal transplant experiment confirmed this notion, but revealed an asymmetry in the plasticity that parallel a possible asymmetry in the risks of acclimating to a temporally unpredictable environmental cue.    Shell color of N. lapillus also varied with wave exposure. Populations on protected shores were monomorphically white while those on more exposed coasts were highly polymorphic and varied from predominantly brown to predominantly white. I conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated (1) physiological stress during periods of tidal emersion were greater on protected shores, (2) under similar natural conditions brown morphs heated up faster, attained higher temperatures, desiccated more rapidly and suffered greater mortality, and (3) shell color did not influence mortality on the exposed shore or in shaded microhabitats on the protected shore, but brown morphs suffered much greater mortality in sunny microhabitats on the protected shore. Therefore, interpopulation variation in shell color is in part a response to a selective gradient in physiological stress. Selection for crypsis by visually hunting predators did not appear to play a prominent role.

T1  - Aspects of the ecology of lizards of the genus Liolaemus in the central Chilean cordillera
AN  - 303573261
AB  - The ecology of ten species of iguanid lizards in the genus Liolaemus was studied on three elevational transects in the central Chilean Andes, from 1500m-3000m el, to determine the causal factors setting distribution limits. Detailed data on thermal biology and parasite influences are presented here, as well as some information on the effects of microhabitat availabilities, congeneric competitors, and other factors. The lack of association between lizard thermal tolerance and elevation suggests that these temperature relationships do not set distributional limits within the elevations of the study transects.    Some physical factors do influence the thermal biology of Liolaemus. Body mass determined thermal inertia, influencing rates of cooling and heating. Non mass-related differences in heating rates existed among the species: species at higher elevations heated more slowly. Larger body size and its consequent thermal inertia in part determine diel activity periods, with smaller individuals active earlier and larger individuals active later. The cooler temperatures at higher elevations did not produce interspecific differences in body temperature, but most high elevation species showed an intraspecific decrease in body temperature with elevation. Species differed in mean field body temperatures, but the range of means (33$\sp\circ$C to 35.5$\sp\circ$C) was slight and there was no relationship of mean field body temperature to either elevational distribution or microhabitat selected.    Some thermal factors that the lizards experience (e.g., higher body temperatures of the darkly colored male L. nigroviridis) may result from the interplay of biophysical effects with other forces, such as sexual selection effects of social structure. Reproductive consequences of broadened activity periods on gestation appear to influence activity patterns. Some species of lizard selected microhabitats which increased length of activity times, choosing in the evenings rock substrates which held heat after air temperatures dropped. Thermal relationships appear to set upper limits on egg-laying species that cannot successfully reproduce at high elevations, where only live bearing species are found.    There is no evidence of malarial infestation of the lizards, ticks are almost absent, and mites do not increase at the distributional limits of the lizards. Thus, these parasites apparently play no role in setting lizard distributional limits. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.)

T1  - Investigation of the financial viability of a combined power with district heating scheme for Sheffield.
AN  - 301474665
AB  - The City of Sheffield was one of the nine lead cities investigated by the consultants W.S. Atkins on behalf of the Government to assess the feasibility of combined heat and power with district heating, CHP/DH. In July 1982 the results of the study were published by W.S. Atkins in their `CHP/DH Feasibility Programme: Stage, 1, Summary Report and Recommendations for the Department of Energy'. The case for a combined heat and power with district heating scheme for Sheffield was found to be marginal, with a real internal rate of return (I.R.R.) of 4.8%, compared with an internal rate of return of 5% or over, which the Government requires for Nationalised Industries investment.Sheffield City Council decided to make further investigations in order to improve the profitability of their scheme. This report forms part of that work, being an investigation into its financial analysis.The W.S. Atkins financial analysis was examined manually and then reproduced in a computer program. The results were in adequate agreement with those of W.S. Atkins.This program was then used to perform a sensitivity analysis on the scheme which included variations not considered by W.S. Atkins in their reports. The variables considered listed in decreasing order of effect were fuel prices, discount rate, start-up date of scheme, scheme length, lifespan of capital items, D.H.S. labour and rates costs.The financial profitability of the scheme was especially sensitive to changes in fuel prices. An increase of only 20% in fuel prices resulted in an increase in the I.R.R. of 38% over the base case value. Changes in fuel prices could prove the deciding factor in the success or otherwise of the scheme. As fuel prices rise in the future when fuel resources become less readily available and of restricted use, the case for a CHP/DH scheme will substantially increase.In Scandinavia similar schemes are thought of as low risk investments, but in the United Kingdom the investment is required to come from the private sector where it is considered to be of high risk and low profitability.The different criteria for investment in electricity generation in nationalised industry to that for investment in CHP/DH for cities can result in a misallocation of resources which can only be corrected by government policy.

T1  - DIFFERENTIAL PREDATION UPON EMBRYOS AND LARVAE OF TEMPERATE PACIFIC ECHINODERMS
AN  - 251747545
AB  - A fundamental premise of benthic marine invertebrate life history theory asserts that energetic costs associated with lecithotropic and brooding modes of development are offset by decreased rates of mortality during periods of embryo and larval development. These energetic tradeoffs are presumably the basis for the evolution of dichotomous modes of development among several invertebrate taxa, and they provide the foundation for an inverse correlation between fecundity and offspring survivorship.    In this thesis, I describe a series of experimental observations to test the hypothesis that rates of embryo and larval mortality are inversely correlated with initial egg size and mode of development. Tests of hypotheses rely primarily upon comparisons made in the laboratory among echinoderm larvae from the Pacific Northwest. The life history patterns and differential susceptibility of planktotrophic and lecithotrophic larvae to predation by carnivorous zooplankton support the size-mortality hypothesis, although stage-specific differences in embryo and larval susceptibility were found to vary substantially among species with planktotrophic and lecithotrophic modes of development. Microcosm feeding experiments demonstrate stage-specific differences in the susceptibility of echinoderm embryos and larvae to predation by carnivorous zooplankton. The occurrence of similar stage-specific susceptibility curves among phyletically divergent types of echinoderm larvae, and among different types of predatory zooplankton, allow predator-prey interactions to be assessed at a functional-group level that recognizes five distinct patterns of larval susceptibility. The fixed shapes of stage-specific susceptibility curves at various temperatures suggests that cumulative losses of embryos and larvae to predation are directly related to rates of larval development in nearshore waters.    Ontogenetic changes in the behavior of echinopluteus larvae can be an effective deterrent to predation by brachyuran zoeae. In contrast, the swimming behavior of asteroid larvae increased their probability of capture by two species of benthic suspension feeders. These investigations highlight the importance of larval behavior at low Reynolds numbers. Differences in the field distribution of juvenile asteroids, coupled with information from zooplankton tows and laboratory feeding and substratum selection experiments, support the hypothesis that communities of benthic suspension-feeders can influence the survivorship of echinoderm larvae during settlement.

T1  - The biology of larval and juvenile Nephrops norvegicus (L.) in the Firth of Clyde
AN  - 2157371410
AB  - In Scotland over the past 30 years the Nephrops fishery has expanded and is now the largest in Europe with landings in 1986 valued at over £29m. Much of the species biology is poorly understood, especially the early life history. The biology of larval and juvenile Nephrops is the subject of this thesis and the work reported has been conducted on Nephrops within the Firth of Clyde. Because Nephrops incubate their eggs externally (on their pleopods) they suffer progressive egg loss. Creels were set to capture ovigerous females incubating eggs at various stages of development to provide fecundity data and egg samples for a study of the biochemical changes associated with embryonic development. During the incubation period mean egg loss was estimated as 18 percent . Almost a fifth of the population were judged to have suffered additional egg loss, probably at the moment of spawning. Estimation of the mean number of eggs hatched per female per year took such losses into account and involved the use of length frequency information and a maturity ogive. The best estimate of the fecundity range was 985 - 1115 eggs hatched per female, which includes an allowance for the proportion of the population that may be biennial spawners. Lipids are the principal energy reserve utilized during embryonic development and full development requires 6 - 7 joules per egg. Most energy is expended during the later stages of development and is associated with a rapid uptake of water and salts. An aquaculture facility was developed and newly hatched larvae were reared under different culture conditions. Survival was found to be better in isolation compared to mass rearing conditions and initial periods of starvation in excess of 1 - 2 days led to an increase in mortality. Larvae were reared over a temperature range of 8 - 20 C and relationships were derived between temperature and the rate of larval development for each zoeal stage. The development time increased for successive zoeal stages at each temperature and 16 C seemed to be the overall optimum temperature for development. A larval survey programme was conducted in the Lower Firth of Clyde (L.F.C.) to investigate temporal and spatial changes in larval abundance. The larval abundance data were used in conjunction with the temperature information obtained in the laboratory study to obtain a seasonal production estimate for the 1st zoeal stage of 177 x 108 larvae within the 876 square kilometres sampling area. This value, when used in conjunction with the mean number of eggs hatched per female per year, gave an estimate of 15.87 x 106 to 17.97 x 106 females for the L.F.C. spawning stock. Information on the vertical distribution of Nephrops zoeae was obtained over two 24h cycles, one coincided with a spring and the other with a neap tidal period. The distribution of the larvae was related to several environmental variables and compared with the light and pressure responses demonstrated under controlled laboratory conditions, 1st, 2nd and early 3rd stage zoeae demonstrated positive phototaxis and high barokinesis. No dramatic diel changes were detected in the vertical distribution of the larvae. Most remained between 6 to 38m depth during daylight hours. A limited nocturnal ascent resulted in peak larval abundance shifting from 16 to 5m depth. Shortly after dawn the larvae descended to their daytime distribution. Depth regulation is probably achieved by light and pressure sensitivity and may be influenced by the position of the pycnocline. During the 3rd zoeal stage the light response changed from photopositive to photonegative and Nephrops may first come into contact with the sea bed towards the end of this stage. Substratum selection and settlement behaviour experiments were conducted with early postlarval stages and these suggested that the 1st postlarval stage is a transitional form between the planktonic and benthic environments.

T1  - Studies on the pollution ecology of the freshwater isopod asellus aquaticus
AN  - 898761236
AB  - A comparative study of five populations of the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus was carried out between 1983-1985. Four sites were geographically close and one more distant; they differed in their water quality. Each sampling station exhibited different water quality from the others. At the five stations investigations were made of selected physicochemical parameters: oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity, hardness, phosphate, chloride; levels of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in the water were also estimated. Changes in the invertebrate fauna and Asellus populations were monitored monthly. For Asellus the sex ratio, life cycle, fecundity, relationships between body size and body weight, body length and the number of flagellar articles in the antennae, body size of ovigerous females and egg number (including the marsupial stages of development) were examined in detail. It was found that population structure varied significantly between clean, moderate and polluted stations even though some of them were geographically close. Significant differences were found between the stations regarding the population density, species diversity and the relationship between body size/dry weight, body size/egg number, body size/number of flagellar articles in the antennae. For example, asellids from clean stations usually had a body size and dry weight greater than the asellids from polluted or moderately polluted stations. The number of flagellar articles increased markedly at the maturity moult. Leading on from the field study which showed that water quality has a significant effect on the biology of A. aquaticus, laboratory experiments were carried out over a relatively long period to assess the effects of various environmental parameters, i.e. zinc, conductivity, temperature and light regimes on the life history, growth, fecundity and survival. Long-term (12 months) exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of zinc were found to slow the life cycle down and decrease fecundity and body weight. Tissue analysis revealed heavy body burdens of zinc. Exposure to low and high levels of conductivity also slowed down the life cycle and decreased fecundity and body weight. The optimum conductivity appeared to be 750<IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/mu.gif">S, whilst the optimum temperature was 13oC. Surprisingly the light regime also affected body size, larger individuals resulting in the 16h dark/8h light experiments. In addition, the effect of additional heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Cd) were selected for short period experiments on the survival of Asellus aquaticus. Juveniles were found to be more sensitive than adults to all factors. The effect of predation by Gammarus tigrinus on Asellus aquaticus was also examined. In order to determine whether or not the structure of the exoskeleton of A. aquaticus was being affected by water quality, this structure was examined using steroscan electron microscopy. Plaques were found on the surface of asellids from long-term zinc experiments which may help to explain the survival of asellids despite their apparent high burden of zinc. (D73079/87)

T1  - GENETIC VARIATION IN THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON LIFE HISTORY TRAITS AND ADAPTATION TO THERMALLY HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS BY TROPICAL MILKWEED BUGS (ONCOPELTUS) (GENOTYPE-BY-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION, FASCIATUS)
AN  - 303483233
AB  - Strains of the Large Milkweed Bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), descended from two Costa Rican populations in habitats with distinctively different thermal regimes show differences in life-history traits when they are reared in the same constant conditions. They also differ in the effects of temperature differences on six of eight life-history traits studied. The traits contribute to all of the major components of fitness (survival, fecundity, and rate of development). When considered in light of the effects of these differences on the intrinsic rate of increase (r) at different temperatures, the results indicate that local adaptation has occurred, even though the same life-history traits (e.g., high fecundity) are favored by natural selection across all thermal habitats in this colonizing species. The results suggest that different genotypes confer the favored traits in different environments.    Strains of a closely-related species, Oncopeltus cingulifer, from the same sites show no evidence of overall life-history adaptation to local temperatures. In contrast to the widely-distributed O. fasciatus, O. cingulifer is an exclusively tropical species. It is argued that O. cingulifer lacks genetic variation that is sufficiently organized to permit rapid adaptation to cool habitats.    When families of sisters (full-sibs) of O. fasciatus are divided and reared at two different temperatures, the families differ in their life-history responses to temperature differences. The finding of statistically significant family-by-temperature interactions indicates that the species harbors genetic variation for "temperature specialists." There is no evidence of an adaptive acclimation response to rearing temperature in O. fasciatus.    The results are discussed in terms of a simple solution to the paradox of high heritabilities for life-history traits in natural populations in spite of strong uniformly directional selection on these traits. If different alleles at some loci confer the favored traits in different environments, then local adaptation will result in genetically-based life-history variation across environments. Gene flow between habitats could preserve genetic variation affecting life-history characters within populations.

T1  - EFFECTS OF SELECTED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND CHEMICAL ECOLOGY OF PLANT TRICHOMES ON TOMATO SUITABILITY FOR KEIFERIA LYCOPERSICELLA (WALSINGHAM)
AN  - 303470512
AB  - Tomato pinworm (TPW), Keiferia lycopersicella (Walsingham), growth and survival were studied at selected temperatures from 11-41(DEGREES)C. Developmental time from egg to adult ranged from 118.4 days at 14(DEGREES)C to 18.6 days at 35(DEGREES)C. Lower thermal thresholds were determined by extrapolation from linear regression lines for egg and larval stages. Pupal development was not linear and no lower threshold was estimated. TPW survival and development were also studied on three selected maturity stages of tomato foliage and fruit.    Delayed larval development, higher mortality, and reduced leaf consumption by TPW were observed on two wild tomatoes, Lycopersicon hirsutum (LA 361) and L. hirsutum f. glabratum (PI 134417), when compared with the commercial variety, L. esculentum cv. VFN 7718. The exudate of type VI trichomes of these wild accessions provided significant antibiotic effects against neonate larvae of TPW. Basal cells of type VI trichomes and other epidermal cells as well as most of the palisade mesophyll cells of PI 134417 were not consumed by TPW larvae. Similar results were not evident for LA 361 and VFN 7718.    Two normal odd-chained keones, 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone, and one unknown sesquiterpene, comprised approximately 95% of the contents of a gland of PI 134417. In a closely related species, LA 361, two unknown insecticidal sesquiterpenes accounted for 6% of the gland contents. Additionally, small amounts of one unknown monoterpene and another unknown sesquiterpene were found in type VI glands of VFN 7718. Bioassays comparing the gland exudate and isooctane extracts of glands to neonate larvae of TPW and Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) indicated that:  (1) 2-tridecanone and 2-undecanone were the major insecticidal compounds in PI 134417, (2) the two unknown sesquiterpenes in LA 361 were acutely toxic to both species and, (3) gland contents in the VFN 7718 provided only a physical barrier to TPW and were not detrimental to S. exigua. In topical bioassay of synthetic 2-tridecanone and 2-undecanone (3:1) demonstrated potentiation. Concentrations of these chemicals decreased as trichomes aged. Quantities of insecticidal chemicals and density of type VI trichomes varied with plant age and location within plants.

T1  - LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF THE PINE SCALE, CHIONASPIS HETEROPHYLLAE COOLEY, AND THE PINE NEEDLE SCALE, CHIONASPIS PINIFOLIAE (FITCH) (ILLINOIS, INDIANA, KENTUCKY, MICHIGAN)
AN  - 303432913
AB  - Life histories of the Pine Scale, Chionaspis heterophyllae Cooley, and the Pine Needle Scale, C. pinifoliae (Fitch) (Homoptera:Diaspididae), were determined on separate plantings of Scots Pine, Pinus sylvestris. Although both species were bivoltine and overwintered primarily as eggs, a portion of the population for each species completed a partial third generation, overwintering as mated adult females. C. heterophyllae general seasonal development and summer crawler emergence preceeded that of C. pinifoliae. Blooming of Spiraea x vanhouttei and pollen release of P. sylvestris coincided with spring crawler activity, while Cotinus coggygria and Campsis radicans were blooming as summer crawlers emerged. Accumulation of 250-270 heat units (base 50 F) had occurred before crawlers emerged in the spring and 1330-1470 heat units accumulated prior to summer emergence. C. pinifoliae settled preferentially on the concave needle surface on P. sylvestris, whereas C. heterophyllae settled on concave and convex surfaces. The male:female ratio was 40:60 for C. pinifoliae and 25:75 for C. heterophyllae. Fecundity estimates of first (ca. 25 eggs/female) and second (ca. 55 eggs/female) generation were the same for both scale species. Natural enemies were listed with estimates of percent predation or parasitism and pertinent biological observations.    National host ranges and geographic distributions were recorded. A new host record for C. heterophyllae was Picea abies and new state records of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Michigan were discussed.    Prepupal, pupal and adult male descriptions for C. heterophyllae and C. pinifoliae were made studying materials from several areas of the United States. Scales were determined to be in two distinct morphological groups, C. pinifoliae males being larger than those of C. heterophyllae. Adult males of both species were smaller when feeding on Pinus mugo than when on P. sylvestris. Presence of individuals with 8-segmented antennae and absence of wingless males distinguished C. heterophyllae and C. pinifoliae from other described Chionaspis species.

T1  - CLASSICAL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF THE FILBERT APHID, MYZOCALLIS CORYLI (GOETZE) (HOMOPTERA: APHIDIDAE) IN WESTERN OREGON
AN  - 303426510
AB  - A classical biological control project was undertaken against the filbert aphid, Myzocallis coryli (Goetze), in western Oregon. Hazelnut orchards in Spain, France, and Italy were searched for natural enemies of the aphid, and a parasitic wasp, Trioxys pallidus Haliday, was imported, quarantined, mass-reared, and released in Oregon orchards.    The wasp successfully attacks and completes its development on the Oregon race of the filbert aphid. A greenhouse culture of the parasitoid has been maintained continuously for over 50 generations, and approximately 30,000 adult wasps have been released in the Willamette Valley. Overwintering survival has been documented in at least eight different locations. In three commercial orchards, the parasitoids reduced aphid populations by 26-32%.    The newly imported biotype of T. pallidus attacking the filbert aphid was compared with the previously established biotype attacking the walnut aphid. The two races are morphologically indistinguishable, and were shown to freely hybridize in reciprocal crosses, producing viable, fertile offspring. However, the races showed distinct differences in host suitability, with the newly imported biotype having greater reproductive success on filbert aphids than the previously established (walnut) biotype.    Bionomics of both M. coryli and T. pallidus were studied in the laboratory. Data indicate a higher developmental threshold for overwintering parasitoid pupae (7.4(DEGREES)C.) than for overwintering aphid eggs (3.3(DEGREES)C.). Based on a common threshold of 6.0(DEGREES)C., thermal requirements for time-to-adult are ca. 240 and 265 degree days for summer generations of aphids and parasitoids, respectively. Diapause termination in aphids is more strongly influenced by winter chilling than is diapause termination in parasitoids.

T1  - BIONOMICS OF MANTISPA VIRIDIS WALKER (NEUROPTERA: MANTISPIDAE) (SPIDERS, REARING, DISTRIBUTION)
AN  - 303410677
AB  - Field and laboratory studies were conducted from 1982 through 1986 in the Clemson area of South Carolina to investigate the biology of Mantispa viridis Walker (Neuroptera: Mantispidae). These studies documented the developmental biology of this species from egg to adult, female egg production, adult mating behavior and survival, spider host associations, adult and immature seasonal cycles, and overwintering stages. In addition, laboratory procedures and techniques were developed to rear and maintain colonies of this and two other mantispid species, M. pulchella (Banks) and M. interrupta Say.    Development from egg to adult averaged 33.2 d under laboratory conditions of 25(DEGREES)C, 80% RH, and 16L:8D photoperiod. Both fresh and freezer-stored eggs of 27 spider species distributed in 14 families proved nutritionally adequate to rear M. viridis from the first instar to adult.    Mated, laboratory-reared females (n = 3) produced an average of 59.3 (+OR-) 3.8 egg clutches during their lifetime, with 23 (+OR-) 3.2 of these containing fertile eggs. Egg production of mated females decreased when fertile eggs were no longer produced, but this lower fecundity level remained higher than that of unmated females. Male M. viridis possess two pairs of eversible glands located in the third and fourth abdominal segments. These are everted during the precopulatory mating sequence and appear to be related to pheromone production. Adults (n = 28) reared from spider egg sacs and maintained under laboratory conditions lived for an average of 156 (+OR-) 8.1 d.    Field-collected immatures of M. viridis were associated with 21 spider genera representing 13 families. The majority of the species host records (n = 23) were from the spider superfamilies Araneoidea and Clubionoidea. Immatures of M. viridis were associated with egg sacs of nine spider species on more than one occasion. Two of these, Metepeira labyrinthea (Hentz) and Agelenopsis sp. accounted for 63% of the total (n = 125) M. viridis associations.    Field studies from 1982 through 1986 showed that all immature stages of M. viridis can overwinter, but that adults die during the first prolonged period of subfreezing temperatures. Immatures overwinter within the egg sac of their spider host and develop to the adult during the spring months. These individuals produced the first M. viridis generation for the year, which is followed by at least two others each season.

T1  - THE FIRST CELL CYCLE REORGANIZATION AT THE PERIPHERY OF FERTILIZED XENOPUS EGGS
AN  - 303394964
AB  - Specification of the amphibian dorso-ventral axis takes place in the period between fertilization and first cleavage when the grey crescent forms. In the course of grey crescent formation, the egg reorganizes its periphery by a movement for which conflicting descriptions have been given. The primary goal of this study was to reinvestigate the case of Xenopus eggs by imprinting one kind of fluorescent dye pattern (nile blue) onto the subcortical cytoplasm and another kind (fluorescein-lectin) onto the egg surface. When the egg surface is held fixed by embedding the egg in gelatin, two movements of the subcortical cytoplasm are observable during the first cell cycle: an overall rotation over an arc of $30\sp\circ$ of the subcortical cytoplasm relative to the egg surface, and, superimposed on the rotation, a convergence of the animal subcortical cytoplasm around the sperm entry point. In normal unembedded eggs, when the egg surface is free to move, it is the cortex that rotates $30\sp\circ$ relative to the subcortical cytoplasm, which remains stationary (except for the contraction in the animal hemisphere). The direction of rotation in the egg predicts the location of the embryonic axis better than does the site of sperm entry. I thus suggest that rotation, not convergence, specifies the embryo's prospective axis. I also give evidence that the important axis-specifying events are taking place in the vegetal hemisphere. A pharmacological study demonstrates the need for polymerized tubulin in movement generation. The need for actin filaments is still unclear. Using nonlethal treatments (UV irradiation, egg tilting, and cold) to artificially control the extent of rotation, I demonstrated an overall correlation, although quite variable, between the extent of movement in the vegetal hemisphere and the completeness of axial development. In all cases, no complete axis develops from an egg which underwent no rotation at all. Thus, rotation in the egg constitutes a cue, but does not generate precise instructions for subsequent development. If eggs are treated with ${\rm D\sb2 O}$ around time 0.3, rotation is reduced in extent. Yet, "hyperdorsal development" often follows. It is possible that ${\rm D\sb2 O}$ acts directly on the step cued by rotation.

T1  - Ecophysiological studies on freshwater gammarid crustaceans
AN  - 301445316
AB  - Gammarus tigrinus is a species of amphipoda introduced from North America where it inhabits estuaries. In the British Isles it is found in a wide range of habitats but not normally estuaries. It often occupies freshwaters with above average levels of conductivity. The ecology of Gammarus tigrinus from three sites at Attenborough Gravel Pits and from two sites at Brinsley (North Nottinghamshire) was studied from February 1983 to May 1984 and from July 1984 to July 1985 respectively. All five sites had above normal levels of conductivity, particularly those at Brinsley which were polluted by coal mining effluent. Initially densities of G. tigrinus were high at Attenborough but declined dramatically towards the end of 1983 for an unknown reason. At the five sites monthly measurements were made of water conductivity, temperature, oxygen, pH and heavy metals (zinc, lead, copper and cadmium). Monthly samples of Gammarus tigrinus were examined to assess the sex ratio, the ratio of various post-marsupial stages, the relation between body length and dry weight, the size classes and the number of articles on the antenna. It was found that the population structure varied significantly between the sites which exhibited different water quality. Breeding was found to start earlier in the year at Attenborough when compared with Brinsley; however, at all sites two generations per year were found. Significant differences were found between the sites with regard to population density and the relationship between body length and body dry weight. Gammarids of similar body length were found to be of a much lower dry weight at sites with abnormal water conductivity. In order to assess the extent of disappearance of G. tigrinus at Attenborough an extensive survey was undertaken of the gravel pits system. This revealed a very high diversity of species even in the waters of low quality indicating that other species had not been similarly affected. G. tigrinus was originally recorded from western and central England and a geographical survey in Nottinghamshire was undertaken to assess its spread eastwards. This indicated that the species is continuing to move across the country via rivers and canals. As water quality had been shown to have a significant effect on the biology of Gammarus tigrinus, laboratory investigations were carried out to assess the effects of total water quality, conductivity, temperature, pH and selected heavy metals on the survival, growth, respiration and osmoregulation of G. tigrinus. In some experiments comparison was made with another amphipod, Crangonyx pseudogracilis. All the experiments showed that increased conductivity, temperature and heavy metals (zinc, lead, copper, cadmium) affected the biology of these two species and may be involved in controlling their distribution. Food preference experiments showed that there was no relationship between the disappearance of G. tigrinus and the food sources in Attenborough. The effects of water quality and geographical location on the enzyme patterns of amphipods is currently a topical problem. The last section of this thesis describes results obtained by electrophoresis for a number of enzymes in Gammarus tigrinus collected from three sites of different water quality to see if differences could be detected. Comparisons were made with Crangonyx pseudogracilis and Gammarus pulex. (D71665/87)

T1  - Ecology and reproductive biology of acanthodactylus schmidti in central arabia
AN  - 301443380
AB  - The ecology and reproductive biology of Acanthodactylus schmidti (lacertidae) in Central Arabia north of Riyadh was studied from 1983 to 1985. The ecology of Acanthodactylus boskianus was also studied as a comparison during the same period. Growth of both species, survival and the morphological adaptations to the desert environment were examined. Home range size of both species was estimated in the study area. Home range size of male A. schmidti was four times that of the female's home range during spring. The male A. boskianus home range was about two times greater than that of the females. Utilization of home range and the social interactions of invdividuals of both species was investigated. Home range overlap, burrowing behaviour and burrow structure was also examined in the field. Male A. schmidti were observed to defend their home range against other males during spring. Activity and thermal ecology of both species was studied during winter and spring. Emergence behaviour, basking behaviour, daily and seasonal activity was studied and analysed. Both species were active throughout the year. However, it was found that during winter, activity was unimodal, which contrasted with the bimodal pattern during spring. The winter mean eccritic body temperature was 33.0 and 34.1oC for A. schmidti and A. boskianus respectively, and 36oC, 35.3oC during spring. A. schmidti was found to thermoregulate more effectively than A. boskianus during both winter and spring. Selected body temperature and critical minimum of both species were studied and measured in the laboratory. The reproductive biology of A. schmidti was studied in some detail. The reproductive season commenced in November and continued throughout May and was found to coincide with the rainy season of the area. Young lizards were observed between February and mid-June. This suggests the presence of multiple clutches (possibly 2-3) during the reproduction season. It was concluded that multiple clutches were an important adaptation for lizards in such an unpredictable desert environment. Reproductive behaviour, male and female reproductive cycle, and fat body cycle also were studied. Finally, the general ecology and conservation of Arabian desert reptiles is discussed and suggestions for management of desert reptile communities are suggested. (D73648/87)

T1  - Technical change and electricity generation and supply in great britain 1960-1980: with special reference to the evaluation of schemes for the combined production of electricity and heat
AN  - 1866260053
AB  - In interaction with the wider society and economy, technology and technological change can have major geographical impacts. One spatially significant technology was studied: the thermal production of electricity in Great Britain since c.1960. Analysis of the development and use of the dominant form of the technology, condensing generation, in the UK on an integrated, centralised public electricity supply system revealed that this was not a technically inevitable process but was influenced by the specific economic, social and behavioural context. A competing technology where useful heat is derived from generating plant as well as electricity has been widely used by industry, producing a less centralised pattern based on smaller turbines than the grid. Its lesser and declining importance is explained primarily by its economic viability for users. This is argued not to imply that CHP has abstractly inferior economics, because of differences between the criteria used by private industry to assess it and those used by the CEGB for condensing generation. Simulation exercises showed that, if analysed as a public sector investment, it was economically and technically viable to generate more electricity from CHP than currently. A variety of possible reductions in primary fuel use as a result of the higher thermal efficiency of CHP were estimated. The lack of public sector investment in CHP was explained in terms of the relative timing of the availability of fuel and technology and rapid growth of electricity demand, the CEGB's interpretation of the statutary definition of its role and the conflict produced with wider energy policy by the increased oil and decreased coal consumption produced by many CHP options. Theoretically, the analysis suggests that the spatial impact of technology cannot be analysed independently of the process of production and selection of technology from available alternatives. Technological change is argued not to be explicable in terms of simple mono-casual models that are widely used but to depend upon the interaction of social, technical, economic and behavioural factors.

T1  - Environmental and genetic factors regulating the breeding season of the vole
AN  - 1767378312
AB  - Photoperiod appeared to be the primary environmental factor regulating the rate of sexual maturation of field voles: long photoperiods promoted sexual development and short photoperiods caused gonadal inhibition. The testes of males placed in long photoperiods had a higher number of luteinizing hormone receptors than those of males placed in short photoperiods. The testosterone content was higher amongst males from long photoperiods than amongst those from short photoperiods, although testosterone concentrations did not differ. The effects of three other environmental factors were studied: The presence of a mature male vole increased the rate of sexual maturation of weanling females, probably through the effects of a pheromone produced by the male. There was some indication that the presence of a mature male decreased the rate of sexual maturation of weanling males. The protein content of the diet had little effect on the reproductive state of males or females, unless reduced to 4% , when growth was retarded and sexual maturation imhibited. Ambient temperature had no effect on the sexual development of female voles, and a slight, and varying, effect on the reproductive state of males. In general, the effect of each environmental factor appeared to be separate, a combination of factors producing additive, and not interactive, effects. The genotype of the vole influenced the rate of sexual maturation of the animals in long and short photoperiods. Effects of genotype were shown in two instances: Laboratory stock male and female field voles grew and matured sexually at a faster rate than the F1 generation of wild-caught animals (Wild F1) in long and short photoperiods. The testes of laboratory stock males had a higher testosterone content and concentration than those of Wild F1 males, from the age of 21<IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif">1 days. Selecting amongst the F1 generation of wild-caught animals for greater or lesser degrees of sexual development in a short photoperiod gave rise, in the next generation, to two distinct lines of voles, differing in their rates of sexual maturation and of growth in long and short photoperiods.

T1  - Aspects of reproduction and behaviour in the lizard (Chalcides ocellatus).
AN  - 898760532
AB  - The skink Chalcides ocellatus Forskal (1775) was used to study aspects of reproduction in vivaparous lizards. A technique of cardiac puncture was developed to obtain repeated samples from individuals. Hormone levels were determined using RIA giving a range of 0 to 34.9 ng ml-1 oestrone and 0 to 40.44 mg ml-1 progesterone. The anaesthetic ketamine hydrochloride was tested and used at a dose of 70 mg kg-1. Laparoscopy was developed for sex determination. In a thermal gradient the skinks maintained a mean body temperature of 30.62<IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.03oC. The mean body temperature of a pregnant lizard (34.04 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.19oC) was significantly higher (p***) than in non-pregnant females (30.43 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 2.09oC) and males (27.79 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.76oC). There is a large inter and intra-individual variation in temperature selection, and apparent seasonal and physiological effects. No correlation was found in females between any thermoregulatory parameter and reproductive hormone levels. Ovulation could be inferred from hormone changes. Mating occurred irrespective of almost any stage of follicular development. Repeat copulation seems to be necessary for successful conception. True gestation length is 40-50 days, the discrepancy is unresolvable due to sperm storage. The effects of environmental factors on reproductive activity were studied in controlled laboratory conditions, using A) constant 31oC, 14L:10D; B) constant 31oC 8L:16D; C) fluctuating seasonal conditions. Temperature appears to be the permissive factor, lizards from group A breeding nearly all year round, whilst B and C were limited to summer. The reduction in photoperiod by two hours postponed breeding by two months in group B. However, this could be attributed to their more recent exposure to natural cues. Superovulation trials failed to give reliable results. Reproductive behaviours have been observed, and found to be similar to other scincids. Sperm storage occurs in the deep clefts of the ciliated epithelium in the lower part of the oviduct. A short SEM study of the hemipenes has shown them to be a simple conical shape with little surface ornamentation. Some embryological details are described.

T1  - BIOLOGY OF IMMATURE CULICOIDES VARIIPENNIS SSP. AUSTRALIS (COQ.) (DIPTERA: CERATOPOGONIDAE) AT SALTVILLE, VA (VIRGINIA)
AN  - 303425006
AB  - The larval and pupal biology of a unique population of Culicoides variipennis inhabiting the brine ponds of Saltville, VA was studied. Developmental threshold temperatures ((DEGREES)C) and thermal constants ((DEGREES)days) for larvae and pupae were 9.6(DEGREES)C and 387(DEGREES)days (larval stage) and 9.6(DEGREES)C and 30(DEGREES)days (pupal stage) respectively. Accumulated heat units recorded in the field ranged from 366-376(DEGREES)days between successive generations in the summer. Heat accumulations required for completion of immature development of C. variipennis were found to be much greater (831(DEGREES)days) for the overwintering generation. During the summar, larval/pupal distribution within the littoral zone of a brine pond was confined to the surface cm of mud at or near the shoreline. Insects overwintered farther offshore, mostly as 3rd instars. In early March, most larvae had molted to 4th instars and migrated above shoreline to pupate. Adult emergence occurred in April. Three summer generations were documented for 1983-1984 at Saltville. Life tables and survivorship curves were calculated for the overwintering generation and the first summer generations for 1983 and 1984. For the overwintering generation, there was a relatively constant mortality rate between successive age-classes (Type II survivorship curve). During the summer, there was relatively little mortality between successive larval age-classes but a dramatic increase in mortality was evident at the pupal stage (Type I survivorship curve). Late instar larvae were found to migrate from the shoreline onto the exposed mudflats to pupate, thus becoming vulnerable to predation by ants and carabid beetles. Excellent survival rates of the larvae during the summer was attributed to habitat stability, the paucity of predators and parasites and abundant microfloral content (i.e. food) of the pond water. Intra-specific competition for food resources appeared to be alleviated somewhat by partitioning of those resources on a diurnal cycle.

T1  - TEMPERATURE HETEROGENEITY AND GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN LIFE HISTORY PATTERNS OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER (PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY, METABOLIC RATE, FITNESS)
AN  - 303387593
AB  - A crucial problem in evolutionary biology is the development of a general theory for the evolution of adaptive life histories in environments that differ in degree of fluctuation and predictability of sequential conditions. Resolution of this problem requires examination of the phenotypic and genetic structure of life history components in populations that differ in environmental heterogeneity. I examined variation in viability, development time, age-specific fecundity, longevity and rate of metabolism for populations of Drosophila melanogaster from sites representing three points on the stable-fluctuating continuum for temperature variation.    The observed differences in population means, phenotypic and genetic correlation structure, and phenotypic plasticity indicate that different selective pressures operate in stable as opposed to fluctuating environments. Flies from the thermally stable population were characteristically highly sensitive to environmental change and displayed many attributes of a K-selected population. The ecologically marginal site engendered more r-selected life history patterns. The flies showed marked plasticity in response to an environmental shift from 22(DEGREES) to 25(DEGREES)C, but were homeostatic in response to warmer temperatures. Flies from variable environments exhibited higher rates of metabolism. These data suggest that in variable environments, responsiveness to conditions conducive to reproductive success may be at a selective premium, while in more stable regimes specialist genotypes with lower reproductive rates may be favored. Potential differences in mode and timing of selective action are discussed.    Phenotypic correlation structure was markedly different for the three populations and appeared to reflect temperature specific constraints. Tradeoffs between early and late life components were especially severe at low temperatures, but the form of the cost differed by population. The presence of considerable genetic variability for early life traits could not be explained by the variable pleiotropy hypothesis, since genetic correlation structure did not show the expected negative relationships between early and late life traits. The marked changes in genetic variance-covariance structure with minor shifts in environmental temperature suggest that current quantitative genetic models of life history evolution will not be adequate for heterogeneous environments. Other approaches to resolving the life history dilemma are addressed.

T1  - DISTRIBUTION AND ECOLOGY OF CALIFORNIA EUSEIUS SPECIES (ACARI: PHYTOSEIIDAE) (COMPETITION, PREFERENCE)
AN  - 303361863
AB  - Morphological and ecological variation among Euseius hibisci (Chant) populations in California was noted by other workers and in preliminary studies. The studies reported here were performed to determine the number of Euseius species in California and to characterize some biological differences between them.    Measurements of dorsal shield and leg setae distinguished three morphologically distinct forms which were cultured on the laboratory. Crossing studies demonstrated varying degrees of reproductive isolation between them. Geographically disjunct populations of the same morphological forms proved reproductively compatible. Two additional species were recognized as occurring in California with E. hibisci: E. tularensis Congdon and E. quetzali McMurtry.    Extensive collections revealed differences in species distributions. E. hibisci occurred on citrus and avocado in coastal regions from Santa Barbara, California through Oaxaca, Mexico. In sympatry with E. tularensis it was usually confined to avocado. E. tularensis predominated on citrus in the interior valleys of central and southern California. E. quetzali was collected on native Quercus and Rubus. Its geographic range included those of the other two species and extended beyond them to northern coastal areas and higher elevations.    Weather record analysis showed that climatic conditions differ between the ranges of E. tularensis and E. hibisci. E. tularensis occurs in areas with greater temperature extremes.    Possible factors responsible for host plant specificity were examined. Survival and oviposition tests on different leaf substrates and substrate preference experiments were performed. These tests demonstrated differences in oviposition rates and substrate selectivity in response to leaves of different species.    The possible role of interspecific competition as a determinant of distribution was examined. A replacement series experiment suggested that the two species are mutually antagonistic at high densities. At lower densities interaction did not affect oviposition rate.    Prey selectivity was studied in E. tularensis by observation of responses to potential food items. Consumption:contact ratio was highest for pollen, followed by citrus thrips, pacific spider mite, citrus red mite, and Euseius hibisci larvae.    Periodic sampling from undisturbed native shrubs indicated that E. tularensis occurred at higher densities on Heteromeles arbutifolia M. Roem than on Rhus laurina Nutt. Citrus thrips densities were much higher on R. laurina.

T1  - Predation of infaunal bivalves by <i>Carcinus maenas</i> (L.) in the Burry Inlet, South Wales
AN  - 2041902130
AB  - Laboratory experiments and field studies in the Burry Inlet were designed to investigate the impact of crab predation on population of burrowing bivalves. Sampling of Carcinus maenas in the Inlet indicated that significant numbers of adult crabs move on to the sand banks at every flood tide for all but the coldest months of the year, but it proved difficult to estimate actual numbers. Settlement of first stage crabs occurs in July. These young crabs live in nursery areas near HWNT until about one year old. Stomach contents analysis demonstrated that large C. maenas feed mainly on infaunal bivalves. The priority food varied from one season to another and between juveniles and adults. Laboratory experiments were conducted on the predatory behaviour of the crab, on four infaunal bivalve species. Methods used by crabs to open the bivalve shells are described and shown to be related to shell strength. For any given crab size, there was an optimal prey size where the prey value was at a maximum. Other experiments showed that crabs selected prey of a size close to the predicted optim\im both for Cerasto- derma edule and Macoma balthica even when they were buried in the sand. Burrowing behaviour of both M. balthica and Scrobicularia plana was found to significantly reduce crab predation, but it had little effect in the case of the shallow burrower C. edule. Crabs preyed heavily on those bivalves that occurred close to the sand surface. When crabs were offered similar sized, small specimens of three species of bivalves buried in sand, they actively selected cockles. Protection of small cockles from various predators by the use of cages in the field decreased their mortality. It was concluded that crabs must be considered serious predators of first and second summer cockles.

T1  - FACTORS AFFECTING VOLTINISM IN THE TIGER SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY, PAPILIO GLAUCUS L. (HOST SELECTION, MICROHABITAT, DEVELOPMENTAL THRESHOLD TEMPERATURE)
AN  - 303353861
AB  - Caterpillars of the tiger swallowtail butterfly, (Papilio glaucus), feed on more than 13 families of plants. They show considerable differences in growth rate and efficiency on the various host plants. Larval growth can be modelled by determining a developmental threshold temperature (T(,o)) at which growth can begin and calculating the number of growth degree hours above this threshold necessary to complete development. In the Flanders, New Jersey area, the tiger swallowtail is bivoltine although there are rarely sufficient growth degree hours to support two broods. A method for calculating leaf surface area of host trees was devised and all host plants in the study area were measured to determine the availability of resources.    Females selected the host species which afforded their offspring the maximum growth rate and not that which was most abundant. In addition to host selection, females selected microhabits which benefitted eggs and larvae. Over 69% of the observed eggs had been oviposited on the western and southern sides of trees. Animals with these exposures developed significantly faster than would be predicted from laboratory tests without radiation. Over 97% of the eggs found were at heights between 0.5 and 2.5m. Larvae placed at 5m had significantly lower body temperatures than those at 1m due to increases in wind and convective cooling at greater heights. Larvae use silk to curl the leaf on which they rest to act as a parabolic reflector and help shield the larvae from cooling breezes.    Univoltine tiger swallowtails from Ithaca, New York, have a T(,o) of 11.7(DEGREES)C. In the New Jersey population the T(,o) is 9.4(DEGREES)C. This lower T(,o) permits New Jersey populations to develop 9.23% faster. The combination of behavioral and physiological adaptations by the tiger swallowtail butterfly increases the probability of successfully completing development in this part of its range.

T1  - BIONOMICS OF TETRANYCHUS CINNABARINUS (BOISDUVAL) (ACARI: TETRANYCHIDAE) ON COTTON
AN  - 303341358
AB  - Laboratory and field research during 1982 and 1983 was conducted to better understand the biology of Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval) and its role in the cotton agroecosystem of the Imperial Valley, California.    To determine the effect of temperature and/or humidity on the species character of dorsal strial lobes, mites of the Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval)-T. urticae Koch complex were reared at two temperature and humidity regimes for 10 generations. Measurements indicate that the dorsal strial lobe densities vary with changes in temperature and/or humidity.    Citrus thrips (Scirtothrips citri (Moulton)) were found in large numbers during sampling of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. 'Deltapine 61') in the Imperial Valley. Because citrus thrips had not been previously reported in cotton, and because another thrips species had recently been found to be an important spider mite predator in cotton, a study was conducted to determine if S. citri could develop on cotton and/or mite eggs. Tests showed that development could occur on cotton leaves alone or on mite eggs alone, however, S. citri is probably a minor predator with little impact on spider mite field populations.    The effects of five pesticides on the within-plant distribution as well as the spatial dispersion of T. cinnabarinus (Boisduval) were examined in a 2-year field study in cotton in the Imperial Valley. The within-plant distribution of the mites on mainstem node leaves was not significantly affected by the pesticides. Throughout the season, mainstem node leaf 5 consistently had one of the highest densities of mites. The linear regression of log variance against log mean provided a better fit to the data than did the linear regression of mean crowding on the mean. The former regression was used as a basis for a sampling plan designed to estimate population densities of T. cinnabarinus with fixed levels of precision.    Several dispersion and regression indices were calculated for populations of female T. cinnabarinus (Boisduval). Cx, Ip and m/m as well as the slopes from the regressions all indicated that the population was slightly aggregated. The variance/mean ratio may be less reliable than previously thought.

T1  - VIRUS PERSISTENCE IN GROUND WATER
AN  - 303334046
AB  - Ground water has traditionally been considered safe for human consumption without treatment. However, it is an increasingly significant cause of human disease. Although ground water accounts for only approximately 20% of the nation's water supply, over 50% of the waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States are due to the consumption of contaminated ground water. It has been estimated that 65% of the cases of illness in these outbreaks are caused by enteric viruses. Little, however, is known about the persistence of viruses in ground water. The purpose of this study was to try to determine the chemical, physical, and biological factors influencing virus survival in ground water. This information will be helpful in developing criteria for determining safe distances between drinking water wells and sources of potential contamination such as septic tanks and waste application sites. Ground water samples were obtained from eleven sites throughout the United States. In addition, twenty samples were collected from the Tucson basin. The water temperature was measured at the time of collection. Several physical and chemical characteristics (including pH, nitrates, turbidity, and hardness) were determined for each sample. Separate polypropylene tubes containing 50 ml of water were inoculated with each of three viruses: poliovirus-1, echovirus-1 and MS-2 coliphage. Duplicate tubes containing water which had been filtered to remove the indigenous bacteria were also inoculated with viruses. The tubes were incubated at the in situ ground water temperature; selected samples were incubated at two additional temperatures. One-ml subsamples were withdrawn at predetermined intervals over a 30-day period and assayed to determine the number of microorganisms remaining. Multiple regression analysis revealed that temperature was the only water characteristic significantly correlated with the decay rates of all three viruses. Bacteria did not have a consistent effect on the decay rate of the viruses. In addition, no significant differences were found among the decay rates of the three viruses, suggesting that MS-2 coliphage may be able to be used as a model of animal virus behavior in the environment.

AB  - Genetic variability in five strains of the guppy (Poecilia recticulata) has been assayed electrophoretically at 22 to 25 structural gene loci coding for 19 enzyme systems. The levels of polymorphism (0.158-0.263) and heterozygosities (0.078-0.125) obtained for the strains indicate that they are as variable as any other fish species, though guppies are in general thought of as inbred due to continued and close mating in domestication.    Genetical effects of thermal selection have been assayed in two single strains and four hybrid strains of the guppy. The selections continued for 3 to 6 generations in different strains with two temperature-time regimes (44$\sp\circ$C for 8 minutes and 43$\sp\circ$C for 8.5 minutes). The effects of selection on 4 or 5 polymorphic loci were examined and some consistent significant differences in allele frequencies were obtained between the control and the selected lines, though in some of the strains the alleles affected by selection were not consistent. However, the results obtained indicate that such polymorphic loci are closely linked with loci which play an adaptive role in temperature stress.    An attempt was made to induce sex-linked mutants in Tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) involving eggs fertilized with sperm in vitro treated with a chemical mutagen, MMS. A few aberrant phenotypes were obtained by such treatment in the hybrid (O. mossambicus x O. niloticus). No evidence of a genetic basis for any of these phenotypes was obtained. MMS treatment of sperm in O. niloticus show dominant lethality.    Chromosome manipulation involving the production of triploid and gynogenesis were carried out in O. niloticus. The results suggest that though triploidy can be induced relatively easily, the gynogenetic technique needs more work to be done on the optimization of UV-irradiation dose.    A comparative growth trial between diploid and triploid fish together with comparisons on various body parameters suggest that triploids in this species are largely inferior to the diploids.    Gynogenetic techniques were resorted to as an inbreeding method to uncover any recessive mutation in females produced by in vitro fertilization with sperm treated with MMS and while no mutations of any sort were found, the all-female nature of the gynogenetic progeny is a confirmation that the females in this species are homogametic.

T1  - SEASONAL, ANNUAL, AND INTERSPECIFIC CORRELATES OF THERMAL ACCLIMATION IN PLETHODONTID SALAMANDERS (CRITICAL MAXIMA, MINIMA, METABOLISM)
AN  - 303323765
AB  - In this study, the thermal acclimation of critical thermal minima (CTMin) and maxima (CTMax) were examined annually and seasonally in several species of plethodontid salamanders. The factors were considered relative to constant and cycling (thermoperiod) temperature regimes (Chapt. 1) and time courses of acclimation (Chapt. 3). Thermal hardening of CTMax and CTMin were also considered (Chapt. 2). Finally, seasonal and annual correlates were considered in the constant temperature and thermoperiod acclimation of metabolism in Desmognathus quadramaculatus (Chapt. 4).    Various species demonstrated the ability to undergo thermal acclimation of both CTMax and CTMin at different constant temperatures. The former seems to be well correlated with the ecogeographic distributions of these species, whereas the latter showed little interspecific variation. These animals showed an ability to acclimate to a thermoperiod by adjusting their CTMax and CTMin appropriately. These responses were best developed in highly terrestrial species such as Plethodon jordani and P. cinereus. Annual and seasonal differences existed among the CTMax and CTMin, but these did not fit any obvious adaptive patterns.    Hardening was, at best, poorly developed in the species studied here. In D. monticola, this phenomenon was highly body size dependent for both the CTMax and CTMin.    The time courses of CTMax and CTMin acclimation paralleled the interspecific trends reported in Chapter 1. The magnitude of acclimation was considerably greater for the CTMin than the CTMax. These responses were fairly stable annually, and the CTMin acclimation was altered seasonally in a manner corresponding to ecological constraints.    Thermal acclimation of metabolism in D. quadramaculatus differed considerably between constant temperatures and a thermoperiod. The temperature sensitivity for the latter was considerably reduced. There was no undercompensation at low acclimation temperatures, and metabolism proved to be highly stable on an annual basis. Some seasonal lability of metabolism was observed.    The temperature acclimation responses of these amphibians presumably influence their ecological success. In particular, the ability to selectively adjust their temperature tolerances and metabolic rates to cyclic temperature regimes may be crucial for their exploitation of the environment in light of considerable thermal variability.

T1  - POPULATION ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY OF THE MOLE SALAMANDER AMBYSTOMA TALPOIDEUM (EGG SIZE, CLUTCH, MASS)
AN  - 303297971
AB  - The population ecology of Ambystoma talpoideum was studied at five breeding sites varying in the probability of drying. Terrestrial drift fences with pitfall traps were used to monitor migration of adults and metamorphosing juveniles.    Breeding migrations "en masse" occurred in November, December, or January. Total number of breeding adults was correlated with cumulative rainfall during the time of immigration. Sex ratio of immigrating adults at the beginning of the breeding season was significantly biased towards males whereas at the end of the season it was biased towards females.    Emigration of adults from the breeding sites occurred each March. Emigration of metamorphosing juveniles took place as early as May and continued until the breeding site dried. In semi-permanent breeding sites most larvae did not metamorphose but remained in the ponds and matured sexually.    One-year old terrestrial morphs had larger snout-vent lengths than 1-yr old paedmorphs but were smaller in body mass. Body mass and snout-vent length increased with age in both morphs. Clutch mass, number of ova, and diameter of ova increased with snout-vent length. After removing the effects of snout-vent with an analysis of covariance, only the diameter of ova and the resultant clutch mass increased with age. One-year old terrestrial morphs produced more ova than 1-yr old paedomorphs. Reproductive investment, as shown by the relationship between clutch size and egg size, increased with age.    In replicated artificial ponds simulating permanent and temporary breeding ponds the water level in the drying treatment decreased during the experimental period with no apparent differences in water chemistry parameters between treatments and only a slight change in water temperature. Quality of the growth environment for larvae and survivorship was the same among experimental treatments. Frequency of metamorphosis was different between water level treatments and between population treatments. Frequency of paedomorphosis was different between population treatments but not between water level treatments. Population differences in the frequency of metamorphosis and paedomorphosis presumably represent genetic differences resulting from the different selective regimes individuals encounter among breeding sites varying in permanency.

T1  - BIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF TETRANYCHUS CINNABARINUS AND TYPHLODROMUS OCCIDENTALIS (ACARINA: PHYTOSEIIDAE) AT THREE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE REGIMES
AN  - 303296860
AB  - Temperature effects on the biology of Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval) and Typhlodromus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acarina: Phytoseiidae) were studied in the laboratory. Temperature had a definite effect on the developmental time, longevity and survival of adult females, and duration and rate of oviposition in both T. occidentalis and T. cinnabarinus. Increases in temperature significantly decrease developmental time, pre-oviposition periods, oviposition duration and rate, and the longevity and survival rates of both adult females. However, the daily consumption rate of T. occidentalis protonymph, deutonymph and adult gravid female increased significantly with an increase in temperature. Mean generation times decreased for both mites with an increase in temperature. The intrinsic rate of natural increase rose with each temperature increase. However, the r(,m) of T. occidentalis was less than that for T. cinnabarinus at all temperature regimes, and it decreased from the 26.6(DEGREES) C regime to the 30.5(DEGREES) C regime. Of the three temperatures studied, 22.7(DEGREES), 26.6(DEGREES), and 3.5(DEGREES) C, 22.7(DEGREES) C proved to be the optimum for the predator to maintain control over the prey.

T1  - EFFECTS OF REPEATING AND SWITCHING THREE LARVAL DIETS FOR FOUR GENERATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORN EARWORM, HELIOTHIS ZEA (BODDIE) (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE)
AN  - 303278985
AB  - This study was conducted under laboratory conditions to determine the effects of repeating and switching three larval diets from one generation to the next on the development of the corn earworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The larval diets used were an alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., meal-based artificial diet, frozen corn, Zea mays L., kernels, and green tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum P. Miller, fruits.    Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, larvae were individually transferred to small (29.5 ml) plastic cups. Forty larvae were established on each diet and kept in the rearing chamber at 27 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C temperature, (TURNEQ)65% relative humidity, and 16L:8D photoperiod for the first generation. Diet switching started with the second generation, resulting in nine possible combinations. This procedure was continued in the third generation, providing all 27 possible diet sequences. In the fourth generation, larvae were kept on their parents' larval diet. In the second experiment, the procedure for the first and second generations was the same as that in the first experiment. However, third generation larvae were reared on their parents' larval diet. Diets were switched in the fourth generation resulting in 27 possible diet sequences.    The cups were checked daily for larval mortality and pupation. Two cages, each with three females and six males, were set up from each diet for egg deposition. Twenty-five eggs were randomly selected from those oviposited on each of the second, third, and fourth days of oviposition to determine the hatching percentage and duration of the egg stage.    The variables measured were as follows: duration of the larval and pupal stages, four-day pupal weights, larval and pupal survival percentages, duration of the preoviposition period, mean number of eggs per female, duration of the egg stage, and egg hatching percentage. From this information the duration of a generation (egg to egg) and the potential daily biomass production per female were calculated.    Growth and development of the corn earworm were affected by the different larval diets. Feeding on tomato fruits resulted in significantly longer larval stage durations, lower pupal weights, higher larval mortality rates, lower numbers of eggs per female, longer generation time, and lower biomass production. Feeding on the artificial diet or corn kernels had the opposite effects on the above mentioned variables. . . . (Author's abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.
