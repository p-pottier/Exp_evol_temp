T1  - Evolutionary and environmental effects on thermoregulation among complex lizard communities
AN  - 305563164
AB  - A community of ten sympatric lizard species was studied in a mountain canyon in southern Arizona to determine the effect of phylogeny on habitat use and thermoregulation. Habitat use, body temperatures ( Tb) and operative environmental temperatures ( Te) were recorded in the field, as well as the selected temperature range (Tsel) for active lizards in the laboratory. Te varied significantly with elevation, time of day, macrohabitat, and microhabitat with most of the variation occurring at the microhabitat level, indicating a small spatial scale of thermal heterogeneity at the study site. At most times of day and in most macrohabitats,  Te bracketed Tsel for the species indicating that maintenance of Tb within  Tsel was possible during most daylight hours. Randomization analyses of matrices of phylogenetic similarity, habitat use and microsite temperature overlaps showed significant correlations between phylogenetic similarity, habitat use, and field active Tbs. There was no correlation between phylogenetic similarity and T sel. Indices of thermoregulation calculated for each species revealed that although these lizards thermoregulated effectively, there was no correlation between the matrix of phylogenetic similarity and similarity matrices for accuracy or effectiveness of thermoregulation. Pseudocommunity analyses showed no partitioning of thermal resources, indeed species tended to use similar thermal resources despite disparate habitat use. The significant effect of phylogeny on microhabitat use, and field Tb but not on Tsel suggests that microhabitat selection may override thermoregulation, possibly due to tradeoffs between thermoregulation, foraging, predator avoidance or reproduction.

T1  - Body size, temperature, and the evolution of herbivory in reptiles
AN  - 305549180
AB  - I critically review the literature on the biology of Recent herbivorous reptiles to explain why it so few herbivorous reptiles have evolved (<1% of >8000 living species) and to identify the conditions that favor the evolution of herbivory. Despite their divergent evolutionary histories, most herbivorous reptiles live in warm climates, and have converged on a common suite of morphological, physiological, and life-history characteristics. Herbivory appears to evolve from omnivory, primarily in seasonal climates, and possibly results from an energetic deficit caused by switching between an herbivorous and a carnivorous diet. The mechanistic basis of this cost is hypothesized to be the consequence of changes in the community structure of fermentative endosymbionts that are responsible for digesting plant fiber and releasing energy and nutrients into their host's gut. Most aspects of the biology of herbivorous reptiles have been poorly studied. Liolaemid lizards are likely the smallest and least studied herbivorous reptiles. A sample of 31 species of liolaemids, with diets ranging from insectivores to herbivores, were examined and found to have dental and gut characteristics similar to those of other herbivorous lizards. These characteristics also correlate with the proportion of plant matter in the diet suggesting some traits associated with the evolution of herbivory evolve in a correlated fashion. Herbivorous reptiles produce small clutches of large eggs (or neonates) relative to nonherbivores. Herbivorous turtles do not exhibit an increase in clutch size with increasing latitude, but nonherbivorous turtles do. Clutch mass is similar between herbivorous and nonherbivorous reptiles indicating that herbivory does not impose constraints on reproductive effort. Instead, selection is expected to favor large-bodied neonates (with accordingly large guts) because large digestive tracts may be a necessity of plant digestion. An energetic model was developed to understand the interplay among body size, temperature, and the biogeography of three herbivorous lizards ranging widely in body size and geographical and climatic distribution. Simulations show that lizards from warm environments with scarce food resources need to be large bodied because large animals expend energy reserves less quickly. Small lizards are able to thrive as herbivores in cool climates because of their ability to exploit unpredictable thermal resources and their low gross energy needs.

T1  - Identification of genes that positively and negatively regulate life span and stress resistance in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 305542696
AB  - Genome sequencing reveals that a large percentage of Drosophila genes have homologs in humans, including many human disease genes. The goal of this research was to develop methods to efficiently test Drosophila genes for functions in vivo. An important challenge is the fact that many genes function at more than one point during development and during the life cycle. Conditional expression systems such as promoters regulated by tetracycline (or its derivative doxycycline) are often ideal for testing gene functions. However, generation of transgenic animals for each gene of interest is impractical. Placing the doxycycline-inducible (“tet-on”) promoter directed out of the end of the P transposable element produced a mobile, doxycycline-inducible promoter element, named  PdL. PdL was mobilized to 228 locations in the genome and was found to generate conditional (doxycycline-dependent), dominant mutations at high frequency. The temporal control of gene over-expression allowed generation of mutant phenotypes specific to different stages of the life cycle, including metamorphosis and aging. Novel phenotypes were identified for some known genes, including specific developmental defects and increased or decreased life span.    During normal aging Drosophila hsp22 protein accumulates >150-fold throughout the fly, while other hsps are unchanged or accumulate to much lower levels. The pattern of hsp gene expression observed during aging appears most similar to that caused by oxidative stress. Drosophila hsp22 is a member of the small heat shock protein family (shsps). To assay for effects of hsp22, the ubiquitous pattern of hsp22 gene expression observed during aging was mimicked in young flies using the “tet-on” doxycycline regulated promoter system. hsp22 over-expression made young flies more similar to old flies in that stress resistance and viability were reduced. Induction of  hsp22: lacZ and hsp70:lacZ reporter transgenes in response to acute stress was normal in the presence of hsp22 protein over-expression and in old flies. The data suggest a model in which chronic oxidative stress during aging causes an accumulation of toxic levels of hsp22.

T1  - Plant evolution in fire -prone environments
AN  - 305526240
AB  - My dissertation work examines fire as a selective force in plant evolution. My investigation of sprouter and nonsprouter growth rates (Chapter 2) examines intra-specific variation in the ability to resprout after fire. This work on closely related sprouters and nonsprouters attempts to shed light on the evolutionary implications of the loss of resprouting ability.    Chapters 3–5 examine the possible evolutionary role of plant flammability. Plants are not only shaped by the selective environment that fire creates, but, as fuel, plants can influence the nature of the fire they experience. In Chapter 3, I use phylogenetic comparative methods to test for an evolutionary correlation between fire response traits and flammability in pines. This work reveals a pattern of correlation evolution in which evolutionary increases in flammability have been associated with increases in fire-dependent recruitment.    Chapter 4 answers critics who have charged that flammability is not a trait upon which evolution can act. In this chapter, I test whether a potential flammability trait that varies in nature can have local effects on fire intensity. My experimental manipulation of shrub canopy architectures revealed that one candidate flammability trait, dead branch retention, can significantly increase fire temperatures. This work suggests that plants may indeed influence the nature of fire they experience.    Chapter 5 examines whether increased flammability can evolve under natural selection. In this simulation model, flammability evolves due to an association between an allele that promotes flammability and alleles at unlinked loci that give high fitness. Flammability behaves as a spatial modifier of generation time. My co-author, Ben Kerr, and I term this process “genetic niche-hiking.” More generally, “genetic niche-hiking,” can explain the evolution of altruistic traits in spatially-structured systems.    Ecologists have long viewed fire as a destructive force to which plants have responded through the evolution of life-history strategies that allow species to cope with this powerful force. My thesis work suggests that a more full view of fire and plant evolution should include the possibility that plants are authors of their own evolution. Plants may be shaping their environment, and in doing so, changing the nature of fire that they and their offspring experience.

T1  - The physiological responses to burst activity and temperature stress in two cultured strains of Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>)
AN  - 305481325
AB  - This study examined the physiological effects of exhaustive exercise and thermal stress on two cultured strains of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reared under identical conditions. Both strains of originated from the St. John River, NB. Strain 1 was in its first generation of culture whereas strain 2 had been cultured for 3 generations. Exhaustive exercise experiments, conducted at 4 months post-hatch, revealed significant strain x time interactions in the oxygen consumption rates (MO2) and ammonia excretion rates (Mamm). When comparisons between cultured and wild fish (from the Catamaran Brook) were made, it was found that wild salmon recovered to resting MO2 and Mamm faster than cultured fish. No significant interactions were noted for phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate and glycogen concentrations. At 8 months post-hatch a significant strain x time interaction was observed for whole-body lactate concentrations, however, no interactions were present at 8 months post-hatch for plasma lactate concentrations. Both the acute (15 to 20 or 25°C) and the graded temperature (15 to 20°C, over a 3 hour period) challenges resulted in significant effects over time for both MO2 and Mamm Strain x time interactions were also noted in both the 5 and 10°C acute challenges. Survival rates of 100% were observed in strain 1 fish following all temperature challenge experiments. In contrast, survival rates for strain 2 fish dropped to 90% and 60% following the 5 and 10°C temperature challenges, respectively. Taken together, the results of these experiments reveal subtle physiological differences between both strains of fish. However, the increased mortality noted for strain 2 fish in the temperature experiments suggests that strain 1 fish were physiologically more fit than the strain 2 fish (cultured for an additional 2 generations).

T1  - Responses to selection for cadmium resistance in the least killifish <i>Heterandria formosa</i>, underlying mechanisms, and fitness costs
AN  - 305451872
AB  - Heavy metal pollution may result in a selection pressure on populations in such contaminated environments. A population negatively affected by the pollution may be able to sustain itself and become resistant if genetic variation for resistance exists in a population. I investigated the potential for the evolution of resistance by conducting a laboratory selection experiment using the least killifish Heterandria formosa. Laboratory populations showed a rapid response to selection for cadmium resistance. After six generations of selection, the resistance to cadmium in the three selection populations was about three times that in the three control populations. Fish from the selection populations also showed a cross-resistance to copper in the three generations in which this was investigated.    I studied Cd accumulation and the detoxification of Cd by binding to metallothionein as potential mechanisms underlying the resistance. In the F3 and F4 generations, fish from the Cd-resistant populations had a lower short-term (2-h) cadmium uptake and a lower long-term accumulation of cadmium than fish from the control populations. The changes in cadmium accumulation dynamics appeared to be the major mechanism for cadmium resistance. In the F8 generation, a cadmium binding protein from the cytosol of least killifish was partially characterized as a metallothionein-like protein. The Cd-adapted populations had higher basal and induced levels of this protein than the control populations. The metallothionein-like protein seemed to play a role (albeit minor) in the cadmium resistance in this species.    Fitness determines the fate of the resistance genes in the adapted populations, and the evolution of resistance to an environmental stressor may be associated with fitness costs. In the F3 and F4 generations, the selection populations had smaller offspring than those from the control populations. In the F2, F3, and F5 generations, the selection populations showed a lower resistance to heat than the control populations. In the F7 generations, the selection populations showed a lower fecundity, smaller brood size, shorter female longevity, and longer time to first reproduction. These results indicated that fitness costs were associated with the evolution of resistance to cadmium in the least killifish.

T1  - Temperature, body size and life history in Drosophila melanogaster. (BL: DXN062078)
AN  - 301624784
AB  - Body size in Drosophila melanogaster results from the combinations of evolutionary genetic and developmental effects, both of which are affected by the thermal environment.  Evolution or development at lower environmental temperatures results in increased body size in fruitflies, however, the reasons for these adaptations remain elusive.
 To investigate whether larger size is favoured at lower temperature through natural selection on adult males, life-span and age-specific-fertility of males from lines artificially selected for increased and decreased body size were examined at two different temperatures.  Larger males were found to be fitter than controls at both temperatures, but the difference in fitness was much greater at the lower experimental temperature.  Similar males did not perform significantly differently from controls at either experimental temperature.  These findings suggest that thermal selection for larger adult males is at least in part responsible for evolution of larger body size at lower temperatures in this species.
 An investigation into the evolution of plasticity of body size traits was performed.  The phenotypic plasticity of body size and its components;  cell size and cell number, were examined by rearing populations of flies that had evolved in constant and variable thermal environments at two different experimental temperatures.  Plasticity of body size was comparable among all of the populations examined, however, plasticity of both cellular components of body size was significantly greater in flies adapted to variable thermal environments.
 The lifespan and fecundity of eight replicated populations of continually mated flies from a cline along the Eastern coast of Australia, when maintained at two different temperatures in the laboratory, was also examined, and no latitudinal trend in either longevity or lifetime fecundity was observed.  However, there were some differences in the pattern of fecundity over the lifetime of individuals along the cline.

T1  - <i>Listeria Monocytogenes</i> - Inactivation by Essential Oils and High Pressure, and Contribution of Genetic Variation to Stress Resistance
AN  - 2564441603
AB  - A variety of non-thermal mild preservation techniques have lately been introduced in food production, or are currently being investigated thoroughly for potential use in food processing. Two of these novel preservation techniques are the use of essential oil compounds isolated from plants and of High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) treatment. Applications of these preservation methods, alone or combined, have shown to reduce the viable numbers of microorganisms occurring in foods, and in addition, are able to preserve the nutritional and sensory characteristics of the product. The objectives of this thesis were to asses the antimicrobial potential of these combined processing techniques against the foodborne bacterium Listeria monocytogenes , which can cause serious disease with a relatively high mortality rate. In addition, to get more insight in the primary cellular targets that are affected upon HHP treatment of L. monocytogenes , we examined the mechanism underlying increased HHP tolerance of an isolate of this organism. Chapter 1 gives a short introduction on L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, mild and novel preservation techniques in food processing are addressed, with special emphasis on the use of essential oil compounds from plants, and the use of High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP). General characteristics and the mode of action of these preservation techniques are described, followed by resistance mechanisms that bacteria use to counteract their potentially lethal action. This chapter is concluded with the combined use of these preservation methods, and an outline of this thesis.In Chapter 2 , it is demonstrated that various plant-derived volatiles, namely, S-carvone, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and decanal, have the ability to reduce the viable numbers of L. monocytogenes if used in combination with mild heat treatment, while these treatments alone were not affecting the viability of this pathogen. These findings show that essential oil compounds can play an important role in minimally processed foods, and can be used in the concept of Hurdle Technology to reduce the intensity of heat treatment or possibly other individual hurdles.In Chapter 3 , the combined antimicrobial action of carvacrol or thymol in combination with HHP was investigated at different temperatures. These treatments showed a synergistic action, with greater antimicrobial effects upon pressurisation at 1 oC than at 8°C or 20°C. Furthermore, addition of carvacrol to cells after exposure to sub-lethal HHP treatment showed reductions in viable numbers that were similar to those using simultaneous treatment with carvacrol and HHP. Synergism was also observed between carvacrol and HHP in semi-skimmed milk that was artificially contaminated with L. monocytogenes .The study demonstrates the synergistic antimicrobial effect of essential oils in combination with HHP. Together with the results described in Chapter 2, these data indicate the potential of essential oils to be employed in food processing if combined with other techniques.A major problem that successful application of HHP treatment faces is the variable piezotolerance of bacterial species, strains within a species, and even cells within pure cultures that are not homogenous. In Chapter 4 , we investigated the characteristics of a L. monocytogenes ScottA isolate, named AK01, that was derived from a wild type (wt) culture after a single pressurisation treatment. The survival of exponential and stationary phase cells of AK01 was at least 2 logs higher than that of the wt over a broad range of pressures (150-500 MPa), while both strains showed higher piezotolerance in the stationary than in the exponential phase of growth. In semi-skimmed milk, exponential phase cells of both strains showed lower reductions upon pressurisation than in buffer, but again, AK01 was more piezotolerant than the wt. The piezotolerance of AK01 was retained for at least 40 generations in rich medium, suggesting a stable phenotype. Interestingly, cells of AK01 lacked flagella and were elongated, and this strain showed slightly lower maximum specific growth rates at 8°C, 22°C and 30°C than the wt. Moreover, the piezotolerant strain AK01 showed increased resistance to heat, acid, and H 2 O 2 compared with the wt. The difference in HHP tolerance between the piezotolerant strain and the wt strain could not be attributed to differences in membrane fluidity, since strain AK01 and the wt had identical in situ lipid melting curves, as determined by Fourier Transfer Infrared spectroscopy.In Chapter 5 , the mechanisms underlying the altered phenotypic characteristics of AK01 are further examined. In this chapter, high piezotolerance, immobility, and reduced virulence were conclusively linked to a single amino acid deletion in the highly conserved glycine-rich region of the regulatory protein CtsR ( Class three stress gene repressor). CtsR negatively regulates the expression of Class III heat shock genes ( clpP , clpE and the clpC operon). The Clp proteins prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins that might be toxic to the cell. In the mutant strain AK01, expressing the CtsRΔGly protein, we observed upregulation ofclpP , which demonstrates the involvement of Class III heat shock genes in increased survival upon HHP treatment and other stresses. Replacement of the wt ctsR gene with the ctsRΔGly gene in a wt background resulted in a mutant strain that also lost its motile character, and importantly, also showed attenuated virulence.The deletion of three base pairs in the region of ctsR that normally encodes four glycines is seemingly not an isolated incident, since we detected the same mutation in the majority of other spontaneous piezotolerant isolates of L. monocytogenes . This suggests a functional role for this mutation in L. monocytogenes to survive unforeseen events that do not allow for adaptation of normal cells, but require genetic diversity.In conclusion, this work demonstrated some of the potentials that novel techniques, like the use of essential oils and HHP, can offer alone or combined with other novel or traditional techniques, like heat treatment. We furthermore investigated risks that could emerge from the use of those novel techniques. The occurrence of the piezotolerant strain AK01 of L. monocytogenes demonstrated the existence of bacterial heterogeneity within a supposedly pure wt population with regard to HHP resistance. The variance of piezotolerance within a microbial population, but also between different strains, is an important parameter that determines successful application of HHP treatment. This will be an important aspect for risk assessment of HHP treated foods that are, or will become, available on the market. Tailored HHP treatments, possibly in combination with additional mild preservatives, will be required for different products, and increased knowledge about the effects of these treatments will enable the food industry to produce safe foods at minimal costs.Alternate abstract:Recentelijk zijn diverse milde niet-thermische conserveringstechnieken geïntroduceerd in de voedselverwerking, en andere worden momenteel onderzocht op hun mogelijke toepassing in verwerkingsprocessen van levenmiddelen. Twee van deze nieuwe conserveringstechnieken zijn de toevoeging van etherische plantenextracten (essential oils) en de toepassing van Hoge Hydrostatische Druk (HHP). Het is gebleken dat door gebruik van deze conserveringsmethoden, afzonderlijk of in combinatie, een efficiënte reductie van microorganismen kan worden bewerkstelligd, terwijl de nutritionele en sensorische kwaliteit van het product behouden blijft. Een belangrijke doelstelling van deze dissertatie was het beoordelen van de anti-microbiële werking van deze gecombineerde technieken op hun effectiviteit tegen de pathogene bacterie Listeria monocytogenes, welke de levensbedreigende ziekte listeriose kan veroorzaken. Deze bacterie kan worden aangetroffen in levensmiddelen die niet afdoende zijn behandeld of geconserveerd dan wel zijn nabesmet. Daarnaast is het mechanisme bestudeerd dat ten grondslag ligt aan verhoogde HHP tolerantie van een L. monocytogenes isolaat, om meer inzicht te krijgen in de primaire cellulaire respons van dit organisme welke een rol speelt bij resistentie tegen HHP behandeling. In de introductie (Hoofdstuk 1) wordt kort ingegaan op de voedselpathogeen L.monocytogenes. Vervolgens komen nieuwe milde en niet-thermische conserveringstechnieken aan de orde, met nadruk op het gebruik van etherische plantenextracten en hoge hydrostatische druk. De algemene eigenschappen en werkingsmechanismen van deze technieken worden beschreven. Verder wordt ingegaan op de respons van bacteriën op deze behandelingen en hun overlevingsstrategieën Ten slotte wordt het gecombineerde gebruik van deze technieken besproken, en wordt een overzicht van de inhoud van dit proefschrift gegeven. In Hoofdstuk 2 wordt aangetoond dat afdoding van L. monocytogenes kan worden bewerkstelligd door gebruikmaking van relatief lage concentraties van vluchtige componenten geïsoleerd uit kruiden, namelijk S-carvon, cinnamaldehyde, thymol en decanal, in combinatie met een milde hittebehandeling. Afzonderlijke toepassing van deze verbindingen of milde hitte behandeling had echter geen antimicrobieel effect. De resultaten geven aan dat etherische oliën een belangrijke rol kunnen spelen binnen het concept van de Hordentechnologie. Een reductie van de intensiteit van bijvoorbeeld thermische behandelingen of andere conserveringsmethoden kan op een dergelijke wijze worden gerealiseerd voor minimaal behandelde levensmiddelen. Het Hoofdstuk 3 beschrijft het onderzoek naar de gecombineerde anti-microbiële activiteit van carvacrol en thymol in combinatie met HHP bij verschillende temperaturen. Deze behandelingen laten een synergistisch effect zien dat groter is bij 1°C dan bij 8 of 20°C. Bovendien bleek dat additie van carvacrol na een sub-letale HHP behandeling een vergelijkbare afdoding van Listeria monocytogenes tot gevolg had als een gelijktijdige behandeling met carvacrol onder HHP. Een synergistisch effect van carvacrol en HHP werd niet alleen waargenomen in een buffer, maar eveneens in halfvolle melk die kunstmatig gecontamineerd was met L. monocytogenes. Deze studie toont het synergistische effect van carvacrol en HHP aan. Evenals in Hoofdstuk 2 wordt hier de potentie van het gebruik van etherische oliën in combinatie met andere conserveringsmethoden aangetoond. Een serieus probleem waar succesvolle toepassing van HHP mee te kampen heeft is de variatie in druk-tolerantie tussen micro-organismen. In Hoofdstuk 4 worden de eigenschappen onderzocht van een L. monocytogenes isolaat (stam AK01) met hogere HHP tolerantie dan het wildtype. Stam AK01 werd geïsoleerd uit een wildtype cultuur na een enkelvoudige hoge druk behandeling. Cultures van stam AK01 in zowel het exponentiële als het stationaire groeistadium vertoonden overleving die ten minste twee log-eenheden hoger was dan die van het wildtype na blootstelling aan drukintensiteiten tussen 150 en 500 MPa. Zowel het wildtype als stam AK01 hadden een hogere druk-tolerantie in de stationaire groeifase dan in de exponentiële groeifase. Beide typen cellen vertoonden een verminderde reductie als gevolg van HHP behandeling na groei in halfvolle melk vergeleken met buffer, maar ook hier vertoonde AK01 een hogere druk-tolerantie dan het wild type. De druktolerantie van AK01 bleef behouden gedurende ten minste 70 generaties in een rijk medium, wat een stabiel fenotype suggereert. Opmerkelijk is dat de AK01 cellen geen flagellen hadden, langer dan normaal waren, en een licht gereduceerde maximale specifieke groeisnelheid hadden bij 8, 22 en 30°C vergeleken met het wild type. Bovendien vertoonde de druk-tolerante stam AK01 een hogere weerstand tegen hitte, zure condities en waterstofperoxide dan het wildtype. Het verschil in druk-tolerantie tussen AK01 en het wild type kon niet worden toegeschreven aan verschillen in membraanfluïditeit; beide stammen hadden een identieke in situ smeltcurve van hun lipiden, gemeten met FTIR. In Hoofdstuk 5 worden de mechanismen die ten grondslag liggen aan de gewijzigde fenotypische karakteristieken van AK01 verder onderzocht. Er wordt aangetoond dat hoge druk-tolerantie, immobiliteit en verlaagde virulentie van stam AK01 wordt veroorzaakt door deletie van één aminozuur (glycine) in het sterk geconserveerde glycine-rijke domein van het regulatoire eiwit CtsR ( Class three stress gene Repressor). CtsR remt de expressie van de klasse III genen die worden geïnduceerd door een thermische schok (clpP, clpE en het clpC operon). De Clp eiwitten gaan de accumulatie van (gedeeltelijk) gedenatureerde eiwitten tegen, welke mogelijk toxisch zijn voor de cel. Bij de expressie van het gemuteerde CtsR in AK01 (dat een glycine mist) werd verhoogde expressie van het gen clpP waargenomen. Dit toonde aan dat de klasse III thermische schok genen betrokken zijn bij de verhoogde weerstand tegen HPP en andere stresscondities. Uitwisseling van het wildtype ctsR gen in een wildtype stam met het gemuteerde ctsR gen resulteerde in een mutant welke eveneens verminderde mobiliteit en virulentie vertoonde. De deletie van 3 baseparen in het domein van CtsR dat normaliter voor vier glycines codeert lijkt geen incident te zijn, aangezien we dezelfde mutatie konden aantonen in de meerderheid van spontane hoge druk-tolerante isolaten van Listeria monocytogenes. Deze bevindingen suggereren dat de mutatie in het CtsR eiwit van Listeria monocytogenes een functionele rol vervult in een overlevingsstrategie waarbij adaptatie niet mogelijke is, maar genetische variëteit een uitkomst biedt. Samenvattend heeft deze dissertatie aangetoond dat nieuwe niet-thermische conserveringsmiddelen, zoals het gebruik van etherische oliën en hoge druk, effectief kunnen worden gebruikt om bacteriën af te doden, al dan niet in combinatie met nieuwe of traditionele methoden zoals hittebehandeling. Verder zijn een aantal risico’s onderzocht die kunnen voortvloeien uit het gebruik van dit soort nieuwe technieken. De isolatie van een Listeria monocytogenes stam met verhoogde hoge druk tolerantie toonde aan dat er binnen een wildtype culture heterogeniteit bestaat aangaande hoge druk resistentie. De variatie in druktolerantie binnen een microbiële populatie, maar ook tussen verschillende microorganismen, is een belangrijke parameter welke mede bepalend is voor de succesvolle toepassing van hoge druk. Dit is een belangrijk aandachtspunt in risico evaluatie van hoge druk behandelde levensmiddelen die op de markt worden gebracht. HHP behandelingen, mogelijk in combinatie met aanvullende milde conserveringstechnieken, dienen te zijn toegespitst op specifieke producten. Uiteindelijk zal kennis omtrent de effecten van deze behandelingen op bacteriën de voedselindustrie beter in staat stellen veilige levensmiddelen te produceren tegen zo laag mogelijke kosten.

T1  - Temperature, body size and life history in Drosophila melanogaster
AN  - 1759023350
AB  - Body size in Drosophila melanogaster results from the combination of evolutionary genetic and developmental effects, both of which are affected by the thermal environment. Evolution or development at lower environmental temperatures results in increased body size in fruitflies, however, the reasons for these adaptations remain elusive. To investigate whether larger size is favoured at lower temperature through natural selection on adult males, life-span and age-specific-fertility of males from lines artificially selected for increased and decreased body size were examined at two different temperatures. Larger males were found to be fitter than controls at both temperatures, but the difference in fitness was much greater at the lower experimental temperature. Smaller males did not perform significantly differently from controls at either experimental temperature. These findings suggest that thermal selection for larger adult males is at least in part responsible for evolution of larger body size at lower temperatures in this species. An investigation into the evolution of plasticity of body size traits was performed. The phenotypic plasticity of body size and its components; cell size and cell number, were examined by rearing populations of flies that had evolved in constant and variable thermal environments at two different experimental temperatures. Plasticity of body size was comparable among all of the populations examined, however, plasticity of both cellular components of body size was significantly greater in flies adapted to variable thermal environments. The lifespan and fecundity of eight replicated populations of continually mated flies from a cline along the Eastern coast of Australia, when maintained at two different temperatures in the laboratory, was also examined, and no latitudinal trend in either longevity or lifetime fecundity was observed. However, there were some differences in the pattern of fecundity over the lifetime of individuals along the cline.

T1  - Ecology and evolution of an annual plant following fire in the Mojave Desert
AN  - 304741563
AB  - Plant succession following disturbance in deserts is difficult to study because there is no well-defined series of species replacements and “successional stages” contain many of the same plant species. Persistence of the same species through successional stages introduces the possibility that desert species could respond to natural selection induced by disturbed environments. This study details changes in perennial vegetation, plant distribution, and small-scale abiotic environments on the scale of individual annual plants in order to examine corresponding changes in plant character phenotypes and natural selection in response to disturbance caused by fire. Two burned and two unburned populations of the Mojave Desert annual plant, Amsinckia tessellata were compared in a Coleogyne ramossisima dominated shrubland in Joshua Tree National Park.    Perennial community composition was drastically altered by burning, and  A. tessellata distribution did not significantly change. However, the microhabitat (light, temperature, and soil moisture) experienced by  A. tessellata individuals differed between sites only sporadically, mostly during early spring months. The most dramatic effect of burning upon plant phenotypes was in altering plant response to microhabitat. Plants from burned sites responded to microhabitat in a less predictable and more temporally heterogeneous manner. Phenotypic variation and natural selection were estimated and compared between burned and unburned sites for three components of fitness and lifetime fitness. Phenotypic variation of plant characters and fitness variables was considerably higher in the novel burned environment for most of the plant characters measured. However, total linear selection was neither consistently stronger nor weaker in burned habitats for most character groups. Negative nonlinear (variance decreasing) selection coefficients were not more common in unburned sites compared to burned sites except for a single character group and fitness component. The two years showed highly variable selection, likely because the first sampling year was a high rainfall El Nino year while the second was an average rainfall year. Despite the temporal and spatial variation associated with the abiotic environment and selection between burned and unburned environments, A. tessellata populations could potentially diverge in response to changes in the environment wrought by disturbance.

T1  - Dynamics of adaptive evolution in two experimental viral systems
AN  - 304719612
AB  - Two species of coliphage were adapted to a novel thermal environment (44°) by serial passaging in a homogenous environment at a low multiplicity of infection. Genomewide nucleotide changes were identified by whole genome sequencing. Both phage achieved tremendous gains in fitness in the new environment during the course of the experiments with little or no loss of fitness in the ancestral environment. Although the number of mutations underlying the fitness gains varied greatly between the two systems, early large-effect mutations were common to both phage. Five missense mutations were observed during the adaptation of &phis;X174; the first two substitutions were responsible for 85% of the total fitness gain. Adaptation to a less extreme environment (41.5°) was necessary before G4 could be adapted to 44°. Seventeen mutations were observed: 14 missense, two silent, and one intergenic. The first three missense substitutions accounted for over half the ultimate fitness increase. The order in which mutations occurred was determined by probing archived isolates with radiolabeled oligonucleotides. This revealed the surprising result of extensive polymorphism in both phage systems. While there was evidence of epistasis, many of the mutations were beneficial in a variety of genetic backgrounds. Although many adaptive pathways were available, other factors, such as mutational rate heterogeneity, limited the number of pathways that were likely to be followed. This study provides the most complete descriptions to date of the adaptive evolution of a microbial system.

T1  - Ecological studies of larval <i>Glyptotendipes paripes</i> (Chironomidae: Diptera) in selected central Florida lakes for creating an exploratory temporal and spatial model of nuisance populations
AN  - 304694216
AB  - Ecological and physiological influences on the chironomid midge,  Glyptotendipes paripes, were examined to develop a qualitative spatial and temporal computer model of larval distributions in central Florida lakes. Larval population distributions of G. paripes were examined over a two-year period in three central Florida lakes (Dora, Yale, and Wauburg) in relation to selected water and sediment physico-chemical properties. Lake bathymetry and sediment physical compositions were extensively mapped in each lake. Composition of midge larvae in the gut contents of fish in relation to the standing crop of midge larvae in Lakes Dora and Yale was studied. Development times for immature G. paripes were determined in the laboratory by rearing under a series of constant temperatures. These data were used to construct an exploratory spatio-temporal computer model of G. paripes  larval distributions in central Florida lakes.    Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the primary, significant influences on distributions of G. paripes larvae in the study lakes were water depth and the following physico-chemical sediment characteristics: dry weight, total organic carbon and presence of sand, muck or vegetation. While G. paripes larval distributions tended to be associated with shallower, sandy substrates in Lakes Dora and Wauburg, these larvae were distributed over/in muck bottom areas of Lake Yale. The development requirements of this species were calculated to be 716 degree-days above 9.0°C from egg to emergence. Gut content analysis indicated that bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were indiscriminate feeders on midge larvae in shallower portions of the lakes and larvae in deeper portions of the lakes perhaps were not within the grazing range of the fish. When validated against previously collected data from Lakes Jesup and Monroe, the computer model successfully estimated G. paripes larval distributions. The final model was effective at estimating larval distributions in Lakes Dora, Yale and Wauburg with the exception of the field data collected from Lakes Dora and Yale during the latter part of the field study. Further work is needed to determine and understand the environmental conditions that produced the unusual changes in G. paripes distributions noted in these lakes that resulted in model predictions deviating from field data. Theoretical manipulations of conditions within the model produced results that indicated the model to be useful in preliminary ecological studies by providing initial hypotheses on G. paripes larval population responses to selected environmental conditions studies.

T1  - A critical review of techniques used for the comparison of power generation systems on grounds of safety and environmental impacts, incorporating case studies of coal and hydropower generation systems in southern Brazil. (BL: DXN056929)
AN  - 301582685
AB  - This thesis discuses the usefulness and practicality of modern analytical techniques including life cycle analysis, environmental impact assessment, risk analysis and social costing as applied to decision making over future power generation systems. These techniques originate primarily from northern states whereas they are now being applied in southern countries. This thesis examines the utility of these methodologies in the south, in particular, in Brazil.
 In a review of three major studies that attempted to advance the methodology of comparative assessment of fuel chains it was found that the outcome of ranking the relative merits, on environmental and health grounds, was method-dependent. Two approaches clearly identified a ranking in which fossil fuel chains, particularly coal, have higher social costs due to estimated impacts of atmospheric pollutants on the general public and global warming. On the other hand, the other reported health risk estimates that to a larger extent overlapped, identifying the wind off-shore alternative as the one with highest mortality estimate.
 In this thesis risk assessment techniques based on actuarial and dose response functions were tested against four case studies in Southern Brazil. The use of the actuarial approach, based on mortality risk statistics collected in Brazil, reveals that difficulties of applying this type of technique in the Brazilian context. The biggest problem is simply lack of data on the health risks of the many activities that are associated with fuel changes assessed. For the hydropower plants, the main source of mortality risk was estimated to be related to construction activities, while for the power plants operation of power plants and coal transport were estimated as the main sources of mortality risk. First it is necessary to point out that the activities that showed higher risk are the ones which are more demanding on the workforce. As long as the mortality risk and individual risks are kept within accepted levels more demanding activities on the workforce will generate more employment which, while increasing the numbers of accidents, is an important benefit of these projects either during construction or during operation. An important caveat is the uncertainties in the estimation of road transport risks which showed the potential for these to dominate the analysis.

T1  - Geographic physiological variation and northern range limits in the cottonmouth (<i>Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma</i>)
AN  - 252134046
AB  - Studies of the factors that influence the distribution of organisms are central to ecological research. Previous work on limiting factors in the establishment of an organism's geographic range has traditionally focused on survivorship. In my approach, I consider sublethal range-limiting mechanisms. Cottonmouths are excellent model organisms for studying sublethal northern range-limiting factors. Within their range, cottonmouths are often common and locally abundant. Despite their apparent adaptability, cottonmouths do not range above 38°N latitude. The lack of a more northerly distribution is unusual for several reasons and I tested several possible explanations for the current southern distribution of cottonmouths.    In order to assess the possibility of reproduction as a sublethal range-limiting mechanism, I investigated the effects of a natural and experimental temperature/photoperiod regime on testosterone cycles of male cottonmouths. Testosterone concentrations were measured in three groups. The first was a field group. The second was a lab control group, which received approximated natural temperature and photoperiod conditions for Northwestern Arkansas. The third was an experimental lab group, which received approximated temperature and photoperiod conditions of a region above the cottonmouth's northern range limit. Both the field and lab control groups demonstrated a single testosterone peak in August. The experimental group also demonstrated a single peak, but the peak was phase shifted by one month to September. Through the coupling of energetic calculations with time and environmental temperature, I demonstrated how male cottonmouths may eliminate the breeding cycle and how reproductive failure may serve as a sublethal range-limiting mechanism.    To address the possibility of metabolism as a potential sublethal range-limiting mechanism, I investigated geographic variation in resting metabolic rates of cottonmouths along a latitudinal gradient in central (Louisiana) and peripheral (Missouri, Arkansas) populations. I detected a significant effects and interactions of body mass, temperature, time of day, and latitude of origin. Metabolic cold adaptation appears to operate in cottonmouths from northern populations. Energetic calculations show that while hibernation metabolism is more costly near the northern range limit, it is most likely not a northern range-limiting factor.

T1  - Testing the viability and significance of magma mixing in continental arcs using the Sierra Nevada batholith, California, as an example
AN  - 251796371
AB  - The occurrence of contemporaneous, chemically diverse rock types (including diorite, granodiorite and granite) in magmatic arcs suggests a genetic relationship among them. Field and geochemical studies in the Mesozoic Sierra Nevada batholith of California indicate that end member magma mixing between 52 weight percent SiO2 basalts (chemically similar to dioritic plutons of the batholith) and 72 weight percent SiO2 granites is an important process in generating chemical diversity in that arc. Additionally, isotopic data for Sierran arc rocks indicate that two distinct mixing processes occurred: open system (granites represent reworked pre-Mesozoic crustal rocks) and closed system (granites represent juvenile additions to the crust). The concept of closed system mixing is new to petrology and is herein termed “internal mixing”. The concept of internal mixing is hypothesized to occur between basaltic liquids and granitic liquids derived through partial melting of penecontemporaneous diorites, and is supported by chemical, isotopic and geochronologic data for some suites of Sierran rocks. Further support for this hypothesis comes from the demonstration that Sierran granites are chemically comparable to experimentally derived partial melts of Sierran diorites. Recognition of internal mixing processes dramatically increases estimates of juvenile material present in the arc and coincidentally increases estimates of crustal growth rates in the arc.    New numerical models of magma mixing that account for the recent recognition that arc basaltic magmas often contain up to 8 weight percent H2O offer additional validity to the hypothesis that mixing can be an important process in arc magmatism. Calculation of liquidus temperatures, magma viscosities and densities for hydrous high-alumina basaltic liquids demonstrate that the addition of water reduces or eliminates recognized barriers to mixing between dry basaltic and granitic magmas. Consequently, magma mixing is presented as a viable and important mechanism for generation of intermediate composition magmas that dominate the eruptive and intrusive products of continental arcs. Furthermore, mixing is presented as an important process in the generation of Earth's continental crust.

T1  - The role of habitat quality in shaping evolutionary dynamics, population dynamics, and conservation planning
AN  - 251737772
AB  - Understanding ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation in habitat quality is increasingly important as biologists seek to address human-mediated environmental change. I investigated effects of natural temperature variation on individual fitness and population dynamics of Drosophila melanogaster  inhabiting rotting apples in orchards. I also examined how critical habitat designations have influenced recovery plans for threatened and endangered species.    I exposed D. melanogaster to field temperatures in rotting apples and measured survivorship and development time. Extreme temperatures in sun-exposed apples reduced survivorship of D. melanogaster by more than 50% relative to that in shaded apples. This difference is comparable to that caused by seasonal changes in ambient temperature, and suggested that selection will target traits conferring greater heat resistance.    I next conducted a 3 x 2 factorial experiment that revealed an interaction effect of ethanol and temperature variation between shaded and sun-exposed apples on development time. Adverse effects of high ethanol concentrations and extreme temperatures in sun-exposed apples mitigated one another. Expected correlation between selection for ethanol and heat resistance depends on whether this result derived from cross-induction of physiological stress responses or abiotic interactions between temperature and ethanol.    To test an hypothesis that habitat heterogeneity reduces climate-induced population variability, I established populations of D. melanogaster  during summer and autumn in large field cages that enclosed “landscapes” of rotting apples. I manipulated habitat heterogeneity with shade cloth to create homogeneous landscapes of either shaded or sun-exposed apples, and heterogeneous landscapes with both. Population density and growth rate varied less between summer and autumn in heterogeneous cages than in either homogeneous treatment. These results suggested that managing for habitat heterogeneity may reduce population variability and thus mitigate risks of stochastic extinction.    Lastly, I examined how critical habitat designations influenced recovery plans for threatened and endangered species. Plans for species with critical habitat were not more likely than others to prescribe habitat-based recovery actions or habitat-based recovery criteria. Findings suggested that recovery plans for endangered species have not benefited from critical habitat designations and raised questions about how policies might be amended so that future recovery plans will benefit.

T1  - Evolution of microstructure and defect structure in manganese-aluminum-based permanent magnet alloys
AN  - 250741972
AB  - In this study, the transformation behavior of MnAl-based ferromagnetic alloys was investigated. The low-cost and availability of the Mn-Al base metals along with their high mechanical strength, machineability and high magnetic energy product (BH) per unit weight make these materials attractive candidates for permanent magnet applications. These alloys derive their magnetic properties from the metastable L10 τ-phase, which generally appears towards the Mn-rich side of the near equiatomic composition. The magnetic properties of these materials are strongly influenced by the microstructure and characteristic defect structure of the τ-phase. The τ-phase exhibits a unique defect structure, which includes twins, stacking faults, anti-phase domain boundaries and dislocations. Understanding the true nature of defect generation is necessary in order to be able to develop processing techniques to enhance and optimize the properties of these materials.    The τ-phase derives from a phase mixture of &egr;(hcp) and &egr; ′(B19) phases through various heat treatment processes. Controversial mechanisms are reported in the literature regarding the nature of the &egr; + &egr;′ → τ transformation. Phase transformation mechanisms that are displacive and those involving a massive transformation have been reported. In this study, the true nature of the τ-phase formation was investigated experimentally by utilizing techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and in-situ TEM heating experiments. It was shown that both of the transformation modes, i.e. massive and displacive mechanisms, can operate and result in τ-phase formation. The atomic nature of the displacive transformation was studied in detail to elucidate the viability of transformation of a two-phase mixture into a single phase through a shear transformation. In the absence of stress, the massive mode was shown to dominate microstructural evolution in bulk materials.    The isothermal nucleation and growth kinetics of the massive transformation were quantitatively studied and compared with similar alloy systems. The nature of growth interfaces, which are believed to play a major role on the generation of the defect structure of the τ-phase, and planar defects were extensively studied by electron microscopy. Models for defect generation were developed to account for the extraordinary defect density in the τ-phase.

T1  - Actin-based motility in a geometrically simplified system
AN  - 220012957
AB  - Actin polymerization is required for the generation of motile force at the leading edge of both lamellipodia and filopodia and also at the surface of motile intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes . Local catalysis of actin filament polymerization is accomplished in L. monocytogenes by the bacterial protein ActA through nucleation of actin only at one pole, allowing asymmetric formation of an actin “comet tail” and unidirectional movement. Small polystyrene beads (≤0.5 μm diameter) coated uniformly with ActA protein can break symmetry and undergo directional movement in an actin-rich cytoplasmic extract if local asymmetries are built up by random fluctuations of actin filament density or thermal motion. Thus the actin polymerization-based motility generated by ActA can be employed to move non-biological cargo, as has previously been demonstrated for classical motor molecules such as kinesin and myosin. Initiation of unidirectional movement of a symmetrically coated particle is a function of bead size and surface protein density. Larger beads (up to 2 μm diameter) can initiate movement only if surface asymmetry is introduced by coating the beads on one hemisphere or if the Xenopus laevis egg extract is diluted, effectively decreasing extract viscosity. Extract viscosity does not affect the average speed. Observations of actin-based motility in diluted extract allow us to separate symmetry-breaking and tail elongation into two distinct processes and begin to delineate what is required for each. The host cell factors involved in comet tail formation include some of the same proteins found to be involved in lamellipodial protrusion in motile cells. Does this protein component conservation also mean that the ultrastructure of these two motile systems are similar? By performing platinum replica electron microscopy using the simplified system of ActA-coated beads in a range of dilutions of  X. laevis egg extract, we found that actin comet tails have a branched organization very similar to that seen in lamellipodia. Arp2/3 localizes to Y-junctions and S1 decoration shows correct directionality at those branch points. However, unlike filaments in lamellipodia, the actin filaments of the comet tail appear strikingly twisted and under significant torsional stress.

T1  - The Practice of Dance Teaching Within the National Curriculum at Key Stages 3/4 in Yorkshire Schools
AN  - 2130125960
AB  - This research was motivated by a desire to see a greater number of Key Stage (KS) 3/4 pupils (11-16 years of age) given the opportunity to experience Dance in schools. Preliminary investigative research in Yorkshire revealed considerable variations in levels of teachers' knowledge and understanding of dance and pedagogy, suggesting that pupils' dance experiences varied accordingly. This provoked an investigation to discover who was teaching dance, what was taught under the title of dance and how dance was taught to the 11-16 age group. An extensive and comprehensive literature review revealed a paucity of empirical research focused on the practice of dance teaching in schools. The research problem was investigated using quantitative and qualitative research methods. The three research instruments: questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and lesson observations were piloted in Leeds and refined for the main research in Yorkshire. Responses to the questionnaires (175 teachers and 23 dance artists/animateurs, giving a total sample of N=198) were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods of analysis. A purposive sample of six questionnaire respondents (two female specialist dance teachers, two female teachers who taught Dance as part of Physical Education and one male and one female dance artist/animateur) were subsequently selected for individual interviews and lesson observations. The Non-numerical Data Indexing Searching and Theorizing (NUDIST) software was used to analyse the transcribed semi-structured interviews. The observations focused on the use of different teaching styles and were analysed in accordance with those proposed by Mosston (1986). The teacher's location in the dance space was based on Gray's use of a Spatial Mapping Plan (1984a; 1984b; 1989). Results from the descriptive statistical analysis revealed that respondents favoured Creative Dance, using predominantly Reproductive teaching styles combined with Mid-Range teaching styles at KS 3. All the styles were used almost equally at KS 4 with Mid- Range most frequently selected. Four experimental Hypotheses stated that the respondents' selection of dance genre; the choice of teaching styles at KS 3 and KS 4; and opinions of dance issues, will vary with Gender (IV 1) and Years of Dance Teaching Experience (IV 3). These Hypotheses were all rejected at the .05 level as no significant differences were found. The interviews and observations supported the findings of the questionnaire. A significant influence on pupils' learning appeared to be the teacher's use of space increasing his/her accessibility to all pupils. In conclusion, the research demonstrates that teachers focus on the teaching of Creative, Expressive, Educative dance genre in Yorkshire secondary schools, and they further indicate that composition, performance and appreciation are fundamental traits of dance experience. Practical classes followed the familiar format of introduction/warm-up, development and conclusion. Above all, the results demonstrate a need for greater knowledge and understanding of dance and pedagogy if it is to be promoted as an important part of the curriculum. Increased levels of appropriate Initial Teacher Training (ITT) and In-Service courses are necessary to develop teachers' expertise and confidence, and enable more pupils to have the opportunity to experience Dance in school.

T1  - STUDIES ON HEREDITARY CHARACTER OF SEX-LIMETED BLACK NEWLY-HATCHED LARVAE
TT  - 家蚕限性黑蚁遗传性状的研究
AN  - 1027901755
AB  - This paper is a further step into the research on characteristics and their expression mechanisms in order to discover the hereditary mechanisms of silkworm temperature-sensitivity. This paper analyzes both the expression periods of silkworm temperature-sensitivity and hereditary effects of incubation under high temperature and low humidity (HTLH) conditions on silkworm offspring, and, by applying RAPD technique, searches for the molecular marker of temperature-sensitive allele. The results are as follows:
1.	Using xianban as laboratory materials, the experiments show that, the HTLH condition  over 20 hours during the periods of head bluing or bluishing of silkworm eggs is conducive to the expression of temperature-sensitivity, which condition has no accumulative effects on the induction of temperature-sensitivity.
The relationship experiments between the exposure to HTLH during different periods of embryo stages of silkworm eggs, and the hatching of female or male silkworms, shows that the sensitive periods of temperature-sensitivity induction are the first and second days before hatching. During this period, the total protein and RNA are significant different, which might be the induction result of the temperature-sensitive allele. This physiological and biochemical phenomena of embryo prove that the periods of head bluing and bluishing are the sensitive periods of inductive expression of temperature-sensitive genes. The significant differences of the total protein and RNA in silkworm eggs two days before hatching might be the reason of the inductive expression of temperature-sensitive genes of silkworm eggs.
2.	The fasting vitality of newly-hatched larvae under condition of natural temperature and humidity is 
higher than that under condition of high temperature and low humidity. Under incubation conditions of natural temperature and humidity, or high temperature and low humidity, the fasting vitality of the chocolate newly-hatched larvae is higher than that of the black newly-hatched larvae. The further researches on the incubation condition's effects on the vitality of offspring newly-hatched larvae show that HTLH incubation effects the vitality of offspring newly-hatched larvae through effecting the current generation's physique.
3.	The male moth from the newly-hatched larvae under HTLH incubation   
Condition, when used as male parent in crossing, may cause decreasing of hatching ratio of offspring eggs; the female moth, has trend of increasing compared to that from natural temperature and humidity incubation condition; the ratio of unfertilized eggs has decreasing trend.
The emergence breeding from newly-hatched larvae, from silkworm eggs under HTLH(HTLH) and natural temperature and humidity (NTH) incubation condition, are grouped into such groups as HTLH ♀X NTH♂、NTH ♀X HTLH♂、HTLH ♀X HTLH♂、NTH♀ X NTH♂, and the amount of laid eggs among each group, whose offspring silkworm eggs are incubated under natural condition, is not significantly different. 
4.	Using OPE-15 as primer, and DNA of the black newly-hatched larva as template, the RAPD amplification produces a specific DNA fragment of about 150bp, while the chocolate newly-hatched larva doesn't produce this band.

1．本试验用限伴作为研究材料，经实验证明，蚕卵在蚕胚胎发育的点青期或转青期接触高温干燥20小时以上，均能够诱导温敏性的表达，且高温干燥对温敏性的诱导没有累积效应。
蚕卵在胚胎发育不同阶段接触高温干燥与雌雄蚕孵出的关系试验表明，蚕卵温敏性诱导的敏感期在蚕孵化前的第一、二天。在此阶段，蚕卵的总蛋白和总RNA发生比较明显的变化，这可能是蚕卵温敏性基因被诱导表达的结果。从这一胚胎生理生化的变化现象进一步旁证了温敏基因被诱导表达的敏感期在点青期至转青期。蚕卵的总蛋白和总RNA都在蚕卵孵化前两天发生比较明显的变化可能是蚕卵温敏性基因被诱导表达的原因。
2．自然温湿条件下催青孵化出的蚁蚕的绝食生命力高于高温干燥催青孵化出的蚁蚕的绝食生命力。在自然温湿或高温干燥两种催青条件下，孵化出的赤蚁蚕的绝食生命力均比黑蚁的绝食生命力高。进一步研究不同催青条件对后代蚁蚕生命力的影响，结果表明高温干燥催青通过影响当代蚕的体质而对后代的蚁蚕绝食生命力产生一些影响效应。
3．蚕卵在高温干燥条件下催青，孵出的蚁蚕经饲养而发育成的雄蛾，用其作杂交的父本有使后代卵的孵化率降低的趋势；雌蛾，其后代卵的孵化率与自然温湿的雌蛾相比有升高的趋势；不受精卵率则有降低的趋势。
在高温干燥和自然温湿条件下催青的蚕卵，孵出蚁蚕经饲养至化蛾，组配成高温干燥♀×自然温湿♂、自然温湿♀×高温干燥♂、高温干燥♀×高温干燥♂、自然温湿♀×自然温湿♂等组合，其后代的蚕卵在自然条


件下催青时，各组合间的产卵量差异不显著。
4．以OPE?5为引物，黑蚁蚕的DNA 为模板进行RAPD扩增时，得到一条约250bp特异性的DNA片段，而赤蚁的RAPD扩增产物没有此条带。初步推测该特异性扩增条带可能与控制家蚕限性黑蚁性状的易位基因有关。

T1  - Selection for improved feed utilization in Atlantic salmon
AN  - 304678738
AB  - The thesis, which is based on five experiments, discusses possible selection strategies for improving feed utilization in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).    Relative feed intake (DFI), thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and feed efficiency ratio (FER) were significantly higher in offspring from a selected line than those from a wild, unselected line (Paper I). The higher growth of the selected line was the result of both greater feed consumption and more efficient feed utilization for growth. This implies that selection for increased growth in Atlantic salmon may improve both of these traits.    Accumulation of yttrium in tissues was very low and not related to weight gain of individual Atlantic salmon fed diets containing YCl3 ( Paper II). Since growth and feed intake is highly correlated, it is concluded that YCl3 is not suitable as a bio-marker for measuring feed intake. Long-term feed intake and feed utilization can now only be recorded for families of salmon reared in separate cages or tanks.    A significant family component indicates that the variation in DFI, TGC and FER in freshwater-reared Atlantic salmon has a genetic component ( Paper III). The response in feed utilization declines as growth is increased. A significant family component for the deposition of energy per kg weight gain, indicates a possibility to improve feed utilization in Atlantic salmon by selection for less energy in weight gain.    A significant effect of sire for the apparent absorption coefficients (AAC) of K, Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe suggests that the variation in AAC of elements in seawater-reared Atlantic salmon is partly governed by genetic factors ( Paper IV). The AACs of K, Cu, Mg and Zn were correlated to body weight and/or growth rate.    Estimated heritabilities for AAC of elements and a significant family component for AAC of amino acids, indicate that the variation in AAC of elements and amino acids in freshwater-reared Atlantic salmon has a significant additive genetic component (Paper V). This implies that these traits may be changed by the ongoing selection for increased growth in Atlantic salmon, and should be monitored and possibly used as selection criteria to prevent undesirable correlated responses.

T1  - Development of a high power density combustion system for a silicon micro gas turbine engine
AN  - 304660080
AB  - As part of an effort to develop a microfabricated gas turbine engine capable of providing 10–50 Watts of electrical power in a package less than one cubic centimeter in volume, this thesis presents the design, fabrication, packaging and testing of the first combustion system for a silicon micro heat engine. The design and operation of a microcombustor is fundamentally limited by the chemical reaction times of the fuel, by silicon material and fabrication constraints, and by the inherently non-adiabatic nature of the operating space. This differs from the design of a modern macrocombustion system that is typically driven by emissions, stability, durability and pattern factor requirements. The combustor developed herein is shown to operate at a power density level that is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of any other power-MEMS device (2000 MW/m3), and establishes the viability of using high power density, silicon-based combustion systems for heat engine applications at the micro-scale.    This thesis presents the development of two specific devices—the first device is a 3-wafer level microcombustor that established the viability of non-premixed hydrogen-air combustion in a volume as small as 0.066 cm 3, and within the structural constraints of silicon; the second device is known as the engine “static-structure”, and integrated the 3-stack micro combustor with the other non-rotating components of the engine. Fabricated by aligned fusion bonding of 6 silicon wafers, the static structure measures 2.1 cm x 2.1 cm x 0.38 cm, and was largely fabricated by deep reactive ion etching through a total thickness of 3,800 μm. Packaged with a set of fuel plenums, pressure ports, fuel injectors, igniters, fluidic interconnects, and compressor and turbine static airfoils, this structure is the first demonstration of the complete hot flow path of a multi-level microengine. The 0.195 cm 3 combustion chamber has been tested for several tens of hours and is shown to sustain stable hydrogen combustion with exit gas temperatures above 1600K and combustor efficiencies as high as 95%. The structure also serves as the first experimental demonstration of hydrocarbon microcombustion with power density levels of 500 MW/m3 and 140 MW/m 3 for ethylene-air and propane-air combustion, respectively.    In addition to the development of the two combustion devices, this thesis also presents simple analytical models to identify and explain the primary drivers of combustion phenomena at the micro-scale. The chemical efficiency of the combustor is shown to have a strong correlation with the Damkohler number in the chamber, and asymptotes to unity for sufficiently large values of Da. The maximum power density of the combustor is also shown to be primarily limited by the structural and fabrication constraints of the material.    Overall, this thesis synthesizes experimental and computational results to propose a simple design methodology for microcombustion devices, and to present design recommendations for future microcombustor development. Combined with parallel efforts to develop thin-film igniters and temperature sensors for the engine, it serves as the first experimental demonstration of the design, fabrication, packaging and operation of a silicon-based combustion system for power generation applications at the micro-scale.

T1  - Breeding soundness evaluation of Zebu bulls with special reference to variations in clinical parameters and sperm characteristics in sires extensively managed in the dry tropics of Costa Rica
AN  - 304653343
AB  - This thesis aimed to investigate the breeding soundness of Zebu ( Bos indicus) bulls extensively managed in Costa Rica, with special reference to the identification of variables associated with their final ranking as potential breeders. Particular attention was paid to the prevalence of sperm abnormalities in the ejaculate, as well as eventual seasonal variations-and their causes-in clinical parameters and the spermiogramme.    Breeding soundness evaluations (BSE) were performed under field conditions in Bos indicus (Bi) (n = 598),  Bos taurus (Bt) (n = 252) and Bos indicus  × Bos taurus bulls (Bi × Bt) ( n = 48) in four different climatic regions of Costa Rica. Low scrotal circumference (SC; less than 30 cm) was the most common clinical finding in bulls more than 2 years of age. The percentage of unsound bulls with sperm abnormalities in the ejaculate, especially head defects and proximal droplets, increased as SC decreased (P < 0.05), being higher in bulls having a decreased testicular consistency (TC) (P < 0.001) and long scrotum (P < 0.01). Frequencies of sperm abnormalities were also higher in bulls less than 2 years of age than in older sires (P < 0.01) and were highest in Bi × Bt bulls (P < 0.001). The prevalence of bulls unsound for breeding was lower (P < 0.01) in Bi sires (29%), intermediate in Bt (41%) and higher in Bi × Bt (48%).    Sperm morphological examinations in 302 Zebu bulls, aged 1.5–9 years, from the dry Pacific zone of Costa Rica, confirmed the relationship between sperm morphology and clinical andrological parameters.    The fine morphology of testes and cauda epididymides from 11 sexually mature Zebu bulls with normal (n = 3) or decreased TC ( n = 8) at palpation was also studied.    The overall results confirm the higher adaptability of Zebu bulls to the tropical environment, as well as the relationship between SL, SC and TC with testicular normality and, therefore, with a normal sperm morphology in the ejaculate. The findings also suggest that nutrition, rather than ambient temperature, is the major factor contributing to variations in the reproductive function of Zebu bulls in the tropics.

T1  - Evolutionary potential of the annual legume, <i>Chamaecrista fasciculata</i>, in relation to global warming
AN  - 304615241
AB  - Impending climate change will test the capacity of plant populations to evolve heat and drought tolerance. The goal of this research was to assess the evolutionary potential of populations of an annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, to novel conditions due to global warming employing a quantitative genetic approach. Climate models suggest that southern populations currently experience a climate similar to that which is predicted for northern populations in the future. Investigation into the magnitude and nature of genetic variation for performance of northern populations across a range of environments will provide insight into limits to adaptation. I sampled populations from an aridity gradient in the Great Plains in Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, northern Oklahoma, and southern Oklahoma. In a pair of greenhouse drought experiments, I found clinal variation among these populations with respect to morphological traits, phenotypic plasticity, and physiological response to drought. Furthermore, there was a reversal in the effect of watering such that northern populations had higher fecundity in well-watered conditions whereas the opposite was true for the most southern population. Pedigreed lines from three populations (MN, KS, and southern OK) were produced by controlled crosses in the greenhouse and progeny were reciprocally planted into field sites in MN, KS, and OK. Phenotypic selection analysis demonstrated that selection regimes differ among the field sites. Short phenology and thin leaves are favored in the north, whereas slower phenology and thick leaves are favored in the south. With few exceptions, quantitative genetic analyses indicated that all populations harbor substantial genetic variance for these traits in all environments. However, although the northern population exhibits relatively high mean fitness in terms of fecundity and expresses significant genetic variance in the intermediate site, it has substantially lower fitness and no significant additive genetic variation in the southern site. The additive genetic correlation structure of northern populations across environments does not indicate a constraint to evolutionary response. However, selection response is predicted to be severely constrained by among-trait additive genetic correlations that are not in accord with the direction of selection. Modest responses to selection may prove biologically significant in an incrementally changing environment.

T1  - The evolutionary significance of melanism in the common garter snake, <i>Thamnophis sirtalis</i>
AN  - 304612893
AB  - Evolution is defined as a change in gene frequency over time and occurs via several mechanisms, including natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation. This study investigates the first three mechanisms in populations of the common garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis. High levels of melanism (black coloration) occur in island and mainland populations in the western basin of Lake Erie. The frequency of melanism varies among populations but is stable within populations. Color pattern is probably determined at one locus with melanism recessive to normal coloration. Dorsal coloration may influence natural selection in two ways. Melanism may be advantageous if dark coloration increases heating rates or equilibrium temperatures. However, melanism may be detrimental if reduced crypsis leads to greater detection by predators.    To determine how melanistic snakes differ from normal snakes, I tested for associations of color pattern with morphology, growth, and behavior and found melanism may be associated with a greater number of subcaudal scales, a slower growth rate in mass, and a longer latency to move. To determine whether melanistics differ in thermal properties, I measured heating rates and equilibrium temperatures in matched pairs of normal and melanistic snakes. I found no thermal differences among neonates or subadults, suggesting that if melanism provides a thermal advantage, it is restricted to larger body sizes. To determine whether melanistics are subject to greater predation, I measured predation intensity using clay models. I found no difference in attack rate between normal and melanistic snake models.    In addition to these selection hypotheses, I also examined the role of population size, gene flow, and genetic drift. Estimation of population sizes suggests that some populations are small enough for genetic drift to influence allele frequencies. However, estimation of gene flow from patterns of molecular variation using FST- and coalescent-based approaches suggests that gene flow is high (greater than 3 migrants per generation). If estimated gene flow rates are correct, genetic drift should be swamped by migration, and variance in morph frequency among populations is better explained by differences in selective regimes. However, if these rates overestimate contemporary gene flow, drift may be primarily responsible for this variance.

T1  - Structural, dielectric, and optical properties of potassium tantalate niobate thin films prepared by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition
AN  - 304612688
AB  - The structure-property relations of potassium tantalate niobate (KTaxNb1−xO 3) thin films have been investigated to assess their viability as nonlinear optical materials. Single phase, epitaxial films were deposited by low pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition over the entire solid solution range. Under optimized growth conditions, the composition of the films could be controlled within 5 atomic percent.    The factors determining the domain structure of the KNbO3 thin films were studied. Thermally-induced strain and depolarization effects were responsible for the film domain structure. For films possessing a mixed domain structure, the volume fraction of each domain variant depended on lattice mismatch. A thickness dependence on the structural, dielectric, and optical properties was observed for the KNbO3 thin films.    The phase diagram of the epitaxial KTaxNb 1−xO3 thin film system was determined from x-ray diffraction and temperature dependent dielectric measurements. At room temperature, the morphotropic boundaries of the films occur at x ≈ 0.30 for the orthorhombic to rhombohedral phase transition and at x ≈ 0.74 for the rhombohedral to cubic phase transition. This differs significantly from the bulk equilibrium phase diagram and is attributed to the lattice misfit strain, which stabilizes the rhombohedral structure over the tetragonal phase.    Second harmonic generation (SHG) of the KNbO3 thin films was strongly influenced by the domain structure. The measured SHG coefficients of unpoled films were typically one to two orders of magnitude lower than the bulk. At normal incidence, this reduction was attributed to the presence of 180° antiparallel domains. However, at oblique incidence, the domain effects were lessened and higher nonlinear optical susceptibilities were obtained. Measured effective susceptibilities ranged from 0.7 to 16.9 pm/V. The SHG susceptibilities for the KTaxNb1− xO3 films was dependent upon composition. The nonlinear optical coefficients decreased with increasing tantalum concentration. The refractive indices and spontaneous polarization also decreased with increasing tantalum content. Crystalline defects in the films also contributed to the second harmonic signal. No second harmonic generation was observed for the KTaO3 thin films as expected from symmetry considerations.

T1  - Consequences of ecological specialization in long-term evolving populations of <i>Escherichia coli</i>

AB  - This dissertation asks two major questions: (1) Does adaptation to a specific environment necessarily cause losses in performance or functionality in other environments? and (2) What are the population genetic mechanisms responsible for any such losses? These questions are addressed using 12 populations of Escherichia coli that evolved in a simple, glucose-limited laboratory environment for 20,000 generations. During this time, all of the populations became progressively better adapted to growth in this environment. In Chapter I, I examine the consequences of this evolution for the bacteria's capacity to utilize 93 substrates, and thereby quantify the extent to which specialization led to losses of function. On average, diet breadth of the evolved populations declined significantly relative to the ancestors, but complete loss of function on any given substrate was rare. I also measured the relative fitness of the evolved populations in four foreign environments, in which improved fitness was frequently found. In Chapter II, I quantify diet breadth after multiple evolutionary time points to determine whether antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) or mutation accumulation (MA) explains a greater proportion of the observed functional decay. The evolution of increased mutation rates in three populations allowed a critical test of the MA model. Mutator lines are expected to lose functions much more rapidly than the wildtype lines under MA, but not under AP, as the rate of adaptive substitution was similar across lines. These classes of lines did not significantly differ in diet breadth, contrary to the predictions of MA. Most losses of function occurred early in the experiment when beneficial mutations were being substituted most rapidly, a pattern that is consistent with AP. Thus, AP appears more important than MA for the tendency toward decreased diet breadth in these evolving populations. In Chapter III, I examine the effects of adaptation to a constant 37° environment on thermal niche. The mean maximum growth rate of all evolved populations increased at moderate temperatures, but decreased at extreme high and low temperatures. Most of these changes in thermal niche occurred over the first 2,000 generations, when selection was most intense. Together these results suggest that AP was responsible for improved performance at moderate temperatures but reduced growth at extreme temperatures. Chapter IV is a case study of functional decay, and focuses on the loss of D-ribose catabolic function that occurred in all populations by generation 2,000. The mutation rate for this loss of function was found to be extremely high and caused by deletions associated with an IS150 element inserted upstream of the operon. Mutants bearing only this mutation also conferred a small benefit in the selective environment. Given these findings, population genetic models suggest that the loss of ribose catabolic function was caused by (i) an unusually high mutation rate, such that these mutants appeared repeatedly in all populations, (ii) a selective advantage in the experimental medium that drove these mutants to fixation, and (iii) linkage of these mutations to other beneficial mutations of larger effect.

T1  - Evolutionary ecology and population genetics of tychoparthenogenesis in the mayfly, <i>Stenonema femoratum</i> (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae)
AN  - 304611351
AB  - Tychoparthenogenesis is characterized by low hatching success of unfertilized eggs, (less than ten percent) from females of typically sexually reproducing species. Because hatching success is low, the predicted two-fold advantage of obligate parthenogenesis does not exist with tychoparthemogenesis. This suggests that some other advantage must be responsible for its maintenance. To investigate the potential adaptive significance of tychoparthenogenesis, I documented population and habitat variation in tychoparthenogenetic capacity and investigated biotic and abiotic correlates of tychoparthenogenesis in the mayfly, Stenonema femoratum. Tychoparthenogenetic capacity (% unfertilized eggs hatching) varied among habitats in 1996, but not in 1997. Temporary stream females had significantly higher tychoparthenogenetic capacities compared to those of permanent streams and lakes. But in 1997, habitats were not significantly different. All populations showed female biased nymph sex ratios. Temporary streams showed low nymph densities compared to the other habitats, however, habitats did not differ in adult density. Tychoparthenogenetic capacity was negatively related to nymph density, suggesting tychoparthenogenesis may function in reproductive assurance. Habitats differed in their abiotic characteristics, however, tychoparthenogenetic capacity was correlated only with water temperature.    Populations with higher tychoparthenogenetic capacities exhibited lower observed heterozygosity, however, all populations contained substantial genetic diversity. Temporary streams showed significantly lower heterozygosity compared to permanent streams and lakes. Fixation index was significantly greater than zero for all but one population, indicating heterozygote deficiencies. Temporary streams had significantly greater fixation indices compared to permanent streams and lakes. Populations showed weak but significant genetic differentiation among subpopulations, possibly due to local clustering of sibs, but there was no significant genetic differentiation among populations, suggesting substantial gene flow among populations.    I estimated population outcrossing rates for two populations. Multilocus outcrossing rates were tm = 0.734 (Little Dixie Lake) and tm = 0.505 (Rock Bridge Gans Creek). Results also indicated biparental inbreeding in LD, but not in RBG. Correlation with selfing was large in both populations, indicating heterogeneity in outcrossing rates. Correlation with paternity was high in both populations, indicating that outcrossed sibs within families were sired by the same father. Progeny sex ratios were female biased, but family outcrossing rate was not correlated with family sex ratio.

T1  - Characterization and assessment of compost for suppression of selected turfgrass diseases
AN  - 304592766
AB  - The use of composts for turfgrass disease management allows for a reduction of pesticide use in traditional chemical control practices. Up to five composts were characterized and evaluated for suppression of turfgrass diseases. The monitoring of temperature and oxygen throughout the composting process was the best method tested in evaluating compost maturity. Controlled environment experiments with selected compost treatments suppressed dollar spot of turf (Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F. T. Bennett) by up to 58% and, in field trials, were not significantly different than fungicide controls (P = 0.05). Similarly, fall applications of compost reduced snow mould (Microdochium nivale Fr. Samuels and Hallet,  Typhula ishikariensis Lasch ex. Fr.) severity to levels not significantly different from fungicide controls and increased green-up of turf (recovery from disease and/or winter dormancy) by up to 63% compared to fungicide and 54% compared to fertilizer controls (P = 0.05). Microbial characterization of composts revealed high culturable colony counts. Moreover, 29% of bacteria isolated displayed proteolytic activity. Two bacterial identification systems gave variable results, whereas phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was a valuable indicator of microbial community dynamics. Many bacterial isolates tested in the plate challenge experiment displayed antagonistic activity towards selected turfgrass pathogens. Antagonistic activity of composts relies on a number of factors, and although their relative importance varies, microbial activity levels, population dynamics, nutrient aspects, as well as other associated chemical and physical factors all have a part in turfgrass disease suppression.

T1  - Intergalactic dust and metals in cosmology
AN  - 304590993
AB  - This thesis addresses the creation, distribution, and cosmological implications of intergalactic dust and heavy elements (‘metals’). Most cosmic metals must have formed in stars in galaxies, yet a significant fraction of all metal lies the in the intergalactic medium (IGM). How these metals escaped their progenitor galaxies is currently an open question, which we address using cosmological N-body/hydrodynamical simulations to which we add prescriptions for the chemical evolution of galaxies and for the ejection of metals into the IGM by dynamical processes, by supernova-driven winds, and by radiation-pressure driven dust efflux. The method provides detailed calculations of the amount and distribution of cosmic metals, and the results demonstrate that winds and radiation pressure—but perhaps not dynamics—might account for most of the intergalactic metal observed, if it was ejected at redshift  z [special characters omitted] 8 from relatively large galaxies. These and other calculations indicate that unless it is largely destroyed during ejection, a significant level of intergalactic (IG) dust should exist. If this dust reddens attenuated light less than dust in galaxies (perhaps due to selective destruction or galactic retention of very small grains), it could seriously affect recent determinations of the Hubble diagram sing Type Ia supernovae, without having been detected by those observations. Intergalactic dust would also reprocess some diffuse extragalactic background light from optical wavelengths into the far-infrared (FIR), and the expected contribution can be compared to observations of the cosmic microwave (CMB) and FIR backgrounds. This strongly constrains the density of IG dust but does not rule out a cosmologically significant level. Finally, we address the question of whether the entire CMB might be dust emission. Such ‘cold big-bang’ models have long provided an alternative to the widely accepted hot big-bang models, but have difficulty accounting for the highly thermal nature of the CMB. We estimate the temperature, calculate the evolution, and discuss the anisotropies of a homogeneous radiation background emitted at high redshift by population III objects and thermalized by a mixture of dust types. These calculations are compared in detail to current observations to assess the current viability of cold big-bang models.

T1  - Studies on postponed aging in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 304583538
AB  - This study utilizes populations of Drosophila melanogaster to study various aspects of postponed aging. For example, in Chapter Two, I measured the return rate of demographic traits under reverse demographic selection, finding that life span rapidly approached the level of the control population. Starvation resistance and the S allele of Phosphoglucomutase also fell within the 67 generations of this experiment, while early fecundity increased within the same time frame, suggesting that antagonistic pleiotropy governs these life-history characters. Desiccation resistance, on the other hand, continues to be maintained at the same level as that of the ancestral stock, suggesting mutation accumulation as the mechanism for its evolution.    In Chapter Three, I investigate the implications of the maintenance of a selection response upon relaxation by imposing relaxed stress selection on stocks selected for enhanced resistance to starvation and desiccation stress, and then observing the response to reverse selection. I found that after 35 generations of relaxed selection, longevity, early fecundity, and desiccation resistance have not changed significantly in the relaxed desiccation populations, suggesting that the alleles affecting these characters lack significant antagonistic pleiotropy. Starvation resistance, on the other hand, rose significantly in the relaxed desiccation populations, indicating that they have responded to the new selection regime. These results suggest that significant erosion or reversal of selection responses upon relaxation is not a general phenomenon. Also, patterns of correlated response to upward selection may not be preserved in the response to relaxed selection. This illustrates a more general point that the evolutionary and genetic relationships between characters may not be fixed even over short periods of evolution, a point of salience for evolutionary models that assumed such fixity.    RNA's for the heat shock protein (hsp) genes hsp22 and  hsp23 have previously been found to be induced during Drosophila  aging, suggesting that these genes might have specific functions at late ages. Thus, Northern blot analysis was used to determine if selection for increased lifespan has affected the expression of several small hsp genes. I found a consistent upregulation of hsp22 RNA levels in all five postponed senescence stocks relative to their controls (Chapter Four).    In Chapter Five, ten new outbred population were created by crossing inbred laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Five populations were selected for postponed senescence, and five were maintained as controls. I tested whether patterns of indirect response observed in the original populations selected for postponed senescence can be altered significantly by using populations with a very different genetic history. Imposing selection for increased longevity results in a significant increase in longevity. At the same time, early fecundity for the five selected stocks falls below that of the control populations. A related character, starvation resistance, does not seem to be changing during the 22 generations of selection. And, if it is differentiating, it is doing so in the opposite direction from that observed previously.

T1  - Juvenile Pacific herring (<i>Clupea pallasi</i>) feeding ecology in Prince William Sound, Alaska
AN  - 304580344
AB  - Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) are commercially exploited along the Asiatic and North American Pacific Ocean continental shelves. In Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska, herring were commercially important until a year class failures in 1993. A noticeable lack of life history information on juveniles was available in PWS to use for studies addressing the failed recruitment. This study describes the seasonal herring feeding ecology in PWS nursery areas from 1996 to 1998. Zooplankton from 535 vertical tows and herring diet data from 3,282 stomach contents were collected from Eaglek, Simpson, Whale and Zaikof Bays. Zooplankton species composition was dominated by small calanoid copepods, cyclopoids, invertebrate eggs, and adult euphausiids in March prior to the spring phytoplankton bloom. Small calanoid copepods, especially Pseudocalanus spp., were dominant during the peak abundance. Oikopleurans were abundant from August to October. The zooplankton density peaked at 1,234 to 5,594 individuals m−3 between June and July 1996. Zooplankton density was significantly lower in 1997 than 1996. Seasonal density and diversity were found to vary among and within the four bays. The abundance of prey in herring diets was correlated to the timing and degree of zooplankton prey availability. Feeding was highest at 1,192 items per fish in July 1996 and decreased until winter (December to March) when the number of empty stomachs ranged from 70 to 90%. Lower zooplankton densities in 1997 were reflected in significantly lower abundances of prey in 1997 diets. Prey selectivity was negatively correlated with zooplankton densities among months. Diel and ontogenetic feeding trends as well as differences between feeding depths were noted. Assimilation rates of smaller herring were closer to basal metabolic rates and herring less than 3 g had insufficient energy reserves to survive the winters of 1995–1996 and 1996–1997. These patterns suggest that juvenile herring are dependent on an abundance of prey to successfully feed and have enough energy reserves to overwinter. The effects of increased temperatures on zooplankton fluctuations and changes in herring condition may have had population level consequences in PWS. Successful feeding when prey abundance and composition was highly variable reveals herring's adaptability to multiple environments.

T1  - Latitudinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster. (BL: DXN051599)
AN  - 301579887
AB  - There is widespread latitudinal variation in ectotherms. This latitudinal variation is often the result of a combination of the evolutionary genetic and developmental effects of the changing environment. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism in which to study this variation. Genetic, latitudinal clines have been found in a number of traits of Drosophila melanogaster. Body size, egg size and ovariole number have been found to increase, and development time to decrease with latitude in more than one continent. Parallel latitudinal clines in different continents indicate that natural selection is responsible for this genetic variation. The developmental effects of the environment can act in the same or opposite direction to the evolutionary effects.To further investigate latitudinal variation in D. melanogaster, latitudinal variation in starvation resistance, fat content and larval growth efficiency were studied. Starvation resistance and fat content in South American populations were found not to vary with latitude. Larval growth efficiency was studied in both South American and Australian populations, and larvae originating from high latitude populations were able to convert a fixed amount of food into larger adult body size. In addition, at lower experimental temperatures, larvae originating from both high and low latitudes converted food into larger adult size.An investigation into the genetic basis of the clines in body size in South America and Australia was performed. Chromosome substitution analysis was done to establish whether any of the chromosomes had large effects on body size, and whether these effects differed between the 2 continents. Chromosome 3 was found to have the largest effect on body size in both continents, with the other chromosomes also having some effect.

T1  - Analysis of stage-differentiation in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> using developmental mutants and molecular regulators
AN  - 1992757179
AB  - The life cycle of the trypanosome undergoes a series of differentiation steps to adapt to the different environments encountered by the parasite. In particular the differentiation of the bloodstream form to the insect stage procyclic form has been well characterised and a map of events formulated. However, the actual underlying control mechanisms are as yet unknown. The aim of this project was to dissect the underlying mechanisms of control of bloodstream form differentiation. Three approaches were taken, first bloodstream cells strain GUP2965.3 was cultured in vitro and the differentiation ability of the cells analysed. It was observed the bloodstream cells adapted to in vitro culture in the media HMI-9 quickly and efficiently. It was discovered that the addition of 6mM cis-aconitate (pH7) and reduction in temperature to 27°C resulted in optimal differentiation and cell survival in GUP2965.3 cells. Secondly, the respiratory poison potassium cyanide was used to select for cells which were unable to differentiate to procyclic forms. The selection regime derived cell lines which demonstrated lower levels of differentiation compared to wild type cells. The differentiation defective cell lines were then cloned and analysed using a number of markers for differentiation. The experiments revealed that the defective cell lines were capable of initiating differentiation but were unable to complete the process. In particular they appeared to arrest at an early procyclic phase and were unable to progress to the mature procylic stage. In the final approach, a stage regulated MAP kinase was identified in T brucei, pK2.7, where mRNA was bloodstream stage enriched. The sequence of pK2.7 demonstrated the presence of the conserved dual phosphorylation motif, TXY, specific to the MAP kinase family of molecules. Furthermore pK2.7 had an unusual C-terminal extension which may be important in the regulation, function and localisation of the protein. To elucidate the functions of pK2.7, gene over-expression and ablation was attempted. The results obtained suggests that pK2.7 may be an essential gene in the trypanosome which may play a role in the signal transduction pathways.

T1  - Latitudinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster
AN  - 1752554321
AB  - There is widespread latitudinal variation in ectotherms. This latitudinal variation is often the result of a combination of the evolutionary genetic and developmental effects of the changing environment. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism in which to study this variation. Genetic, latitudinal dines have been found in a number of traits of Drosophila melanogaster. Body size, egg size and ovariole number have been found to increase, and development time to decrease with latitude in more than one continent. Parallel latitudinal dines in different continents indicate that natural selection is responsible for this genetic variation. The developmental effects of the environment can act in the same or opposite direction to the evolutionary effects. To further investigate latitudinal variation in D. melanogaster, latitudinal variation in starvation resistance, fat content and larval growth efficiency were studied. Starvation resistance and fat content in South American populations were found not to vary with latitude. Larval growth efficiency was studied in both South American and Australian populations, and larvae originating from high latitude populations were able to convert a fixed amount of food into larger adult body size. In addition, at lower experimental temperatures, larvae originating from both high and low latitudes converted food into larger adult size. An investigation into the genetic basis of the dines in body size in South America and Australia was performed. Chromosome substitution analysis was done to establish whether any of the chromosomes had large effects on body size, and whether these effects differed between the 2 continents. Chromosome 3 was found to have the largest effect on body size in both continents, with the other chromosomes also having some effect.

T1  - Studies on the Ecology of cotesia plutellae Kurdjumov and its Protection and Utilization
TT  - 小菜蛾绒茧蜂生态学特征及保护利用
AN  - 1024725097
AB  - In this dissertation,ecological factors that affected the parasitizing action of Cotesus plutellae were studied with the rotational composite design of quadratic regression and uniform design. The influence of certain measure in the protection of C .plutellae was evaluated with life table established according to acive factors on the diamondback moth (DBM) and parameters such as popu1ation trend index (I) and index of population control (IPC).population dynamics of C.plutellae and the diamondback moth (DBM), phalla xylostella (L.) in different kinds of vegetable fields were investigatad systematically. The results showed that p.xylostella and C. plutellae had the same trend. In initial stage of growth of vegetables, parasitic rate was rather low, while the harvest time, population of DBM increased, and so did the rate of parasitism. These showed that the potential ability of C,plutellae to control the DBM was quite powerful.Parasitism of C.plutellae affeted by some environmental factors Illumination time attributed little to its parasitic rate and searching effect. The rate of parasitism and searching effect deceased with the increase of host density. The rate of parasitism went up with the increasc of C. plutellae, but its searching effect declined. The ambient temperature had a great impact on parasitism. At l50C, C. plutellae almost ceased hunting for host and the rate of parasitism approached to zero. At 27-280C, searching effect reached its climax and rate of parasitism increased to 47.22%.. C. plutellae almost stop searching and rate of parasitism was extremely low at 350C. C.plutellae was greatly affected by the spatial states, e.g. density of vegetables and size of plant. In a specified space, given a certain  amount of C.plmellae and hosts, the rate of parasitism went down with the increase of density and size of plant. The adaptability of C.plutellae to the host avaiIability was also probed. The results showed that the rate of parasitism of C. plutellae increased stably within six days after emergenee. In the first day the parasitic rate of the third instar larvae of DBM was 72.94%, and it reached 88.79% in the sixth day, which showed that the absence of host in a short time did not affect the control effect of C plutellae on DBM.The green house consisted to a certain degree in controlling DBM. In the treatment
with released C.plutellae, the rate of parasitism increased to 27.4% in a l/4ha vegetable plot. while in the field with no C plutellae released, it dropped to 7%. Therefore the control efficiency was improved 22% by releasing C .Plutellae, moreover. Population trend index in the field released pleutellae was 0.709 times of that of no C. Plutellae released. Hence, releasing C.Plutellae had some control effect on DBM.DBM got the resistance to the most chemical pesticides. Within 72h, DDVP only killed 40.37% of their larvae and cypermethrin just killed 33.54%, while these chemical insecticides had a strong influence in the adults survival rate of C.plutellae, mating and oviposition behavior.For instance, bisultap killed 93.59% of C.plutellae adults and suppressed 76.47% of female oviposition within 48h. Bilological pesticides, such as Bt.caierdi, libao and neem, were also used to deal with DBM.B .t could kill 25.05% of larvae within 24h and 97.l9% within 72h. Furthermore. the majority of DBM chrysalises could not emerge normally.B.t had a relatively gentle lnfluence li C.plutellae adults. It killed just 40.l8% and suppressed barely l l .78% of female parasitism. Studies on the field had obtained similar results. In the vegetable plot where the chemical pesticide had been sprayed for a long time, namely, in the chemical control region, the rate of parasitism was mere1y 22.7%, while in the region utilized the biological pesticides, e.g.neem, B,t, the parasitic rate reached to 37.8% and 33.3% respectively. The index of population trend of DBM in chemical control region was 1 .03 times of non-drags sprayed region, but in B.t or neem applled region was 0.25 and 0.36 times of non-drags sprayed region.Results showed that C. plutellae was dominant natural enemy of DBM.Augmentation and release of C. plutellae could improve its field control effect on DBM in the south China, but the cost was rather expensive and need further researches. For these reasons, the key of factor conservation of C. plutellae was to stop employing chemical insecticide in the field.Alternate abstract:本文从保护利用小莱蛾绒茧蜂（Cotesia plutellae Kurdjumov）的角度出发，采用二次正交旋转组合设计，均匀设计等方法，对影响其寄生作用的生态因子（温度、光照、空间异质性等）进行了分析，并以作用因子组配的生命表及种群趋势指数（I）和控制指数（IPC）评价了不同措施对小菜峨绒茧蜂的保护作用，现将主要试验结果简述如下：通过田间不同蔬菜品种上小菜蛾绒茧蜂与小莱蛾种群数量关系的系统调查，结果表明小莱蛾绒茧蜂与寄主小菜蛾（Plutella xylostella L.）在不同的蔬菜品种上是相同的变动趋势，即无论在绝对数量还是相对数量上都表现出明显的跟随现象，在蔬菜生长初期，寄生率较低收获后期，小菜蛾种群升高，寄生率也升高，表现出较强的控害潜能。小菜蛾绒茧蜂的寄生行为受到各种环境因子及自身属性的影响，绒茧蜂的寄生率和寻找效应与光照时间呈正相关，但作用不明显；随着寄主数量增加，绒茧蜂的寄生率和寻找效应呈下降趋势, 蜂量的增加可以提高绒茧蜂的寄生率，但降低其寻找效率。环境温度对绒茧蜂的寄生行为影响显著, 在15℃，小菜蛾绒茧蜂停止寻找寄主，寄生率几乎为0, 随着温度的升高，活动能力加强，寻找效率很高，寄生率上升，27-28℃小菜蛾绒茧蜂寻找效率最大, 寄生率高达47.22%,超过28℃后，绒茧蜂寻找效率降低，寄生率也下降，35℃时，几乎停止搜索，寄生率极低。小菜峨绒茧蜂空间异质性反应明显，蔬菜种植密度及植株大小时绒茧蜂的寄生率都有影响，在特定空间内，一定的蜂量和寄主虫量条件下，随着种植密度增加和植株增大，绒茧蜂寄生率随之下降。绒茧蜂对寄主缺乏的适应性，研究表明绒茧蜂羽化后，由于寻找不到合适龄期的小菜蛾幼虫而延迟寄生，在6天内，随着时间推移，寄生率反而有所上升，在提供寄生后第1天寄生3 龄幼虫的寄生率达72.94％, 第6天寄生率可达88.79％。可见短时间的寄主缺乏不影响绒茧蜂的控制能力。在大棚蔬菜种植中，由于大棚的影响，小菜蛾绒茧蜂的寄生率偏低，只有29.5％, 比棚外的35.8％低，但大棚对小莱绒成虫扩散阻碍效果更强，总体上，棚外的小菜蛾种群的趋势指数是棚内的1.466倍，大棚对小菜蛾种群有一定控制作用：田间释放绒茧蜂控制小菜蛾种群的试验结果表明，1／45ha的大棚菜地内释放1200头绒茧蜂，寄生率可达27.4%,而未放蜂区寄生率只有7％,放蜂控制效果可提高22％, 由于绒茧蜂的干扰，放峰区的小莱蛾种群趋势指数是未放峰区的0.709倍，放蜂对控制小菜蛾种群起一定的作用。小菜蛾已对大多数化学杀虫剂产生了抗药性。用药72小时后敌敌畏处理的小菜蛾幼虫死亡率只有40.37％,兴棉宝只有33.54％，但杀虫剂对绒茧蜂成蜂的存活率，交配、产卵作用都有较大影响，杀虫双处理成蜂48小时内死亡率高达93.59％，对雌蜂寄生抑制率达76.47％; 生物制剂B.t，菜蛾敌，绿宝，印楝处理小菜蛾幼虫，在24小时内，B.t处理组死亡率为25.05％,但72小时后可达97.19％．且已化蛹的小菜蛾也绝大多数不能正常羽化。生物制剂对绒茧蜂成虫的影响较小，72小时内B.t处理组死亡率只有40.18％，且对雌蜂寄生抑制率也只有11.75％。田间的观察也得出相似的结果，在长期施用化学农药的菜地（化防区）绒茧蜂的寄生率仅22.7％，但施用生物制剂的印楝区和B.t区分别可达37.8％和33.3％，化防区的小菜蛾种群趋势指数比未施药区的还高，是未施药区的1.03倍，而 B.t区和印楝区的小菜蛾种群趋势指数只有未施药区的 0.25倍和 0.36倍。综上所述，绒茧蜂对小菜蛾的自然控制能力较强，是小菜蛾种群的优势天敌。在华南地区，大量繁殖释放绒茧蜂可以提高其田间控制效果，但其技术成本较高，有待进一步研究；因此，菜地停止使用化学杀虫剂是绒茧蜂保护的关键。

T1  - Biology and behaviour of the parasitoid <i>Anagyrus kamali</i> Moursi [Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae]
AN  - 304557672
AB  - The parasitoid Anagyrus kamali Moursi [Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae] has been recently introduced into the Caribbean as a biological control agent against the Hibiscus Mealybug (HMB), Maconellicoccus hirsutus Green [Homoptera: Pseudococcidae]. Information on this parasitoid is scarce and investigations of its biology and behaviour were conducted to optimize its mass-production, and improve our understanding of the  A. kamali/M. hirsutus system. Host selection experiments showed that, of nine species tested, HMB was the only suitable mealybug species for A. kamali development. Third nymphal instar was the optimal stage for wasp mass-production since A. kamali progeny from this stage had a female biased sex ratio and it had a weaker immune response as evidenced by lower encapsulation rate than adult female HMB. Parasitoid functional response was of type III in variable-time conditions, ensuring the preservation of HMB population at low density, and of type II–III in fixed-time conditions, leading to a better use of HMB population in mass-rearing. Temperature and photoperiod had a profound impact on parasitoid fecundity, 26°C and LD 0:24 being the optimal condition to maximize A. kamali  oviposition. Parasitoid body size was positively correlated to its fitness. Large parasitoids lived significantly longer, had a higher fecundity, and progeny emergence with a lower sex ratio than small ones. Studies on mating showed that A. kamali is arrhenotokous and that multiple mating is required to optimize progeny sex ratio. Progeny production by mated females was also higher than that of virgin females. Female parasitoid fecundity was negatively correlated to their density due to mutual interference. Under mass-rearing conditions, 75 female A. kamali per cage was the optimum. Finally, under stored condition, food supply and low temperature (20°C) appeared essential to sustain parasitoid longevity. However, storage periods up to 14 days did not affect parasitoid lifetime fecundity. For optimal mass-production, 75 male and female A. kamali should be released in a cage containing 30–36 sprouted potatoes infested with 15 HMB egg masses each three weeks. After a three week-period, this should allow the production of 900 parasitoids over a 12 day-period.

T1  - On the interaction between atmosphere and vegetation under increasing radiative forcing: A model analysis
AN  - 304550797
AB  - Atmosphere-vegetation interaction. Terrestrial vegetation exerts a significant influence on the atmosphere. For instance, it determines by its reflectivity (albedo) the input in shortwave energy from the sun, it controls the fluxes of water vapour and of carbon dioxide, and influences by its surface roughness the flow in the planetary boundary layer.    However, in current global climate models that are used to project the evolution of the global climate under an increasing greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing, the structure of terrestrial vegetation, which determines the properties and the functionality of the land's surface with respect to the atmosphere, is assumed to remain constant and not responsive to the changing climatic conditions.    The aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of feedbacks in the atmosphere-vegetation system in the framework of a computationally very efficient conceptual model.    The conceptual model. The conceptual model is based on strongly simplified but largely realistic representation of the atmosphere and the terrestrial vegetation on a regional level. It includes essentials of water related two-way feedbacks, such as the influence of vegetation on evapotranspiration and therefore on the surface energy balance, and the impact of temperature and drought on biomass growth and mortality.    Response to increasing radiative forcing. In the simulation experiments the atmosphere-vegetation system of a mid-latitude region is subject to an increasing external radiative forcing.    The analogous simulations with the dynamic biomass scheme indicate at first a transient growth of biomass related to the temperature increase up to a critical threshold in radiative forcing.    The increase in biomass leads to a slight mitigation, respectively its decrease to a slight reinforcement of the temperature increase, because of the change in evapotranspiration.    Model extended by dynamic roots, cloud feedback and adaptation. This picture changes if one takes into consideration an additional feedback loop. This feedback is based on the hypothesis that drought stress implies not only a reduction in above ground biomass, but also a reduction in rooting systems and therefore a reduction of the amount of water accessible to the plants for transpiration.    The investigations with a scheme that couples cloudiness to regional evapotranspiration indicate that cloud feedback tends to stabilize both states.    In order to investigate the role of the adaptability of terrestrial ecosystems to changing climatic conditions, a simple scheme of adaptation has been implemented into the conceptual model.    The conceptual nature of the model presented in this work restricts its applicability to the qualitative investigation of feedbacks in the atmosphere-vegetation system. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Temperature/development relationships and life history strategies of Arctic Gynaephora species (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) and their insect parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae and Diptera: Tachinidae), with reference to predicted global warming
AN  - 304531506
AB  - Increases in temperature and precipitation predicted under global warming are expected to be most pronounced and thus have their greatest impact on ecosystems at high latitudes. Insects constitute a major component of the foodwebs of terrestrial ecosystems and should be among the first organisms to show noticeable responses to predicted global warming, especially in the Arctic where climatic conditions are often limiting. However, interactions among species must also be taken into account. The genus Gynaephora  Hübner (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) is represented in North America by two species, G. groenlandica (Wocke) and  G. rossii (Curtis), and their geographic distributions overlap broadly across the Canadian Arctic. Both species are found at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island, and the population of G. groenlandica at this site is thought to be limited mainly by parasitoid-induced mortality rather than by climatic conditions.    Field observations, surveys, and temperature-manipulation experiments were conducted at Alexandra Fiord; laboratory rearing was conducted under controlled conditions at the University of Victoria. Life histories and seasonal phenologies for Gynaephora species and their insect parasitoids were elucidated from field studies, and temperature/development relationships for selected stages of most of these species were derived from laboratory rearing. The results of field studies and laboratory rearing were compared and used to formulate predictions about the responses of these insects to predicted global warming.    Seasonal phenologies of the parasitoids provide optimal access to new hosts but parasitoid-avoidance strategies of Gynaephora larvae ensure that a proportion of their populations escape parasitism. Laboratory rearing showed that the relative timing of host and parasitoid seasonal phenologies is maintained over a broad range of temperatures; therefore, temperature increases predicted under global warming are unlikely to have any great effect on host-parasitoid interactions. However, increased cloudiness associated with the predicted increase in precipitation might have profound effects resulting from lower ground-level temperatures caused by a lack of solar heating. The extent of this effect is uncertain but might lead to reproductive failure in  Gynaephora species, with similar repercussions for the insect parasitoids.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Because a female's opportunity to obtain increased somatic benefits by mating with a particular male is limited, the possibility that females obtain genetic (indirect) benefits by virtue of preferring certain males and male signals was investigated. Controlled breeding experiments demonstrated that in some environmental conditions the offspring of females mating with attractive males matured faster than the offspring of females mating with non-attractive males. However, under other conditions the offspring of females mating with non-attractive males developed faster and heavier than the offspring of females mating with attractive males. These findings suggest that a good genes model of female choice may operate in A. grisella,  but the process depends on environmental conditions.    Recent studies demonstrate that sexually selected traits in many species have considerable genetic variation, indicating that a substantial amount of additive genetic variance is maintained despite the strong directional (sexual) selection imposed on these male traits by female choice. There are virtually numbers of mechanisms that may possibly contribute to the maintenance of additive genetic variance for sexually selected traits. In this dissertation, the role of environmental heterogeneity in maintaining additive genetic variance for sexually selected traits was investigated in A. grisella.  I examined the reaction norms of two genetic groups that were derived through five-generation of artificial disruptive (two-way) selection. Some signal and developmental characters were found to exhibit substantial phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, significant crossover interactions for pulse rate (PR) and maturation duration occurred between the two genetic groups due to their different responses to the various environmental conditions tested. For example, the high PR lines generated relatively faster PRs than the low PR lines at low temperature (22.5°C), whereas under high temperature (30°C), the low PR lines produced relatively faster PRs than the high PR lines. Because PR is one of the important signal characters that contribute significantly to male attractiveness, different genetic groups may be favored in various environmental conditions due to the alternation of selection pressure imposed by female choice. Thus, additive genetic variance of sexually selected traits may be maintained due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of environment. Nonetheless, the occurrence of crossover interactions for pulse rate in  A. grisella challenges current indirect sexual selection models (Fisherian runaway and good genes) because the fundamental assumption of trait reliability is violated.    The mating success of a male will be largely determined by his relative attractiveness to his neighbors. To compete with other males for sexually receptive females, males may modify their acoustic advertisement signals. In this study, I examined the plasticity of acoustic behavior of  A. grisella males during signal competition. When a close-range signaler (competitor) was present, males raised their PRs, but they only sustained the elevated PRs for an average of 10 min. The males having low basal PRs increased significantly more in PR than those having high basal PRs. Thus, the signal modification of males during competition may enhance male's attractiveness to females. In addition, the plasticity of acoustic behaviors of  A. grisella males may contribute to the maintenance of additive genetic variance for sexually selected traits.

T1  - Genetic polymorphism and adaptation to environmental heterogeneity in an intertidal barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides
AN  - 304529054
AB  - The northern acorn barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, was used as an ecological model system to investigate how environmental heterogeneity structures patterns of variation at particular polymorphic loci. Static sampling from a variety of habitat types in nature demonstrated an extremely fine-scaled covariance between genotype and the level of physical stress experienced by barnacles in particular habitat types. This pattern was evident at the locus encoding the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) enzyme, but was not observed at another allozyme locus (Gpi) or a neutral DNA marker (the mtDNA control region). These data implicate balancing selection at the Mpi linkage group. To specifically address this hypothesis, genotype frequencies were documented at multiple time points in the barnacle life-cycle and from various habitat types. The viabilities of the two homozygous Mpi genotypes were habitat-dependent, suggesting that a Levene model of balancing selection maintains allelic variation at the Mpi locus. Furthermore, selection at Mpi was observed to occur as a pulse of genotype-specific survivorship during a two week period immediately following metamorphosis from the larval to the adult phenotype. Experimental manipulations of the level of temperature/desiccation stress in the field created the same pattern of selection for alternative homozygous genotypes in alternative intertidal environments. An experiment conducted in a flowing seawater laboratory demonstrated that the mechanism of selection at the Mpi locus results from the presence of mannose in the barnacle diet and exposure to physiological stress.  Mpi homozygotes exhibited significantly different growth rates when cultured on a mannose-enriched diet and exposed to thermal stress. The phenotypic differences between the homozygous genotypes also predicted survivorship in the experimental treatments. The data indicate that homozygous Mpi  genotypes differ in their ability to process mannose-6-phosphate in the glycolytic pathway; when individuals shift to anaerobic metabolism as a result of physiological stress, differences in enzyme activity may result in the observed pattern of differential survivorship.

T1  - Partial melting of depleted peridotite in the earth's upper mantle and implications for generation of mid-ocean ridge basalts
AN  - 304519568
AB  - Peridotite in the earth's upper mantle undergoes polybaric, fractional melting as it rises adiabatically beneath mid-ocean spreading ridges. As liquid is continually extracted, peridotite becomes increasingly depleted in incompatible components. The amounts and compositions of partial melts of depleted peridotite are important parameters in models of MORB petrogenesis, but have not been well-constrained previously. I present partial melting experiments on a depleted peridotite composition at 10 kbar and 1250–1390°C. My experiments make use of small aggregates of glassy carbon particles into which partial melt is extracted at high temperature. I have been able to analyze low degree partial melts (<10%) and quantify the effects of incompatible element depletion on the melting behavior of peridotite. Special tests of the approach to equilibrium in this study confirm the validity of the aggregate melt extraction technique, which has sparked much debate in the literature (see Chapters 2 and 3 for details).    Melts of depleted peridotite differ in important ways from melts of fertile peridotite, mostly due to lower alkali contents and chemical consequences thereof. At low melt fractions, melts of depleted peridotite have less SiO 2, more CaO, and higher CaO/Al2O3 than melts of fertile peridotite at the same melt fraction. According to these results and others in the literature, solidus temperature is a linear function of incompatible major element content. Melt fraction at cpx-out is proportional to normative cpx in source peridotite.    Liquid compositions from this study are in good agreement with calculations using the quantitative models of Kinzler and Grove (1992a), Langmuir et al. (1992), and Ghiorso and Sack (1995). Calculations of polybaric, fractional melting of primitive mantle using the models of Langmuir et al. (1992) and Asimow (1997) indicate that about half of all liquid contributed to MORB is formed by partial melting of depleted peridotite.    The data presented in this thesis provide information about amounts and compositions of partial melts formed from depleted peridotite, an important upper mantle constituent beneath mid-ocean ridges, and can be used to improve quantitative models of MORB primary magma formation and further our understanding of MORB petrogenesis.

T1  - An experimental evaluation of the benefits and costs of sexual selection
AN  - 304497801
AB  - An enduring question in evolutionary biology concerns the selective forces behind sexually selected traits. A number of hypotheses have been proposed: adaptive mate choice, self-reinforcing association, pleiotropy, and conflict. Within this dissertation I report on two independent, replicated, experiments, each performed on an outbred, laboratory-adapted, population of Drosophila melanogaster, that test aspects of the adaptive and conflict hypotheses, respectively. In each experiment sexual selection was removed through enforced monogamous mating with random mate assignment, or retained in polyandrous controls. Evolutionary changes between the populations were evaluated after 35–55 generations of exposure selection. In the first experiment I evaluated the opportunity for adaptive mate choice by measuring the rate of adaptation to a novel thermal environment. The populations were exposed to chronic low-grade thermal stress that substantially reduced their reproductive rate. Relative to thermally naive controls, the thermally stressed populations substantially adapted, evidenced through net reproductive rate and its components, total surviving progeny and development speed. Sexual selection had no measurable effect on the rate of adaptation. These results indicate that variation in sexual fitness was largely unrelated to variation in thermal tolerance.    In the second experiment I evaluated the cost of sexually selected conflict. Conflict occurs between mates when adaptations benefit individuals of one sex at a cost to their mates. Monogamous mating constrains the reproductive success of mates to be identical, thereby converting any prior conflicts between mates into opportunities for mutualism. Evolution was allowed to proceed under the conditions to which the flies had been adapting for over 200 generations. In the monogamous populations males evolved to be less harmful to their mates and females evolved to be less resistant to male-induced harm. The monogamous populations also evolved a greater net reproductive rate than their promiscuous controls. These results indicate a potentially widespread cost of sexual selection due to conflicts inherent to promiscuity.

T1  - Compensatory Growth, Life-History Decisions and Welfare of Farmed Atlantic Salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i> L.) Parr
AN  - 2169365430
AB  - In nature, growth rates are rarely maximised but are instead optimised by natural selection. Compensatory growth, a common phenomenon in the animal kingdom, is evidence of this: when growth conditions improve after periods of poorer than normal growth, many organisms will grow at faster than normal rates. This allows them to achieve a desired body size despite unexpected setbacks in growth. This thesis investigates compensatory growth in the context of social interactions and life-history decisions in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. The fish in the experiments were 0+ parr on an accelerated smolt regime, producing out-of-season smolts ca. 6 months in advance of the natural cycle. In the experiment described in Chapter 2, six groups of individually marked fish were subjected to periods of unseasonably low temperature during successive periods of three or six weeks in the spring. Their growth rates were compared to that of a control group that was not exposed to low temperature. Four out of the six experimental groups showed clear compensatory growth spurts when they were returned to warm water. The mean size of fish in the two groups that did not exhibit compensatory growth was close or equal to that of fish that had already compensated. Thus, fish only initiated a period of compensatory growth if they were below a target size threshold for the time of year. Chapter 3 examines the behavioural mechanisms behind compensatory growth responses. By automatically registering movements of fish that were individually identified with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, the exact feeding and activity patterns of individual fish within groups were recorded over a period of days. While on average growth-compensating fish did not spend more time feeding than controls, they were more aggressive; as a result dominant fish within each group gained more exclusive access to the feeding area during periods of compensatory growth. The extent to which compensatory growth could be achieved was therefore dependent on both the social status of the individual and the dominants' ability to monopolise the food patch. Sexual maturation is an increasing problem in aquaculture due to the use of accelerated smolt regimes, probably because rapid growth rates trigger maturation during a crucial decision period in the spring prior to spawning. The experiment described in Chapter 4 used three groups of parr, exposed to successive three-week periods of low temperature between April and June, in an attempt to reduce the incidence of sexual maturation. There was some evidence that a growth setback caused a reduced and delayed investment in gonads. However, contrary to expectations, the incidence of maturation did not differ between the experimental groups and a control group. Periods of compensatory growth after the experimental groups were returned to warm water may have negated the effects of the low temperature treatment on the decision to mature. In addition, the absence of seasonal cues due to the constant photoperiod may have resulted in a less strictly defined decision window. Sexual maturation and smolting are often considered to be mutually inhibitory processes. However, some mature parr make the decision to smolt and do so with varying degrees of success. The question of whether the fish could undergo the processes of maturation and smolting at the same time was investigated in chapter 5 by following the development of smolt characteristics (smolt coloration and sea-water adaptability) in sexually mature and immature parr.. Smolt characteristics were more developed in immature fish, but nevertheless the mature males did show signs of smolting, and larger mature males could adapt to sea water. I suggest that the inhibition of smolting by sexual maturation is a result of two processes: firstly, that mature parr often do not fulfil the necessary requirements to make the smolt decision; secondly, that in mature parr that do decide to smolt, androgens inhibit or delay the development of smolt characteristics, but do not entirely prevent smolting due to the delay between spawning and emigration. The development of dorsal fin damage, which is primarily caused by aggression, was followed in Chapter 6 in four groups of parr of different mean length. The probability of having fin damage was strongly related to relative body size within each group: the largest fish in a tank were up to six times more likely to have damaged fins than the smallest fish. Studies of small groups of salmonids have demonstrated that subordinates are the main recipients of fin damage, but the present study indicates that the reverse is true in larger groups. This may be because dominant fish compete aggressively amongst themselves and incur fin damage, while less aggressive individuals adopt alternative feeding strategies that reduce the risk of injury. Erosion of the operculae is often seen in cultured fish, but little is known about the causes of the condition. While vitamin deficiency has been implicated in some cases, fish that show none of the other symptoms of vitamin deficiency may still develop opercular erosion. Chapter 7 describes how the development of opercular erosion was recorded in four groups of parr of different mean length. Erosion of the operculae developed during the early summer but healed completely during the late summer and autumn. The larger fish in a tank were generally more likely than smaller fish to have eroded operculae. I suggest that the condition resulted from physical injury caused by aggressive interactions between fish, and that a shift in behaviour with increasing body size reduced the rate of attack on the operculae later in the year, allowing them to recover from injury. The final chapter brings together the findings and concepts of the previous chapters. The implications of the findings for aquaculture are also discussed.

T1  - Studies on artificial parthenogenesis of the commercial silkworm races
TT  - 家蚕现行品种孤雌生殖的研究
AN  - 1024698782
AB  - The rate of appearance of Silkworm parthenogenetic eggs was very below in natural state. But induced by physical and chemical factors, certain parthenogenetic eggs and larvae appear. Some fundamental studies on the parthenogensis of commercial silkworm ovarian eggs induced by the hot water which invented by Astaurov, were carried out, The results showed as follows: 1.The parthenogenetic eggs were obtained when these commercial races induced by hot water. But the rate of appearance of parthenogenetic eggs varied markedly according to the traces used. More parthenigenetic were obtained in gybrids. 2.During hot water treatment, the effect of temperature ion the rate of parthenogenetic eggs was more significant than that of soaking time should be kept at 44-46deg C for 14-18minutes. 3.Certain parthenogentic eggs appeared when the treatment was carried out within 48 hrs after the ovarian eggs had been taken out from a female moth. But when the treatment was carried out within 12hrs or 36hrs, the rates of parthenogenetic eggs were higher. 4.During the period from emergence to hot water treatment, two protected method to ovarian eggs. In- body and out-body were taken. The result obtained by the second method was satisfied, the rate of parthenogenetic eggs increased by 5.5% than another method. 5.The hereditary feature of the varieties also affected the rate of apperance of silkworm parthenogenetic eggs. The parthenogenesis has maternal effect, which resulted in the difference of the rate of parthenogenetic eggs between the reciprocal hybrids. 6.After the virginal moth was kept at 4deg C for 3 days or 2 days, they could lay about 30-40% of total eggs within 12 hrs when kept at 25deg C. 7.After the virginal moth was kept at 5deg C for 4 days or 8 days, then transferred them into the environment at 30deg C, the moth could lay about 60-80% of total eggs within 7 hrs. When hot water treatment was taken, more high rate of parthenogenetic eggs could be achieved than the artificial method of intaking eggs from the ovarian. 8.Some materials were obtained by crossing the commercial stocks with PC-43, which was parthenogenetic tine introduced from Russian. Reproduced by parthenegenetic method, the rate of parthenogenetic eggs of these materials maintained at a high and stable level. And the economic characters of them also improved, especially the ratio of cocoon shell. 9.Using parthenogenesis, a new parthenogenetic line was bred out from the chilling and named it PC-W. Even instant acid treatment or acid treatment after chilling was carried out to PC-W, about 30% of larvae hatched out from treated eggs. After several generations, the economic characters of the line were improved. 10.After the ovarian eggs were kept at-11deg C for 30 minutes, 30-50% of total eggs started meiotic parthenogentic development.Alternate abstract:家蚕有偶发性的孤雌生殖，但人为地用理化因素刺激可获得一定比例的孤雌生殖发育卵和幼虫。为提高孤雌生殖技术，并为以后孤雌生殖在家蚕性别控制领域、基因纯化及杂种优势机理等方面的运用研究打下基础，本研究主要运用Astaurov的温汤处理诱导家蚕孤雌生殖方法，对现行蚕品种孤雌生殖的四个方面作了研究，得出的主要结果如下：1.供试的家蚕现行品种都可获得一定比例的孤雌生殖发育卵，但品种间孤雌生殖发生率有较大差异。杂交种的孤雌生殖发生率明显比原种要高。2.温汤处理诱导家蚕孤雌生殖过程中，温度变化对孤雌生殖发生率的影响，显著超过浸渍时间对孤雌生殖发生率的影响。现行蚕品种诱导温度以44-46℃为宜，浸渍时间以14-18min为好。3.卵巢卵取出到温汤处理的时间在48hr内都可得到一定的孤雌生殖发育卵，以经过12hr和36hr处理时孤雌生殖发生率最高。4.处女蛾羽化至处理期间，卵巢卵的两种保护方式即体内保护与体外保护对孤雌生殖发生率有一定差异，体外保护稍优于体内保护。5.品种的遗传特性对孤雌生殖有一定的影响。孤雌生殖具有母本效应，母本孤雌生殖发生率高的，其杂交子代的孤雌生殖发生率也有提高的趋势。6.处女蛾用4℃冷藏3d或2d可促使其在12hr内产下30-40％的未受精卵。7.运用5℃冷藏处女蛾4d后再将其移入30℃高温环境进行刺激,可使处女蛾在7hr内产下60-80％的未受精卵，运用温汤处理诱导，可获得比常规取卵方法更高比例的孤雌生殖发育卵。8.用从俄罗斯引进的无性孤雌生殖系PC-43（中系原种）与现行品种的6个中系原种杂交并进行孤雌生殖继代表明，这些杂交材料在维持比较高的孤雌生殖发生率同时，其经济性状有了较大提高，特另是茧层率提高尤为明显。9.从现行家蚕品种中，筛选出一个无性孤雌生殖系PC-W，通过即时浸酸，冷藏浸酸处理表明，该系孤雌生殖发生率较为稳定且经济性状有逐代提高趋势。10.运用-11℃冷冻未受精卵30min可获得了30-50％的减数分裂发育卵。

T1  - Test of alternative domains of attraction in the dynamics of a fishless oligotrophic lake
AN  - 304493282
AB  - The theory of domains of attraction (alternative “stable” states) allows variability, thresholds and persistence as integral parts of ecological system functioning. This thesis investigates the potential for alternative domains of attraction in a zooplankton community. Two alternative states have been proposed for the zooplankton community of small fishless, oligotrophic, mountain lakes. In the “competition state”,  Daphnia (Cladocera) outcompete solitary rotifers and impede predator recruitment. This state is persistent and resilient to disturbance. In the “predation state”, predation by Chaoborus (Diptera) on both prey types alters community dynamics to favor rotifers over Daphnia. Persistence of the predation state requires reduced prey competition, enhanced young predator recruitment in summer and predator survival in high densities overwinter.    I carried out graded field experiments using reduced Daphnia  densities and predator additions in the spring to generate and test the predator state. I monitored lake and enclosure communities for three consecutive years using an adaptive sampling concept. Chaoborus recruitment was enhanced in enclosures and the new predator cohorts survived overwinter in high densities. However, developmental delays prior to the winter period prevented persistence of the predator state over several generations. Enhanced predator densities in the spring, as well as cold temperature, delayed  Daphnia population onset and increase, which released solitary rotifer populations needed to feed young predator recruits in early summer. However, in the higher predator treatments, both prey types stayed depleted till late summer which resulted in delayed predator development.    Laboratory experiments showed that although Chaoborus americanus  can pupate at 5°C, they could not metamorphose into adults below 9°C. Cold water can delay their reproductive phase and delay timing of young predator recruitment.    I conclude that Shirley Lake, under current nutrient levels, does not have two domains of attraction. Nonetheless the presence of a threshold between states enlarges the window for coexistence of weaker competitors or rare species. Thresholds lead to alternative domains of attraction in some systems, and to transient state in others. From a management perspective, extended transient states can either lead to misleading interpretation and erroneous interventions if permanent changes are expected or be used as tools to produce temporary changes.

T1  - Pyroxene thermometry in chondritic meteorites
AN  - 304491932
AB  - Ordinary chondrites experienced various degrees of thermal metamorphism (the petrographic types) once they accreted into the parent asteroid, during the formation of the Solar System.    The thermal model for ordinary chondrites is matter of debate: namely, there is some uncertainty as regards number of parent bodies, accretionary history, metamorphic regimes, heat source and thermal structure.    This study explores the thermal history of ordinary chondrites through the application of pyroxene geothermometry; data from mineral composition, microstructures and cation ordering, obtained by means of electron microprobe, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, provides new constraints for the parent body thermal model: (1) Ordinary chondrites accreted into parent body at T $<$ 600$\sp\circ$C. (2) The thermal metamorphism is a prograde process (not retrograde). (3) The petrographic types developed through at least different temperature regimes in the ${\sim}900{-}500\sp\circ$C interval, where ${\sim}900\sp\circ$C represents the metamorphic peak. (4) After a diverse high-temperature evolution, the different petrographic types cooled similarly in the ${\sim}350{-}500\sp\circ$C range, likely at rates of 10$\sp\circ$C/ky.    Data are discussed in the light of the various parent body thermal models in the literature and favour a thermal evolution either in distinct bodies for each petrographic type, i.e., the "multiple parent body" model, or in km-sized "onion shell-type" bodies, thus much smaller than previously suggested (i.e., $\sim$100 km in radius).    A glaciological study of one of the most fertile meteorite concentration areas on Earth, the Frontier Mountain ice field (Antarctica), was undertaken as field work for this thesis. On the basis of data on ice dynamics, a model for the origin of the meteorite concentration is proposed. In particular, data indicates that: (1) The present-day glaciological conditions at Frontier Mountain can fully explain the meteorite accumulation: it is unnecessary to call upon paleo-scenarios, as previously suggested. (2) The accumulation model can be described as "stagnant ice against an absolute and submerged barriers".

T1  - Lipids in cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i> L.) and Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i> L.) eggs, with special emphasis on reproduction and quality
AN  - 304489821
AB  - Throughout the world, fish provide an source of animal protein. Therefore the dwindling world fisheries are of great concern. Reproduction is probably the most important issue in this respect, and factors affecting reproductive success are of utmost importance to assure sustainable fish populations for future generations.    This study focused on comparing Baltic and Atlantic populations of cod and salmon. Landlocked salmon, which has a limnic diet, was also included. The objective of this work was to compare lipid composition of eggs from these three environments and relate it to egg quality. Since the Baltic Sea is heavily polluted, the relation between xenobiotics, and reproductive success was studied. To elucidate the effect of spawning environment on the lipid composition of salmon eggs, river stocks were compared. Dietary effects were studied by feeding females from one environment with food from another. We focus on results related to the biologically important fatty acids 22:6n-3 (DHA) and 20:4n-6 (AA), as well as cholesterol and its oxidation products (COPs). We found: (1) DHA content in cod egg phosholipids was slightly (after at least one gonadal cycle) affected by diet. For salmon, egg DHA remained stable in spite a change of diet. Further, its content was inversely related to river winter-temperature. (2) AA content was related to egg quality in cod and salmon. In landlocked salmon the importance of AA was even larger. (3) Salmon eggs exhibiting the pollution-related syndrome M74 had elevated levels of both DHA and COPs, whereas levels of AA and cholesterol were unaffected. These eggs also had a lower level of the astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant.    Based on our findings we suggest that (i) the DHA level is genetically determined and that the difference between salmon stocks reflects an adaptation to temperature. This is supported by studies on importance of DHA in regulating membrane fluidity at low temperatures. (ii) AA, being a precursor of prostaglandins, is essential for the development of normal physiological functions in eggs and larvae. This should be considered when feeding broodstock and juvenile fish. (iii) Elevated levels of DHA in M74-affected salmon may be related to exposure to xenobiotics, which increase COPs contents and decrease antioxidant levels.

T1  - The potential role of parasites and the influence of size on female mate choice of Schistocerca americana and Dichromorpha viridis, with paternity verified via random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDS) technique
AN  - 304479520
AB  - To examine female mate preferences, crosses with one female and two males of different sizes were assembled. After nymphs hatched, random amplified polymorphic DNA was utilized to assess paternity. Various primers were tested for their ability to yield bands that could distinguish individuals. Of the 75 primers tested, 45 yielded consistent bands. Paternity was assigned if three markers from three primers were shared between offspring and a male. In general, fertilization patterns were consistent with a hypothesis of last-male sperm-precedence. There were some differences in behavior between two types of experiment sets (males were removed after mating or allowed to stay in the cage after copulation). Males of D. viridis mated for a shorter duration and males of S. americana associated (rode the female without genitalia contact) with females when in the presence of other males. These behaviors probably result from the perceived competition that other males pose. Females may be using such behaviors in their favor or may be engaging in cryptic choice for certain males. In a companion study, size of S. americana was found to be heritable from fathers to offspring. Large, heavy males probably have an advantage even if last-male sperm-precedence is the rule.    From previous work, large and heavy males were found to obtain more matings in a semi-natural study. In the current study, heavy males were found to incorporate more $\sp{14}$C into their reproductive organs and pass this on to the females during copulation. Females may be using protein donation as a cue for oviposition.    To assess the role that parasites may play, a two-year study of grasshopper species was taken. A parasite of the Malpighian tubules, Malameba locustae, was found in both nymphs and adults. Nymphs were infected more than adults, a criterion crucial to Hamilton and Zuk's theory for how female mate preferences should evolve in a system where parasites influence female choice. Thus this parasite-host system would be useful in testing this theory and other theory regarding the role of parasites in shaping sexual selection regimes.

T1  - The effects of food supply and nutrition on black bear reproductive success and milk composition
AN  - 304461423
AB  - I investigated the relationship between food abundance and black bear reproductive success. Black bear reproductive potential had been hypothesized to be related to natural food abundance in other studies but the effect had not been tested.    Pregnant females should select dens of maximum thermal efficiency to conserve body fat used for thermoregulation. If this were so they could allocate more depot fat to lactation. I examined data on natal den type (open nest, brushpile, covered) and subsequent survival of cubs in Massachusetts and Minnesota over 11 and 13 years, respectively. I could not detect any differences in cub survival but the power of tests was low (power = 0.139 to 0.258).    I could not predict either litter size or MFYS from environmental and harvest variables. When natural food abundance was low black bears used cornfields intensely and did not differ in body weight from high food years. Litter size and MFYS were related to litter order; first litters were smaller and had lower survival than subsequent litters. Sixty percent of Massachusetts females had their first litter at 3 years old. Twelve of 20 first litters were of single cubs and 10 of 12 first litters were totally lost.    I hypothesized that female black bears operated according to the life history theory of tradeoffs between present and future reproduction. Having cubs is not very costly to bears, raising them is. Thus, females had cubs at an early age (3 years old) but often could not find enough food in spring to both lactate and continue structural growth. Thus, first litters were usually lost.    I provide the first direct test of the hypothesis of the effect of diet quality on milk composition and cub survival in free-ranging bears. Milk composition differed between years of varying spring diet quality. Milk fat was lower when diet fat was low but MFYS was not different between the high fat and low fat years. I conclude that in Massachusetts, and likely most of eastern North America, natural food abundance has little effect on bear reproduction because bears can access alternate food sources.

T1  - A genetic basis for life history differences among populations of the midge, Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae)
AN  - 304460687
AB  - Laboratory and field experiments were conducted with six populations of Chironomus riparius to test for variation among the populations in life history parameters such as growth, mortality and/or reproductive rates. Egg masses of C. riparius from five field populations and one laboratory population were obtained and used to initiate laboratory cultures for experimentation. Environmental effects on life history variations could be ruled out because experiments were conducted with larvae that had been reared in the laboratory for several generations under identical conditions. Populations were compared under a variety of experimental conditions to test whether they would respond similarly, if genetically similar, or differently, if their genotypes were different.    The populations were subjected to a variety of experimental conditions in the laboratory in which temperature and food quality were manipulated. The population collected from Strouble's Creek, Virginia demonstrated a pattern of high growth rate and low mortality rate, while the population collected from the final clarifier at the Madison, Wisconsin sewage treatment plant showed a pattern of low growth rate and high mortality rate. When several populations were transplanted into a high chlorine environment at the Blacksburg, Virginia sewage treatment plant, the population that had been previously exposed to the chlorine showed a significantly lower mortality rate than the other populations. A series of toxicity tests revealed different sensitivities among several populations to an experimental pesticide. Differences among populations were also found in numbers of egg masses produced, numbers of eggs per egg mass, length of time until the onset of adult emergence, and the overall length of the emergence period.    The results of this study show the importance of genetic differences among populations of C. riparius. Many commonly measured life history parameters that are usually assumed to vary primarily from differences in environment, have been shown to vary as well from underlying genetic differences between populations. The role of genetics should be assessed, whenever possible, in studies where comparisons between populations of aquatic insects are made, in order to determine the degree to which genetics and environmental variables contribute to observed population differences.

T1  - Evolutionary genetics of the least killifish
AN  - 304445745
AB  - This research focuses on two separate but related areas of the biology of Heterandria formosa, the Least Killifish. The first involves the genetic covariance structure of thermal stress tolerance and life history traits. The second concerns population structure and gene flow. The conceptual motivation for these studies is the nature of ecological forces responsible for species ranges, and the nature of tradeoffs, if any, between thermal stress tolerance and absolute fitness.    To investigate the covariance structure, I conducted two artificial selection experiments. In one, I mass-selected on heat and cold stress tolerance to determine correlated responses in the "opposite" stress tolerance and in a suite of life history traits presumed to affect absolute fitness. In the other, I performed group selection on population size to investigate possible correlated responses in thermal stress tolerance and in life history traits.    In the mass selection experiment, there was no direct response to selection on either heat or cold stress, although the results suggest a response in cold stress tolerance in fish from one source population. Source populations (SC and FL) differed in cold stress tolerance, indicative of past adaptive differentiation. In the group selection experiment, two lines selected for small population size responded to selection. There was no correlated response in thermal stress tolerance or in any life history trait, although the lines were differentiated in an unknown trait responsible for timing of reproduction.    My initial hypothesis was that populations on the Florida peninsula should be farther from migration-drift equilibrium than populations on the mainland. The evidence did not support this hypothesis. Instead, it appears that populations in the northeastern part of the species range are more recent in origin, and may be farther from equilibrium than populations in the rest of the species range. In addition, the data imply that there has recently been substantial cross-peninsula migration in Heterandria formosa, as evidenced by the better fit of the data to a two-dimensional model of gene flow.

T1  - Evolutionary dynamics of molecular and quantitative genetic variation in ephemeral pond populations of Daphnia pulex
AN  - 304442287
AB  - I investigated temporal and spatial patterns of quantitative- and molecular-genetic variation using the fresh-water invertebrate, Daphnia pulex, as a model system. First, I performed an experiment designed to reveal environmental and genetic variation for an important fitness trait, diapause termination, in temporary pond dwelling populations of Daphnia pulex. Significant effects of photoperiod and temperature on hatching success were observed in both inbred and outbred sexually produced diapausing eggs. Outbred diapausing eggs had greater hatching success than inbred eggs, indicating the presence of non-additive genetic variation for hatching. Hatching success was greater under environmental conditions mimicking early season conditions in the natural environment. These results suggest that the timing of hatching is an adaptive response to natural selection.    I next used a combination of quantitative trait analysis and molecular genetic analysis to examine temporal variation in a natural population. Periods of clonal reproduction lead to a build-up of genetic disequilibrium. Yearly bouts of sexual reproduction changed the levels of expressed genetic variation and mean phenotypic values by reducing genetic disequilibrium. The levels of molecular genetic variation were reduced by clonal selection and restored the following year by the input of variation from a seed bank of diapausing eggs. These results demonstrate that non-additive genetic variation and seed bank effects influence the evolutionary trajectory of temporary pond populations of Daphnia.    Finally, I examined quantitative- and molecular-genetic variation among 19 populations of western Daphnia pulex. These populations showed a high degree of spatial differentiation for quantitative and molecular characters. Molecular patterns of variation were used to construct a phylogenetic hypothesis of relatedness among populations. The phenotypic and genetic (co)variance structure of morphological and life-history characters was not constant between populations. The constancy of the (co)variance structure was inversely correlated with the degree of relatedness between populations.

T1  - Mutation and the evolution of age-specific mortality rates: Experimental results and statistical developments
AN  - 304436237
AB  - Demographic analyses of Drosophila melanogaster allowed to accumulate spontaneous mutations for 10, 19 and 47 generations revealed: (i) significant genetic variance generated by mutation (mutational variance) for age-specific mortality rates early in life, (ii) lower mutational variance at advanced ages, (iii) genetic correlations caused by mutations (mutational correlation) that were positive between ages separated by one or two weeks but declined as ages become further separated, (iv) increased genetic correlations between mortality rates with increased mutation accumulation, and (v) little change in mean age-specific mortality rates under mutation pressure (i.e., little mutational bias). Similar results were obtained for mutations experimentally induced by P-element mutagenesis. Insertional mutations differ from spontaneous mutations in their magnitude but not their age-specificity. Estimates of pleiotropic effects of individual mutations ranged over nearly 10 days (approximately 20–25% of the average maximum lifespan of the lines).    Predictions from the two predominant evolutionary theories for senescence,  mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy, are tested using mutation data and the observation that mortality rates decelerate and level off at advanced ages. We argue that existing models are not consistent with the data and suggest ideas that might reconcile theory and observation including: redundancy models, heterogeneity models, and positive pleiotropy.    Statistical concepts are developed for estimating the influence of environmental and genetic effects on mortality rates. The character process model extends quantitative genetics to function-valued characters (also called “infinite-dimensional characters”) by employing parametric models for covariance functions. This model works better than standard multivariate techniques or fitting orthogonal polynomials. Next, maximum likelihood methods are developed for estimating the parameters of the Gompertz family of age-specific mortality models and comparing the fit of competing models. The statistical power to detect substantial differences in mortality rates is investigated. Lastly, data are examined from experiments that examine the longevity effects of temperature, dietary restriction, laboratory selection, and inbreeding. Novel decomposition techniques show that longevity differences from temperature shift and dietary restriction result predominantly from differences in the rate of increase in mortality with age, while increases in longevity through laboratory selection result predominantly from a reduction in baseline mortality rates.

T1  - Evaluation of Trichogramma ostriniae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) as a biological control agent against the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae): Biological, behavioral and ecological perspectives
AN  - 304429420
AB  - The biology and behavioral ecology of Trichogramma ostriniae, an introduced egg parasitoid of Ostrinia nubilalis and other lepidopteran species were studied in the laboratory and under field conditions. The inter- and intra-specific discrimination, competition, and the effectiveness of T. ostrinia and T. nubilale were also investigated.    For T. ostriniae to complete its life cycle, it took 6.7 days at 33$\sp\circ$C and 20 days at 17$\sp\circ$C. Comparison of several theoretic models indicated that a transformed day-degree model and the Hilbert-Logan model were better for predicting the development of this parasitiod. The wasps reared on O. furnacalis by the seventh generation and at 27$\sp\circ$C had a lower level of parasitism than wasps from other generations and at other temperatures. The differences among generations for the time female wasps spent drumming host eggs did not show any host and generation related trend.    European corn borer egg parasitism was positively correlated with egg density. Female T. ostriniae might exhibit the Type II or Type III functional response depending on the temperature. The field data suggested a Type II functional response when data were pooled for all replicates.    The effects of weather, plant size, and distribution of egg masses on egg parasitism by the wasp were studied in a sweet corn field. Logistic regression analyses indicated that percentage of eggs parasitized was negatively related to an increase in leaf area and distance of eggs from release point. Eggs on leaves in the upper third of a corn plant received much less parasitism than those on the middle and lower third. Temperature as well as the length of exposure of egg to wasps also affected the level of egg parasitism.    Laboratory test on the cross breeding between T. ostriniae and T. nubilale indicated no successful hybridization. The results of the inter- and intra-specific discrimination and competition between the two species revealed that only female T. ostriniae discriminated eggs parasitized by females of the same species. When both species oviposited the same egg, T. ostriniae was most likely to be able to complete development.    The level of egg parasitism by releasing T. ostriniae alone was found to be 15% higher than that by releasing T. nubilale alone, and 20% higher than by releasing a combination of the two species. Further analyses using the logistic regression model for independent and correlated data indicated T. ostriniae to be more efficient at discovering host egg masses than T. nubilale. Mutual interference between the two species was the main factor for the lower level of egg parasitism when the two species were released together.    The results suggest that T. ostriniae is the better candidate for augmentative releases for control of the European corn borer, and the two species should not be released into a corn field at the same time.

T1  - A comparative study of effects of changing food production system on quality issues in a school foodservice operation
AN  - 304422410
AB  - Implementation of a cook-chill food production system has been considered an effective and viable means for school foodservice operations to decrease costs and increase productivity. However, there is a lack of consensus among users of a cook-chill system with regard to the ability of the system to achieve these goals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of changing the food production system from a conventional to a cook-chill system on students' acceptance of a selected menu-item, time-temperature control, waste composition, foodservice employees' job satisfaction, and the financial implications in a Midwest school district. One group pretest-posttest repeated measures design was used to test hypotheses. Data about individual plate waste and students' acceptance were collected three times in three elementary schools. The time-temperature history of the test item was monitored, and a waste stream analysis was conducted in the cook-chill system. Employees' attitudes and job satisfaction were measured 4 months before, 5 months after, and 1 1/2 years after the implementation. Financial data for three academic years were compared. There was significantly less percent plate waste of the test menu-item in the cook-chill system than in the conventional system. A significant difference in the average serving size of the test menu-item was found among schools and between the two test periods. All acceptance ratings increased in the posttest for Group A (fourth grade in Phase 1 & fifth grade in Phase 2) and decreased in the posttest for Group B (fifth grade in Phase 1 & sixth grade in Phase 2). There were wide variations in the reheating time and method and also the holding time and temperature among schools and between the two systems. Production packaging waste and food wastes accounted for 76% and 24% of total wastes by weight, respectively, in the cook-chill system. The cook-chill system negatively affected employees' attitudes and did not increase their job satisfaction level 5 months after the implementation. However, the overall employees' job satisfaction significantly $\rm(p\leq.05)$ increased 1 1/2 years after the implementation of the cook-chill system. Significant savings in food cost and labor cost per meal were not observed with the installation of the cook-chill system during the first year of operation. Results of this study do not support some of the perceived benefits of a cook-chill system identified in the previous literature.

T1  - Ecology of the fringe-toed lizard, Uma notata, in Arizona's Mohawk Dunes
AN  - 304413937
AB  - Uma notata in the Mohawk Dunes had population densities in good habitat of 15-17 lizards/ha.   Testis volumes peaked in April-May and declined to low levels by August. Egg production peaked in May during 1995 but did not occur in spring 1996.    Minimum convex polygon home range estimates were 530 (±70 SE) m2 for 2 adult males and 228 (±82) m2 for 8 adult females. Adjusted for sample size bias, these estimates were 994 (±422) and 774 (±302) m2, respectively. Subadults had smaller home ranges. Uma notata actively used perennial plants as escape cover, preferentially selecting Ambrosia dumosa.   I found significant use of plant materials in Uma notata diet with both ontogenetic and seasonal shifts in proportions of plant items. Their diet included 65 taxa of arthropods from 39 families, along with 13 plant species in 7 families.   I also studied survival rates, tail loss, substrate selection, and thermal effects.

T1  - Adaptation to a variable environment: tadpole development strategies in the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) (BL)
AN  - 301599540
AB  - In Britain Bufo calamita is a threatened species that breeds in ephemeral pools.  Although transient, these pools may be predictably variable to tadpoles that can detect changes in proximal cues associated with drying ponds.  However, recent shifts in land use have led to unpredictable changes, both in the species' terrestrial environment and the composition of aquatic communities.  This anuran is therefore an ideal model for the study of life history variation, with the aim of this thesis to investigate the adaptability of B. calamita tadpoles to conflicting selection pressures.Growth responses of B. calamita tadpoles from populations with a history of competition from B. bufo were the same as those from allotopic populations.  Also, despite being vulnerable to predation from Triturus helveticus, B. calamita larvae did not respond to the visual, tactile and chemical cues of a caged newt.  Biotic factors can be important regulatory forces;  but for species that breed in ephemeral ponds, hydroperiod is the primary determinant of tadpole survival.  The effects of density and temperature on the growth of temporally isolated cohorts of B. calamita larvae were investigated in one German and three British populations.  The results of these experiments indicate that although both density and temperature regulate growth, temporally separated cohorts only responded differentially to temperature;  with growth that was consistent with hypothesised responses to desiccation risk.  In replicated ponds, B. calamita responded to desiccating conditions with retarded tadpole growth;  but, despite the formation of tadpole aggregations within the sunlit areas of desiccating ponds, they did not display developmental plasticity.  Therefore, for species such as B. calamita, the advantages of breeding in highly variable environments may be to exploit predictably transient habitats that are rich in food but low in competitors and predators, rather than evolving plastic responses to desiccation risk.

T1  - The effects of induced triploidy on the reproduction of the rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) and the nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus)
AN  - 301581813
AB  - Triploid rainbow trout produced by heat shock and control (diploid) siblings were raised separately at similar density, feeding and water quality regimes. No significant differences in body weight or condition factors were observed; however the weight of the eviscerated carcass was on average 20% higher (P<0.05) in triploid fish compared to diploid fish at 20 and 44 months post-hatching. The effects of triploidy on males were most evident during the final stages of spermatogenesis; in contrast, the gonadal development of triploid females was affected during its early stages, with the majority of the oogonia (30-70%) remaining within the oogonial clusters. A major finding was the presence of male-differentiating areas in most triploid females examined, which by the end of the sampling period appeared as gonadal hermaphrodites. Testicular weight, gonado-somatic index, sperm cell density and spermatozoa motility were significantly lower in triploid than in diploid male siblings, although some triploid males produced viable progeny when crossed to normal (diploid) females. Characterisation of this progeny by image analysis of nuclear DNA revealed the presence of a near-triploid genome. A single 5 month-old juvenile had developed testes in meiotic phase, providing a first evidence for the generation of limited numbers of viable progeny by autotriploid rainbow trout males. A cytogenetic analysis was carried out on monosex diploid and triploid populations of Nile tilapia. Synaptonemal complex analysis in diploid genotypes revealed the presence of an incompletely paired segment in the terminal region of the longest bivalent in heterogametic (XY) genotypes, which was not observed in homogametic genotypes. This unpaired region provides cytological evidence for the chromosomal basis of sex determination in O. niloticus. Meiotic analysis in triploids revealed the presence of longer (P<0.0001) synaptonemal complexes in heterogametic (XXY) than in homogametic (XXX) genotypes, with a significantly different (P<0.0001) nature of pairing evident between both groups. A model to explain the different progress in gametogenesis observed between male and female teleosts is discussed.

T1  - Pyroxene thermometry in chondritic meteorites (BL)
AN  - 301543817
AB  - Ordinary chondrites experienced various degrees of thermal metamorphism (the petrographic types) once they accreted into the parent asteroid, during the formation of the Solar System.The thermal model for ordinary chondrites is matter of debate: namely, there is some uncertainty as regards number of parent bodies, accretionary history, metamorphic regimes, heat source and thermal structure.This study explores the thermal history of ordinary chondrites through the application of pyroxene geothermometry; data from mineral composition, microstructures and cation ordering, obtained by means of electron microprobe, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, provides new constraints for the parent body thermal model:1) Ordinary chondrites accreted into parent body at T<600°C.2) The thermal metamorphism is a prograde process (not retrograde).3) The petrographic types developed through at least different temperature regimes in the ~900-500°C interval, where ~900°C represents the metamorphic peak.4) After a diverse high-temperature evolution, the different petrographic types cooled similarly in the ~350-500°C range, likely at rates of 10°C/ky.Data are discussed in the light of the various parent body thermal models in the literature and favour a thermal evolution either in distinct bodies for each petrographic type, i.e., the "multiple parent body" model, or in km-sized "onion shell-type" bodies, thus much smaller than previously suggested (i.e., ~100 km in radius).A glaciological study of one of the most fertile meteorite concentration areas on Earth, the Frontier Mountain ice field (Antarctica), was undertaken as field work for this thesis. On the basis of data on ice dynamics, a model for the origin of the meteorite concentration is proposed. In particular, data indicates that:1) The present-day glaciological conditions at Frontier Mountain can fully explain the meteorite accumulation: it is unnecessary to call upon paleo-scenarios, as previously suggested.2) The accumulation model can be described as "stagnant ice against an absolute and submerged barriers".

AB  - The objective of this thesis was to examine various aspects of behavioural regulation of nest construction in Vespine wasps. This was achieved by examining nest structure principally in colonies of Dilichovespual sylvestris and Dolichovespula norwegica at various developmental stages. Some aspects of nest construction behaviour were also examined in Vespula vulgaris.D. sylvestris and D. norwegica were found to have very similar behaviour in fibre selection, pulp processing and paper manufacture. The Doichovespula species were, however, found to exhibit several behavioural differences in paper manufacture to V. vulgaris. Comb and envelope in V. vulgaris were found to be shorter and thicker than those of the Dolichovespula species. Comb and envelope paper was also found to be thicker in V. vulgaris than in D. sylvestris and D. norwegica. The use of short, thick fibres in V. vulgaris led to envelope with a lower tensile strength than that of D. sylvestris and D. norwegica.The ability of the colony to elevate its temperature was found to increase during development, reaching a peak at the start of the production of the reproductives. The colony showed its greatest ability to thermoregulate shortly before the maximum envelope thickness was reached in the nest.Several factors were examined which may limit the ability of the colony to elevate nest temperature. These included the number of workers, eggs, small larvae, large larvae and pupae. Differences between colonies in their ability to elevate nest temperature were only significantly explained by the number of old larvae present.The results presented in this thesis indicate that workers use simple behavioural rules in the regulation of construction of comb, comb supports and envelope. The use of very simple behavioural rules may have penalties to the colony in terms of the adaptability of the nest structure. However they reduce the time spent by workers surveying the nest and processing information.

T1  - Biology, life-tables and prognosis model of the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
AN  - 304427064
AB  - Studies on the population dynamic of Mamestra brassicae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were conducted during 1988-1992 in order to improve forecasting and control. The influence of temperature on development, fecundity and survival were investigated in climatic chambers, and lower developmental thresholds and thermal requirements were established for the preoviposition period and the immature stages.    Pheromone traps were tested in cabbage fields at 5 locations in south-eastern Norway during 1989-1991. The trap catches were low at all locations and years, and the traps could therefore not be recommended for practical monitoring. A degree-day model for prediction of favourable times for assessment of infestation level and insecticide application was developed, validated and implemented.    Mortality in the immature stages, and larval dispersal, was investigated in the laboratory and in the field. Highest mortality was found in first instar larvae and in hibernating pupae. The mortality in first instar larvae was probably caused by failure to locate and establish feeding sites and predation, whereas the winter loss probably was caused by unfavourable weather conditions.    Life tables for five generations of a natural population of M. brassicae on white cabbage in As during 1988-1992 was constructed and analysed. Generation survival was very low, and the key factor was mortality in small larvae. The stage specific mortality appeared to be mainly density-independent.    Parasitoids and pathogens were of little importance in controlling the M. brassicae population, although they were more or less persistently present throughout the experimental period. Trichogramma semblidis (Aurivillius) (Trichogrammatidae) was reared from eggs, and Microplitis mediator (Haliday) and Aleiodes (Aleiodes) sp., both Braconidae, were reared from larvae. Erynia virescens (Entomophtorales) was identified in medium and large larvae.    Implications of the results in this study for integrated pest management is discussed, and management tactics are proposed.

T1  - Separation of volatile flavor compounds from model orange juice using pervaporation system
AN  - 304405135
AB  - The manufacture of concentrated orange juice results in major physical and chemical losses of volatile flavor compounds mainly by evaporation. This results in a product with an inferior sensory quality. One method of improving the sensory quality of orange juice is to recover the lost aroma compounds by pervaporation and to feed them back into the final product.    The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of two types of pervaporation membranes and one nanofiltration membrane for the recovery of orange juice aroma by pervaporation. The studies were conducted using a model orange juice aroma solution containing major volatile flavor components reported in the literature. The model orange juice aroma consisted of seven typical aroma compounds at a total concentration of 70 ppm, and the membranes used were polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-1060), poly (dimethylsiloxane) + silicalite (PDMS-1070) and DS-7.    Three major parameters, flux, productivity and enrichment factor, increased with increasing temperature. Flux and selectivity showed a dramatic increase in all the components at 70$\sp\circ$C. This increase appears to be resulted from both the activation energy of model components and increased flexibility of the active layer of the membrane. Downstream pressure was the most important factor affecting the performance of pervaporation in this study. Depending upon high (12 in Hg vac.) or low (25 in Hg vac.) downstream pressure, the overall results were remarkably different.    Comparison of the three membranes, PDMS 1060, PDMS 1070 and DS-7, showed that PDMS 1070 and DS-7 had higher selectivity but lower flux for non-polar hydrocarbon groups than the PDMS 1060. On the other hand, PDMS 1060 was more selective and permeable for polar groups, such as trans-2-hexenal, ethyl butyrate, octanol and linalool, than the PDMS 1070 and DS-7.    Potential use of pervaporation for orange juice aroma compound recovery was verified through this study. This study indicates that aroma compounds, especially volatile flavor and aroma compounds, can be enriched several tens to hundreds of times.

T1  - Descriptions, life history and case-building behavior of Culoptila cantha (Ross) (Trichoptera: Glossosomatidae) in the Brazos River, Texas
AN  - 304393356
AB  - Larval, pupal and adult samples of Culoptila cantha, from a large riffle of the Brazos River in north-central Texas from January, 1995 to March, 1997, indicated a predominately trivoltine cycle during both years; the over-wintering generation spanned 6-7 months and warm-season generations spanned 2-3 months. Water temperature thresholds of 22-24 and 27-29$\sp\circ$C appeared to synchronize emergence of the over-wintering and first warm-season generations, respectively; the later warm-season generation emerged asynchronously. Emergence occurred near dusk and peak diel flight occurred within an air temperature range of 15-30$\sp\circ$C. Mean fecundity was highest in March and decreased throughout the summer and fall. Larvae and pupae aggregated on the downstream undersides of clean, 10-20 cm diameter cobbles in the head of the riffle. Eggs, larvae of all instars, larval cases, case reconstruction progression and behavior, pupae, and adults are described.

T1  - Wolbachia symbiosis in the agriculturally-important predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis
AN  - 304375479
AB  - This study focused on detecting, describing, and evaluating the biological effects of Wolbachia endosymbionts in the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Wolbachia were found in adults and eggs of M. occidentalis using Wolbachia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers which amplify the 16S ribosomal RNA and ftsZ genes. Wolbachia also were found in their prey, the two spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). Wolbachia DNA from the two mite species was sequenced and compared. Parsimony analysis indicated the mite Wolbachia sequences were very similar to one another and to Wolbachia from insects. Wolbachia DNA could be transiently detected in the uninfected predatory mite Amblyseius reductus Wainstein (Acari: Phytoseiidae) after feeding on infected spider mites, indicating the infection status of any predatory arthropod's diet should be considered before using the PCR to detect Wolbachia.    In insects, Wolbachia causes nonreciprocal reproductive incompatibilities in crosses between infected males and uninfected females; the reciprocal crosses are normal. Genetically similar populations of M. occidentalis differing in the presence of Wolbachia (due to heat-curing of one population) were crossed to assess the effects of the symbiont. Wolbachia did induce non-reciprocal incompatibilities in this parahaploid mite, evidenced by significantly fewer viable eggs, higher proportions of egg shriveling as compared to the reciprocal and control crosses, and no or few female progeny.    To determine whether the proportion of Wolbachia-infected M. occidentalis in a polymorphic population would increase over time (because infected females can reproduce with both infected and uninfected males), three M. occidentalis populations were initiated with 10% infected and 90% cured mites and monitored for 22 generations. Wolbachia infection did not spread rapidly through the populations. Imperfect transmission rates and fitness costs were detected, which may prevent the rapid spread of Wolbachia. This suggests Wolbachia would not be useful as a "drive mechanism" for inserting useful genes into field populations of M. occidentalis.

T1  - Comparative physiology and macroecology of thermal tolerance in ectothermic vertebrates with correlates of phylogeny and biogeography
AN  - 304367458
AB  - "Temperature and moisture are the two master limiting factors to the distribution of life on earth" (Krebs 1994). Ecologists have dedicated much study to the understanding of these factors and how they influence species and their biogeography. Organisms have four options in dealing with the climatic condition of their habitats: (1) tolerate the temperature and humidity regardless of possible consequences to fitness, (2) move to more suitable climatic conditions, (3) death, or (4) escape fitness limiting conditions through evolutionary adaptation. It is this forth option which has been one of the primary interests to comparative physiologists and physiological ecologists in explaining (1) how physiological processes function with respect to the environment, (2) how the physiological capacities of an organism enable it to live in conditions not suitable for other species, and (3) how the environment may "fine-tune" or even directionally select for particular physiological processes increasing the relative fitness of future generations.    An organism's distribution and geographic range result from physiological tolerances and its ability to adjust physiological processes to maximize survival, growth, and reproduction under a diversity of environmental factors characteristic to its geographic region. This principle has been described by Liebig's Law of the Minimum which states that the distribution of species is governed by the environmental factor for which a species has the narrowest tolerance range or least adaptability. As described, physiological ecologists agree that temperature is probably one of the most pervasive factors in determining the distribution of animals. In this work, I address the importance of species specific thermal tolerance in an attempt to explain some macroecological patterns of distribution among fishes. The first two chapters are an evaluation and review of thermal tolerance in studies of comparative physiology. I measured the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for more than 600 individuals to statistically evaluate the variability associated with the end points loss of righting response (LRR) and onset of spasms (OS) used in determining CTMax. In my review of thermal tolerance, I found 388 of 725 papers to provide data for a historical and taxonomic review with a discussion of various methodologies and uses for the measure of species specific thermal tolerance.    In the third chapter, I investigated the correlates between the comparative physiology of thermal tolerance and macroecological patterns of distribution for several fishes found in Oklahoma. Although temperature and the physiological tolerance for changing thermal regimes are major limiting factors affecting species distribution, studies of macroecology have not adequately addressed the relationship between temperature and an organism's geographic distribution. Studies of macroecology often fail to investigate the underlying physiological factors and tolerances that influence animal distribution. This is one of the first attempts to use a "true" physiological parameter in macroecology.

T1  - Consequences of, and opportunities for, genetic differentiation among populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii
AN  - 304367372
AB  - Herein, I have utilized the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, as a model system for investigating processes of genetic differentiation among populations. First, I performed a set of line-cross experiments under both near-optimal and density-limiting conditions in order to examine the genetic basis of population differentiation. Both dominance and epistasis have contributed to the divergence of fitness (r$\sb{\rm c}$) among ancestral and derived populations, but not between ancestral or between derived populations. The expression of nonadditive effects depends upon the environment in which they are assessed. In conjunction with previous data from W. smithii, these results provide empirical support for Wright's (1977) "shifting balance" theory of evolution.    I next completed a survey of allozyme variability within and among 34 populations of W. smithii throughout nearly the entire species range. The location of the margin of the maximum extent of the Laurentide Ice Sheet defines a boundary in the distribution of within- and between- population variability, both of which decline north of this boundary. These results suggest that northern populations are the product of a range expansion which has been recent relative to the establishment of populations south of New Jersey. Patterns of electrophoretic variability are inversely related to patterns of additive genetic variability for the photoperiodic regulation of seasonal development. These results suggest that quantitative genetic measures of variability provide a more accurate assessment of the adaptive potential of populations than electrophoretic or DNA-based biochemical measures.    Finally, I performed selection for increased stress tolerance under conditions of thermal and nutrient-limiting stress for approximately 10 generations in order to examine variation in persistence and adaptation among southern, northern, and hybrid populations of W. smithii. One half of the selected lines went extinct. There was no effect of geographic origin or level of hybridization on population extinction. Among the surviving populations, hybridization constrained performance, indicating a latent outbreeding depression that was not apparent in either the F$\sb1$ or F$\sb2$ hybrid generation. Survivorship through heat and desiccation shock was higher in surviving selected lines than in their respective controls.    This thesis contains previously published and co-authored material.

T1  - Interactions between cauliflower mosaic virus isolates and Nicotiana species that determines systemic necrosis
AN  - 304355323
AB  - Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) strain D4 induces a systemic mosaic while W260 induces systemic necrosis in addition to the mosaic symptom in Nicotiana clevelandii. To determine which W260 genes are responsible for the systemic necrosis symptom, I tested chimeric viruses constructed from the D4, W260, and CM1841 strains and found that W260 gene VI elicited systemic necrosis. To investigate the inheritance of systemic necrosis, I crossed N. clevelandii with Nicotiana bigelovii, a host that reacts with a systemic mosaic symptom upon infection with W260. All F1 plants developed a systemic mosaic after inoculation with W260 and the F2 generation segregated 3:1 for systemic mosaic vs. necrosis. These results indicate that the systemic necrosis symptom in N. clevelandii is induced by the interaction of a single, recessive host gene and gene VI of CaMV.    Gene VI of CaMV strain D4 has previously been shown to determine systemic infection of solanaceous species including N. bigelovii. Another CaMV strain, CM1841, cannot systemically infect N. bigelovii following a mechanical inoculation, but is capable of recombination with the D4 gene VI coding sequence present in transgenic N. bigelovii and the recombinant is responsible for the development of systemic infection. To study the temporal and spatial appearance of recombinant viruses, I inoculated CM1841 mechanically and by agroinoculation to transgenic and nontransformed N. bigelovii. In agroinoculated transgenic plants, inoculated leaf tissue turned necrotic around the point of agroinoculation. The first leaves to develop systemic symptoms were necrotic in both agroinoculated and mechanically inoculated transgenic N. bigelovii. The predominant type of virus recovered from the inoculated and first systemically infected leaves was the wild type CM1841 rather than a recombinant. A shift in symptom type from necrosis in the lower leaves to a chlorotic mosaic in the upper leaves was associated with the recovery of recombinant viruses, indicating that the recombinants predominated only in later stages of pathogenesis.    Necrosis and resistance that comprise a viral hypersensitive response (HR) are traits that are not necessarily linked. Analyses of progenies of crosses between N. glutinosa, N. clevelandii, N. bigelovii, and N. edwardsonii suggest that necrosis and resistance associated with the HR of N. edwardsonii to CaMV strain W260 are two genetically unlinked traits derived from the two progenitor species of this host, N. glutinosa and N. clevelandii, respectively. Also, results obtained with a cross between N. edwardsonii and N. bigelovii suggest that necrosis and resistance associated with the HR of N. edwardsonii can be genetically separated, since the F1 progeny of this cross was resistant to infection by W260, but local lesions were chlorotic, rather than necrotic.    In all of the experiments described above, I found that local and systemic necrosis elicited by CaMV isolates in Nicotiana hosts is enhanced under conditions of low light intensity, short days and temperatures of 18-20 C.

T1  - Thermal evolution of body size in drosophila melanogaster
AN  - 1797412141
AB  - The objective of this research was to investigate the causes and consequences of thermal evolution of body size in Drosophila melanogaster. This was done empirically by the integrated study of lines collected along latitudinal gradient and population that were undergoing long-term evolution at different temperatures in the laboratory. All experiments were conducted in the laboratory using controlled conditions of temperature and larval density. I examined 20 populations collected along a north-south transect in Australia (17°-43°S) and found that wing size increased with latitude. The genetic cline in wing size was mostly based on variation in cell number (82%). These findings contradicted previous results on thermal selection in the laboratory, where the divergence in wing size was achieved almost entirely by changes in cell size. In another experiment, 6 geographic lines were reared at 5 temperatures spanning the entire viability range for the species. Wing size, cell size and cell number all decreased with increasing development temperature. Cell size determined most of the plasticity in wing size (˜75%). Wing size increased with latitude across the reaction norm, mostly due to variation in cell number (87%), which repeated the pattern observed at a single temperature. Although there was significant variation among populations in phenotypic plasticity of the wing traits, a latitudinal trend in this variation was only detected for cell size; variation in plasticity of wing size among populations was attributable to both cellular components. The results of these experiments suggest that thermal evolution acted on body size itself, since cell number is the basis of additive genetic variation for body size within populations at a single temperature. In the experiments outlined above, it was also found that the size of the wing, relative to the size of the thorax, and the relative length of the wing both decreased in response to high selection and developmental temperatures.

T1  - Thermal ecology of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) in south-central Florida
AN  - 304303668
AB  - During 1994 and 1995, I studied several aspects of the thermal ecology of the gopher tortoise in south-central Florida. My findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Body temperatures of hatchings in laboratory thermal gradients were influenced by hydration and nutritional status. Individuals selected lower body temperatures when dehydrated than when hydrated, presumably to reduce further evaporative and respiratory water loss. Individuals also selected higher body temperatures when fed than when fasted, which may enhance digestion when fed and reduce energy expenditure when fasted. (2) Laboratory studies revealed no effect of ontogeny on heat tolerance or thermal preference. However, radiotelemetry of free-ranging individuals during summer revealed that juveniles apparently thermoregulated less effectively than adults. When preferred body temperatures were physically attainable, such body temperatures were maintained 88% of the time by adults but only 56% of the time by juveniles. Juveniles allowed their body temperatures to stray from preferred primarily during the morning as a result of delayed emergence and at night. Rather than occupy the warmest parts of burrows near the entrance, all juveniles were observed to spend the night at a depth of approximately one meter where they were cooler than preferred but safer from nocturnal predators such as racoons. (3) Gopher tortoises acclimatized to seasonal changes in their thermal environment by modifying their tolerance of high body temperatures. Heat tolerance increased from spring to summer, decreased in fall, and declined further in winter. Lab experiments suggested that proximate stimuli for these changes were temperature acclimation and photoperiod acclimation. Interestingly, tortoises did not exhibit seasonal changes in selected body temperatures when placed in laboratory thermal gradients. In the field, radiotelemetered adults maintained body temperatures within the preferred range $>$80% of the time that it was physically possible throughout the year. This seasonal consistency of thermoregulation was accomplished primarily by modification of basking behavior, with tortoises basking during spring and fall but not during summer. At all times of the year, adults restricted foraging activity to the hottest part of the day. In doing so, they elevated body temperatures to maximal preferred levels by sunset and thereafter maximized nighttime body temperatures.

T1  - The role of adaptation in the establishment in the United States of Brachymeria intermedia (Nees) (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae), a parasitoid of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae)
AN  - 304301923
AB  - An unresolved issue in classical biological control concerns the importance of adaptation in the establishment of introduced natural enemy species. One theory for the relatively low rate of establishment in classical biological control is that introduced species may lack sufficient genetic variation to adapt to their new environment. The importance of adaptation was investigated in a series of experiments with Brachymeria intermedia (Nees) (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae), a pupal parasitoid of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae). Attempts to introduce B. intermedia from the Mediterranean region into New England on several occasions from 1908 to 1963 were considered unsuccessful until 1965, when establishment was finally confirmed. I tested the hypothesis that introduced wasps adapted to the harsher climate of the northeastern United States in a series of experiments with B. intermedia from several U.S. and European locations. Attempts to cross wasps from Corsica and Massachusetts resulted in mating asymmetry, with matings between Corsican males and Massachusetts females occurring less often than for the reciprocal cross or within-strain crosses. This asymmetry resulted from decreased attractiveness of older Massachusetts females, less aggressive courting of all females by Corsican males, and possibly higher receptivity of Corsican females to courtship by males. Comparisons of oviposition rates of five wasp strains at different temperatures and photoperiods did not yield differences consistent with adaptation hypotheses, though in some respects U.S. wasps were more similar to each other than to European wasps. The strains did differ in ability to survive exposure to subfreezing temperatures, in support of the adaptation hypothesis. Survival was strongly influenced by wasp size (dry weight), suggesting that colder environments select for smaller size. A half-sib analysis revealed no additive genetic variation for weight in reciprocal crosses of Massachusetts and Corsican wasps. However, offspring from different crosses differed significantly in weight and in the proportion surviving freezing, consistent with the adaptation hypothesis and supporting the notion of genetic differences between populations.

T1  - Geographic variation in life-history traits in four populations of Chelydra serpentina (Linnaeus)
AN  - 304299913
AB  - The snapping turtle has a wide geographic range allowing me to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation among embryos and among hatchlings in survival and growth rates, sex and temperature selection in response to temperature and food represents adaptation rather than phenotypic plasticity. Each population differed in embryo viability, mass at hatching, and hatching growth rates and survival rates. Hatchling mass and growth rates were greater in the southern populations. Incubation temperatures significantly affected survival rates of embryos and hatchlings, hatchling mass and hatchling growth rates. The northern population had the lowest survival rate at low temperatures contrary to predictions. Food availability did not significantly affect hatchling survival rates. Feeding regime had a significant effect on hatchling growth rates in southern populations. Pivotal temperatures did not vary among populations. Selected temperatures of hatchlings were not significantly affected by population, incubation temperature or food availability.

T1  - Reproductive ecology of Gryllotalpa major (prairie mole cricket)
AN  - 304299039
AB  - The prairie mole cricket (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae: Gryllotalpa major Saussure) is a burrowing insect native to the tallgrass prairie of the south-central United States. G. major is a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, but not enough information has been available on life history and general ecology to support listing of the species. Males construct specialized burrows from which they call to attract females for mating. I found that these burrows are aggregated in the moist springtime prairie soils. Females fly through the aggregations of burrows and drop to the ground in the vicinity of calling males. Females are not constrained in choosing a mate, and there is variation in the males' calls that is at least potentially available to females for assessing mates. Females enter the males' acoustic burrows and presumably mate there, but burrows are not used for oviposition sites. Males do not sequester resources important to females, and male parental care is not likely. The acoustic-burrow entrance is sealed after a male switches from an advertisement to a courtship call, and sealed burrows are used as evidence of successful mate attraction. Based on these observations and criteria, the species has a classical lek mating system, an essential piece of information for making predictions used in conservation decisions. Sexual advertisement in the form of acoustic display is energetically expensive and in addition to other costs of mating. Call effort is adjusted in some species in response to competition from other males or to changes in climatic conditions. I found that call rate adjustments were made with social interactions and changes in soil temperature, but group size did not have an effect on calling effort in this study. Prairie mole cricket males do not adjust their call intensity in relation to competition, female availability, soil temperature, or soil moisture. Males produced more complex calls in response to closer calling neighbors, but it appears that prairie mole cricket males may selectively respond to only the nearest one to two neighbors. In addition to the advertisement call previously described, I identified courtship and aggressive calls. There is also a substrate component to the advertisement call that may be important in male-male spacing.

T1  - Laser-spark ignition and the nitrogen-hydrogen radical
AN  - 304273091
AB  - Laser-induced breakdown is studied in ammonia and ammonia-oxygen gaseous mixtures. We investigate the emission spectra of the NH and N$\sb2$ diatomic molecules in pure ammonia optical plasmas using multispecies spontaneous emission spectroscopy. Gas temperatures are inferred in the decaying optical plasma by theoretical reproductions of the experimental spectra. Laser-induced breakdown microplasmas (laser sparks) are used to ignite combustible ammonia-oxygen gaseous mixtures. We determine the minimum ignition energy requirements and laminar flame speeds over much of the flammability limits of these gas mixtures. The experimentally determined flame speeds are compared to theoretical laminar flame speeds. High-speed shadowgraph photography and planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging of the NH free radical is used to study the temporal and spatial development of the optical plasma in combustible and noncombustible ammonia-oxygen mixtures.    Knowledge of the spatial and temporal evolution of gas temperature and species concentrations as well as spatial symmetries in the laser-induced breakdown plasma is essential for numerical modeling of laser-spark ignition. Experimentally determined quantities such as temperature, free-radical relative number densities, minimum ignition energies, and flame speeds can be used to validate such models.    In all laser-induced breakdown studies, the optical discharge was created by focusing Q-switched Nd:YAG laser 1.064 micrometer wavelength pulses into the gas sample. Focused laser-pulse intensities range from 10's to 100's of GW/cm$\sp2.$

T1  - Evolutionary studies in Batrachoseps and other plethodontid salamanders: Correlated character evolution, molecular phylogenetics, and reaction norm evolution
AN  - 304241527
AB  - I tested several hypotheses of correlated character evolution in the salamander family Plethodontidae. Using a phylogenetically-based comparative method, I confirmed that genome size is positively correlated with embryonic developmental time, an important life history trait. However, no relationship was found between egg size and developmental time.    I estimated phylogenetic relationships within Batrachoseps, a group of eight species distributed along the west coast of North America using DNA sequence data from a mitochondrial gene, cytochrome b. Taxonomy of the group has been difficult because of the high degree of morphological conservatism. Two of the three currently recognized widespread species are shown to contain deeply differentiated, distinct historical units. Relationships among these units are generally congruent with previous hypotheses of relationships inferred from allozyme data. Several cases of incongruence between allozyme and mtDNA data may reflect isolation followed by secondary contact. Taxonomic changes are recommended, resulting in the recognition of a minimum of 20 species.    Reaction norms depict the adult phenotype as a function of the environment in which development proceeds. I examined the evolution of a reaction norm, number of trunk vertebrae as a function of developmental temperature in Batrachoseps, using my phylogenetic hypothesis. Number of trunk vertebrae varies at many levels within Batrachoseps. Parallel clines in number of trunk vertebrae occur along an environmental gradient in three taxonomic units in the Coast Ranges of California. Because number of trunk vertebrae is affected by developmental temperature in other vertebrates, I hypothesized that the parallel clines resulted from a shared plastic response to environmental differences. I found extensive variation in reaction norms among population and species, but plasticity was not sufficient to account for the pattern of parallel clines. Plasticity may affect the evolution of traits in two conflicting ways, by facilitating or retarding it. I tested these hypotheses using data on plasticity in number of trunk vertebrae and change in number of trunk vertebrae in nine species of plethodontids. Changes in number of trunk vertebrae occurred more frequently than expected by chance in lineages in which it was plastic. This is consistent with the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity facilitates evolutionary change.

T1  - Genetic relationships among arctic Daphnia: Implications for the origins and evolutionary significance of polyploidy
AN  - 304239088
AB  - This thesis examines genetic relationships among members of the Daphnia pulex complex from arctic North America to extend our understanding of the origin and evolutionary implications of polyploidy. MtDNA analyses of diploid and polyploid D. pulex clones from a low arctic site revealed that the melanized polyploid clones were divergent from the unmelanized diploid clones and had a mtDNA genome that was more closely related to those of temperate D. pulicaria or D. melanica than to D. pulex. These clones were re-classified as D. middendorffiana because of their hybrid origin. Surprisingly, two unmelanized polyploid clones of D. pulex had a mtDNA genome that was similar to that of a more genetically divergent species, D. tenebrosa. A more extensive arctic survey suggested that two independent hybridization events between refugial races of D. pulicaria gave rise to D. middendorffiana. Results from RFLP analyses at a conserved rDNA region (12s-16s) confirmed that no species of the D. pulex complex other than D. pulicaria was more closely related to D. middendorffiana. Clones of D. tenebrosa from low and high arctic sites clustered into two divergent mtDNA lineages, with no association of haplotypes with geographical location, ploidy level, or pigmentation.    The second part of this thesis examines whether polyploid clones are better adapted to low temperature environmental stress than their diploid counterparts. Life history experiments revealed that polyploid clones of D. middendorffiana had lower fecundity, larger egg and offspring, and larger body size than their diploid counterparts at high temperature. They also showed a tendency to mature at an earlier age than the diploids at low temperature. Three polyploid clones were outcompeted by a diploid clone from Churchill at 20$\sp\circ$C. By contrast, two out of three polyploid clones outcompeted a diploid clone from temperate areas under the same temperature. Polyploid clones had higher survival at both low temperature and high salinity than diploid clones but lower survival under high temperature. The molecular results have shown the importance of hybridization for the generation of polyploidy in Daphnia whereas the ecological results have provided an important explanation for the prevalence of polyploids at arctic sites.

T1  - Development and evaluation of a temperature sensitive lethal (TSL) genetic sexing strain of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wied).
AN  - 301504268
AB  - A genetic sexing strain Tolimán-TSL of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wied).  (Diptera:Tephritidae) has been created for the purpose of sterilization and release in Guatemala.  It is been evaluated by tests both in the laboratory and in the field.  The strain is based on the Vienna-TSL strain, which incorporates a temperature sensitive lethal gene (tsl) linked to the gene for white pupa (wp) on chromosome 5.  Females of the strain are homozygous for this lethal;  males are heterozygous for wp tsl.  They carry a 5-Y translocation (T(Y;5) 1-61) bearing the wild type alleles of wp and tsl.  To create Tolimán-TSL both wp tsl and T(Y;5) 1-61 were separately introduced into a Guatemalan genetic background.  Recovering the wp tsl homozygote was difficult, requiring 11 generations of crosses.  The strain yields only males when the temperature is raised from 25°C to 33°C.  Careful regulation of rearing densities in normal factory production is essential to avoid overheating and to ensure good quality flies.  On this basis the ideal 'seeding rates' of eggs were worked out, which could be three times higher in larval cultures destined to produce males-only for release.In tests to investigate sensitivity to gamma radiation from a Cs137 source, where pupae were exposed under conditions of anoxia, it was found that a 100 Gy of gamma rays gave more than 99% sterility and 150 Gy, 99.7% sterility.  Quality parameters (adult emergence, adult longevity, adult size, flight ability, mating index) were only affected by irradiation in two instances:  (1) adult emergence was depressed in Vienna-TSL after exposure to 40 Gy and above (2) flight ability in the Petapa (standard) strain was depressed by exposure to 150 Gy.  Both TSL strains showed significantly greater weight and greater longevity when deprived of food.  Study of the response of Vienna-TSL to substerilizing doses, showed transmission of partial sterility into future generations (5 generations investigated) after exposure to 4-80 Gy.  At a 100 and 120 Gy exposures, transmission could not proceed beyond generation 1.

T1  - Natural variation within a clock gene of Drosophila melanogaster: A phenotypic and molecular analysis
AN  - 301478890
AB  - The clock gene period encodes a repetitive series of Threonine-Glycine (Thr-Gly) pairs in D. melanogaster. This sequence is polymorphic in length and shows a clinal distribution in Europe, whereby the shorter length variants are more frequent in warmer regions and the longer ones in colder areas. A series of new correlations performed with the European population data suggests that thermal selection may be a factor in generating the cline. DNA sequence analysis of various Thr-Gly haplotypes supports a model where the (Thr-Gly)20 and (Thr-Gly)23 alleles are considered as ancestral, since all variants can be derived from them. A reciprocal dine is observed for the (Thr-Gly)20 length valiant in eastern Australia, suggesting that selection may be maintaining the polymorphism, and a further correlation of temperature with allele frequency suggests, as in European populations, that the dine may be thermally mediated. However, the other major allele the (Thr-Gly)17 was spatially homogenous. The temperature compensation of the dock was examined by investigating the freerunning locomotor activity cycles of different natural Thr-Gly length variants from Europe and Australia. A relationship between Thr-Gly length and temperature compensation which could help explain the continental spatial differences was observed. Locomotor activity profiles in light/dark cycles were also examined in the European variants, and revealed subtle phenotypic differences between the Thr-Gly length variants that could also contribute to the observed clinal patterns. The energy expenditure of different Thr-Gly length variants was also measured and revealed behavioural adaptations for possible fitness advantages. Throughout the behavioural analyses there was also evidence that the structural (Thr-GIy)3 motif played an important role in the temperature compensation mechanism and energy expenditure of the fly.

T1  - Development and evaluation of a temperature sensitive lethal (TSL) genetic sexing strain of the Mediterranean fruit fly, <i>Ceratitis capitata</i> (Wied.)
AN  - 1992119594
AB  - A genetic sexing strain Toliman-TSL of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wied.) (Diptera: Tephritidae) has been created for the purpose of sterilization and release in Guatemala. It has been evaluated by tests both in the laboratory and in the field. The strain is based on the Vienna-TSL strain, which incorporates a temperature sensitive lethal gene (tsi) linked to the gene for white pupa (wp) on chromosome 5. Females of the strain are homozygous for this lethal; males are heterozygous for wp tsl. They carry a 5-Y translocation (T(Y;5)1-61) bearing the wild type alleles of wp and tsl. To create Toliman-TSL both wp tsl and T(Y;5)1-61 were separately introduced into a Guatemalan genetic background. Recovering the wp tsl homozygote was difficult, requiring 11 generations of crosses. The strain yields only males when the temperature is raised from 25°C to 33°C. Careful regulation of rearing densities in normal factory production is essential to avoid overheating and to ensure good quality flies. On this basis the ideal 'seeding rates' of eggs were worked out, which could be three times higher in larval cultures destined to produce males-only for release. In tests to investigate sensitivity to gamma radiation from a CSi37 source, where pupae were exposed under conditions of anoxia, it was found that a 100 Gy of gamma rays gave more than 9 9% sterility and 150 Gy, 99.7% sterility. Quality parameters (adult emergence, adult longevity, adult size, flight ability, mating index) were only affected by irradiation in two instances: (1) adult emergence was depressed in Vienna-TSL after exposure to 40 Gy and above (2) flight ability in the Petapa (standard) strain was depressed by exposure to 150 Gy. Both TSL strains showed significantly lower adult emergence and flight ability than Petapa, but significantly greater weight and greater longevity when deprived of food. Study of the response of Vienna-TSL to substerilizing doses, showed transmission of partial sterility into future generations (5 generations investigated) after exposure to 40-80 Gy. At a 100 and 120 Gy exposures, transmission could not proceed beyond generation 1. Toliman-TSL has been introduced twice into mass production, the first time in '94-'95, breakdown occurred within 6-7 generations. In the second period of culture ('95-96), there have been less than 1.3 % aberrant pupae (brown females, white males) for up to 12 generations. The strategy and procedure for factory strain replacement is discussed. Toliman-TSL was evaluated for mating competitiveness in field cages and for dispersal in the open, both in a coffee plantation. Toliman-TSL males were twice as effective as feral males in mating with feral females, and superior to Vienna-TSL males. In field releases, both Toliman-TSL and Petapa disperse about the same and slightly further when females were absent. In much larger field releases, Toliman-TSL males induced measurable sterility in eggs sampled from coffee beans, reaching an average of 34% in the final 3 weeks of a 13 week release period. In a parallel trial Petapa releases (males plus females) produced hardly greater sterility than in a control area with no releases. Trapping showed that Toliman-TSL males were more readily caught than Petapa. It was concluded that Toliman-TSL was several times more competitive than the standard strain and that its use for SIT control was possible.

T1  - The biology of Sargochromis codringtoni (Boulenger, 1908) in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe
AN  - 304298114
AB  - The biology of Sargochromis codringtoni in Lake Kariba has been investigated and is described. The diet of S. codringtoni was examined by analysis of stomach contents from the juvenile to the adult stage. A size related dietary shift was evident. The diet of juveniles was dominated by planktonic Crustacea and chironomid larvae. Sub-adults feed primarily on pulmonates, whilst the diet of the adult fish is dominated by prosobranchs. Predator-prey data on adult fish was subjected to analysis of indices of electivity and the values indicated that there was negative selection against bivalves. Prey selection experiments confirmed this result as the fish showed no particular preference for any particular snail species but avoided the bivalves. The anatomical features related to feeding showed that S. codringtoni is well adapted to handling a molluscivorous diet.    Gastric evacuation and food consumption were estimated on three different occasions characterising three seasons. The gastric evacuation curve was a decaying exponential and gastric evacuation rates ranged from 0.0743gh$\sp{-1}$ at 19$\sp\circ$C to 0.401gh$\sp{-1}$ at 29$\sp\circ$C. S. codringtoni consumed 4.45%-13.96% of its body weight a day depending upon temperature.

T1  - Clonal diversity and individual adaptability in two colonizing parthenogenetic insects
AN  - 304267430
AB  - This thesis deals with the characteristics of two successfully invading and colonizing parthenogenetic insects, the greenhouse cockroach, Pycnoscelus surinamensis and the spearwinged fly, Dipsa bifurcata.    Many parthenogenetic species are geographically more widely distributed and ecologically broader than their sexual relatives. This success in colonizing and invading abilities has partly been attributed to the existence of broadly adaptable genotypes, which are able to survive and reproduce under a wide range of environmental conditions. The evolution of such "general purpose genotypes" is discussed and currently used methods to estimate environmental adaptability and environmental sensitivity are evaluated. The hypothesis that successfully invading clones of the parthenogenetic cockroach P. surinamensis consist of general purpose genotypes is tested by comparing temperature tolerance and desiccation resistance among clones of P. surinamesis and its sexual ancestor, P. indicus. The results suggest that there is no single set of life history traits with respect to temperature tolerance and desiccation resistance that characterizes all of the successfully invading clones.    Most parthenogenetic species are composed of several clones and clonal coexistence is, contrary to theoretical predictions, common among parthenogenetic populations. Clonal diversity and the dynamics of clonal coexistence were investigated in seven populations of the parthenogenetic fly Dipsa bifurcata by electrophoresis. Environmental factors affecting clonal dynamics are discussed and related to ecological and genetic characteristics of the different populations. Temporal variation in clone frequencies for four of these populations were monitored over seven years and the fluctuations were analyzed and related to estimated fitness differences among clones. The frequency changes were cyclic and synchronous for all populations and corresponded to the seasonality of the environment. The seasonal fitness variation among clones suggests the presence of a seasonal niche separation which could act as a mechanism promoting clonal coexistence.

T1  - Consequences of temperature, viscosity, and small size for early life-history processes in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus
AN  - 304255788
AB  - I examined two implications of size for early life history stages of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus. First, ciliated larvae operate at a physical scale where movement is strongly influenced by the viscosity of sea water. Experiments uncoupled two confounding effects of temperature on larval swimming and feeding: direct effects on physiological processes, and indirect effects on mechanical processes due to changes in sea water viscosity. To separate these effects, I manipulated sea water viscosity through (a) temperature change and (b) addition of biologically-inert polymers. An environmentally relevant, 10$\sp\circ$C drop in water temperature reduced swimming velocity by 40%, water movement by 35%, and suspension feeding by 67%. Viscosity change was sufficient to account for 40%, 55%, and 60% of these reductions in rates, respectively. Much of the effect of temperature was therefore explained by mechanical effects of the external environment. High viscosity also shifted ingestion toward larger particles. These results underscore a problem of using temperature coefficients, such as Q$\sb{10}$'s, to infer effects of temperature on physiology.    Second, larger free-spawned eggs present a larger target for sperm, but afford lower fecundity. To determine whether the fertilization benefit of large size offsets the fecundity cost, I analyzed zygote production as a function of egg size using a model of fertilization kinetics. For eggs of constant organic density, zygote production decreases as a function of egg size, regardless of sperm concentration. Zygote production is predicted to increase, however, as eggs are enlarged through hydration or through addition of a low-cost accessory structure. In D. excentricus, removal of the egg jelly coat reduced fertilization rates. The kinetics model indicated that 53% of this reduction could be accounted for by the change in target size, and 23% by the change in density. Selection experiments with untreated eggs confirmed that larger targets are favored in fertilization. The ovum has 70 times the organic density of the jelly coat. Thus, addition of a jelly coat weakens the life-history tradeoff between target size and fecundity. Accessory structures could allow the production of energetically smaller eggs by reducing the fertilization cost associated with small egg size.

T1  - Host exploitation at low temperatures by Trichogramma minutum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae): Heritability estimates, selection, and the effect of selection on associated biological characteristics
AN  - 304255722
AB  - Females of Trichogramma minutum Riley were found to have significant mean heritability (h$\sp2$ = 0.43) for host exploitation at 15$\sp\circ$C. This indicated that host exploitation could be improved by selection. The applied artificial selection over 8 generations doubled the parasitoids ability to exploit hosts at 15$\sp\circ$C. This result remained stable for two generations after selection pressure was removed; gains were again achieved when the selection pressure was reapplied for an additional three generations. The average realized heritability for host exploitation at 15$\sp\circ$C decreased from 0.35 to 0.09 over 8 generations of selection. This suggested that directional selection of parents in each subsequent generation reduced the amount of genetic variation. The proportion of females parasitizing the host at 15$\sp\circ$C was significantly different between selection and control lines suggesting that this trait was improved indirectly during selection for host exploitation at 15$\sp\circ$C. Rearing Trichogramma at 25$\sp\circ$C did not decrease its ability to parasitize hosts at low temperatures. This is important for mass rearing of Trichogramma because females of Trichogramma reared at 25$\sp\circ$C have a faster developmental rate, higher emergence rate, fecundity and sex ratio than those reared at 15$\sp\circ$C. The results suggested that host exploitation at low temperature can be improved in Trichogramma and this will have a significant impact on its use for biological control in cooler climates.

T1  - Biological and geographical limits on the production dynamics of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) on the southwestern Scotian Shelf
AN  - 304243450
AB  - The interrelationship among stock abundance, spatial distribution, growth and recruitment for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) on the southwestern Scotian Shelf was assessed using data from standard bottom trawl surveys conducted by Canada (1970-92) and the United States (1963-86). Recent studies using survey data to describe interannual variation in the the spatial distribution of marine fish stocks have yielded contradictory results. Several sources of imprecision and bias in these distributional indices were identified which limited their utility for describing the geographic response of groundfish stocks to changes in total abundance. An improved modelling approach was developed which described the statistical relationship between total abundance-at-age and local density of juvenile haddock for sub-areas of the stock range. Systematic variation among sub-areas in parameter estimates of the model was consistent with density-dependent habitat selection: juvenile haddock responded to increases in total abundance-at-age by increasing their local density in sub-areas where they were absent or scarce when abundance was low. A distinct spatial gradient in growth of haddock was also evident with individuals resident in the Bay of Fundy being larger than their counterparts on the southwestern Scotian Shelf. This difference necessitated partitioning the survey data into two subcomponents for the analysis of interannual variation in growth. Both stock abundance and bottom water temperature influenced interannual variation in growth of haddock, however, their relative importance depended on the time period, subcomponent, and age-classes considered. Growth of juveniles on the southwestern Scotian Shelf varied inversely with stock abundance. Body size characteristics of adult haddock on the southwestern Scotian Shelf were positively correlated with recruitment which suggests that interannual variation in population fecundity may be an important source of recruitment variation. A simulation example suggested that estimates of spawning stock biomass are not proportional to population fecundity which could explain the widespread lack of correlation between spawning stock biomass and recruitment.

T1  - Evolutionary trajectories in recently established populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis)
AN  - 304230461
AB  - The evolutionary implications of establishing refuge populations for rare species have received little attention. One means by which evolutionary trajectories may be altered is if genetic variability is lost in refuge populations. I examined allozyme variability at 16 loci for western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) populations with known histories of introduction. Translocations had little effect on genetic variability as measured by heterozygosity. However, refuge populations had considerably lower levels of allelic diversity than parental populations. All losses were of relatively rare alleles (frequency less than 0.1 in parental population). These losses were probably due to an undocumented bottleneck early in the introduction history. A literature review revealed that genetic variability is often reduced in refuge populations, typically involving the loss of alleles. Such losses are important as they may compromise the evolutionary potential of these populations.    Populations may also experience rapid evolution in life history traits when introduced to novel environments. I described life history traits for four recently established populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Female mosquitofish from thermally stable habitats, Bonham and Garrett, were characterized by delayed size at maturity, high fat content, and large embryos. In contrast, females from a thermally unstable habitat, Wabuska, were characterized by maturity at small size, low fat content, and small embryos. Females from Parker, a warm spring, matured at an intermediate size, had low fat content and large embryos. These differences are of interest because these populations shared common ancestors in 1937. To test whether these differences in traits were due to plasticity or rapid evolution, captive populations from the four study sites were maintained under common-garden conditions for two generations. No population differences were observed for reproductive traits, including reproductive allocation and embryo weight. Fat content was significantly different among populations in the common-garden experiment. In both the common-garden and in the field, Wabuska females matured at significantly smaller sizes. The observed variation in the field reflected plasticity for reproductive traits, but rapid evolution has apparently occurred for size at maturity and fat storage for these recently established mosquitofish populations. The conservation implications of these results are discussed.

T1  - The economic impact of climate change on India's agriculture
AN  - 304228751
AB  - It is widely held that the current rate of increase in $\rm CO\sb2$ production from human sources will lead to climate change. This dissertation uses an economic model to analyze the effects of that climate change on the agricultural sector of a country, India. This dissertation distinguishes itself from other studies by attempting to capture farmers' capacity for adapting to a changed climate.    More precisely, the profit-maximizing framework is used to describe farmers' behavior in the presence of rainfall, among other variables. Only rainfall is chosen as a climatic variable as it is said to be the limiting input to Indian agriculture.    India is chosen because its agricultural sector is large and covers various climates. This variety of climates serves to capture Indian farmers' adaptability to climate change.    The model, a series of crop-supply and input-demand equations, is estimated with cross-sectional and time-series data. The equations are then re-computed for the new levels of technology and rainfall that are predicted to occur when ambient $\rm CO\sb2$, levels are double their current values.    The model omits the effect of changes in temperature, which is predicted to rise. Higher temperatures will reduce yields; the direct, fertilizing effect of higher $\rm CO\sb2$ levels should, however, more than offset the reduction in yields.    Nevertheless, the model predicts that changing rainfall levels, resulting from $\rm CO\sb2$ doubling, lead to an increase in the production of rice and potatoes, to a decrease in the production of many staples and to an increase in the demand for all inputs. When technology is allowed to change as well, then the model predicts increases in the output of most crops and in the demand for labor and materials. These results are sensitive to the forecast period, which is determined by the time it takes for $\rm CO\sb2$ levels to double.    Higher population levels, predicted to occur at the time of $\rm CO\sb2$ doubling, will absorb almost all the increase in agricultural production. The increasing demand for labor in the agricultural sector, resulting from climate change, will absorb a large part of the increase in population.

T1  - Dormancy of Heterodera glycines in Missouri
AN  - 304214975
AB  - A two-year study was conducted in field microplots to determine the relative importance of soybean phenology and soil temperature on the induction of dormancy in soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. Infested microplots were planted with near-isogenic soybean lines (selections from 'Clark') differing for date of maturity. Eggs of H. glycines, extracted from cysts collected monthly from each microplot, were used in hatching tests and bioassays to determine dormancy. Egg-hatching and J2-infectivity rates decreased beginning in July, indicating dormancy induction. Hatching rates were not related to soil temperature, and did not differ consistently among soybean isolines. The monophasic changes in all nematode responses (hatching, infectivity, and reproduction) with peak mid-summer rates suggest that H. glycines produces one primary generation per year under central Missouri conditions. Changes in hatching rates and the timing of minimum and maximum rates suggested that H. glycines eggs exhibit more than one type of dormancy.    Trehalose accumulation occurs during dormancy induction in other nematode species, and its use as a marker for dormancy of H. glycines was investigated in a two-year field microplot experiment. Changes in the glucose, trehalose, total protein, and glycogen contents og eggs retained within cysts were monitored monthly. Trehalose accumulation was highly negatively correlated with soil temperature. Thus, trehalose accumulation is not a useful marker for dormancy in contrast to dormancy induction, which was temperature-independent.

T1  - Characterization of acute and chronic toxicity of fluoranthene and the potential for acquisition enhanced tolerance in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas)
AN  - 304213701
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine if fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, can evolve tolerance of exposure to fluoranthene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.    A population of fathead minnows was acutely exposed to fluoranthene in the presence of UV radiation. Survivors were allowed to recover and then bred to produce a putatively more tolerant F$\sb1$ generation. Fish from the selected population had significantly shorter LT50 values and reduced swimming capacity compared to wild fish. Genotype at the Gpi-2 (glucosephophate isomerase) locus was significantly related to time to death in all acute exposures, including those conducted in a chronic experiment. These results are likely explained by an opercular deformity which was apparent in 33% of the F$\sb1$ treatment fish and in 34% of their offspring. Shifts in genotypic frequencies were not apparent in the selected population.    A separate population was chronically exposed over an entire generation. Compared to a control population maintained identically except for the exclusion of fluoranthene, egg production (33% reduction), hatching success (21% reduction), and larval survivorship (37% reduction) were significantly lower in this population. Enhanced tolerance was not apparent in LC50 determinations, although an examination of the concentration-response distribution suggested an adverse effect due to egg and larval exposure to fluoranthene prior to the test. However, LT50 values indicated that the exposed population was approximately 30% more tolerant. Egg production by F$\sb1$ fish, the production of the F$\sb2$ generation, was not significantly different for the treatment and control fish. There was a 12% difference in genotypic frequency at the PGM locus between F$\sb1$ treatment and control fish. Accidental loss of parental fish precluded a comparison between generations. There was no significant difference between swimming fatigue times for exposure and treatment F$\sb1$ fish swum at several temperatures.    These results indicate that Gpi-2 genotypes differ in their tolerance of acute exposure, that acute exposure of fathead minnows can cause morphological deformities, that chronic exposure can hinder reproduction, and that fathead minnows can evolve tolerance of future. These results also suggest that swimming performance is not altered by this acquisition of tolerance.

T1  - Body size and proportions in the Late Pleistocene Western Old World and the origins of modern humans
AN  - 304210614
AB  - Predictions derived from two competing models of modern human origins, "Replacement" and "Regional Continuity", were tested using osteometric and femoral cross-sectional data reflective of body size and proportions for Late Pleistocene and recent humans from Europe, Africa and the Near East. Specifically, given a strong genetic component and low selective rates on the features studied, Replacement predicts the earliest modern humans in higher latitudes will exhibit a tropically-adapted morphology (assuming Africa was the center of the hypothesized single origin); later humans in these regions will have evolved more cold-adapted proportions. Regional Continuity, on the other hand, permits only minor shifts in body shape, due to climatic change and/or improved cultural buffering.    Univariate, regression and multivariate analyses of both raw and "log shape" data reveal a close morphological affinity between the early modern Europeans (EUP, $\geq$ 20,000 BP) and recent Africans. Like Africans, the EUP sample had long limbs (particularly distal segments), relatively smaller joints and relatively short and narrow trunks. Allometric effects may account for the trunk shape features, but the other features either violate allometric expectation or are isometric. Thus, allometry alone cannot account for EUP body shape.    Two ordination methods (UPGMA clustering and principal coordinates analysis with minimum spanning tree) of log shape data group the EUP sample mean with recent Sub-Saharan and/or North Africans. Principal components analysis of log shape data reveals that most EUP specimens fall within the recent Sub-Saharan African range of variation. However, most fall within the recent European range of variation, as well, albeit at the extremes of that range.    Other fossil groups cluster as follows: European Late Upper Paleolithic (LUP) and Mesolithic specimens cluster with recent Europeans, European Neandertals are "hyper" cold-adapted, and thus different from all recent groups, Late Pleistocene North Africans cluster among recent North Africans (excepting the Jebel Sahaba sample, who have Sub-Saharan affinities), and there is some suggestion that the small Skhul/Qafzeh sample has Sub-Saharan affinities.    These results are interpreted as evidence for a lack of local continuity associated with the origins of modern humans, at least in Europe. These data do not, however, preclude the possibility of some (albeit small) contribution of genes from Neandertals to succeeding populations, as is postulated in Brauer's "Afro-European Sapiens" model.

T1  - Nonequilibrium flows with smooth particle applied mechanics
AN  - 304185242
AB  - Smooth particle methods are relatively new methods for simulating solid and fluid flows though they have a 20-year history of solving complex hydrodynamic problems in astrophysics, such as colliding planets and stars, for which correct answers are unknown. The results presented in this thesis evaluate the adaptability or fitness of the method for typical hydrocode production problems.    For finite hydrodynamic systems, boundary conditions are important. A reflective boundary condition with image particles is a good way to prevent a density anomaly at the boundary and to keep the fluxes continuous there. Boundary values of temperature and velocity can be separately controlled. The gradient algorithm, based on differentiating the smooth particle expressions for (u$\rho$) and (T$\rho$), does not show numerical instabilities for the stress tensor and heat flux vector quantities which require second derivatives in space when Fourier's heat-flow law and Newton's viscous force law are used.    Smooth particle methods show an interesting parallel linking them to molecular dynamics. For the inviscid Euler equation, with an isentropic ideal gas equation of state, the smooth particle algorithm generates trajectories isomorphic to those generated by molecular dynamics. The shear moduli were evaluated based on molecular dynamics calculations for the three weighting functions, B spline, Lucy, and Cusp functions.    The accuracy and applicability of the methods were estimated by comparing a set of smooth particle Rayleigh-Benard problems, all in the laminar regime, to corresponding highly-accurate grid-based numerical solutions of continuum equations. Both transient and stationary smooth particle solutions reproduce the grid-based data with velocity errors on the order of 5%. The smooth particle method still provides robust solutions at high Rayleigh number where grid-based methods fails. Considerably fewer smooth particles are required than atoms in a corresponding molecular dynamics simulations of Rayleigh-Benard convection. Nevertheless, the smooth particle trajectories are essentially Newtonian trajectories, for particles with mass m, subject to an effective potential function 2Pn-$\sp{-2}$w(r). Accordingly, high-pressure subsonic problems, with v$\sp2$ $<<$ c$\sp2,$ cannot be reliably solved using this method. A further limitation of the method is its inability to treat free surfaces accurately.    Not just subsonic flows can be treated. Shock waves propagate very well in smooth particle systems. For the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability problem with a small amplitude interface perturbation, compared to the wavelength, the interface amplitude grows linearly and the growth rate agrees with the analytic value within 3%.    The smooth particle method promises to be of special interest whenever it is desirable to include fluctuations. Smooth particles also provide an interesting eddy viscosity for use in turbulence studies.

T1  - The reproductive behavior and ecology of the tidewater goby Eucyclogobius newberryi (Pisces: Gobiidae)
AN  - 304168266
AB  - The tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi) is an endangered fish restricted to California's coastal estuaries. I conducted field studies of two populations in north-central California over three years (1991-1994) to investigate population dynamics, reproduction and feeding ecology. I also investigated the tidewater goby's unusual sex-role reversed mating behavior, in which females compete more intensely than do males for access to mates.    Tidewater gobies inhabited coastal lagoon, creek and brackish marsh habitats, preferring shallow slack-water areas. Fish and eggs were collected over a wide range of salinity (2-27 ppt) and temperature (9-15$\sp\circ$C). Fish from marsh habitats were larger, which may reflect better food resources or longer lifespan. Clutches averaged 300-500 eggs, with the largest clutches collected from the Pescadero population and from marsh habitats. Marshes may therefore be important habitats to conserve. Tidewater gobies preyed opportunistically on benthic invertebrates, principally ostracods, chironomids and Corophium amphipods. Observations of feeding behavior suggested that habitat differences in diet could reflect substrate differences. Juveniles fed at all hours while adults fed primarily at night, but their diets did not differ. Although spawning could occur in any month, it peaked in spring, with a smaller peak in late summer. Both sexes spawned repeatedly and most adults died after the spring spawning season.    Laboratory and field observations revealed that the tidewater goby is moderately sex-role reversed. The male constructed a burrow in sand, where he cared for the entire clutch of a single female. Although males defended territories and courted females, females displayed more striking nuptial coloration, fought more intensely for mates and often initiated courtship. The potential reproductive rate of females was 1.24 times greater than that of males. According to sexual selection theory, this should produce a female-biased operational sex ratio and thus result in more intense sexual selection pressure on females. Experimental manipulation of the sex ratio revealed that individuals adjusted their behavior according to the local sex ratio, not the population sex ratio. Mating success was influenced by courtship behavior and female nuptial coloration, but not by intrasexual competitive behavior or body size.

T1  - Muscle growth, development and enzyme activity in cold and warm water fish species exposed to different temperatures
AN  - 301613472
AB  - The purpose of this thesis was to compare muscle growth, development and metabolism in fish that have been adapted through the process of evolution to different thermal conditions.  For each species a "natural" thermal regime was compared with a thermal extreme.The developing fish, optimum temperature for myofibre hyperplasia and fast muscle growth is within the thermal range of the spawning season for each species.  As a result, total muscle growth is impaired when thermal regime differs from that found in the natural habitat for each species.In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, L.), a cold water species, increasing the temperature above the "natural" thermal range resulted in impaired myogenesis and growth, while in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus, Peters), a tropical species, decreasing the temperature below the optimum "natural" thermal range resulted in decreased muscle fibre hyperplasia and growth.In Atlantic salmon (newly hatched and juveniles) and tilapia (fry and juveniles) fast growth is related with an increased activity of the respiratory chain enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) in relation to the activity of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of their axial muscle tissue.At the coldest temperature of the thermal range of tilapia, activity of CCO does not increase, indicating a lack of a capacity to compensate for the Q10 effect of temperature on the rate of aerobic metabolism.  In sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, L.), which is a eurythermic fish species, cold acclimation resulted in some changes in the ratio of mitochondrial enzyme activity and the ratio of LDH:CCO, indicating that in each species the response of fish muscle to thermal acclimation can vary.

T1  - Advanced melting systems for nickel base superalloys.
AN  - 301502631
AB  - A literature review detailing the materials properties required for the latest generation of aero-engines has highlighted the need for "clean" nickel-base superalloys.  The difficulties of assessing "clean" alloys has been reviewed as has literature dealing with current commercial melting systems for these alloys.  A detailed assessment of literature on ingot production and refining by Electron Beam Cold Hearth Remelting (EBCHR) has also been carried out.  This ascertained that low density inclusions (LDI's) can be eliminated in the hearth by surface tension, gravity and the effects of the high vacuum.Based on the literature reviewed and historical experience at INCO ALLOYS LIMITED, a programme of trials was designed to evaluate the viability of producing semi-commercial scale ingots by EBCHR in three nickel base alloys with the required cleanness and mechanical properties.Ingots of 250mm diameter have been produced in INCONEL* alloy 718, INCO* Waspaloy and Alloy APK12 (similar to UDIMET** 720).  Good ingot surfaces were generally obtained with a reduction in oxygen and nitrogen levels achieved for all the alloys compared to the feedstock material.  Electron Beam Button Melting (EBBM) indicated that a reduction in the number and size of oxide inclusions was obtained after EBCHR for all the alloys.The flexibility of the EB heat source was used to optimise conditions to obtain equiaxed as-cast grain structures which were successfully converted to wrought fine grain sizes by  hot working for all the alloys.Mechanical testing of the fully wrought structure established that a significant improvement in Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) properties was obtained for all the alloys.  Statistically relevant sampling of tests carried out at one stress condition showed that a much reduced scatter was obtained compared to data from conventional material.  Evaluation of LCF sample fracture surfaces indicated no premature failures in the EBCHR materials due to random defects.

T1  - The mineralogy, geochemistry, physical properties and possible industrial applications of volcanic zeolitic tuffs from Santorini and Polyegos Islands, Greece
AN  - 301475373
AB  - The microcrystalline vitric mass of Pliocene volcanic tuffs of Santorini and Polyegos islands, in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, has been replaced by authigenic zeolites and clays. The Santorini tuffs are dominated by heulandite type 2 and 3, the classification based on thermal tests, illite/smectite phases, and mordenite, opal-CT, cristobalite, feldspar, quartz and amphibole. The composition of the heulandite minerals can range from (Na2.12K2.56 Ca0.40Mg0.19) (Si29.97A16.08O72) 24H2O and (Na2.60K2.28Ca0.48Mg0.27) (Si29.71 A16.20O72) 24H2O, where Na and K dominate in different proportions, to more calcic members (Na1.56K1.26Ca1.19Mg0.58) (Si29.35A16.71 O72) 24H2O where Ca and Mg dominate. Microprobe analyses classify the heulandites as type 3. Heulandite classification, then, requires the combined use of thermal tests and microprobe analyses. The heulandites show a platy crystal habit and they form, by the mean of dissolution, pseudomorphs after the inner parts of glass shards. The tuffs from the north part of Polyegos island are dominated by mordenite and illite, rarely illite/smectite, along with heulandite type 3, opal-CT, kaolinite, quartz and feldspar. The composition of the mordenite includes, as well as the typical Na-Ca members, with analyses within the known field of mordenite composition, mordenites with unusual high K values. So the formula can range from a (Ca0.68Mg0.49Na4.05K0.52) (Si41.06Al6.94O96) 24H2O where Na and Ca dominate and the Na/K ratio is 7.79 to (Ca1.20Mg0.20Na2.31K2.39) (Si40.61A17.41O96) 24H2O where the Na/K ratio is 0.97. The mordenites show a fibrous habit and replace the inner part of lapillus pumice fragments. They were probably formed by the circulation of hydrothermal fluids through the volcanic tuffs, followed by the emplacement of rhyolitic lavas in the area. The hydrothermal alteration event led to the formation of numerous baryte and galena veins and flats. The examination of other crystal phases present in Santorini tuffs indicates that not all of the products in the Santorini volcanic suite were the result of the involvement of more fertile asthenosphere, as was believed. Volcanic products, like the tuffs examined, show mineral chemistry similarities with their counterparts from the two ends of the volcanic arc. Therefore, the maximum crustal thinning under the central part of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, which is responsible for this different source for the generation of magmas in this area of the Arc, had not been completed before the Upper Pliocene, at the very earliest. The examination of geochemistry reveals that the parent materials were dacites to rhyodacites in Santorini and dacites-rhyodacites to trachyandesites-trachytes in Polyegos. The volcanic tuffs from both areas are the product of a fractional crystallisation process with most distinctive evidence found in Polyegos. Santorini shows evidence of magma mixing process also. The traditional cation exchange capacity methods require modification when used with tuffs rich in zeolites regarding the saturation time and the ammonia measurement techniques. Nevertheless, the zeolitic tuffs exhibit excellent cation exchange properties higher than it was expected. Their great ability to combine with lime, in water saturated environments, and act as pozzolanic materials, improves the performance of concrete mixtures. Mixtures which are made by replacing ordinary Portland cement, for calcined zeolitic materials and in various proportions, are able to reach and maintain compressive strength values, higher than standard concrete cubes which are made of 100% Portland cement as the binding agent. Finally, using relatively cheap mineral separation techniques, like dry sieving, fractions rich in zeolite minerals can be easily obtained.

T1  - Mitochondrial malic enzyme (mep-2*) genotype, temperature and growth in juvenile atlantic salmon (salmo salar l)
AN  - 301470907
AB  - The genetic variation at the diallelic mitochondrial malic enzyme (MEP-2*) locus represents one of the most widespread polymorphisms detected in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Previous studies of this locus in wild fish populations have found evidence to suggest an adaptive genetic response to local environmental temperature. In both Europe and North America, latitudinal clines in the frequencies of the two MEP-2* alleles exist, that show the same correlation with environmental temperature. In addition, these studies have identified variable associations between MEP-2* genotypes and phenotypic variation in juvenile growth in freshwater. Because growth performance is known to influence survival and reproductive success in Atlantic salmon, it has been postulated that differences in MEP-2* genotype growth performance could be a factor underlying the basis of this apparent adaptive response. This thesis investigates the relationship between MEP-2* genotype, temperature and growth performance in juvenile Atlantic salmon. The thesis aims were (i) to determine whether the genetic variation at the MEP-2* locus in the Atlantic salmon was associated with differences in juvenile growth performance in freshwater, (ii) when any such differences were established, and (iii) to what extent water temperature influenced the association. These were achieved by monitoring MEP-2* genotype growth performance and survival in juvenile Atlantic salmon, hatchery reared under warm (ambient plus ca.4°C), ambient (seasonally variable ambient water temperature) and cold (ambient minus ca. 4°C) water temperature regimens. The results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate that the genetic variation at the MEP-2* locus in the Atlantic salmon is associated with significant differences in juvenile growth performance in freshwater. Associations were observed both early in post-hatch development, and later when the fish had made the transition to exogenous feeding. Furthermore, these associations were found to be strongly influenced by both temperature and feeding ration. These are specific new findings which significantly add to our present knowledge of the MEP-2* polymorphism in the Atlantic salmon. Although these associations did not influence survival in the study, it is postulated that if the same effect were to occur in natural populations, the genetic response indicated could influence fitness. Additionally, it is possible that these genotypic differences in growth performance could be of relevance to selective breeding programs within the salmon farming industry. However, whether the genetic response exhibited was directly due to the MEP-2* locus on its own, or to some other linked locus or loci, remains to be demonstrated.

T1  - Interspecific Competition, Predation, and the Coexistence of Three Closely Related Neotropical Armoured Catfishes (Siluriformes - Callichthyidae)
AN  - 2479803663
AB  - Tropical ecosystems are renowned for their high biodiversity with many closely related species living together. Alpha diversity of tropical freshwater fishes is also extremely high, as exemplified by the cichlid fauna of the Great African lakes and the neotropical characins. Since Hutchinson in 1959 posed his often quoted question: "Why are there so many animals?", factors affecting species diversity have been important subject of study and discussion in ecology. Given the limits of the physical environment, two different biological processes are probably responsible for most of the organization of equilibrial communities: competition and predation.Critics of the view that competition and predation play a major role in structuring communities argued that several factors keep populations below a level where competition or predation could be strong. Reviews of the literature on field experiments designed to demonstrate the influence of competition and predation revealed that only 9% of the studies were conducted in the tropics.The tropical rainforest is one of the most stable environments in the world. Temperature and humidity are almost constant, but important fluctuations in the water level of streams and swamps occur. Extreme conditions limiting population densities and leading to the extinction of populations are often hard to imagine. The high number of species will lead to complex biological interactions. More studies on competition and predation in the stable environment of the tropical rainforest are necessary to evaluate the importance of both processes in structuring communities.A case study is presented concerning three medium-sized armoured catfishes of the family Callichthyidae: Callichthys callichthys, Hoplosternum littorale and Hoplosternum thoracatum. In order to evaluate the influence of competition and predation on the catfish communities, four factors were investigated in detail: 1) geographical distribution, 2) diet overlap, 3) reproductive seasonality and nest-site differentiation, and 4) predation.In Suriname (South America), both C. callichthys and H. thoracatum occur all over the country. Both catfishes are abundant in both coastal plain swamps with standing water and rainforest creeks in the interior with running water. Hoplosternum littorale, on the other hand, is restricted in its distribution to coastal plain swamps. Salinity tolerance experiments demonstrated that one-week old larvae of H. littorale could not survive in electrolyte-poor water (e.g. rain water). The 'clear water' of rainforest creeks in the interior may be compared to slightly contaminated distilled water with very low electric conductivity. Larvae of both C. callichthys and H. thoracatum survived and developed further in rain water. The pattern of distribution in Suriname can be considered as a model of the distribution of the three catfishes in South America. In South America, H. littorale is not only conspicuously absent from clear water streams draining the weathered Precambrium Guyana and Brazilian Shields, but also from 'black water' streams with humic acids and also a low conductivity (e.g. the Rio Negro). Within the Amazon drainage system H. littorale seems restricted to 'white water' streams loaded with Andean sediments and with a higher conductivity than both clear water and black water. In Suriname, actual syntopy of the three species occurs in coastal plain swamps. In rainforest creeks of the interior C. callichthys and H. thoracatum occur syntopically. Consequently interspecific competition among the three callichthyids is possible.Analysis of the stomach contents of larvae, juveniles and adults of the three armoured catfishes revealed no significant interspecific differences in the diet of larvae, juveniles and adults. However, ontogenetic differences in diet composition among larvae, juveniles and adults where significant for all three catfishes. Larvae of C . callichthys, H. littorale and H. thoracatum fed almost exclusively on Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda. The stomach contents of juveniles were more diverse and included micro-crustacea, insect larvae, aquatic insects and some detritus. Adults ingested large quantities of detritus which probably reflected the inability of large fish to seperate effectively benthic invertebrates from substrate. Chironomid larvae where found in large numbers in the stomach of adult specimens. The short alimentary tract of the three catfishes and the structure of its wall make it improbable that these fishes are able to assimilate detrital nonprotein amino acids. The posterior part of the intestine is thin-walIed and has a respiratory function. The anterior digestive portion is relatively short. Morphologically the three callichthyids are adapted to a benthic way of life and a diet of soft-bodied aquatic invertebrates. The similarity in the diet and their bottomdwelling habit provide the basis for grouping the three armoured catfishes into one ecological guild. Competitive interactions are expected to be potentially strong among members of a guild.Male C. callichthys, H. littorale and H. thoracatum construct and guard a floating bubble nest in flooded swamps. Although the habit of constructing a floating bubble nest probably evolved as an adaptation to the oxygen-depleted environment of tropical standing waters, some of the characteristics of the nests of C.callichthys and H. thoracatum may have evolved as a response to the unpredictability of the fluctuations in water level and water velocity in rainforest creeks. The conspicuous nests allow the study of the temporal pattern of breeding, the spatial distribution of the nests and the differentiation of the nest-site microhabitat among the three species. Daily surveys in coastal plain swamps revealed a similar, bimodal breeding season in the three catfishes. Nests were observed in both the short and long rainy season. The bimodal breeding pattern in Suriname is probably related to the unreliability of the rainfall in the short rainy season of December-January. In French Guiana the rains of December-January usually do not fail and an unimodal breeding season of H. littorale is found. Significant differences in nest macrohabitat selection were found among the three callichthyids. Nests of H. littorale were built in herbaceous swamps, while C . callichthys and H. thoracatum nested in swamp forest under trees. The two forest nesting species differed in the microhabitat at the nest site. Nests of C . callichthys were constructed in extremely shallow water and in holes of tree roots and earth. Nest densities in the selected habitat were low in C.callichthys and H. littorale, but relatively high in H . thoracatum. Nest-site differentiation in the rainy season (the main feeding period) may prevent competitive exclusion among the three catfishes.The potential predation pressure on eggs, larvae and juveniles of H. thoracatum was estimated by combining laboratory predation rates of 24 predator species (both invertebrates and vertebrates) with the density of the predators in the swamp as determined by chemofishing with rotenone. The contribution of a particular predator species to the total predation pressure on H.thoracatum was determined to a large extent by the density of the predator in the swamp. Seemingly innocuous predators with low or moderate predation rates in the laboratory may be extremely important in the swamp due to their abundance. Smallsized fishes and aquatic invertebrates are probably major predators of early developmental stages of H. thoracatum. The potential predation pressure on eggs is high, but the aggressive nest guarding behaviour of the male catfish and concealment of the nests probably protects the eggs effectively from most aquatic predators. Larvae are not guarded by the male and the potential impact of the 24 predators on the larvae of H. thoracatum is large. Although the experiments were performed with H. thoracatum there is no good reason to expect important differences in predation rates on larvae of the three armoured catfishes. Even if only 2.5 % of the potential predation will be realized due to other prey available, the high mortality of early developmental stages of H. thoracatum (and C. callichthys and H. littorale ) in the swamp could be easily explained as the effect of predation. Potential predation pressure and the number of predators that were able to prey on H. thoracatum sharply declined with increasing age (size) of the juvenile catfish. The heavy armour of bony plates and stout pectoral spines protect older juveniles and adults from most potential predators. The high potential predation pressure in the swamps and the low density of juvenile catfish at the end of the rainy season suggest that predation is important in structuring these catfish communities.Although larvae of the three armoured catfishes C. callichthys , H. littorale and H. thoracatum show differences in tolerance to electrolyte-poor water, the three species occur together in coastal swamps. Interspecific diet overlap is very high, and the three catfishes show no differentiation in their breeding season and diel pattern of activity. Ontogenetic changes in the defense mechanisms of armoured catfishes result in a situation in which both predation and competition exert control at different times in the life cycle. Predators probably kill most of the larvae and juveniles, leaving only a few individuals to escape and reach adulthood. If the number of escapes would exceed the number of adult deaths, the populations eventually become sufficiently dense to compete. However, in this situation nest-habitat segregation may prevent competitive exclusion of one  of the three species .

T1  - The Physiological Ecology of the Phase Polymorphism in the African Armyworm Moth, <em>Spodoptera exempta</em> (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
AN  - 1796352680
AB  - The effects of larval phase polyphenism on adult reproductive biology, and larval nutritional and thermal ecology of the African armyworm moth, Spodoptera exempta (Walker) were investigated.Differences between moths which were reared from solitaria and gregaria larvae were obtained in fecundity (weight-adjusted) and pre-oviposition period. Number of egg batches, oviposition period and longevity of female moths were influenced by adult diet and not by larval phase. Phase effects, on fecundity and pre-oviposition period were removed by rearing larvae as solitaria for three generations.Larval food consumption and utilization indices were affected by phase and instar; the direction of differences depended on whether solitaria larvae were first- or third-generation. There were no differences in growth rates between phases. Weight-adjusted triglyceride contents of larvae were higher in the gregaria in two out of three trials. Solitaria larvae contained more body water. Rearing of larvae in different sizes of containers did not affect the triglyceride levels within phases, but affected water content in the solitaria.At constant ambient temperatures of 17.5, 22.5 and 25°C, gregaria larvae developed faster than solitaria. At 30°C, larval period was shorter for the solitaria than the gregaria. The rate of development did not differ between phases at 35°C. Gregaria larvae lost their black pigment at 35°C and above. Anaesthetized black larvae attained higher rates of increase in temperature than larvae of lighter pigment when exposed to radiant energy. Loss of the black pigment at higher temperatures was accompanied by loss of ability of gregaria larvae to heat up faster under radiant energy. Studies on behaviour failed to demonstrate any preference of larvae in one phase for illuminated or shaded areas.The implications of these findings for the life history of S. exempta and the problems involved in research on phase polyphenism are discussed.

T1  - Comparative ecology and life history of two temperate, northwestern Atlantic searobins, Prionotus carolinus and Prionotus evolans (Pisces: Triglidae)
AN  - 304147622
AB  - Research of fish emphasizes economically important species (e.g., Clupeiformes, Gadiformes, Pleuronectiformes), so our knowledge of life history variation in fishes is limited by the relatively small number of non-commercial species that have been studied. Largely in response to this, two unexploited species (northern searobin, Prionotus carolinus (Linnaeus, 1771), and striped searobin, P. evolans (Linnaeus, 1766)) were studied in a central part of their range, the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Museum specimens and archived fishery-independent data sources were reviewed to outline their life cycles and population characteristics. Both species occurred year-round in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, migrating seasonally in an onshore-offshore as well as a north-south pattern and spawning from May to October. Prionotus carolinus was typically more abundant than P. evolans, and water temperature was useful for explaining seasonal differences in distribution and abundance between the two species. Their population sizes were fairly steady over the last 2-3 decades, unlike many other benthic species whose abundances have declined during this period. Larval, metamorphosing, and newly-settled juvenile searobins were collected during 1991-1992, and these stages were found to be much more abundant than previously reported. Prionotus spp. early life history was further emphasized by analyzing microincrements (validated as daily) in sagittal otoliths. For both species, flexion of the notochord was complete at 6-7 mm standard length (SL) and by three weeks after hatching; this morphological transition closely preceded settlement (at about 8-9 mm SL and about one week later). Both species grew 0.3-0.4 mm d$\sp{-1}$ as larvae, and settled juveniles grew at a similar or faster rate (0.3-0.6 mm d$\sp{-1}$). Prionotus carolinus concentrated its spawning later in the season (principally in August) so that young-of-the-year (YOY) individuals were smaller, on average, than YOY P. evolans. The size range of YOY P. carolinus also overlapped with the size range of yearling conspecifics, which confounded cohort analysis of length frequencies. Continental shelf habitate appear to be important nursery grounds for P. carolinus, based on the wide distribution and high densities of YOY fish there, and P. carolinus may represent a major component of total juvenile fish production for the Mid-Atlantic Bight shelf.

T1  - Within-population variation in demography of Taraxacum officinale
AN  - 304144326
AB  - A central question in evolutionary biology has been, how is within-population genetic diversity maintained in the face of selection and drift. I examined the potential contribution of environmental seasonality to the maintenance of diversity within plant populations by asking: Is demography of a natural population season-specific? Does season-specific demography vary among biotypes within the population? Are season-specific responses influenced by the competitive environment? Can the patterns of genotype performance among seasons be responsible for preserving genetic diversity within a population?    Demography of a natural population of Taraxacum officinale in Morgantown, WV, USA, examined with Lefkovitch transition matrices, was season-specific. Population growth was sensitive to perturbation of growth and fertility of small individuals from October through July. Large individuals contributed disproportionately to population growth during late summer. Detecting these dynamics is important for understanding long-term population growth and viability.    Lefkovitch matrices calculated for five biotypes (leaf morphs) within the population indicated that differential biotypic demography within the year contributes to preserving genetic diversity. A common environment experiment confirmed that biotype differences were genetically-based.    Replicates of five genotypes (representing each of the biotypes) planted into the field in each of four seasons confirmed the importance to diversity of differential fitness to seasonal environments. Several genotypes performed better in warm months. A second group performed better in cool seasons. Despite seasonal differences in fitness components, genotypic performances across seasons were equivalent.    Genotypes (representing three of the previous biotypes) planted with Plantago major, Poa pratensis and Trifolium pratense suggest that differential performance to seasons is influenced by biotic as well as abiotic components in the environment.    Differential genotype responses to seasonal environments represent the temporal variation in fitness necessary for maintenance of genetic variation. Therefore, temporal environmental fluctuations are expected to contribute to the persistence of the genotypes present in this natural population. This effect of temporal environmental heterogeneity, in combination with spatial heterogeneity, may be important to many species which exist in cyclically fluctuating environments as even subtle differences in the environment may result in genetic adaptation within populations.

T1  - Intra- and interspecific factors in the dynamics of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) populations
AN  - 304136705
AB  - This review summarizes the results of seven papers on intra- and interspecific factors affecting the dynamics of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) populations in Finnish lakes. The main aims of the research were: (1) to compare and select methods for estimating year-class strength and density of vendace; (2) to gather quantitative data on certain vendace populations for many fish generations; (3) to find out the mechanisms affecting vendace year-class strength; (4) to assess the effects of fishing on vendace population dynamics; and (5) to find implications for fisheries management in lakes.    The main results were: Fishing affected the fish community structure and consequently year-class strength and population dynamics of vendace. Regular two-year oscillations were found in vendace populations under intensive fishing. Survival and growth of 0+ vendace were regulated by density-dependent processes. The condition of adult vendace was negatively related to stock biomass. Changes in the egg dry weight and year-class success were related to changes in the adult condition. Favourable feeding conditions for vendace larvae occurred with low vendace stock biomass and with warm springs. The long-lasting period of vendace scarcity may be related to changes in fish community structure induced mainly by climatic factors. The management of vendace fishery should take into account the density dependent regulation of year-class strength as well as the effects of fishing on the fish community structure.
