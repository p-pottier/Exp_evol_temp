AB  - The central question of evolutionary biology, the problem of speciation, was formulated more than 100 years ago. The basic scenario for the appearance of new species is allopatric speciation, developed by Dobzhansky`s and Mayr`s evolutionary concepts. This model requires geographic isolation (stop of gene flow between differentiating groups) for the speciation process. For nearly 50 years allopatry has been considered one of obligatory conditions for speciation, as well as ecological selection and genetic drift. Still, we should not forget that the opposite model - sympatric speciation, proposed first by Darwin, has not been carefully tested during the last 100 years. According to this model, the differentiation process can begin with possible gene flow between differentiating groups. Divergence processes can occur gradually as a response to natural selection. One of the indicators of speciation is reproductive isolation. Ever-increasing evidence indicates that the geographic separation of gene pools is not obligatory for evolving reproductive isolation. There are cases when ecological selection, sexual isolation, and habitat choice can lead to speciation without any geographical separation. Populations may diverge not because they are separated geographically from each other, but because they choose different niches. J.M. Thoday in 1959 showed that positive assortative mating in Drosophila can arise after only 12 generations of disruptive selection without isolation. However, several dozens of laboratories tried to reproduce these results and failed to do so. Numerous experiments of Rice (1984, 1987) (usually, but not always, with isolation) demonstrated that assortative mating can arise due to selection in contrasting environments. One of the most famous examples of incipient sympatric speciation is the fly Rhagoletis pomonella (Feder et al., 1997; Ollson et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2007; Michel et al., 2007). It is quite difficult to study the process of sympatric speciation. If one studies a reproductively isolated species with a common ancestor that live in sympatry, the problem is that it cannot be clearly known if the studied differentiation took place when the species were sympatric or allopatric. Alternatively, one studies diverging sympatric populations. But it is difficult to guarantee that these populations will evolve into a new species. The optimal evidence of sympatric speciation would be a range of examples from very early up to final stages of evolving isolation in sympatry.Substantial genetic divergence was discovered between populations of Drosophila melanogaster inhabiting opposite slopes of "Evolution Canyon" (EC1) at Lower Nahal Oren, Mt. Carmel, coordinates 32°43'N, 34°58'E (Nevo 1995, 1997, 2001, 2006, 2008); the slopes display notable physical (solar illumination, UV irradiation, temperature, humidity) and biotic contrasts at a microscale (Pavlicek et al., 2003). The main underlying factor for such sharp ecological differences in the adjacent opposite slopes at this microsite is the difference in solar radiation. Extensive studies of D. melanogaster from EC1 involved habitat choice, mate choice, thermal and drought tolerances, adaptive candidate genes, and mobile elements (Nevo et al., 1998a; Korol et al., 2000, 2006a; Iliadi et al., 2001; Michalak et al., 2001; Lupu et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2005; Zamorzaeva et al., 2005; Rashkovetsky et al., 2006). Flies from the opposite slopes, reared under standard laboratory conditions, differed in survival and longevity. Considerable interslope differences were found in flies exposed to elevated temperatures, drought, and starvation stresses.Alternate abstract:הבעיה המרכזית בביולוגיה אבולוציונית היא בעית ההתמיינות (speciation .

T1  - Genetic variation and local adaptation in peripheral populations of toads
AN  - 2001933918
AB  - Northern fringe populations generally have low amounts of genetic variation and inhabit habitats where specific adaptations are needed. On the Swedish west coast, the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) inhabits skerry islands. I have examined: I) adaptation to two environmental stressors in this habitat; II) the genetic population structure within the skerry habitat; III) the effects of neutral genetic variation, selection and genetic drift on trait divergence within the skerry habitat; and IV) the effects of genetic variation on fitness under three thermal conditions of varying stressfulness. V) I have also studied the impact of putative local adaptations on the Scandinavian green toad (Bufo viridis) conservation programme. The results suggest that the skerry natterjack toads are locally adapted to the desiccation risk in their habitat. However, despite inhabiting a more saline habitat, they had a lower salinity tolerance when compared to their conspecifics in the more general habitat. The lowered salinity tolerance is most likely explained by the presence of negative genetic correlations between salinity tolerance and desiccation avoidance and suggests that the occurrence of multiple environmental stressors may constrain adaptation. Within the skerry habitat, the toads exhibited a strong population structure with populations differing in their levels of genetic variation. Moreover, within the skerry habitat, the results suggest uniform selection pressures. However, correlations between trait values and neutral genetic variation suggest that inbreeding depression may affect trait values and thus potentially constrain adaptation. In the natterjack toad, fitness costs associated with lack of genetic variation were only present under benign conditions and not under more natural conditions. This suggests that environmental stress masks inbreeding depression in these traits under natural conditions. In the study regarding the Scandinavian green toads, I found that one population inhabiting a saline habitat had a higher salinity tolerance than other populations in less saline habitats. This suggests the presence of local adaptation, which should be acknowledged in the green toad conservation programme. Several of the northern fringe populations of toads fulfill the criteria of being Evolutionary Significant Units and their conservation thus should be prioritized.

T1  - Synthesis of cds quantum dots and their cytotoxicity study
AN  - 1873762565
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorQuantum dots (Quantumdots, QDs) are nano-materials of quasi-zero- dimension, with three-dimension size below 100nm. They are atoms or clusters composed of the minimal number of atoms or molecules. Due to the unique optical properties, QDs are being widely used in biomedical imaging as novel fluorescent markers. As the prevalence of these materials in society is increasing, the question of their long-term effects on human health and environment is becoming critical.Therefore, on the basis of the practical application of quantum dots and human health, to analysis the mechanisms of biological damage of quantum dots and and effectively prevent the emergence of harmful factors, has great practical significance. Although many studies have reported that modifying QD surface with shells or ligands can effectively inhibit its toxicity in vivo and in vitro, these protective coatings may degrade under certain conditions, toxicity of "naked" QDs after their coatings are degraded is still under investigation. As a result of various types of quantum dots, we selected bare Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) QDs as the model of decayed surface-modified QDs, whith are representative and have not been adequately studied currently. In this study, we proposed an emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) system to synthesize CdS QDs, which acted as a model of decayed surface-modified QDs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to characterized QDs particles. Synthesis of QDs with EML system is simple and convenient with low toxicity of raw materials and does not need high pressure or high temperature, monomer size can be controlled and relatively stable at room temperature. CdS QDs were of cubic structure synthesised by ELM system with uniform monomer particle size about 6 ~ 8nm. However, since QDs can be a great surface area and are not surface modified, they often aggregated into secondary particles, with a number of connected surface and a larger size. Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CHL) and human fetal liver cells (L-02) which were commonly used in the toxicology experiment were selected of as cell models, and were exposed to CdS QDs with different concentrations. 24h after exposure, changes in cell morphology and cell viability were observed, SOD expression of cells were determined through immunohistochemical detection. To study the role of QDs cytotoxic mechanisms, cadmium ion concentration inside and outside cells, cell oxidative damage (cells MDA, SOD, GSH content), ROS content, intracellular and extracellular Cd2+ concentration and membrane damage (LDH content), etc., were determined to detect the degree of cell damage. Results of cytotoxicity test showed that after exposure to CdS QDs, shrinkage deformation of CHL and L-02 cells occurred, and as the dose increased, cell survival rates gradually decreased. Compared to CHL, L-02 cells were more sensitive to the stimulation of CdS QDs as the CdS QDs median lethal concentration (LC50) to CHL was about 50~100μg/mL, while the LC50 to L-02 is 10~20μg/mL; SOD expression was observed both in control and infected groups in CHL and L-02, but QDs had a certain impact to protein expression; MDA content increased synchronous with QDs concentrations, while the SOD and GSH content declined compared to the control groups which showed a certain degree of dose - response relationship; cellular ROS content increased with the exposure dose, suggesting that the mechanism of CdS QDs cytotoxicity may be the oxidative damage; Intracellular and extracellular Cd2+ concentration of CHL and L-02 and showed a gradual upward trend, compared with CHL, Cd2+ was more easily to pass through L-02 cell membrane.after 18h exposure to QDs, LDH content of cells significantly increases, indicating that CdS QDs has a certain role in the injury on the cell membrane. The results have certain relevance as we selected two types of cells as biological samples to detect QDs cytotoxicity. Results from the experiments showed that CdS QDs had a more serious injury on L-02 cells. Biological toxicity of CdS QDs may not only via mechanisms involving both Cd2+ and oxidative damage, but also the role of lipid peroxidation and destruction of the bilayer lipid membrane integrity so that triggered an increase in the cell membrane

T1  - Studies on crystal structures and functions of metal-organic coordination polymers constructed from novel thiophene-based ligands
AN  - 1870517044
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorMetal-organic coordination polymers (MOCP) have attracted considerable attentions not only because of their various interesting architectures, but also of their wide potential applications in material science, such as photoluminescence, magnetism, gas adsorption, catalysis, templating metal nanoparticles and so on. However, the research on metal-organic coordination polymers constructed from thiophene-based organic ligands is rather limited and needs more efforts and concentrations. Therefore, we design and synthesize a series of novel thiophene-based dicarboxylate linkers. And 22 metal-organic coordination polymers were rational designed and synthesized. Further study of their crystal structures and physical properties revealed that there was clear influence between the above two aspects. This dissertation includes the following three parts: (1) the brief introduction about the crystal structures and their physical properties; (2) metal-organic coordination polymers built from H2DBTA; and (3) metal-organic coordination polymers constructed of H2DTTA. 1. Metal-organic coordination polymers built from H2DBTA (a) Through the solvothermal reaction of H2DBTA and Mn(ClO4)2, a 3D porous MOCP (1) was obtained, in which the dinuclear Mn2-SBU performed unusual magnetism in the temperature range of 220 K to 240 K. Correspondingly, the crystal data of the MOCP under different temperatures suggested that the compound exhibited unusual crystal structural variation as well, which possibly could be ascribed to negative thermal expansion. The results supported that there were important relationship between the structure and magnetic behavior in metal-organic coordination polymers. (b) The rational design and syntheses of nine Zn-DBTA MOCPs (2-10) were carried out after the careful analysis of the structural characteristics and common coordination fashions of secondary N-donor linkers. These MOCPs showed various structural types, such as 1D chains, 2D layers and 3D frameworks. Furthermore, the DBTA ligand functionalized as a flexible dicarboxlate linker with various coordination modes. The good photoluminescences and comparatively long radiative lifetimes help them become a family of promising fluorescent materials. (c) Four metal-DBTA coordination polymers (11-14) constructed of Cd2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ centers expanded the crystal structure types and metal types. The DBTA ligand performed two additional coordination modes which again supported its wonderful coordination flexibility. 2. Metal-organic coordination polymers constructed of H2DTTA (a) The 2D two-fold interpenetration MOCP (15) made of DTTA and Ni2+ was taken as a good artificial template to support silver nanoparticles. The resulted Ag(0)/15 showed good catalytic activity and recycle ability in the catalysis of the A3 reaction of aldehyde, secondary amine with alkyne. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited good selectivity towards linear aliphatic aldehydes rather than aromatic and branch aliphatic aldehydes, which possibly owing to the fitness between the shapes and sizes of the reaction substrates to the supported environments in/on the MOCP 15. (b) We have successfully prepared three related Mn2+ MOCPs (16-18) through solvothermal reactions of the same reagents, H2DTTA and Mn(ClO4)2, just by adjusting the reaction solvents and co-ligands. The comparative study of their crystal structures and photoluminescence reveals that solvents and co-ligands in each preparation of the MOCP have significant influence on the crystal packing mode and intramolecular electron distributions, which provides a promising method to regulate the physical properties of MOCPs by controlling the preparation process. Furthermore, the strong emission, near-visible or visible excitation wavelengths and comparatively long radiative lifetimes of their photoluminescence make the three MOCPs promising candidates for fluorescent materials. (c) Four Lanthanoid-DTTA coordination polymers (19-22) with large 1D nanotubes showed good photoluminescence and catalytic activity in the reaction of aldehyde with alcohol. There was good selectivity towards the sizes and shapes of the aldehyde substrates as

T1  - Study on the immobilization of aminoacylase by polyamidoamine (pamam) dendrimer
AN  - 1870405691
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorDendrimer is a new type of functional macromolecule compound whose specialties are to design the molecular size, shape and functional group at the molecular level. The introduction of PAMAM can improve the surface efficiency. Enzyme immobilization offers advantages over free enzymes in stability, continuous processes, reusability of catalysts, ease of enzyme survival in the reaction mixture and adaptability to various environment designs. Effective immobilized technology and ideal supports were necessary for the enzyme immobilization. In this paper, Divergent synthesis was used as the synthesis process of the PAMAM surface modified silica. The silica used is of 50μm in diameter. After Silanization by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), 3.0G PAMAM was grown from the amino groups by repetition of two steps under certain conditions: Michael addition of methyl acrylate (MA) to amino groups on the surface and amidation of the resulting terminal ester groups with ethylenediamine (EDA). The molecular structures and properties of the product have been characterized by terminal group analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), fluorescence microscope (FM) and elemental analysis (EA). The result demonstrated that the structures and properties of the synthesized dendrimers was in line with the theoretical structures and properties. Glutaraldehyde was used to crosslink PAMAM modified silica with aminoacylase, using 1% glutaraldehyde to crosslink PAMAM modified silica and aminoacylase in 25℃ for 4h. The performances of the immobilized enzyme were evaluated by the separation of N-acetyl-DL-methionine. The properties of immobilized enzyme were also studied. Various characteristics of immobilized aminoacylase, such as pH, concentration of Co2+, concentration of substrate, are considered. The optimized conditions of immobilized aminoacylase were found to be pH 7.5 and 30℃ respectively. The thermal stability and storage stability were also valuated. The results indicated that the immobilized enzyme had higher thermal and storage stability than the free enzyme. Half-life of the immobilized enzyme was 34d. Immobilized aminoacylase was used to evaluate the performances of the immobilized enzyme by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). The results showed that the immobilized enzyme had good efficiency, reproducibility and

To study and explore these microalgae resources, the effects of salinity, temperature and light intensity on 7 strains of Dunaliella sp. were studied and morphological and molecular classification were also used in the investigation of taxonomic position and genetic relationship. The anti-salt metabolism was preliminarily analyzed. The results showed: 1. Seven strains had similar adaptability to the temperature and light intensity; the optimal growth condition was under 25℃,6000lx. However, there were significant differences in their salinity tolerance. The optimal salinity ranged from 50 to 150, and A57 were the best one. A85 got the best multiplication capacity under the optimal culture condition. 2. The ribosome 5.8S rDNA and ITS sequences of these Dunaliella sp. were sequenced, and compared with the 7 Dunaliella sequences from Genbank. UPMGA phylogenetic tree revealed that all the seven Dunaliella strains clustered in the same clad with Dunaliella viridis. Considering the appraisal results of cytomorphology and physiology, the studied Dunaliella strains might belong to D. viridis. Within the 7 studied strains, A85 and A57 and A83 were clustered to a clad, while A121 and A124 were clustered to another clad, which was further supported by RAPD analysis using 12 random primers. 3. intracellular glycerol content of A57 grown in hypersaline medium indicated that the adjustment of glycerol content finished in 6 hours after hyperosmotic shock. After three weeks, some functional proteins were induced significantly, protein 75KD,70KD,15KD, whose amounts enhanced nearly two times; protein26KD,36KD,40KD,almost doubled, while expression of protein 54KD, 108KD were strongly restrained. 4. Applied FDA-PI double staining method with FCM to detect the cell viability and morphological changes of A57 after hyperosmotic shock, the results indicated that the cellular contents decreased quickly at the initial stage, while cell volume increased. The nonviable cell percent rised evidently in 6 hour, and remained stable until 24 hours after the

T1  - Distribution and effect of wolbachia in major trichogramma species and its lepidopteran hosts in china
AN  - 1869025115
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorWolbachia are a group of cytoplasmically inherited bacteria that cause reproduction alterations in arthropods, including cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, feminization of genetic males, male killing and fecundity enhancing. It's reported that Wolbachia induced parthenogenesis in Trichogramma. Trichogramma are very important parasitoid wasps. They have significant effects in biological control. In this study, distribution of Wolbachia in five common Trichogramma species contained twelve strains in China was investigated. The results showed that Wolbachia distributed in all the populations except Trichogramma japonicum. Eva, Kue and Pip groups of Wolbachia distributed in both strain GDYMT.o and HLJYMT.d, and the triple infection rates were 100%. In other Trichogramma populations, there are only group Kue and Pip Wolbachia, and the double infection rates are 100% too. All the Trichogramma in this study are sexual (arrhenotokous). In order to study the effect of Wolbachia on these Trichogramma, we did heating and antibiotic treatments. After rearing under 31C or fed with 0.5% and 1% antibiotics for several generations, the Wolbachia were not deleted successfully for three repeatments. Though the wasps were very weak, even some of them were died, the Wolbachia were still not cureable. The Wolbachia infection type and infection rate were not changed. In order to get non Wolbachia host, we fed C.cephalonica with antibiotics too. But the Wolbachia infected in C.cephalonica were not cured either though the C.cephalonica were too weak to lay eggs or even some of them died. We conclude that Wolbachia is fixed in Trichogramma and C.cephalonica. In order to study the horizontal transfer of Wolbachia between different hosts, we investigated the distribution of Wolbachia among T.ostriniae and its lepidopteran hosts collected in Dongbeiwang Agronomy farm in Beijing based on the PCR of 16S rDNA and wsp genes of Wolbachia. Two species which were both belong to Geometridae were only infected with Wolbachia of supergroup A, six species were only infected with Wolbachia of supergroup B, T. ostriniae and other eight lepidopteran species were infected with both A and B Wolbachia, with all the individuals infected. The similarity of wsp sequences of Wolbachia found in T.ostriniae and its lepidopteran hosts was very high and some of the sequences were identical. This indicated that Wolbachia may transfer among T.ostriniae and its lepidopteran hosts. We tested the infection of Wolbachia in Trichogramma individuals successfully and systematically reported the infection rate of Wolbachia in major Trichogramma species in China for the first time. And a pilot study about the effects of Wolbachia on major Trichogramma species in China and horizontal transfer of Wolbachia has been done in this study. This is a stable base and a good beginning for the study of the effect and the mechanism of Wolbachia on major Trichogramma species in

T1  - Studies on the rearing technique and host selection behaviors of spathius agrili yang
AN  - 1868450614
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorSpathius agrili Yang (Hymenoptera:Braconidae) is an important ectoparasitic wasp of the Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) larvae. This parasitoid has the potential to use as an excellent biological control agent for suppressing populations of its host. In order to utilize this natural enemy , the mass rearing techniques, Effects of temperature on development and reproduction of S. agrili, Sphenoptera sp. was used as a host for rearing of S. agrili and the inundative release experiments were conducted in field were mainly studied. This article studied the responses of S. agrili to volatiles by chemical ecology and behavior ecology to find the role of phytochemicals in host-finding of S. agrili. The main results are summarized as follows. The study on the growth,development and reproduction of S. agrili at 6 differernt temperatures (22℃, 24℃, 26℃, 28℃, 30℃, 32℃).The results showed that the developmental rate of egg , pupa and the whole generation of Spathius agrili yang increased with the rise of temperature from 22℃ to 32℃,but the developmental rate of larva was highest at 26℃.The developmental threshold temperature required for egg, larva, pupa and whole generation was 14.34℃,16.89℃,14.16℃ and 13.84℃, while the effective accumulated temperature was 24.59,61.16,166.27 and 276.80 degree_day, respectively. Temperature had different level effects on parasitic rate, the rate of successful parasitism, egg number, number of generations and sex ratio of S. agrili .The results showed that the temperature from 26℃ to 28℃ was suitable for the development and reproduction of S. agrili . This experiment designed five inoculating ways to mass rearing with stem-way, timber-way and wraped paper-way successfully reproducing the wasp. The parasitic rate was the largest when employing timber-way, reaching up to 87.50% and the average egg number was 6.14. The advantage of this way was less work; the parasitic rate was much lower in wraped paper-way which could not meet the requirement for reproducing parasitoids. After comparing these ways, the operation of stem-way was more simple and less labourious which was fit for mass rearing but the parasitic rate was relatively lower , in comparision with timber-way, and needed more improvement. Screening substitute hosts was a key factor in the process of mass rearing. This experiment has selected some larvaes of wood borers from parasitoid's natural surroundings and the larvae of Bupresidae to mass rearing. The rescult shows that Sphenoptera sp. could be successfully parasitized by S. agrili. To explore the possibility for S. agrili manage the A. planipennis, the field release was conducted. The parasitic rate was 15.38% before releasing parasitoid in the field. The parasitic rate was 53.85% next April which witnessed a remarkable increase in parasitic rate while the parasitic rate maintained above 46.15%, showing a huge effect. The female's behaviour was investigated by Y-tube olfactometer. The results indicated different volatile had such attraction to wasp that the leaves attracted by host > healthy leaves = the bark attracted by host > healthy bark > host larvae > frass, and the parasitoid showed preferences to the leaves attracted by host(p0.05), this indicated that the choice for hosts' residents of S. agrili mainly depended on the information given out by the leaves attracted by host. This information might come from plants' volatiles induced by pests and have something to with the cooperative effect between host plants and pest injury. EAG was used to test the S. agrili's antenna EAG response to four kinds source of volatiles and the results showed the relative value of EAG response to four kinds source was as follows: the leaves attracted by host > frass > the bark attracted by host > host larvae. The rescults also showed the significant EAG responses difference between the leaves attracted by host and blank, while between leaves attracted by host and host larvae (P<0.05). These results in this experiment were coherent with the results of Y-tube olfactometer. Antennae and their sensilla of S. agrili were observed using scanning electron microscopy. Both sexes of antenae were threadlike. Five types of sensilla were found on the antennae of female. They are sensilla trichodea, sensilla chaetica, sensilla placodea, sensilla basiconca and sensilla campaniformia, respectively. But only there types of sensilla were found on the antennae of male. The difference between sexes mainly related to the unique behaviour of females and males, so it could be presumed that sensilla basiconca and sensilla campaniformia play a greatly important role in host

T1  - Research on drought monitoring models of soil moisture with modis data
AN  - 1868052005
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe frequent occurrence of drought has seriously affected the human society and the sustainable development of economic. It also threatens the human survival natural environment. China is a drought-prone country, and drought has brought endless disaster since ancient times. So it is significative to get timely and accurate drought monitoring information for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives.This paper analyses the current status and development trends and discusses the advantages and shortages of the existing methods. On this basis, this paper emphasizes how to combine the remote sensing index and the traditional meteorological index to constitute drought monitoring integrated model, which will be applied to regional-scale drought monitoring with Hebei province as the experimental zone.Land surface temperature and normalized different vegetation index derived from MODIS are used to establish Temperature-Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) and Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI). The two indexes are applied as optional remote sensing indexes of the soil moisture drought monitoring. The most suitable remote sensing index is chosen based on which one is more sensitive to soil moisture according to specific time and region. The Percentage of Precipitation Difference and Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) are calculated from precipitation data. Through the experimental comparison and the error analysis, SPI is selected as the meteorological index of drought monitoring model. The commonly spatial interpolation approaches of punctate data for rainfall are studied, and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) is chosen according to comparison and analysis as the most suitable method, which is used to accomplish spatial interpolation of SPI. So SPI is translated into grid format to facilitate the combination with remote sensing index.Drought monitoring integrated model is established for every ten days of September in Hebei province as the experimental zone. It is worth noticing that models for every ten days are changed. The suitable remote sensing index is selected according to the responding MODIS data. The weights of remote sensing index and precipitation index are dynamically generated and measured by using the relativity to relative soil moisture(RSM). Images of relative soil moisture are derived from statistical model between drought monitoring integrated model and RSM. Graphs of drought level distribution in ten days are achieved based on the drought level standard of relative soil moisture. So it is realized to dynamically monitor drought of soil moisture.Accuracy evaluation of drought monitoring integrated model is applied in two aspects. First, predicted relative soil moisture (PRSM) is computed through statistical model, then scatter diagrams are drawn of RSM and PRSM. The results show that the scattered points is in the vicinity of a straight line's both sides, so integrated models are good and linear distribution. Second, RSM and the corresponding PRSM are compared and the comparison results are applied to error analysis. Taking one with another, the model inversion errors are quite small,which shows that the accuracy of regression model is

T1  - Environmental variation and life-history evolution: experiments on <i>Caenorhabditis remanei</i>
AN  - 1442496507
AB  - The purpose of my project is to examine by what means, population history can influence the responsiveness of populations to environmental change. In order to approach this question I used a model species (Caenorhabditis remanei) and selection experiments in the laboratory.  
  It is recognised that heterogeneous environments select for plasticity. Thus, in order to manipulate the plasticity levels, I maintained populations for 50 generations in two different environments: constant temperature and predictably fluctuating temperature. Life-history components were quantified at three times during the course of the experiment (generation 1, 20 and 50). If plasticity is adaptive, it could be under strong selection in the fluctuating environment. After the selection experiment, comparisons between populations evolved in these different environments allowed me to quantify how two different evolutionary pressures shaped strains’ life history, and how this response depended on likely levels of genetic diversity (i.e. between the pure strains and the hybrid). 
   
  In both environments, I found changes in the reproductive schedules. Although I did not detect significant changes in the lifetime fecundity after the selection experiment, females showed an increase in their early fecundity. This shift in reproductive parameters shows adaptation as a consequence of the environmental pressures. These results are in agreement with the theory of life-history evolution. In theory, a plastic genotype has a wider ecological breath compared with one with reduced or no plasticity. After 50 generations in each environment, populations were assayed at three temperatures to assess whether population history can influence the responsiveness of populations (e.g. tolerance to temperature). 
  Higher levels of plasticity (i.e. tolerance) were expected in populations maintained in a fluctuating environment compared to the more stable environment. I found that worms from a fluctuating environment showed an increase in their tolerance to stressful conditions, while worms cultured in a constant environment showed no change. Thus, I successfully selected for populations with high and low levels of plasticity. Adaptive plasticity is expected to increase individual’s fitness across a range of environments because it expresses the “matching” phenotype according to environmental cues. However, a plastic genotype with the machinery to match the environment could be at disadvantage compared to a less plastic genotype when the environment is not changing. This disadvantage is expected to be linked to the reallocation of resources in the maintenance of genetic and cellular machinery that enables it to detect changes in the environment and in the production of the matching phenotype. Thus, to test this hypothesis, I translocated populations between the two environments. After the translocation, plastic worms moved back into the constant environment reproduced very poorly compared to worms before the selection took place and compared to the less plastic worms (reared in a constant environment). This strongly supports the idea that plastic strategies can turn an individual into “The Jack of all trades, but Master of none”.

T1  - Environmental and genetic determinants of host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics.
AN  - 1314573354
AB  - By using Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its associated bacteriophage SBW25ø2 as a model I have attempted to investigate the role that environmental productivity has on host-parasite coevolution. The main issues are 1- The effect that environmental productivity has on the rate of coevolution. 2-The effect that environmental heterogeneity has on local adaptation and the evolution of infectivity and resistance ranges. 3-Whether pre-adaptation to abiotic conditions affect the outcome of coevolutionary interactions. 4-The effect that migration between rapidly coevolving communities (hot spots) and slow coevolving communities (cold spots) has on rate of coevolution, to determine whether hot spots can drive cold spots and vice versa 5- I looked at the within population coevolutionary dynamics of 2 populations, in order to determine the roles of individual clones on the fate of population dynamics 6- The effect that environmental productivity ahs on the evolution of specificity of bacteria/phage interactions. I found that 1- Increased environmental productivity accelerates coevolution, and that this is caused, in part, by increased cost of resistance in the least productive environments. 2- We observed increased resistance and infectivity ranges coevolving in the most productive environments. 3- We showed that bacterial pre-adaptation to the biotic environment made the effect of enviornemntal productivity on rate of coevolution non-significant. 4- Our results show that hot spots can drive cold spots, but not vice versa. 5- We observe very different dynamics between the two populations. There is evidence of multi-locus GFG persistent coevolution. 6- Dynamics between both treatments differed substantially. Productivity affects the extent to which selection is directional relative to fluctuating.

T1  - Macroeconomic analysis of global warming :intergenerational view and theoretical models
TT  - 全球变暖的宏观经济研究——代际观点和理论模型
AN  - 1026902484
AB  - This dissertation conducts a theoretical analysis on emission-reduction
decisions dealing with global warming and their effects on economy-environment
system. This analysis is entirely based on two models, the Discrete- time Model and
the Continuous-time Model. Reflecting considerations of intergenerational
relationship, the two models are classified to the widely accepted 'representative
agent model', which originated from Ramsey (1928) and has been recently developed
to explore relations between economic growth and environmental protections with new
thoughts of sustainable development and intergenerational equity. Although it is
basically from view of macroeconomics, the author proves that, this type of models
can be equivalently transformed to an overlapping-generation model, which has better
interpretations of microeconomics. The models also follow the structures and
functions of frequently used Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of global warming.
Beyond this, the author boldly proceeds abstracts and simplifications to balance
mathematical tractability and practical reasonability. Other features such as
utility measuring of temperature also distinguish the models.
Using mathematical methods of dynamic optimization, the author deduces the basic
models and the sensitivity of some important factors, and discusses other important
issues by model extensions. Some computing simulations of the discrete time model
are also carried out. The main conclusions are below:
1. Earlier emission-reduction is necessitated when considering the
intergenerational equity, because it can make more offspring enjoy more comfortable
temperatures. This conclusion is also the outcome of involving utility of temperature
in our models.
2. In the case of finite time horizon, the nearer to present generations, the more
reductions are needed. For infinite time, the author proved the existence of a steady
state, on which each generation must proceed the same level of reductions. The time
path of abatement costs leading to the steady state is partly determined by the utility
valuation of temperatures.
2. If growth of population or potential emissions is unlimited, abatement costs will
be raised forever, that is, one generation after another. However, effects of
technical progress and uncertainty exert ambiguous influences, which can either
increase or decrease abatement costs.Alternate abstract:于通行的代表性代理人模型一类。它的原型是Ramsey(1928)提出的；在近期的研究中被赋本文对全球变暖的减排对策加强经济－环境影响进行了理论分析。全部的分析基于两个模型?D?D离散时间模型和连续时间模型。模型是在考虑代际关系的背景下提出来的，属予了代际公平和可持续发展的新涵义，用于研究经济增长与环境保护的关系。模型虽然是基于宏观视角的，但作者证明了，在适当的假定下，这一代表性代理人模型可以等价于代际交叠模型，从而具有较好的微观基础。模型还和全球变暖问题研究上广泛运用的综合评价模型 (IAMs)在结构和功能上保持一致，不同的是，作者做了大胆的简化和抽象，既保证模型的解析可推导性，又不失其对实践的指导意义。同时，模型的某些方面，如引入气温的效用，也是过去的模型所不具备的。
作者运用动态最优化的数学方法，在对基本模型进行推导的基础上，讨论了部分参数变化的影响，并通过模型扩展分析了一些重要的影响因素。对离散时间模型还进行了实际估算。通过研究，作者得到的主要结论归纳为：
1．	考虑代际公平的最优减排对策要求我们尽早进行减排，这样可以使更多的后代享受适宜的气温。这也是气温上升的效用损失直接引入模型的结果。
2．	对于计划期有限的减排对策，则离当代越近的各代需要进行越多的减排；而对于计划期无限的减排对策，作者证明了存在一种稳定的状态，各代人之间要进行同样多的减排，至于达到稳态的减排时间路径是上升还是下降的，取决于人们对气温变化的效用评价。
3．	人口增长和潜在排放上升如果是无止境的，那么减排成本必须是逐代提高的。技术进步和不确定性等影响则不能肯定，可能会导致减排成本的上升或下降。

T1  - Characterization of the Multidomain Nsp2 Replicase Protein of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus
AN  - 846070982
AB  - This dissertation focused on understanding the biology of the nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the etiological agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRSV nsp2 is a multidomain protein, containing a putative N-terminal cysteine protease PL2 domain, a 500-700aa middle region of unknown function, a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal tail with uncertainty. In this dissertation, we report the following. (i) PRRSV nsp2 is undergoing rapid evolution in field strains exemplified by viral isolates MN184A and B. (ii) We showed that PRRSV nsp2 hypervariable regions aa12-35 and aa324-813 were not essential for viral replication in MARC-145 cells by using a reverse genetics system based on strain VR-2332. In contrast, deletion of the cysteine protease PL2 core domain, the PL2 downstream flanking sequence (aa181-323), the predicted transmembrane domain and the C-terminal domain were lethal to the virus. (iii) We provided evidence that the nsp2 protein encodes an active PL2 protease and mediates nsp2/3 processing in CHO cells with a substrate preference for the dipeptide G1196|G1197. The PL2 protease possessed both trans- and cis-cleavage activities, which could be distinguished by point mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that mutations that caused a specific loss of  trans function of the PL2 protease, but not cis activity, were detrimental to the virus. In addition, we showed that the conserved aspartic acid residues (e.g., Asp89) played an important role in the PL2  trans-cleavage activity. (iv) We investigated the proteolytic processing of nsp2 in MARC-145 cells using recombinant PRRSV expressing foreign epitope-tagged nsp2 protein. We showed the presence of the nsp2 protein as different isoforms in PRRSV-infected cells, which appeared to share the same N terminus but differed in their respective C-termini. The nsp2 species emerged almost simultaneously in the early stage of PRRSV infection, were stable and had low turnover rates. Deletion mutagenesis suggested that the smaller nsp2 species (e.g. nsp2d, e and f) were not essential for viral replication in cell culture. Lastly, a cellular protein, heat shock 70kDa protein 5 (HSPA5), was identified as a coimmunoprecipitate of nsp2.

T1  - A cold and harsh environment: Demography and spatial ecology of a northern population of wood turtles (<i>Glyptemys insculpta</i>)
AN  - 304817771
AB  - Natural history studies of geographically distinct populations are important for informing and implementing management strategies for species at risk. Wood turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) are a species of Special Concern (COSEWIC) in Canada and are considered Vulnerable internationally (IUCN). Their species at risk status is attributed to their habitat specificity and thus patchy distribution across the northeastern portion of North America. The purpose of this study was to assess population health, spatial ecology, and habitat requirements of an unstudied wood turtle population in the Sudbury District of Ontario at the species' northern limit while testing for variation in life history strategies (e.g. body size) across the species' latitudinal range. A mark-recapture and radiotelemetry study was conducted from 1 May 2005 to 19 October 2006 to describe home range size, movement patterns, and habitat, temperature, and hibernacula selection. A total of 900 ha of habitat were classified and a 1.5 km of river was quantified for selection studies. I hypothesized that wood turtles at their northern limit would have larger body and home range sizes and would travel greater distances during a shorter annual activity cycle compared to southern conspecifics as a result of a less productive environment in the north. I also hypothesized that optimal hibernacula characteristics (e.g. dissolved oxygen, protection from predators and freezing temperatures) may be limiting, therefore fidelity to hibernacula or communal overwintering may be common. I found that the wood turtle population in the Sudbury District was large (56 ± 15 turtles) and healthy, with equal sex-ratios, high juvenile capture rates (35%), and that recruitment had occurred over each of the last 11 years. Moreover, latitudinal differences in body size were apparent with larger body sizes in the northern and southern portions of the species' range but relatively small body sizes in the middle of the range and home range sizes increased with latitude. Wood turtles in the Sudbury District had the largest home ranges among populations reported in the literature (59.4 ha (100% MCP)). Wood turtles selected riverine habitats throughout the annual activity cycle; however, early in spring, selection was for ephemeral pools and upland deciduous habitat that may provide a rich food resource and good basking opportunities. Wood turtles basked from 1 May to mid-June but became thermal conformers for the rest of the annual activity cycle; however, females became thermal conformers with air and males became thermal conformers with water. During winter, wood turtles selected environments that were high in dissolved oxygen (∼ 90%), had temperatures that approached 0°C, and had short ice durations compared to other water bodies used by other turtle species at the study site. Moreover, fidelity was not shown across years; therefore, hibernacula are likely not a limiting factor for the species' distribution in the north. These data are important for the creation and implementation of management strategies for the local population of wood turtles but can also be used to assess conservation needs across the species' range. I provide management recommendations for this population in each chapter and as a conclusion to the thesis.

T1  - Population genetics and life history evolution in the sea anemone family Edwardsiidae
AN  - 304691010
AB  - Genetic diversity enables populations to rapidly adapt to changing environments, and it contains the seeds of future evolutionary change. The starlet sea anemone,  Nematostella vectensis, is an informative species for studying the factors (life history, gene flow, selection) that impact genetic diversity in coastal estuaries and assessing how this diversity may provide raw material for local adaptation. N. vectensis is found in salt marsh habitats along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America and southeast England. Population genetic structure from 24 populations throughout  N. vectensis' range was surveyed with a combination of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), microsatellites and sequence-based markers. The data reveal: (1) a striking degree of genetic structure between populations, (2) multiple instances of anthropogenic introduction from the Atlantic coast of the United States to the Pacific coast and to England, and (3) substantial variability among locations in the contribution of asexual reproduction. A three-year study of Sippewissett, MA revealed the distribution and genetic structure of subpopulations is considerable within a single estuary and changed among years; in addition recently colonized pools can harbor extensive genetic diversity. Leveraging >17,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we developed a database of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 555 were high-confidence SNPs including 78 non-synonymous SNPs. Surprisingly,  N. vectensis contained nonsynonomous polymorphisms in the highly conserved domains in two homeodomain-containing genes (tlx  and rx) and a deiodinase gene. We detected significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in natural populations, suggesting that these polymorphisms could be under selection. Coincident with extensive genetic structure, laboratory studies revealed significant differences in phenotypic diversity among clonal lines collected from eight locations throughout  N. vectensis' range—mostly along the steep thermal cline along the Atlantic coast of North America. Animals from more southerly latitudes exhibited higher growth rates above 29°C, while the growth rates of northern and southern populations were indistinguishable at 13°C suggesting local adaptation to warmer thermal environments. To put the intraspecific evolution of N. vectensis in its phylogenetic context, pilot studies were conducted on the life history, ecology, and genetic diversity of the closely related species Edwardsiella lineata that has evolved a novel parasitic life history.

T1  - Evolutionary change in human-altered habitats: Morphological shifts, differential selection, and environmental drivers of phenotypic plasticity in the lizard <i>Anolis sagrei</i>
AN  - 304656449
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine how anthropogenic change has impacted patterns of intraspecific morphological variation in the brown anole,  Anolis sagrei, and the evolutionary processes underlying those patterns. Chapter 1 investigates whether anthropogenic habitat alteration has generated morphological divergence between natural and human-disturbed habitats across several islands in the Bahamas. Morphological analyses revealed that lizards inhabiting disturbed habitats were significantly larger in several morphological characters than those inhabiting natural habitats. The observed morphological divergence was found to exist despite high levels of gene flow between habitat types, highlighting the importance of ecology in driving this divergence. Chapter 2 examines whether human-induced changes in habitat structure have altered the strength and form of natural selection on hindlimb length. Mark-recapture data revealed that anthropogenic habitat alteration may promote diversification by creating divergent, highly localized selection regimes. Human-driven changes in habitat structure impacted both the strength and form of natural selection on hindlimb length in these lizards. In addition, fine-scale genetic differentiation was found to exist between populations inhabiting natural and disturbed habitats, creating the potential for long-term evolutionary consequences of divergent selection regimes. Together with Chapter 1, these results highlight the significant impact that human activities may have on the evolution of populations that persist in human-altered habitats. Chapter 3 investigates how environmental variation influences intraspecific morphological variation through phenotypic plasticity. Growth data from males and females reared in a laboratory under different food and thermal regimes demonstrated that environmental variation had sex-specific effects on growth and adult morphology. Males exhibited much higher variation in growth and adult body size in response to food-temperature treatments than females, indicating sex-specific plasticity in body size. This sex-specific response produced significant variation in sexual size dimorphism. The influence of environmental variation on sexual size dimorphism may have important evolutionary implications for Anolis lizards. Habitat-specific sexual size dimorphism among ecomorphs is thought to have ix arisen from differences in selection pressures related to habitat structure. Here I add an important element by demonstrating that variation in sexual dimorphism, at least at the intraspecific level, can arise from a plastic response to environmental variation.

T1  - Neutronic analysis stochastic distribution of fuel particles in Very High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors
AN  - 304574975
AB  - The Very High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (VHTR) is a promising candidate for Generation IV designs due to its inherent safety, efficiency, and its proliferation-resistant and waste minimizing fuel cycle. A number of these advantages stem from its unique fuel design, consisting of a stochastic mixture of tiny (0.78mm diameter) microspheres with multiple coatings. However, the microsphere fuel regions represent point absorbers for resonance energy neutrons, resulting in the "double heterogeneity" for particle fuel. Special care must be taken to analyze this fuel in order to predict the spatial and spectral dependence of the neutron population in a steady-state reactor configuration. The challenges are considerable and resist brute force computation: there are over 1010 microspheres in a typical reactor configuration, with no hope of identifying individual microspheres in this stochastic mixture. Moreover, when individual microspheres "deplete" (e.g., burn the fissile isotope U-235 or transmute the fertile isotope U-238 (eventually) to Pu-239), the stochastic time-dependent nature of the depletion compounds the difficulty posed by the stochastic spatial mixture of the fuel, resulting in a prohibitive computational challenge. The goal of this research is to develop a methodology to analyze particle fuel randomly distributed in the reactor, accounting for the kernel absorptions as well as the stochastic depletion of the fuel mixture.    This Ph.D. dissertation will address these challenges by developing a methodology for analyzing particle fuel that will be accurate enough to properly model stochastic particle fuel in both static and time-dependent configurations and yet be efficient enough to be used for routine analyses. This effort includes creation of a new physical model, development of a simulation algorithm, and application to real reactor configurations.

T1  - Hotel - Beirut: Architecture in the conflict city
AN  - 304509426
AB  - The post-conflict city is both a tragedy and opportunity; an environment of suffering, yet a fertile landscape for reconstruction. An architect's typical relation to an armed conflict environment is as an agent of reconstruction once fighting stops. But what of a city where conflict is continuous and interminable? How does an architect intervene in a conflict city?    My thesis proposes an architectural intervention that recognizes an urban condition where hot and cold conflict are states of a fluctuating environmental condition. As the conditions change, spaces might adapt and architectural elements react, whether by physical operations, shifts in program, or accommodation of different users and occupations. Much of the conflict logic that is embedded throughout is inspired by strategies and spatial reappropriations that civilians employ to cope with a never ending conflict condition.    Designing for the conflict condition does not suggest perpetuating its continuance. Rather, propositions which recognize varying degrees of hostilities within the urban fabric allow for the generation of unique spatial configurations, both formal and programmatic, with potential for diverse social and cultural use when conflict is cold, or what the idealist would consider times of relative peace.

T1  - A study on the starvation and recovery response of the ammonia oxidizing bacterium <i>Nitrosomonas europaea</i>
AN  - 304440297
AB  - The chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria, which utilize ammonia (NH3) as their sole energy source, are noted for their survival during NH3 starvation. The starvation response of ammonia oxidizing bacteria is characterized by high viability, high stability of macromolecular cellular components, low maintenance energy requirements, and the maintenance of an active electron transport chain. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria maintain a state of readiness that allows them to immediately begin oxidizing ammonia, even after long-term starvation. This work has evaluated the recovery from starvation physiology of Nitrosomonas europaea in comparison to actively growing and starved cells. It was hypothesized that energy generation would be prioritized over energy consumption during the initial phase of recovery since the first reaction in the ammonia oxidation pathway is energy dependent. Through genome wide transcriptome analysis and more focused studies on the regulation of ammonia oxidation, CO2 fixation, and stress response, it was found that starved cells exhibited a massive downregulation of transcription. In addition, translation in starved cells is likely inactive due to a starvation induced ribosome modification at a site that controls trans location of the ribosome. The stress response that is typically induced in starved heterotrophic bacteria appeared to be absent in starved cells of N. europaea. Upon recovery from starvation, stress response genes were upregulated and are hypothesized to be part of a post-starvation cellular repair system. Examination of a strain of N. europaea that lacks the global stress response regulator, RpoH, demonstrated a significant role of stress response in an efficient exit from starvation. The data also show that stress responsive σ E promoters control expression of the duplicate operon copies of  amoC (encoding an ammonia monooxygenase subunit) and a divergent monocistronic copy of amoC (amoC3). Further analysis demonstrated that the divergent AmoC3 copy is involved in maintaining ammonia oxidation activity at elevated temperatures and is possibly involved in mediating the recovery of ammonia oxidation activity following starvation under high oxygen tension or at low cell densities. Overall, the studies described here have significantly advanced our understanding of both ammonia oxidation and the starvation and recovery response of ammonia oxidizing bacteria.

T1  - Slaves to the Eyring Equation? Temperature Dependence of Life-History Characters in Developing Ectotherms
AN  - 2463628315
AB  - This thesis investigates to what extent the thermodynamics of biological rates constrains the thermal adaptation of developing ectotherms. The biophysical Sharpe-Schoolfield model is applied to explain the temperature dependence of body size in ectotherms, to predict the temperature tolerance limits in developing ectotherms and to predict patterns of thermal adaptation within and among species. If the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation is applied to model the temperature dependence of growth and differentiation rate separately, then the temperature dependence of size at maturity follows from the interaction between these processes. Recent studies have shown that this approach provides an explanatory framework for all ectotherms, which obey the Temperature-size Rule, the observation that ectotherms at high temperatures grow and develop faster to a smaller size at maturity compared to low temperatures, but also to the exceptions of this rule. The Sharpe-Schoolfield equation basically consist of two parts: the numerator, which is formed by the Eyring equation, models the exponential increase of reaction rates with temperature based on reaction kinetics, and the denominator, which describes the reversible temperature-induced inactivation of enzymes. If the denominator is applied to a genetic control system of the cell cycle, it can be shown that the temperature tolerance limits are accurately predicted in range of insect species. It is argued that reversible temperature-induced inactivation of regulatory components of the cell cycle mimics the dosage change during the cell cycle. The Eyring equation is also successfully applied to cross-species comparisons of thermal adaptation in a large group of related frogs and toads. The recently developed model of Universal Temperature Dependence is critically discussed and it is argued that the predictions are partly based on incorrect assumptions and biased use of literature data. Furthermore, the supposed invariant biophysical parameters may vary in response to thermal adaptation. When ectotherms adapt to lower temperatures (horizontal shift) a correlated response occurs of a wider thermal range (specialist-generalist shift), a smaller slope (sensitivity shift) and lower activity (vertical shift). This correlated response is mainly determined by the Eyring equation. The enzyme activity-stability tradeoff is the most important thermodynamic constraint and limits the viable development of most ectotherms to a relative small thermal tolerance range of approximately 20°C. It is argued that this correlated response does not limit evolution within thermal environments, but instead may be one of the drivers of evolution and consequently biodiversity. The overall conclusion is that the biophysical Sharpe-Schoolfield equation is an excellent model to study thermal adaptation in ectotherms.

T1  - The research on biological characteristics and pearl performance of hyriopsis schlegelii
AN  - 1868135185
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorHyriopsis schlegelii which was original distributed in Japan is the famous freshwater clam, it is various species of the genus Hyriopsis cumingii which was original distributed in China. It was introduced into China by Nancheng Reservoir Exploitation Company in Fuzhou in 1997. In this research, we focus on the biological characteristics, propagation and artificial breeding techniques and pearl performance characteristics. In order to provide some theoretical and practice instructions of freshwater pearl cultivation in our country, to work out the problem of unitary species of pearl clam, to promote a healthy and sustainable development of freshwater pearl cultivation. First, the biological characters were investigated. The external and internal morphology of H. schlegelii are almost as same as H.cumingii wit regional variations. The countable and measurable properties data indicated that shell width of H. schlegeli is as1.23 times as H.cumingii. Paraffin section and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) observations showed the crystalline style of H. schlegeli is longer and larger diameter than H.cumingii, the mantle depth of H. schlegeli is as1.78 times as H.cumingii, and the nacre shell is 2.08 times. The basic unit of structure of nacre is aragonite tablet, which become more and more thickly as the growth of H.Cumingii. The average growth speed of H. schlegeli is faster than H.cumingii, which were the same sizes, culture density and cultured in the same water. Second, the propagation and artificial breeding techniques of H. schlegeli was carried out. The results demonstrated that 3 years old H. schlegeli are partial maturation and 4 years old clam are the best ones, they also keep this capability till 6 winter ages. The season of propagation is from May to July, can ovulate many times, and the ovum matured at different times, one matured female clam can ovulate 4~5 times per year. The results showed that the glochidia of H. schlegeli were hooked. The optimum temperature range of the embryonic development was 24~36℃, the hatching time of the embryonic development more shorter when the temperature is higher than 30℃, the accumulated temperature of the embryonic development was 247.2℃. In the host fish, the number of glochidia was varied in the part of body, number of branchias was most, and diposefins was least, the average number of parasitic is 1985 per fish. The average fecundity of selective F3 generation was 13.9 thousands per one, and the survival rate of larvae was 82.6%. The survival rate of preparation clam for nucleated pearl producing and all-nacre pearl producing were 86% and 82.3%, and the compliance rates for operating were 78% and 95%. Third, pearl performance was carried out on H. schlegeli and H.cumingii, including nucleated pearl producing and all-nacre pearl producing. The results indicated H. schlegeli has significantly high advantage in pearl performance than H.cumingii. The survival rate of operative mussel of H.schlegeli was higher than H.cumingii both of nucleated pearl producing and all-nacre pearl producing. The thickness of pearl layer and the quality of pearl in nucleated pearl, the yield of all-nacre pearl were also better than H.cumingii, especially in three kinds of best all-nacre pearl, which the diameter are 8mm, 9mm and more than 10mm. At the same time, the pearl performance of F3 generation was better than F2 generation, it indicated the advantage of selective improved variety. The results indicated that H. schlegeli has best morphology for culturing pearl, the propagation and artificial breeding techniques were matured, the pearl performance was better H.cumingii. It can be widly use in freshwater pearl cultivation in our

T1  - Simulation of the NPP in the eight districts of Beijing city based on remote sensing in Beijing
TT  - 北京市城八区植被净第一性生产力遥感模拟研究
AN  - 1027107433
AB  - Vegetation has a very important impact on the global energy cycle and biochemical cycle. Leaf Area Index (LAI), Net Primary Product(NPP) are two important paraments of vegetation of deriving biophysical and biochemical paraments, and simulating carbon cycle.
This study aims to simulating NPP and LAI of Beijing using TM image. LAI, defined as the half the total surface area of leaf per-unit ground area, is a key structure parameter of vegetation canopy, and accurate LAI is critical for understanding biological and physical process associated with vegetation. NPP is defined as the net amount of new carbon absorbed by plants per-unit of area and time. NPP can show the growth status of vegetation, so provide the compositive information for the management of regeneration resources. Furthermore, NPP, as an important component of carbon cycle in biosphere, is also very important in the research of global change. The BEPS model was used for simulation. At the same time the experimental data was used to modify the BEPS model. The research steps are as following:
1.	The Beijing vegetation samples in different ages, different density, and different species were selected in the experiment. The LAI and NPP were calculated from measured LAI, diamantes and height of the trees.
2.	TM image of Beijing was processed including corrections of radiance and geometry. Then, it was classified by decision tree classification method. SR and NDVI vegetation index calculated from image was used to derive LAI. Thereby the biomass of vegetation was also derived.
3.	Because of the requirement of BEPS model, the temporal LAI image data with the same resolution is gotten from 9 different times TM.
4.	NPP in the study area was simulated by prepared data such as LAI, annual land cover type, daily meteorological data (radiation, precipitation, temperature and humidity), available soil water holding capacity (AWC) and biomass.Alternate abstract:植被对全球能量循环及物质的生物化学循环具有重要的影响。叶面积指数、生物量和净第一性生产力等是表征植被特征的重要参数。反演生物物理学参数，模拟生态系统循环是评价生态环境变化的重要手段。
本文旨在利用TM遥感影像反演北京市城八区植被的叶面积指数（LAI）、净第一性生产力（NPP）。叶面积指数定义为单位地表面积上总叶表面积的一半，它作为一个重要的冠层结构参数，对于理解与植被相关的生物物理过程是非常重要的。因此叶面积指数的获取具有非常重要的意义；净第一性生产力是指绿色植被在单位时间、单位面积上由光合作用所产生的有机物质总量中扣除自养呼吸后剩余的部分。净第一性生产力一方面它可以反映植物的生长状况，为可再生资源管理提供高质量的综合信息；另一方面它是生物圈碳循环的重要分量，在全球气候变化研究中占有重要的地位。为了模拟LAI和NPP，本文利用碳水耦合的遥感过程模型BEPS（Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator），结合实地测量的叶面积指数以及以往的经验，对BEPS模型进行修正，最终得出北京城八区植被的LAI、NPP分布情况。本文主要有以下几个研究步骤：
1.	根据研究需要，进行研究区实验设计并实施实验内容，主要有：研究区内选取不同年龄段、不同疏密程度、不同种类的人工植被，进行树木LAI、胸径、树高等数据的采集，从而计算样地实测的LAI；
2.	对于研究区对应的TM遥感影像进行辐射纠正、几何纠正等图像预处理。对图像进行分类，细化研究区的植被覆盖类型。计算相应的植被指数，利用植被指数反演生物量和LAI；
3.	由于BEPS模型需要有研究区全年的LAI数据，利用TM不同时相的9景数据分别进行LAI的反演，得到全年的时间序列的LAI；
4.	运用以上几步准备好的相应研究区的逐日最高最低气温、日总辐射、相对湿度、降水量、土壤持水量、时间序列的LAI、土地覆盖类型以及生物量数据，利用BEPS模型，模拟出了北京市城八区植被的净第一性生产力，并利用实测数据进行了验证。

T1  - The genetic dissection of differential growth in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and its relationship to chloroquine drug selection
AN  - 527716888
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria is responsible for severe morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Anti-malarials used to treat malaria, such as chloroquine (CQ), exhibit increased failure and have an effect on the parasite genome potentially resulting in differences in parasite growth. Differences in erythrocytic growth rates between parasite clones affect parasite virulence (Chotivanich et al., 2000; Dondorp et al., 2005). Parasite growth is complex, composed of discrete biological steps contributing to differences in overall ‘growth.’ To identify genes and mechanisms regulating differential growth, a series of phenotypes ranging from bulk growth (e.g. blood smears and Hx-incorporation) to its nested steps (merozoite production, invasion efficiency, and cycle time) were measured in progeny of a cross between a CQ resistant and CQ sensitive parasite, Dd2 and HB3 respectively, and used in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Progeny exhibit quantitative distributions of growth in all five growth assays. Significant QTLs from the two bulk growth assays and cycle time produce a preliminary list of 167 candidate genes. An unbiased method using whole genome datasets and bioinformatics was developed to prioritize the list. Putative functions were assigned using protein network datasets, gene expression correlations, and gene ontology enrichment resulting in a final list of 22 candidates.    A relationship between parasite growth and drug sensitivity is observed in CQR parasites but not CQS parasites; suggessting CQ selection has altered the parasite genome and parasite fitness as measured by growth. Progeny inheriting ‘D’ alleles at three random markers are absent less often compared to progeny inheriting mixed alleles. This suggests the Dd2 genome is fitter. When progeny inherit a resistant pfcrt allele, there is an increase in the percent of absent progeny with ‘D’ alleles at three markers. Therefore CQ resistant progeny suffer from a fitness cost. Specific alleles implicated in the ‘CQR background’ were used to ask about parasite fitness and lethality support the idea that CQ selection alters the parasite genome by causing compensatory mutations in response to a cost to resistance. These compensatory mutations affect other parasite phenotypes such as growth. This hypothesis is further supported by observed growth differences in CQ-selected mutant lines.

T1  - High-density thermoelectric power generation and nanoscale thermal metrology.
AN  - 33717289; 200905-10-0043338 (CI); 200905-20-0032163 (EA)
AB  - Thermoelectric power generation has been around for over 50 years but has seen very little large scale implementation due to the inherently low efficiencies and powers available from known materials. Recent material advances appear to have improved the technology's prospects. In this work we show that significantly increased generated power densities are possible even for established material technologies provided that parasitic losses are controlled and effective strategies are found for handling the large resulting heat fluxes. We optimize the performance of a thermoelectric generator in this regime, and discuss fundamental performance limits in this context. We present a design of a thermoelectric generator using conventional material and a microchannel heat sink that we predict can generate many times the power of a conventional thermoelectric, at a comparable efficiency. A high temperature vacuum test station is used to characterize the power generation, efficiency, and material properties of thermoelectric materials and generators. The results of a series of studies on various bulk and thin-film materials are presented, as well as packaged generator performance. The method of CCD thermoreflectance imaging is pursued in this thesis as a quantitative means for making non-contact temperature measurements on solid-state samples at the micro- and nano-scale. We develop and test a theory of the instrument and the measurement process to rigorously characterize the accuracy and precision of the resulting thermal images. We experimentally demonstrate sub-micron spatial resolution and sub-20 mK temperature resolution with this tool. High-resolution thermal images of thermoelectric elements, polysilicon-gate field effect transistors, and other integrated electronic devices are presented.

T1  - The development of palladium-catalysts for organic synthesis.
AN  - 33559714; 200904-16-0035572 (SO)
AB  - Chapter 1. Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions of aryl and heteroaryl halides with aryl-, heteroaryl and vinyl boronic acids proceed in very good to excellent yield with the use of 2-(2',6'-dimethoxybiphenyl)-dicyclohexylphosphine, SPhos. Additionally, a comparison of the reactions with SPhos and with 2-(2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl)-diphenylphosphine is presented that is informative in determining the relative importance of ligand bulk and electron-donating ability in the high activity of catalysts derived from ligands of this type. Further, when the aryl bromide becomes too hindered, an interesting C-H bond functionalization-cross-coupling sequence intervenes to provide product in high yield. Chapter 2. The direct transformation of aryl bromides into the corresponding Weinreb amides via Pd-catalyzed aminocarbonylation at atmospheric pressure is described. Electron-deficient, -neutral and -rich aryl bromides were all efficiently transformed to product. Furthermore, the process tolerates a wide variety of functional groups, is mild, and is operationally simple. Chapter 3. A general, functional group tolerant, and mild system for the Pd-catalyzed Heck carbonylation of aryl chlorides into the corresponding benzamides has been developed. This catalyst operates at one atmosphere of carbon monoxide using an inexpensive, air-stable and commercially available ligand. A variety of aryl chlorides were all successfully transformed to the corresponding amides using primary, a-branched primary, cyclic secondary, acyclic secondary, or aryl amines. Additionally, the mechanism of this reaction was studied using in situ IR spectroscopy and revealed the unique effect of sodium phenoxide in this reaction. Chapter 4. Pressurized microreactor systems greatly expand the range of reaction conditions and accelerate gas-liquid mass transfer. Heck aminocarbonylation reactions exemplify the potential for quickly and safely scanning of reagents and reaction conditions (1 to 15 bar and 100 - 160degC). The results reveal a general trend of increased yield of amide with temperature and selectivity for alpha-ketoamide production at lower temperature and higher pressure.

T1  - Electrical and thermal characterization of carbon nanofibers for interconnect and packaging applications.
AN  - 33245143; 200904-10-0029747 (CI); 200904-20-0021236 (EA)
AB  - Copper interconnect technology is rapidly approaching its scaling limit due to a variety of factors involved with reducing feature size including: increasing resistivity, reliability concerns due to electromigration, and excessive power dissipation related to ever-increasing clock frequencies. The aim of this work is to present a series of fundamental electrical and thermal measurements and models to demonstrate the viability of implementing carbon nanofiber (CNF) structures into next-generation integrated circuit technologies. Through the use of various characterization techniques, the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of CNFs are revealed, and show great potential for carbon-based nanostructures in integrated circuit applications. The temperature-dependent electrical characteristics of vertically aligned CNF arrays for on-chip interconnect applications are presented. The electrical application of CNFs for on-chip interconnects is explored in three parts. First, the electron transport mechanisms in these structures are investigated using I-V measurements over a broad temperature range (4K-300K). The measured resistivity of CNF arrays is modeled based on known two-dimensional electron conduction mechanism in a disordered medium. The model assumptions are verified using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of the CNF-metal interface. Second, based on the developed low-temperature CNF conduction model, the ideal material for efficient electron transport is found to be a-axis graphite, exhibiting a morphology closely resembling multi-wall carbon nanotubes. To this end, palladium was used as a catalyst material for the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of CNFs as an alternative to nickel to improve the graphtic structure of the CNF. Finally, electrical reliability measurements are performed at different temperatures to demonstrate the robust nature and high current carrying capability of CNFs for interconnect applications. Thermal properties of CNFs are investigated using a novel copper (Cu)-embedded CNF array for thermal management applications. Fabrication of the composite material is based on techniques derived from high-aspect ratio copper filling. A copper electrochemical deposition (ECD) recipe is developed for optimal gap filling between the CNFs in the array. Two types of thermal resistance characterization are performed on the CNF-Cu composite: (1)An ASTM D-5470 based characterization technique and (2)A photothermal analysis technique. Both results agree well and demonstrate the high thermal conductance of the CNF-Cu composite for thermal interface material applications. A variety of modeling techniques are employed to investigate temperature-dependent characteristics of CNFs. Low-temperature modeling is performed to investigate the conductivity limit of CNFs and to elucidate the physics of electron conduction within the material. Electrothermal effects are modeled using tunneling theory to describe electron transport across electrode-CNF interfaces, and the effects of contact annealing. Since self-heating effects are pivotal in one-dimensional conductors and interconnects, electrothermal modeling is of absolute necessity to describe Joule heating-induced breakdown in the CNF. The modeling work performed here enhances our understanding of the coupled effects between electrical and thermal transport in CNFs.

T1  - Evolutionary and functional genomics of bacteria from the cold deep sea
AN  - 304883847
AB  - Chapter 1 introduces the deep sea environment. Recent studies of sequence-independent diversity of deep-sea microbial communities are reviewed and reanalyzed. These are compared to sequence-dependent studies evidencing the need for new culturing and isolation methods for deep-sea bacteria. The chapter ends by reviewing the current state-of-the-art of deep-sea genetics and genomics and describes the general features of the genomes of piezophiles.    Chapter 2 describes the development of three new vectors for use in  Photobacterium profundum and other Gram-negative bacteria. The first one (pEE3) is a suicide vector for insertional inactivation of genes. The second one is a general purpose cloning vector (pFL122) based on the broad-host-range replicon RSF1010. The third one is a broad-host-range vector carrying an arabinose-inducible promoter to use for gene expression studies.    Chapter 3 explores the diversity evolution of cultured piezophiles. Three novel strains of piezophilic bacteria were isolated, one of them being the first Gram-positive piezophile ever isolated. Most of the cultured piezophiles, belong only to a narrow range of phylogenetic lineages which cluster within clades of known psychrophiles. In the ensuing discussion the hypothesis that cold-adapted piezophiles might evolve from polar water psychrophiles and disseminated through deep-sea oceanic currents is presented. During the study specific ribosomal RNA features of the 16S of piezophiles were identified. These features are correlated with the pressure adaptation of the strains.    Chapter 4 describes a high-throughput transposon mutagenesis approach to identify genes important for growth at low temperature and high pressure. These genes belong to a wide variety of categories which are discussed in detail. A large fraction of the mutants impaired in growth at low temperature had gene disruptions in genes for the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, providing the first direct evidence of the role of the cell envelope in adaptation to low temperature.    Chapter 5 presents the results of the sequencing and the analysis of the genome of the shallow water strain P. profundum 3TCK. The genome is compared to that of the deep-water strain P. profundum  SS9 identifying unique regions that might be conferring fitness in different habitats. Among these is a cluster of genes for motility important for swimming in high viscosity found only in the deep-water strain, a set of genes for UV resistance found only in the shallow water strain, and the specific rRNA features described in chapter 3 found only in the deep-water strain. The motility gene clusters are further characterized evidencing the role for particular flagellins and motor proteins for swimming at high pressure. The UV and ribosomal features are exchanged between the shallow- and the deep-water strains and the phenotypes of the resulting strains are characterized.

T1  - Biodiversity patterns in tropical montane rainforest flora of Costa Rica
AN  - 304883300
AB  - This dissertation examines patterns of plant biodiversity and distribution of understory shrubs in the pantropical and specious family, Rubiaceae, in montane rainforest in Costa Rica. Conducting vegetation surveys between 100 and 2800 m along a continuous elevational gradient in old growth tropical rainforest, I tested the predictions of competing hypotheses for species richness patterns across various environmental gradients. These hypotheses included mid domain effect, area effect, climatic variables, and environmental variables such as soil nutrients. Results indicated a peak in species richness in the mid-elevations, with rainfall best predicting richness.    A test of species propagation methods and a common garden transplant design enabled an investigation into the vulnerability of understory species to increasing temperatures associated with global climate change. A factorial design identified the most effective propagation methods for cuttings across substrate, chemical applications of rooting hormone, cutting type and life form within six species of the genus Psychotria (Rubiaceae). Cutting survival and biomass accumulation were not influenced by use of rooting hormone. The effects of substrate, cutting type and growth form produced significantly different results with the greatest survival in forest soil treatments in shadehouses, using stem cuttings and small shruby growth forms.    Physiological examinations of leaf temperature tolerance for species in the genus Psychotria, specifically investigating the performance of the photosystem II, revealed complex patterns of response to predicted warming. Within naturally occurring individuals along the elevational gradient and cuttings transplanted to a common garden, there were little direct effects of temperature on photosystem II, due to broad temperature tolerances. However, biomass accumulation was reduced with increased warming demonstrating an important direct effect on productivity.    Species responses to key factors such as temperature and rainfall are complex and species-specific but overall, as shown here, they influence the distribution of biodiversity in montane tropical ecosystems. Accurately predicting the effects of global climate change on the future distributions of tropical species enables us to assess the vulnerability of montane rainforests to global warming and better strive towards its protection for future generations, particularly where biodiversity is high in the mid-elevations, which are poorly protected in existing reserves.

T1  - Spiraling evolutionary patterns in cycling environments: The experimental evolution of physiologically superior ecological generalists
AN  - 304877508
AB  - This dissertation examines spiraling evolutionary patterns in cycling environments to rigorously test evolutionary hypotheses related to fitness and trade-offs, and also simulate realistic ecological conditions to bridge the disciplines of experimental evolution to environmental microbiology, using enteric bacterium Escherichia coli as an experimental system. The first study examines evolutionary responses of the bacteria to an environmental acidic-alkaline range between pH 5.3 and 7.8 (15-5000nM[H+]). General hypotheses about adaptation to abiotic variables and coliform organism response to changing environments were tested. Six replicate lines of  E. coli evolved for 2,000 generations at one of four different constant pH conditions: pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0 or 7.8. Both direct and correlated fitness changes in these environments were measured relative to the ancestor in direct competition experiments.    This second study examines evolutionary responses to environmental acidity fluctuating temporally among pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, and 7.8 (5000-15nM[H +]). Two distinct temporal variations were used. One group of populations evolved for 2000 generations in a cycled regime fluctuating daily between a constant pH 5.3 and 7.8 cycle. The other group evolved during exposure for 2000 generations to a randomly shifting regime fluctuating stochastically day-by-day between pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0 or 7.8. Relative fitness changes were measured by direct competition experiments in both constant and stochastic pH regimes. This study initiated the first long-term natural selection experiment on adaptation to variable pH, investigating patterns of trade-offs, specialists, generalists, and acclimation in temporally fluctuating environments.    The third study investigated Escherichia coli growth and survival in a novel "Host to Coast" laboratory Analog simulating an 11-day sequence cycling through the pH and temperature conditions of the small intestine, colon, sewer, seawater, human stomach, and back into the small intestine. This study investigated the evolutionary roles of pH and temperature in evolving increased growth and survival fitness of E. coli in environments of coastal seawater and human host. Patterns, such as high alkalinity evolving high growth fitness in seawater, are discussed. Results may have future implications for wastewater treatment/release into marine waters for the prevention of evolving superior strains of pathogenic E. coli.

T1  - Phylogeny, taxonomy, character evolution, and biogeography of glassfrogs (Amphibia: Centrolenidae)
AN  - 304857188
AB  - The present study provides a new hypothesis of the evolutionary relationships of Glassfrogs (Centrolenidae) inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and addresses questions on the evolution and speciation of the group. Ingroup sampling includes 55.5% of the named taxa in the family, representing most of the phenotypic diversity described for the group. As outgroups, I included 35 species, most of which represent families traditionally associated with Glassfrogs. Gene sampling consisted of complete or partial sequences of three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND1) and three nuclear markers ( c-myc exon 2, RAG1, POMC) for a total of ∼4362 bp.  Phylogenies were estimated using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses for individual genes and combined datasets. The importance of analyzing mitochondrial and molecular datasets separately is discussed, with particular emphasis on the ways in which this approach clarifies interpretations of relationships within Glassfrogs and other Neotropical anurans.    Based on the phylogeny obtained, I propose a new taxonomy of Glassfrogs and its sister taxon Allophryne ruthveni. This arrangement formalizes clades that have significant statistical support under Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian inference criteria, and that, in most cases, are phenotipically diagnosable. Centrolenid diversity is arranged into two subfamilies and a total of 12 genera, seven of which are new.    Using Maximum Likelihood and Parsimony, I explore the evolution of morphological and behavioral features that characterize this unique group of Neotropical anurans. Each trait that has been postulated to trace relationships unambiguously in this group turns out to have had a complex evolutionary history with multiple origins and losses. Complete ventral transparency has evolved multiple independent times under all models of reconstruction, even those biased toward single origins. I demonstrate that repeated evolution of transparency has a significant inverse correlation across phylogeny with the presence of iridophores, which are hypothesized to protect internal organs from detrimental effects of solar radiation and heat. Complex derived behaviors, such as deposition of eggs on undersides of leaves, have evolved at least four times, and may be correlated with evolution of parental care. The evolution of sexually dimorphic traits (i.e., humeral spines) is ambiguous and depends on the method of inference; however, a scenario with recurrent origins of spines, probably selected in response to male-male intraspecific competition, is favored. The effect of incomplete sampling on reconstruction of ancestral character states is considered by comparing topologies and patterns of character evolution derived from analyses of complete and pruned datasets. Given the results, I suggest that when working with relatively large groups (i.e., ≥ 90 species), complete taxon sampling may not be so critical for an accurate reconstruction of character evolution, as long as morphological/behavioral diversity of all major clades is represented.    The biogeography of centrolenid frogs is partially resolved. Glassfrogs originated in South America and dispersed multiple times into Central America. The most likely scenario for the current distribution of the Centrolenidae suggests a Guianan origin with subsequent dispersal into the Amazonia and the Chocó. Once the land connection between South and Central America was complete, and before the uplift of the Eastern Andean Cordillera, Glassfrogs dispersed to Central America at least four times. The uplift of the Eastern Cordillera and the Mérida Andes, coupled with drops in temperature during Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, could have facilitated dispersal of cold-adapted species from the Guianas to the Cordillera de la Costa and then into the Northern Andes. Glassfrogs reached the Southern Andes via repeated dispersal from the Northern Andes. Finally, comparisons of phylogeny and species distributions strongly supports vicariance as the main speciation mechanism in centrolenid frogs.

T1  - Conformational analysis of heat shock factor 1 and its C -terminal domain
AN  - 304847733
AB  - Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1 (HSF1) is a key regulator of the expression of heat shock proteins during the heat shock response. It functions as a connector between the upstream stress signals and the downstream cellular responses needed for cell survival. HSF1 is activated by heat and other pathological or physiological stresses, undergoing homotrimerization to acquire the ability to bind to DNA, and structural and chemical modifications to achieve transcriptional competence. In aged animals, HSF1 function is impaired, leading to a decline in HSP70 gene expression and a defect in responding to stress. The C-terminal domain (CT), which encompasses the regulatory and activation domains of HSF1, is predicted to contain natively unfolded regions by PONDR ® disorder analysis. Natively unfolded domains play an important role in transcription factors, allowing them to undergo posttranslational modifications and interactions with a myriad of partners essential for the transcriptional process. Experimental evidence presented in this dissertation indicates that CT is natively unfolded under physiological conditions since it exhibits the following structural characteristics: (1) a very low abundance of secondary and tertiary structure as observed by circular dichroism, (2) no hydrophobic core as monitored by a TNS binding assay, (3) a large hydrodynamics radius as measured by SEC-HPLC, and (4) high structural flexibility as probed by limited proteolysis. Interestingly, CT can be induced to fold when the negatively charged amino acid residues are neutralized by acidic pH or the cationic detergent DTA. The "folded" CT is very compact, containing secondary structure and hydrophobic clusters. Interaction of CT and its physiological partner, the core domain of the TATA-binding protein (cTBP), indicates a moderate structural alteration upon complex formation. CT interacts at the hydrophobic sites of cTBP, with a dissociation constant of 0.91 μM, as determined using competitive TNS-binding assay. The "induced-fit" binding between CT and cTBP suggests a structural plasticity of the natively unfolded structure of CT. The structural flexibility of CT could also imply its adaptability to transiently interact with various transcriptional effectors/regulators.

T1  - Ontogeny and life history of shortnose sturgeon (<i>Acipenser brevirostrum</i> Lesueur 1818): Effects of latitudinal variation and water temperature
AN  - 304847047
AB  - Ontogenetic niche shifts usually occur concurrently with a change in developmental stage and likely evolved as a strategy to reduce mortality and optimize growth at each developmental stage. The optimal shift point may be flexible, however, and may be influenced by environmental cues. In this dissertation I address the following three objectives: (1) Compare habitat preferences and dispersal duration and timing of early life stages of shortnose sturgeon from a northern (Connecticut River, MA, USA) and a southern (Savannah River, SC, USA) river, (2) Determine the effect of three temperature regimes on the timing and pattern of downstream dispersal of shortnose sturgeon larvae, and (3) Link changes in morphological development with ontogeny of behavior in shortnose sturgeon.   During the period of yolk-sac absorption, fish from the Connecticut and Savannah Rivers which were reared at the same temperature selected cover and dark habitat, sheltering under rocks and preferring darkness and black substrate. Once fish began feeding exogenously, they switched rapidly to a preference for open, bright habitat, emerging from rocks and selecting illuminated areas and white substrate. Connecticut River fish moved downstream for 6 days (days 7–12 after hatching) beginning immediately after feeding began. However, Savannah River fish had a longer dispersal with multiple, prolonged peaks and fish continued a low level of downstream movement for the whole larval period and as early juveniles (at least until day 62). The differences in dispersal between Connecticut and Savannah River fish, however, were expressed under the same laboratory conditions, including temperature. Thus, genetic differences between the populations do exist and conservation strategies should consider this. In tests with Connecticut River fish to determine temperature effects on dispersal pattern, rearing fish at 10°C delayed the onset of dispersal, but increasing the temperature (15 and 20°C) produced a dispersal with multiple peaks, rather than simply shifting the peak to a younger fish age. Fish were morphologically similar when they began dispersing, regardless of river or temperature. Colder temperature caused development to slow and fish to delay beginning dispersal. These results show dispersal of shortnose sturgeon early life stages is influenced by river temperature.

AB  - Mutualisms, such those between plants and pollinators, corals and dinoflagellates, and legumes and rhizobia, are vital to natural ecosystems. These and many other mutualisms have persisted for millions of years; however, their apparent stability poses an evolutionary puzzle because genotypes that maximize their own fitness at the expense of their partner (i.e. "cheaters") should invade and destabilize mutualism toward parasitism. Selective mechanisms that reward cooperative partners, such as sanctions or partner choice, may explain the evolutionary persistence of cooperation in mutualisms. Alternatively, if partner quality depends on the abiotic or biotic context, then a single cheater genotype may not enjoy a universal advantage. Context-dependent selection may also drive differentiation among coevolving populations for the traits mediating species interactions, thereby maintaining variation at a geographic scale. Studying the outcomes between the legume Medicago truncatula  and its nitrogen-fixing mutualist Sinorhizobium from natural populations in their native range revealed that the quality of a plant or rhizobium partner depends on the genotype with which it interacts and on the availability of nitrogen—suggesting that different mutualist genotypes are favored depending on the composition of partner populations and the nitrogen environment. Comparing the fitness of plants and rhizobia in symbiosis with partners from the same, versus distant, populations showed that both plant and rhizobium populations were differentiated for the traits mediating benefit exchange. Finally, when inoculated with a mixture of strains, plant genotypes formed more nodules with rhizobia that confer high fitness benefits to that genotype, suggesting an important role for plant partner choice in enforcing rhizobial cooperation. Importantly, nodulation with plants resulted in increased fitness for the rhizobium strains inside nodules, and therefore partner choice can impose selection for rhizobial cooperation. Plant partner choice was also genetically variable within M. truncatula  populations, indicating that this mechanism may respond to natural selection. These results indicate that context-dependence and plant partner choice are both important for the persistence of cooperation in plant-rhizobium symbiosis. Moreover, although the mutualism between legumes and rhizobia has endured for over 60 million years, the outcomes of coevolution in these interactions may be highly dynamic at shorter time scales.

T1  - Life history evolution in seasonal environments: Phenological and environmental determinants of thermal adaptation in <i>Wyeomyia smithii</i>
AN  - 304830237
AB  - Environmental variation poses a major evolutionary challenge to organisms. This is particularly true for seasonal environments where environmental factors fluctuate radically but predictably on an annual basis. Dormant life history stages often evolve to mitigate exposure to harsh seasonal environments (e.g., winter). In addition, norms of reaction, or the relationship between phenotype and environment, often evolve as a response to local environmental heterogeneity. My thesis explores how the seasonal timing of dormancy affects selection on reaction norms of active, non-dormant life history stages in temperate insects. Changing the dates of initiation and termination of winter dormancy changes the thermal habitat experienced during active growth and reproduction. Thus, geographic variation in the timing of dormancy complicates geographic patterns of thermal selection on active life history stages. Using available inter- and intraspecific life history data in conjunction with long-term weather data, I show that geographic clines in dormancy timing cause populations along the cline to experience similar exposure to cold temperatures during active growth. As a result, strong latitudinal trends in the timing of dormancy predict weaker latitudinal trends in thermal adaptation of active stages. I further illustrate this concept by examining geographic variation in the timing of winter dormancy, thermal sensitivity of development, and tolerance to thermal stress in the pitcher plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. The results from W. smithii suggest that selection applied specifically by the thermal environment of the growing season best explains geographic variation in the thermal sensitivity of development time. In contrast, geographic variation in the thermal environment of the entire year best explains geographic trends in thermal stress tolerance of active life history stages. These results suggest two major conclusions. First, thermal sensitivity and thermal tolerance can exhibit local adaptation in populations that also demonstrate local adaptation in diapause timing. Thus the evolution of one type of adaptation does not preclude the other. Second, dormancy timing unquestionably influences direct selection on active life history stages, but correlated selection on overwinter survival may strongly influence temperature tolerance of active life history stages.

T1  - Ultraviolet radiation as an environmental stressor of amphibians
AN  - 304819413
AB  - My thesis explored the effects of and potential mediating mechanisms for an important environmental stressor, ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. UVB radiation has negative effects on organisms in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. I used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of UVB radiation on a diversity of aquatic organisms (Chapter 2). UVB negatively affects aquatic organisms by reducing both survival and growth. In particular, UVB reduces growth of embryos more than any other life history stage. Some taxonomic groups may be more affected by UVB radiation than others. In our analysis, the growth of members of the kingdom Protozoa was suppressed by UVB radiation to a greater degree than any other kingdom. These analyses suggest that UVB is an important stressor in both freshwater and marine systems.    Amphibians are a common component of freshwater systems and are experiencing world-wide population declines. These declines may be due to a number of causes including habitat loss, introduced species, global climate change, disease, toxic chemicals and UVB radiation. I used meta-analytic techniques to quantify the effects of UVB radiation on amphibians. By synthesizing the results of 41 articles on the effects of UVB radiation on amphibians (Chapter 3), I found a nearly 2-fold reduction in survival of amphibians exposed to UVB radiation. Salamanders (caudates) appear to be more susceptible to damage from UVB than frogs or toads (anurans). Moreover, survival of larvae was much lower than survival of embryos or metamorphic individuals under UVB radiation. In addition, I used factorial meta-analytic techniques to explore the interaction between UVB radiation and other stressors in amphibian habitats. UVB radiation acted synergistically with other stressors to reduce survival of amphibians.    Behavioral avoidance of UVB radiation may help mediate the negative effects of UVB radiation on amphibians. In aquatic systems, behavioral avoidance usually requires movement out of shallow water, where UVB levels can be high, into deeper waters with lower UVB transmittance. However, these two microhabitats have very different thermal profiles, creating a trade-off between exploiting warm waters with high UVB levels and avoiding UVB by seeking cooler, deeper regions of ponds. I explored the microhabitat use of larvae of four species through a series of laboratory experiments, field experiments, and observational field transects at three different amphibian habitats (Chapter 4). Larvae did not avoid UVB radiation in either the laboratory or field experiments. Larvae in thermal gradients selected relatively high temperatures regardless of the UVB exposure at these temperatures. In field transects, salamander larvae were most common in deeper, cooler waters where UVB levels were lower. In contrast, anuran larvae were frequently observed in the warmer and shallower regions of each habitat. These regions also had the highest UVB levels, suggesting that anuran larvae are exposed to high levels of UVB due to thermoregulatory behavior.    Behavioral avoidance of UVB radiation is not the only mechanism amphibians may use to prevent damage from UVB. Pigments such as melanin may allow larvae to exploit warm shallow waters by absorbing harmful UVB radiation before it causes cellular damage. I tested the efficacy of melanin as a photoprotective pigment in the larvae of two species, Rana cascadae and  Pseudacris regilla (Chapter 5). I found no evidence of a photoprotective function for melanin in these larvae. In contrast, lighter colored tadpoles grew more under UVB radiation compared to darker colored tadpoles. Overall, exposure to UVB reduced survival of P. regilla larvae and reduced growth of R. cascadae larvae. Larvae of both of these species were frequently observed in very shallow water with intense solar radiation.    This thesis emphasizes the importance of UVB radiation as an environmental stressor in aquatic habitats. Many aquatic organisms are negatively affected by UVB exposure. My thesis work quantitatively demonstrated that UVB radiation is one factor that reduces survival of amphibians and suggests that some species are exposed to high levels of UVB radiation in natural habitats. While UVB radiation is not the sole cause of amphibian population declines, my work suggests that UVB radiation is an important stressor for amphibians that should not be overlooked. In addition, UVB radiation is clearly an important stressor for many other aquatic organisms. Future work should consider the effects of UVB in aquatic systems, particularly the effects of UVB radiation on community structure and ecosystem function.

T1  - Life history divergence and tidal salt marsh adaptations of the coastal plain swamp sparrow
AN  - 304808366
AB  - Adaptation to local environments via natural selection is a powerful mechanism for population divergence and likely one of the primary causes of speciation. To understand how specific habitats shape local adaptation, it is helpful to study closely-related populations from widely differing ecosystems that have not had sufficient time to diverge by genetic drift. Throughout the following chapters I examine the distribution of morphological, behavioral, and reproductive phenotypes within and between two subspecies of the swamp sparrow. These two populations, the tidal salt marsh endemic Melospiza georgiana nigrescens and the nominant inland subspecies,  M. g. georgiana were incompletely isolated from each other following the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation. Since that time the increased nest predation, temperature, season length, salinity and tidal flow of the coastal marshes relative to inland wetlands has resulted in a number of adaptations among coastal sparrows due to natural selection, sexual selection, and phenotypic plasticity. Specifically I examine the habitat preferences of the coastal plain swamp sparrow, the difference in clutch size between the two subspecies, the rates of extrapair fertilization relative to male quality, the ecosystem-specific interactions between natural and sexual selection on plumage badges, and the role of conspecific attraction in nest placement. The environmental differences of the tidal salt marsh have played strong roles in the local adaptation and divergence of coastal plain swamp sparrows from their freshwater ancestors. Many of these divergent mechanisms may be similar among other tidal marsh endemics, although some (especially those related to sexual selection) may be specific to the swamp sparrow. In general, however, we see that the added environmental challenges of tidal ecosystems strongly alter selection regimes on a terrestrial vertebrate inhabiting this dynamic ecotone. The swamp sparrow system can further increase our understanding of how the interplay between environmental resources, sexual selection, and natural selection affects the local adaptations leading to evolutionary divergence.

T1  - Nanocalorimetric sensor for ultra-low-volume biological measurements and calibration by chemical method
AN  - 304805986
AB  - Microcalorimetry is an established technique in the biological sciences for determining energy generation and consumption. With recent developments in microfabrication techniques, nanocalorimeters or even picocalorimeters are now possible. Measuring the biological thermal signal from cells is very difficult, however, due to both the cells' low thermal activity level and the challenge of maintaining cell viability without undermining the sensitivity of the calorimeter. We have modified a commercial thermal sensor to acquire biological data. An integrative thermal shielding, evaporation prevention, and nanoliter sample-injection system was developed to deliver cells into the reaction chamber and preserve the sensitivity of the sensor. The modified nanocalorimeter has a power sensitivity of 7.6 nW/Hz½ and a temperature sensitivity of 136 μK/Hz½. The heat production of the cardiomyocytes was measured when cells were stimulated with high K+ solution. The method may be useful for future development of high-speed parallel devices for drug screening or bioanalysis.

T1  - Regional impacts of climate change on water resources of the upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia
AN  - 304805302
AB  - This dissertation aims to evaluate the climate change impacts on both hydrologic regimes and water resources of the upper Blue Nile River Basin in Ethiopia where hydrologic data are limited. The downstream countries of the Nile River Basin are sensitive to the variability of runoff from the part of the Nile Basin located in Ethiopia. Climate change affects water availability and the conditions will worsen with increasing water demands. Typical climate change impact studies compare the simulation results under future climate change scenarios with those from a baseline climate scenario representing current climate conditions. To analyze and evaluate the future changes in hydrology and water resources of the study area, data-parsimonious, yet reliable, methodologies and models are required.    This dissertation presents three manuscripts for analyzing climate change impacts. The first manuscript consists of two parts: The first part is focused on the construction of the baseline climate scenario. Accurate reproduction of current climatic conditions (typically, 1961-1990) is a key to this step. The conditional generation method is proposed for this purpose. The second part is devoted to the construction of the future climate change scenarios. The outcomes of general circulation models (GCMs) are used for this step. This study uses six GCMs' outcomes for the 2050s to explore a range of projections due to inter-model differences. These outcomes are weighted to provide a plausible change in climatic conditions. The second manuscript is on the simulation of runoff using the proposed hydrologic model under different climate scenarios. Model evaluation and parameter regionalization for ungauged basins are important tasks given the limited data and information available. In the third manuscript, the results from previous analyses are integrated to evaluate climate change impacts on hydrology and water resources through a set of indices. The impacts of dam operations for hydropower generation under climate change scenarios on downstream countries are also assessed. The major findings of this study suggest that (1) climate would be wetter and warmer in the 2050s; (2) flow regimes would be enhanced, especially for low flows; and (3) the proposed dam operations would not affect the water availability to the downstream countries.

T1  - Dynamical modelling of lithospheric extension and small-scale convection: Implications for magmatism during the formation of volcanic rifted margins
AN  - 304791234
AB  - Enhanced melt productivity delivered by buoyant upwelling and small-scale convection of the mantle during rifting may play an important role in determining the fundamental structure of igneous crust produced during and following continental breakup. This thesis investigates the relationship between rift-related decompression melting and the influence of small-scale mantle convection and rift geometry on the subsequent production and distribution of melt-related crust. A two-dimensional plane-strain finite element method for viscous-plastic creeping flows is used to numerically model extension of the lithosphere. The evolving temperature and pressure fields within the model are coupled to an algorithm for predicting the amount and timing of decompression melting of upwelling mantle. Predicted melt fractions are converted to equivalent thicknesses of igneous crust, and the predicted crustal thicknesses for a series of models are compared to the observed crustal structure of rifted margins inferred from seismic data. Reference models characterized by passive plate-driven flow predict stable formation of ∼7 km thick igneous crust. Models characterized by small-scale mantle convection can to first order reproduce the general architecture of most volcanic rifted margins, that is, a relatively narrow band of thick (12-13 km) igneous crust (inferred to occur along strike of the margin), juxtaposed with thinner oceanic crust farther offshore. The variability in thickness (4-7 km) predicted for the later-stage thinner igneous crust is however difficult to reconcile with global observations of oceanic crustal thickness (7±1 km). Also, the peak 13 km thickness of igneous crust predicted for models with convectively enhanced upwelling fails to match the great thicknesses (≥ 20 km) of igneous crust observed at many volcanic margins; a small increase to mantle potential temperature appears necessary to predict generation of such thick igneous crust. Composite models that include both small-scale convection and an increase to mantle potential temperature predict large pulses in initial magmatism and generation of 17-21 km thick crust, followed by unstable production of thinner igneous crust. The results indicate that models with small-scale convection and no temperature anomaly may play a role in explaining the formation of volcanic margins with only moderately thick (11-15 km) igneous crust. Further, convection coupled with small increases to mantle temperature may be important during the initial phase of very thick igneous crust generation at some volcanic margins. The geometry of the lithosphere during extension appears to influence only moderately the spatial distribution of produced igneous crust. Predicted distributions of igneous crust are only weakly sensitive to asymmetric rifting of the lithosphere; this suggests that the degree of symmetry in the thermal structure of the upwelling sublithospheric mantle is the dominant control on the final distribution of igneous crust produced during rifting.*   *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

T1  - A statistical study on incipient plasticity of metals
AN  - 304730099
AB  - Recent rapid development in the micro-machinery and chip industry has boosted fundamental research work into the sub-micron and even nano regime where the behaviour of the materials is not only governed by classic mechanics but also quantum mechanics. Unique applications may be enabled in the future since materials reduced to the nanoscale can show completely different properties compared to what they exhibit in bulk. Newly-invented testing technologies such as nanoindentation and focused-ion-beam fabrication now make it feasible to study the strength of nanomaterials which can provide useful information to the micron-machinery industry. It has been observed by many researchers that the strength of materials in nanoscale can be much higher than their bulk counterparts, implying the possibility of making devices with higher stress tolerance in sub-micron and nanoscale. However, the onset of plasticity is found to exhibit a statistical distribution rather than being a constant value. More interestingly, even holding the load in the sub-critical region may eventually lead to yielding, indicating that the material cannot sustain GPa level stresses indefinitely.    This thesis attempts to explore the underlying physics of the incipient plasticity phenomenon observed in experiments using molecular dynamics simulations. We started from shearing a small block of Ni3Al with periodic boundary conditions, and observed the formation of initial plasticity nucleus from atomic clusters with larger than average displacements under the dual action of stress and thermal agitation. It was found from the simulated potential-step and stress-step curves that an avalanche of plasticity occurred when the largest relative displacements of the atoms in the system exceeded a critical value of one half of the Shockley partial. These atomic clusters were not stable before the onset of plasticity, but they were able to grow quickly into stable dislocation loops during the avalanche event.    The statistical distribution of the atomic relative displacements before yielding was then examined to verify its evolution with stress and temperature. The distribution was found to follow a Weibull form at any step before yielding but some variables changed with stress and temperature. Based on the assumption that incipient plasticity occurs when some atom in the system is displaced more than the critical value, the statistics of relative displacements were put into a survival probability model which finally gave us fairly good predictions for various experimental results by extrapolating the sample size from nano scale in simulations to micron scale in experiments.    However, the predicted strength in micro-pillar compression tests was still several times larger than the experimental values, possibly due to the different boundary conditions we used in the simulations when obtaining the statistics. To verify this, we performed simulations on the same material with a nano-sized column with free surfaces, and found that the most highly displaced atoms always occurred near a surface within a thickness of several angstroms from the surface. The statistics of the atomic relative displacements in the surface layers still obeyed a Weibull form. Based on the same assumption that instability is reached when an atom exhibits a relative displacement of about one half of the Shockley partial, the predicted yield strength of micro-pillars when extrapolating the statistics of the column surface in the simulations to the surface area encountered in real experiments on micro-pillars agreed a lot better with the experimental values, thus confirming that nucleation is more likely to start from the surface in a column during compression.

T1  - Incorporating environmental education content into a high school biology curriculum using scientific inquiry
AN  - 304707668
AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to incorporate environmental education into the biology classroom using inquiry learning. Science education can be applied to all aspects of life on earth. By educating people about the natural resources used to make food, clothes, everyday products, types of transportation and housing, we are able to show how humans impact our world today. A current study done by William F. McComas (2003) showed that many Biology textbooks have tried to touch on the topic of environmental education, but none have integrated it into the biology class particularly well. Some of the textbooks observed noted ecology topics only towards the end of the book for those teachers who have the time at the end of the year to cover said material. "Possessing knowledge of ecology enables individuals to make useful explanations and accurate predictions while informing decision making and "action taking." In this fashion, ecology provides a thread linking together various sub-domains of biology" (McComas, 2003). Environmental education relates to many aspects of biology because it affects the evolution and adaptation of species, anatomy and physiology of individuals living in a particular area. In addition it relates to the genetic makeup of offspring, the metabolic processes involved in plants and animals, and the utilization of a particular niche to occupy.  Environmental education also impacts many important issues that students face today and therefore would be a good way to increase student learning about biological topics because the information is relevant to their everyday lives. Science education is a very important aspect of everyday life. Biology provides the basics for studying life on earth. By applying environmental education into a biology curriculum, students will gain a better understanding of biological diversity, interactions within ecosystems, adaptation, cycles, human impact, and even the use of technology. All of these factors are important in the science of biology and can easily show young minds the value of knowing how the environment works. It is important for the student population to become educated in all facets of the environment because of the many issues that the world and even local environments are facing, such as global warming, flooding, pollution and drastic changes in ecosystems. Inquiry learning, an instructional strategy used in teaching science, is an excellent way for students to become active within their environment while learning valuable facts concerning science today. Inquiry instruction prepares students for future environmental decisions by creating a scientifically literate community.

T1  - The mitochondrion in the life and death of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>
AN  - 304704324
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum is the causative protozoan parasite of the most severe form of malaria. This disease is still a major problem throughout many regions of the world and eradication efforts have fallen short. Although effective anti-malaria chemotherapies have been developed, we don't know why these drugs work and whether their effects on the parasite are static or cidal. Mitochondrial electron transport chain is a well established anti-malarial drug target, molecular details underlying the parasite demise have not been elucidated. However, the mitochondrion remains a validated drug target in the malaria parasite.    Disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport leads to parasite death. Here we show that the blood-stages of the parasite seem to maintain an active electron transport chain to serve one function; de novo  pyrimidine synthesis. By supplying P. falciparum with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), which does not require ubiquinone to function, the transgenic parasites become resistant to electron transport inhibitors. Surprisingly, disrupting the flow of electrons does not abolish the mitochondrial membrane potential in P. falciparum and these parasites have established an alternate mode of generating this potential.    Subsequently, we explored the effects of atovaquone, alone as well as in combination with its synergistic partner, proguanil, on mitochondrial physiology and the stage specific static or cidal effects of the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport. Our results suggest that, in P. falciparum, the in vitro effects of atovaquone and atovaquone/proguanil are dependent upon the erythrocytic stage of the parasites exposed to the drugs. We found a large proportion of ring-stage parasites are most resilient to drug treatment and seem to survive for up to 48 hours, with a small fraction remaining viable even after 96 hours of treatment. The survival of the parasites depends on their ability to exist in a 'static' phase; once treatment ceases, the parasites re-enter the erythrocytic development cycle as seen by parasite morphology. To further elucidate the mechanism of resistance development, we have analyzed the response of drug selected parasites to a subsequent drug treatment. These studies begin to provide information on the physiological state of the drug-inhibited parasites when mutations in mitochondrial DNA could arise that lead to drug resistance.

T1  - Effects of sward structure and climate change on the ecology and behaviour of grassland isopods.
AN  - 301675984
AB  - In this thesis I examine the effect of microclimate on the diversity, abundance, population processes and behaviour of three grassland isopod species, as representatives of soil arthropod macro-decomposers, in the context of predicted climate change scenarios. It is shown that inter-specific differences in relative adaptability to the terrestrial habitat, in conjunction with habitat heterogeneity, are essential in understanding these dynamics. Variation in diversity resulted from disturbance both to the soil profile and sward structure due to grazing. Predictions from a spatial survey were tested using a twenty-year time series. Results highlight the importance of the equitability component of diversity. This same long-term dataset was used to examine aggregation in the field. Aggregating behaviour was strongest at the very lowest densities regardless of habitat. There was some evidence to suggest species-specific relationships between aggregation and micro-climatic conditions. Using laboratory experiments, the relationships between aggregation and temperature, relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit were examined more precisely. Species with more advanced adaptations to reducing moisture loss aggregated the least. Isopods aggregated more at higher temperatures and lower relative humidity. With moisture being a critical limiting factor to these invertebrates, choice of activity can be in part dependant upon climatic variables. The trade-off between foraging and sheltering behaviour and relative nocturnality were shown to vary according to moisture availability. The activities of the species least adapted to prevent water loss were altered significantly more than the other two species. A field experiment showed that the fitness costs incurred by reductions in moisture availability may be partially mitigated by the growth benefits of increased temperature.

T1  - Numerical Simulation of Directional Solidification Process and Microstructure Evolution of Superalloy Turbine Blade Castings
TT  - 高温合金叶片定向凝固过程微观组织数值模拟
AN  - 1027105455
AB  - As key parts of airplane engine, high temperature properties of single crystal superalloy turbine blades have direct influence on the performance of an airplane engine. With the development of solidification simulation technology, studying the directional process and predicting the formation of casting defects are helpful to optimize technical parameters, avoid casing defects and reduce the development cycle and cost.
Ray Tracing method was used to develop the dynamic heat transfer model of directional solidification process of multiple turbine blades with the consideration of complex heat radiation transfer among the multiple turbine blades and the furnace wall in the vacuum environment. The placed pattern of multiple blades on the chill plate, the furnace geometry and the withdrawal rate were considered in the model. The directional solidification process of single and multiple blades were simulated using the above model respectively. The temperature distribution during the withdrawal process was predicted, and the cooling curves were compared with the experimental results and they agreed well. The temperature distribution of multiple blades during withdrawal process in the horizontal direction was uneven because of the shades effect among the different blades.
Model for microstructure evolution of turbine blades of superalloy was developed according to the characteristic of directional solidification process with the consideration of nucleation and grain growth. A capturing rule suitable for the finite difference grids was presented and could be used to describe the grain growth in random directions. A Discrete Layer method to predict the microstructure evolution at the scale of real turbine blade was developed based on the fact that the mushy zone during withdrawal process was continuous and thin in the longitudinal direction. The microstructure evolution of starter block and grain selector were also simulated using the Discrete Layer method.
The experiments with various and uniform withdrawal rates were designed to improve the quality of product, avoid the casting defects and increase the productivity at the same time. The temperature distribution of different part in the blade was measured, while the microstructure and casting defects were observed. Stray grains occurred in all three blades in the experiments with uniform withdrawal rate, 7.0mm/min. In the other experiment, 7.0mm/min was used for first 20 minutes and then 3.5mm/min was used till to the end of directional solidification process. One of the three blades had no stray grains, while the other two had. The temperature distribution and microstructure evolution were simulated using the macro and micro coupled model presented in this paper. The simulated cooling curves and casting defects were coincide with the experimental. The accurate time to change the withdrawal rate was very important to control the quality of blades. It was indicated that decreasing withdrawal rate in advance when the mutational cross-section approached to the baffle could be helpful to both increase productivity and avoid casing defects.Alternate abstract:高温合金单晶叶片作为航空发动机中的关键部件，其高温性能直接影响着发动机的整体性能。随着凝固模拟技术的发展，开展高温合金叶片定向凝固过程数值模拟研究，研究定向凝固过程的规律并预测结晶缺陷产生的规律，有助于优化生产工艺，减少铸造缺陷，缩短试制周期，降低生产费用。
本文结合实际的高温合金叶片定向凝固过程，在重点考虑真空封闭炉腔内多叶片间复杂辐射换热的基础上，采用射线追踪法，建立了多叶片定向凝固过程的动态热传输模型。充分考虑了多叶片排列方式、加热炉几何尺寸、抽拉速度等工艺参数的影响。对单叶片、多叶片条件下的定向凝固过程进行了模拟，预测了定向凝固过程中叶片的温度分布情况，并与实验结果进行了对比，吻合较好。多叶片条件下由于叶片间的遮挡作用，水平方向上温度分布并不均匀。
本文针对高温合金叶片定向凝固过程的特点建立了微观组织演化模型，在考虑形核、生长模型的基础上提出了新的单元捕获规则，可在有限差分网格中描述枝晶沿任意方向的生长情况，并针对定向凝固过程固液两相区纵向连续且范围较小的形状特点提出了分层计算法，可用于计算高温合金叶片整体微观组织演变。本文设计了简单算例对微观组织演化模型进行了验证，此外，本文对单晶叶片引晶器、选晶器部分的微观组织演变进行了模拟。
本文针对抽拉速度这一重要的工艺条件设计了单晶叶片匀速及先快速后慢速的变速实验，实测了匀速、变速实验中单晶叶片的温度变化及缺陷情况。在以7.0mm/min匀速抽拉的实验中得到了3件叶片，均在缘板部位观测到了杂晶缺陷；变速实验中先采用7.0mm/min抽拉20min后改用3.5mm/min抽拉至结束，得到的3件叶片质量相对于匀速条件下的叶片有所改善，其中一件为完整单晶叶片，另两件杂晶尺寸减小。运用本文建立的宏、微观计算模型对匀速、变速条件下的单晶叶片定向凝固过程温度分布及组织演变进行了预测。模拟分析表明，变速时刻对于变速工艺的效果具有重要的影响，在截面突变处接近辐射挡板时提前降低抽拉速度则可以起到既避免缺陷又提高效率的目的。

T1  - Effect of tool parameters on residual stress and temperature generation in high-speed machining of aluminum alloys.
AN  - 35364833; 200902-60-0437094 (MT)
AB  - The need throughout the machining industry for cost reduction and increases in productivity have contributed to new interest in high-speed machining. Even though, many model for machining exist, most of them are for low-speed machining, where momentum is negligible and material behavior is well approximated by the quasi-static laws. In machining at high speeds momentum could be large and the strain rate can be exceedingly high. For these reasons a fluid mechanics approach to understanding high-speed, very high-speed and ultra-high-speed machining is attempted here. Namely, a potential flow solution is used to model the behavior of the material around a tool tip during machining at high speeds, i.e. greater than or equal to 100 m/s. It is carefully argued that the potential flow solution is relevant and can be used as a first approximation to model the behavior of a metal during high-speed, very high-speed or ultra-high-speed machining events. At a minimum, the potential flow solution is qualitatively useful in understanding mechanics of high-speed, very high-speed and ultra-high-speed machining. Interestingly, the flow solution predicts that there is a ''stagnation' point on the rake face, not at the tool tip as is usually assumed. Because the ''stagnation' point is not at the tool tip, the flow solution predicts a significant amount of deformation in the work piece resulting in large residual strains and a possible related temperature rise on the finished surface. To verify the fluid flow model, an experimental apparatus has been designed to examine fluid flow in orthogonal machining. Experiments were conducted at room temperature for different Newtonian fluids, cutting conditions and cutting tools. It was seen that, indeed, the ''stagnation' point is not at the tool tip. Next, a modified Hopkinson bar apparatus is employed to simulate dry orthogonal machining at 30 m/s cutting velocity. A focused array of Mercury-Cadmium-Tellurium infrared detectors is used to measure the temperature distribution. A three-component quartz force transducer is utilized in measuring the cutting and feed forces. Measurements of the cutting and feed forces contributed to the ability to prove the steady-state conditions as well as to estimate the coefficient of friction on the tool rake face along with the partition of the thermal energy produced during the high-speed machining process. Force measurements show that at this speed, on the upper boundary of the range of cutting velocities for high-speed machining not high enough to be very-high speed or ultra-high speed cutting, the role of momentum is negligible and the cutting event is dominated by material deformation, making the fluid model less applicable. Much higher cutting speeds, beyond the capability of this apparatus, are needed to make the fluid approach accurate. Not-surprisingly, measurements of temperature distributions showed little heating of the finished surface. Therefore, a study of the temperature fields generated during machining with a cutting tool that has a wear-land was performed. It is seen that the wear-land contributes significantly to the heating of the workpiece and, at this speed, is the most likely mechanism for the generation of residual stress and a temperature rise on the finished surface.

T1  - Characterizing the Plio-Pleistocene evolution of sea surface conditions using the alkenone organic proxy
AN  - 305355154
AB  - Concern about future changes in Earth's climate has generated intense interest in the past behavior of the climate system. Over the past 5 million years the Earth's climate has transitioned from the warm early Pliocene interval, to the colder, more variable late Pliocene and Pleistocene periods, which were marked by the growth of large ice-sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. This dissertation applies a novel approach to understanding this important climatic transition by using the alkenone organic proxy to characterize past climatic variations in sea surface temperature and productivity. This work reviews the discovery, development, calibration, and potential caveats to the application of the alkenone organic proxy, explicitly examining the use of this method to study climatological problems over long (>1 Myr) timescales and concluding that there is enormous potential to apply this valuable tool to the study of long-term paleoclimate. Additionally, this dissertation documents the application of the alkenone organic proxy to the characterization of long-term climatic change at sites in the Coral Sea, eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) and North Atlantic. Results from the western Coral Sea indicate that the late Quaternary rise of the Australian Great Barrier Reef was not caused by a warming of regional sea surface temperatures as previously proposed and highlights the ability of the alkenone organic proxy to provide valuable climate information in regions where carbonate diagenesis has rendered other commonly used carbonate-based techniques unreliable. Work from the EEP and North Atlantic provide the first continuous, high-resolution records of variations in sea surface conditions through the Plio-Pleistocene climatic transition. These records indicate marked spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of sea surface temperature and productivity during this time interval. These datasets probe the validity of several existing theories for the Plio-Pleistocene transition and lay the foundation for an array of sites that will provide a spatial fingerprint of Pliocene to modern sea surface conditions.

T1  - Mixed burden softening and melting phenomena
AN  - 305354419
AB  - The blast furnace (BF) will remain the major iron producing unit for the foreseeable future. The cohesive zone, where ferrous materials soften and melt, affects the productivity of the BF. This research was focused on expanding the current understanding of the mechanism of softening and melting of the ferrous materials. The other objective of this project was to examine the potential use of direct reduced iron (DRI) and hot briquetted iron (HBI) as the BF burden. The materials used in this study were DRI, HBI, lump iron ore and pellets. A wide variety of experimental procedures were employed to completely understand the process phenomena.    The softening and melting (SM) experiments were conducted under load and X-Ray fluoroscopy was used to visualize the process. The results of these experiments were conducive in determining a suitable mechanism of softening and melting of the burden. For single burdens of DRI and HBI, softening occurred when metal began to melt. For mixed burdens of DRI and pellets/lump ore, the initial deformation was not affected by DRI; however DRI dominated as the temperature increased and melting occurred only when DRI melted. Melt dripping was observed at temperatures close to meltdown. A FactSage slag model was used to obtain the evolution of liquid with temperature. It was compared with the bed shrinkage which indicated that the most likely reason of the softening of the burden is the deformation of solid, phases, especially iron.    The bulk SM experiments were interrupted at temperatures of interest and samples were examined for the morphological changes. These experiments were instrumental in studying the burden interaction at different stages during softening and melting of the burden. In addition, in separate experiments (without load), the melting structure of DRI/HBI samples was studied. The results of these experiments were expanded to include viscosity, surface energy and deformation rate calculations which were helpful in understanding the melt exudation phenomenon. The microstructure of the materials showed a transition from heterogeneous to homogenous state with increasing temperatures. The melt dripping was predominantly observed in olivine fluxed pellets. The exuded slag was primarily composed of alkali rich phase which was found least viscous amongst all types of slags present in this system. The viscosity of the liquid and the structure of metallic shell facilitated the melt exudation from the burden. In addition, the liquid filled the iron shell and coarsened its structure. Based on the metallographic examination of the samples a mechanism of burden interaction was proposed. The burden interaction is followed by melt dripping and melting of the burden.    The melting onset temperatures were estimated from the isothermal section modeling of the phase diagrams and liquid mass fraction calculations obtained using FactSage software and databases. The phase diagrams supported the experimental observations such as non-melting of olivine particles in the olivine fluxed pellets and slag homogenization at 1300°C in the basic pellets. Addition of magnesia in lieu of lime was found to provide beneficial impact, in particular on the rate of liquid evolution at high temperature. Effect of alkali, even in small amounts, was deleterious for high temperature properties, especially in terms of early melt onset and lowering of the viscosity of the slag formed.

T1  - Temperature-moderated constraints on optimal egg size and reproductive output in a northern population of painted turtles (<i>Chrysemys picta </i>)
AN  - 305337409
AB  - This research is part of a long-term study on the life-history of the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) that was initiated in Algonquin Park in 1978. I used long-term data to test the hypothesis that widely documented annual variations in egg mass (EM) and egg length (EL) are inversely related to the temperature of the spring or fall periods of follicular development. I also tested the hypothesis that clutch frequency (CF - the number of clutches per year) and clutch size (CS) are positively related to the temperatures of the previous fall. CF was related to temperature in smaller, but not in larger females. Mean EM, EL, CS and (accordingly) the mass of the first clutch were inversely related to the temperature experienced just prior to nesting season onset. I show that this inverse relationship is likely an artifact of selection for a temperature-moderated gonadal cycle, and I argue that the Smith-Fretwell model of egg size optimization is applicable to C. picta in the Algonquin population.

T1  - A multidisciplinary approach to the identification and evaluation of novel concepts for deeply buried hardened target defeat
AN  - 305333211
AB  - During the Cold War, Deeply Buried Hardened Targets (DBHTs) and the assets they protected were of great strategic and tactical concern to the Department of Defense. Megaton-class nuclear warheads were the only viable means of attacking many of these facilities, and even so, a small subset of DBHTs was anticipated to be robust even in the face of such an attack. Post Cold War, the threat posed by DBHTs has not disappeared. Rather, the conventional warfare advantages of the United States have led to an increasing emphasis by potential adversaries on the construction and use of hardened facilities such as DBHTs for protection of both conventional and unconventional assets. Further, the shift in perceived relative risk to the United States' national security from large scale all-out nuclear attack towards very limited attack by Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) has led some to hypothesize that "self-deterrence" may diminish the strategic value of current inventory nuclear weapons.    The objective of the work described was to identify and explore a paradigm shifting solution that could offer leap-ahead capabilities to counter current and future DBHT threats while mitigating or eliminating the "self-deterrence" issue. Systematic evaluation of DHBT defeat alternatives lead to the selection of a thermal subterrene as a hypothetical means of providing such a capability. A number of possible implementation alternatives for a thermal subterrene were investigated, resulting in the identification of the RadioIsotope Powered Thermal Penetrator (RIPTP) concept for providing an effectively unlimited hard rock penetration capability using near-term technologies.    However, the proposed approach was novel and thus required formulation and application of a physics based multidisciplinary analysis code to enable evaluation of lv design alternatives and analysis of performance. Technical considerations identified as important to the feasibility of a RIPTP for DBHT defeat included: packing of RIPTP components in available volume; close-contact melting in a medium with nonlinear thermodynamic properties; radiation shielding; radiation health physics; point source plume dispersal calculations; alternative technologies for production of radioisotopes; chemical and physical properties of isotope compounds; nuclear reactor characteristics; high temperature material stability and inter-material compatibility; weapon and delivery system integration; a variety of heat transfer regimes including radiation, conduction, convection, nucleate boiling, and film boiling; thermal/mechanical stress analysis (steady-state and transient); rock physical and thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature; detection/mapping of deeply buried facility spaces; and more.    The following disciplinary analyses were composed into a multidisciplinary analysis code for a RIPTP: packing of RIPTP components in available volume; close-contact melting analysis; transmutation of isotope species by neutron activation; reactor neutron economy; radioisotope power generation through decay; metamodelled radiation shielding calculations for a RIPTP; and steady state thermal analyses for a RIPTP in various scenarios.    Filtering of radioisotopes for potential suitability, their possible production mechanisms, state of technological development, and multidisciplinary analysis code predicted performance lead to the identification of Thulium-170 as the best isotope for powering a RIPTP using present-day technology and technical data. Ytterbium-169 was identified as an alternative isotope offering the potential for significant potential improvements over Thulium-170 in radiological safety as well as RIPTP performance and producibility. Production, however, was determined to require identification of a cost effective technology for highly enriching Ytterbium-168 from its low natural abundance.    Performance analysis of the identified baseline Thulium-170 RIPTP suggested that the predicted low penetration rate of about 10 meters/day could be a significant negative factor with regards to possible viability of the concept. Consequently, a survey for potentially enabling technologies was performed using an adaptation of the Technology Impact Forecasting (TIF) approach. It was found that the greatest potential for improving performance of the baseline Thulium-170 RIPTP resulted from increasing overall power density of the penetrator. Several possible technology approaches to achieving significantly increased penetration rates (approximately 50 meters/day expected penetration rate vs. original 13 meters/day) were proposed.    However, it was determined that the hypothetical technology having the greatest potential impact on thermal subterrene viability for DHBT defeat with respect to penetration rate was cost-effective enrichment for Ytterbium-168. Development of such a technology would eliminate or enormously reduce the impact of all identified RIPTP performance and producibility concerns. Alternatively, relaxation of the requirement for no radiological hazard to enemy combatants would enable selection of a fissile powered thermal subterrene to provide required power densities consistent with rapid penetration.

T1  - The evolution of a polyphenism by genetic accommodation
AN  - 305329815
AB  - An adaptive polyphenism is the ability of a particular genotype to respond to different environments by generating two or more alternative phenotypes, each of which is adapted to the particular environment. This adaptive strategy has evolved in many taxa, yet little is known about the evolutionary origins of this trait. This thesis focuses on how adaptive polyphenisms can evolve through a process called genetic accommodation. Genetic accommodation is a process by which a novel phenotype becomes established in a population through polygenic changes in the genetic background driven by selection on phenotypic variants that are produced by either mutation or environmental change.    A polyphenism was experimentally evolved in a previously monophenic black mutant Manduca sexta larva through selection on genetic variants revealed by heat-shock. A corresponding change in juvenile hormone (JH) titer was observed as determined by a JH bioassay. A cross between a monophenic and a polyphenic individuals revealed that the evolved polyphenism is likely to be controlled polygenically with at least one gene of major effect. The work demonstrates how hormones can act to mask hidden genetic variation and shows how complex traits may evolve. Implications of such changes are discussed along with a more general view of the developmental basis of the process of evolution by genetic accommodation. The theory of genetic accommodation is then discussed in the context of classical theories and studies of adaptive evolution.    The final step of genetic accommodation involves the removal of fitness cost and trade-offs associated with the evolution of the novel trait. Larval coloration and body size was found to be highly correlated and developmentally integrated by JH. Selection to uncouple the developmentally integrated traits revealed that developmental modules that are not under the control of the developmental integrator can evolve to overcome the potential constraint that arises as a consequence of developmental integration. Therefore, the final step of genetic accommodation relies on evolution of developmental modules to overcome potential trade-offs or costs. The ease with which a polyphenism could evolve in the laboratory demonstrates that polyphenisms can evolve from adjustments on pre-existing hormonal regulation. The relationship between the origins of novelties and polyphenisms is discussed.

T1  - The role of temperature in habitat selection by eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (<i>Sistrurus catenatus catenatus</i>) near their northern range limit
AN  - 305326282
AB  - Temperature should be one of the most important factors influencing habitat selection in terrestrial ectotherms, because physiological processes depend on body temperature and body temperatures depend primarily on the habitats they occupy. The importance of temperature in habitat selection should be amplified in cool climates and for ambush predators, who must select habitat warm enough to detect and strike prey quickly. Using 4 years of telemetry data from 34 individuals, I investigated the role of temperature in habitat selection by eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus c. catenatus ) on the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario, near their northern range limit. Snakes were selective at the microhabitat scale, preferentially using locations with closer retreat sites and shrubs than random. Gravid females were most selective, using sites with more rock cover and less canopy closure than sites used by males and nongravid females. Landscape-scale habitat preferences were proportional to the availability of suitable microhabitat. The overwinter mortality rate (23% over 3 years) was among the highest reported for north-temperature vipers. Lethally low temperatures were a lesser concern for snakes during the active season than temperatures routinely too low for basic functions like prey capture and reproduction. Consistent with theory, snakes thermoregulated less accurately (i.e., body temperatures were further from preferred levels) when environmental temperatures were low, but thermoregulatory effort (i.e., how close body temperatures were to preferred levels, relative to environmental temperatures) varied with environmental temperature in different ways for different snakes. Gravid females maintained body temperatures suitable for embryogenesis by using sites with little forest cover and basking more when environmental temperatures were very low. Males and nongravid females did not make similar adjustments, and in fact used more ground cover (hindering thermoregulation) when environmental temperatures were very low. Gravid females may be required to bear the costs of a high thermoregulatory effort (e.g., reduced foraging success, increased predation risk) to successfully reproduce in an environment with a short and cool active season. Cold incubation conditions, a short time window between parturition and hibernation, and cold overwintering conditions likely result in high rates of neonate mortality, possibly limiting the northern distribution of massasauga rattlesnakes.

T1  - The evolutionary consequences of virus resistance
AN  - 305325505
AB  - Tradeoffs among abilities to contend with different factors that constrain fitness and abundance are fundamental aspects of many theories describing evolutionary and ecological phenomena. The tradeoff between competitive abilities and resistance to predation, herbivory and disease is one of the most widely studied tradeoffs, but direct measurements of this tradeoff and its effects are often difficult, owing to the practical constraints of many experimental systems. I used a microbial system of a viral predator and a bacterial prey to directly measure the cost of resistance to predation under a variety of experimental conditions in order to determine the ecological and evolutionary constraints that predator resistance imposes on populations.    I measured the cost of resistance in the bacterium Escherichia coli to predation by bacteriophage T4 under a range of temperatures roughly spanning the usual thermal niche of E. coli. Temperature strongly affects the cost of resistance in an asymmetric fashion. At the host temperature for E. coli, virus-resistant genotypes are 15 to 25% less fit than virus-sensitive parental genotypes. At sub-optimal temperatures, the cost of resistance was ameliorated. At stressful temperatures, the cost of resistance was exacerbated.    I subsequently evolved a group of T4-resistant E. coli genotypes for 500 generations in the absence of bacteriophage at sub-optimal, benign and stressful temperatures to determine whether temperature affects the abilities of resistant genotypes to ameliorate the cost of resistance through adaptation. There was no adaptive amelioration of the cost of resistance in the benign thermal environment. By far, the greatest degree of adaptive amelioration occurred at a stressful temperature near the upper thermal limit for E. coli growth.    Genetic variance among resistant genotypes tended to increase in novel environments, suggesting that different genetic mechanisms underlay similar fitness changes within each selective regime. Resistance did not change the general pattern of thermal specificity achieved through the course of selection. Genotypes evolved in a thermally benign environment became thermal generalists and genotypes evolved in a thermally stressful environment became thermal specialists. Adaptive amelioration of the cost of resistance was temperature specific, with the degree of correlated amelioration in novel thermal environments decreasing progressively with temperature.

T1  - Surviving the Little Ice Age: Family strategies in the decade of the Great Famine of 1693–1694 as reconstructed through the parish registers and family reconstitution
AN  - 305279142
AB  - This research, undertaken as part of a larger, multi-temporal study of social relations and land use, examines parish registers for the commune of Uxeau (Canton of Gueugnon, Département of Saône-et-Loire, region of Burgundy, France) during the coldest decade of the "Little Ice Age."    The work explores the types of analyses and research questions appropriate for very early registers that cover short intervals. Such registers usually lack the supplemental and corroborating records available for later periods, such as census lists, household enumerations and tax records. Analyses performed include some simple aggregative calculations and a thorough family reconstitution.    More unusually, this study places particular emphasis on the peripheral entries not always included in the data bases for family reconstitution---those notations in addition to the main facts of baptism, marriage and burial, which provide detailed information on persons acting as godparents, marriage witnesses and mourners. Incorporating this data, allows extended family groups to be reconstructed for up to four generations, using parish records covering a period of only ten years---something that would otherwise have taken several decades worth of data to accomplish. It is the ties represented in the peripheral data that make possible the reconstruction of the social network, parish hierarchy, and economic relations within the parish. For example, the spatial mapping of the occupational data and the patterns of social alliances reveals two distinct agricultural ecotypes within the parish.    The ten-year period of the study coincides with the coldest decade of "The Little Ice Age" and surrounds the "Great Mortality" from the famine of 1693-1694. The strategies for marriage and godparent alliances that emerge from the analyses appear to have effectively reduced risk in that precarious decade of harvest failures, uncertain land tenure and exorbitant taxes. Most of the inhabitants of the parish belonged to large communautés , a communal type of farm made up of multiple, cohabitating, extended family groups. The study shows some significant differences in the practices of these communautés from those of later periods and neighboring regions.

T1  - Population and feeding characteristics of hydrothermal vent gastropods along environmental gradients with a focus on a bacterial symbiosis hosted by <i>Lepetodrilus fucensis</i> (Vetigastropoda)
AN  - 304983974
AB  - Three gastropods occupy a range of habitats along gradients in hydrothermal flux at Juan de Fuca Ridge vents. I examined how these species co-exist and identified mechanisms driving their abundances. First, I measured temperatures and spatial patterns in adult densities of the three species at three distances from vents to test if thermal regime relates to their habitat selection. Lepetodrilus fucensis and Depressigyra globulus were most dense in-vent (0--25 cm) at variable temperatures (10±5°C): 2100 and 240 ind. dm-2 (respectively).  Provanna variabilis was most abundant far-vent (51--75 cm: 60 ind. dm-2) at stable temperatures (3±0.5°C). Thermal conditions are key in their habitat selection; behavioural experiments showed that these gastropods select fluid temperatures <18°C. L. fucensis  and D. globulus preferred 5--15°C, while  P. variabilis preferred 4--12°C.    The next studies sought to explain how Lepetodrilus fucensis  reaches order of magnitude higher densities in comparison to other gastropods. First, I quantified L. fucensis recruitment and sex ratio patterns to identify innovative life history traits. I meaured size structure and density at in- and far-vent locations. Early postlarval juveniles occupied far-vent at remarkable densities (2419 ind. dm-2). To test for sex ratio biases, I sexed animals from different habitats and sizes. Populations nearest vents hosted the largest females (>6.0 mm), while peripheral habitats were male-biased. A transplant experiment showed that female survivorship and gonad fullness were significantly lower than males in far-vent locations. Sex ratio biases are driven by two mechanisms: females maximize their reproductive output by selecting optimal habitats and suffer relatively higher mortality in low flux.    Next, I hypothesized that the Lepetodrilus fucensis gill symbiosis is a key adaptation. I used multiple approaches to determine if the prevalence of the association and relationship to the limpet's condition support this hypothesis. FISH probes specific to the 16S rRNA molecule of a gamma-Proteobacteria hybridized where bacteria were present. Direct sequencing using symbiont-specific primers gave a single unambiguous sequence, indicating high specificity. Light and TEM micrographs of gill tissue from a range of species also showed that the symbiosis is ubiquitous. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Comparative biochemistry of lipid and protein metabolism in marine invertebrate larvae from warm and *cold environments
AN  - 304968597
AB  - From the simplest single celled organisms to complex multicellular animals, metabolic regulation of changes in quantity and quality of proteins and lipids are essential to life. In this dissertation, the metabolism of protein and lipid synthesis and utilization was examined in developing embryos and larvae of species of marine invertebrates. Differential protein expression and lipid metabolism was studied during the early larval development of slow- and fast-growing larval families the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Early larval stages possessed more protein than lipid reserves, however triacylglycerols were used to fuel early development to the feeding larval stage. Differential protein expression was measured by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and a complex pattern of differential protein expression was observed for some of the acidic proteins, suggesting possible markers for "egg quality" in setting quantitative traits in larvae.    The cost of protein synthesis was measured in the homogenates made from embryos of several species of temperate and Antarctic echinoderm using cell-free protein translation assays. The costs of protein synthesis in the three temperate echinoderm species studied ranged from 3.66 ± 0.79 to 8.33 ± 3.13 J (mg protein synthesized)-1, which is consistent with values that have been reported in the literature for other temperate species of animals. In contrast, however, significantly lower costs of protein synthesis were measured in Antarctic echinoderm species of 0.41 ± 0.15 to 1.79 ± 0.55 J (mg protein synthesized)-1. This low cost of protein synthesis observed in the Antarctic species suggests a potential adaptation to life in cold and nutrient-poor environments by having a low "cost of living."    The egg lipid content was studied in several species of Antarctic echinoderm. Normal development was negatively impacted by low amounts of initial triacylglycerol content in the herbivorous Antarctic sea urchin S. neumayeri. In two congener species of predatory Antarctic sea star O. validus  and O. meridionalis, variability in the egg lipid content of females was observed, but lipid reserves were sufficient in these species for normal development to proceed. The data presented here on maternal investment in eggs suggests the occurrence of nutritional stress in adult females of S. neumayeri.

T1  - Mussel genetics in relation to selection methods for high quality seed and treatment for tunicates
AN  - 304923279
AB  - An experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential for using the genetic measure of allozyme heterozygosity as a predictor of seed quality. A sample containing two year-classes of Mytilus edulis (marine mussels) was taken from seed lines in St. Peter's Bay, Prince Edward Island and selected using either elevated water temperature or air exposure. The purpose of the treatments was to determine if the survivors had a detectable increase in heterozygosity. Increasing the level of heterozygosity in cultured mussels may produce stocks that have increased growth and less mortality, traits that are important in mussel aquaculture. Differences in mortality between the cohorts may have been due to physiological condition, genetic characteristics or a combination of these factors. The results of this study indicate that selective treatments of naturally collected seed should be investigated as an option to increase productivity and that heterozygosity can be used as a monitoring tool of mussel populations.    A second experiment involved selection techniques followed by a field trial involving three bays in P.E.I. The effects of air exposure or elevated water temperature treatments on samples of Mytilus edulis spat were examined. Selection treatments resulted in a ∼ 50% mortality from an 11-hour air exposure at 27°C and ∼75% mortality from a 6-hour exposure to 33°C water. After the initial treatment, survivors of the air exposure treatment were significantly (P<0.01) larger than the controls while survivors of the elevated water temperature treatment were smaller (P<0.01). The field study showed that the treatments had a significant effect on size, growth and survival, suggesting that relatively simple husbandry practices of weeding out weaker mussel seed can affect productivity. Physiological analyses from field mussels showed that controls had a higher metabolic rate than the treated groups. After ten months in the field, the treated mussels were larger and had lower mortality in the field compared to untreated control mussels. The results demonstrate that simple husbandry techniques can be used to increase the productivity of mussel seed and heterozygosity measures can be used to assess fitness.    Finally, a major problem for mussel aquaculture on P.E.I., Canada surfaced in the late 1990's with the introduction of a fouling organism, Styela clava. This organism infests mussel cultivation equipment to the point where production is no longer viable. This study examined the effects that two anti-fouling treatments, air exposure and acetic acid, had on mussel populations. Socked seed were exposed to three treatment regimes and subsequently placed on a long-line in New London Bay, P.E.I. The treatments were a forty-hour air exposure, thirty-second and two-minute acetic acid immersion. Treatment effects were measured after seven months in the field. Mussel quality was assessed using mussel sock weights, length, condition index and changes in heterozygosity. A significant decrease in sock weights was found for all treatments compared to controls (P< 0.05), revealing that significant mortality occurred in the treated populations. Results on the other characteristics used to assess mussel fitness found no long-term effects on the health or genetic structure of the treated populations.

T1  - Abundance and occupancy: Use of a mesocosm to test pattern and process
AN  - 304907455
AB  - Field-based mesocosm studies may be used as conceptual experiments to examine theoretical questions using the generated empirical data. A field-based Drosophilidae-nectarine mesocosm, comprising sun and shaded microclimate treatments arranged in a checkerboard design, was used in this thesis to examine four theoretical objectives. First, the efficacy of spatial analysis for detecting empirical pattern was examined. Natural variation weakened spatial structuring. However, hypothesis generation was shown not to be affected by this inclusion. Second, enhancing the hypothesis generating capacity of spatial methods was assessed, and confirmed to be possible, through the use of a sensitivity analysis method developed here. The method distinguished between mechanism categories (intrinsic, extrinsic and natural variation) and assessed the relative strength of each category. Next, an empirical test of the He and Gaston (2000a) parameterisation method and model to predict abundance from occupancy was conducted. Abundance estimates derived using the parameterisation method were underestimated because individuals were highly aggregated within fruit. This model and method require further exploration at fine scales for highly aggregated species. The incorporation of spatially explicit information may improve abundance predictions. Finally, the influence of spatial variation in temperature on adult body size in  Drosophila simulans Sturtevant was investigated. The simple developmental effects of temperature differences, or the simple effects of stressful temperatures on thorax length, were overridden by interactive effects between temperature and larval density. As a result, flies attained the same final sizes in the shade and sun. Under natural conditions both mortality and non-lethal effects of temperature and/or crowding are likely to play a role in the evolution of body size. The results of this thesis provide (i) an improved understanding of the influence of natural variation on spatial pattern, (ii) an additional tool for spatial hypothesis generation, (iii) an empirical test of an abundance-prediction model and (iv) an understanding of interactive and non-lethal effects on body size under field conditions. The thesis therefore provides empirical support for the usefulness of field-based mesocosms to examine theoretical objectives.

T1  - Mechanisms underlying sexual segregation in a monomorphic fish species
AN  - 301709920
AB  - I investigate mechanisms underlying sexual segregation in the lesser spotted dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, a model species which is monomorphic with respect to body size.
  Male and female dogfish exhibited sex-differences in horizontal and vertical space use.  Females refuged in shallow-water (3-5 m) caves for up to 75% of the time, but undertook nocturnal foraging excursions to depth (≤ 50m).  In contrast, males spent daylight hours in comparatively deep water (~18m) and nocturnally either ranged throughout the water column or occupied shallow-water habitats.
  The activity patterns of the sexes differed in the wild but not in the laboratory, indicating that sex-specific activity patterns of wild fish did not drive sexual segregation but were mediated through differential habitat selection.  Female refuging behaviour did not reflect the seasonal nature of grey seal sightings and thus it appears unlikely that predation risk underlies this behaviour.  Sex-differences were observed in the thermal habitat selection of wild dogfish, but not in those of laboratory-kept dogfish.  In addition, increased ambient temperatures did not increase rates of egg production, thus it is unlikely that females selected shallow water habitats to increase fecundity.  However, male dogfish made directed movements towards female refuges at the times when females emerged and returned, and laboratory-kept females increased their use of warm-water habitats when males were present.  It is hypothesised that social aversion is the principal factor driving sexual segregation in dogfish and that sperm-storing females refuge in shallow-water caves to avoid unnecessary mating attempts.

T1  - Physiological responses of Salmonella typhimurium under combined osmotic and heat stress
AN  - 2340162123
AB  - A notable exception to the enhanced antimicrobial activity generally seen with combination treatments is the combined effect of reduced water activity (aw) and heat inactivation where it is generally held that heat resistance or survival of several bacteria including Salmonella increases as the aw is reduced. However, recent reports suggest that reduced aw might increase or decrease heat resistance. Results of the present study showed that heating Salmonella Typhimurium at reduced aw (0.94) was protective at temperatures above 53-55°C but sensitising below this temperature. Using selective enumeration media to determine injury, it was shown that at lower heating temperatures (e.g. 50°C), cells survived at high aw with cytoplasmic membrane injury whereas at low aw these cells were killed. At higher temperatures (e.g. 60°C) ribosome degradation was a more important cause of death and was inhibited by low aw heating media thereby providing greater heat resistance. The time take for repair from injury varied with the different heating conditions and differed in the response to biosynthetic inhibitors such as azide, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. A lower than optimal growth temperature decreased heat resistance, while a high growth temperature increased it at both aw values (0.99 and 0.94). The effect of growth temperature was generally more pronounced at high aw. Habituation of Salmonella cells at low aw had no effect or decreased their heat resistance depending on the length of habituation and the heating condition. D50 reductions were always larger when heating at high aw compared to low aw conditions, whereas the reverse occurred in D60. The observed effect of low aw on Salmonella heat resistance cannot be generalised to all other bacteria. Other members of Enterobacteriaceae tested responded similarly, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Gram positives Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus plantarum all showed greater heat resistance at low aw regardless of temperature. Interestingly, Enterococcus faecalis, an enteric Gram positive, behaved similarly to the Enterobacteriaceae. Listeria monocytogenes, however, showed the opposite behaviour at both temperatures (50°C and 60°C).

T1  - CH4 and N2O Emission and Their Influence on Global Warming Potential in Ground Cover Rice Production System
TT  - 覆盖旱种稻田CH4和N2O排放及其对全球增温潜势的影响
AN  - 1026879893
AB  - Field experiment and trace gas collection chamber was applied to study the effect of ground cover rice production system (GCRPS) on flux and dynamics of CH4 and N2O emission during second rice growth in Guangzhou- The experiments included five treatments of normal paddy (T1), plastic film mulching (T2), straw-mulching plus nomal N fertilizer (T3) (Urea), straw mulching plus lower N fertilizer (T4) and straw mulching plus CRF (T5)- The regularity of CH4 and N2O emission in GCRPS was discussed by comparison the flux of CH4 and N2O in different treatments- Total greenhouse effect, i-e- global warming potential (GWP), of each treatment was calculated to estimate the contribution of GCRPS to greenhouse effect in order to provide scientific knowledge for comprehensive estimating adaptability and plasticity of the GCRPS-
Results showed that CH4 emission in normal paddy field and GCRPS concentrated in the nutritive growth stage of rice, being within 35 days after transplanting- However, there was little CH4 emission from the GCRPS treatments a small quantity of CH4 emission from normal paddy field during the later growing stage- The CH4 emission peak appeared in a few days after transplanting, which could last for several days- Then the amount of CH4 emission of paddy treatment and GCRPS treatments reduced to the lowest level- Compared to the normal paddy control treatment, the CH4 emission in GCRPS of whole growing stage declined by 16266 mg-m-2 to 17923 mg-m-2, i-e- by 79-8% to 88% of T1- It could be concluded that GCRPS could decrease CH4 emission- Among the GCRPS the plastic film mulching was the best on to refine the CH4 emission and straw mulching toke the second place-
Different from CH4, the trend of N2O emission in normal paddy field was not regularly- That is to say, there was N2O emission peak in prophase of rice growth- However, the N2O emission of GCRPS treatments had consistent regularity- The N2O emission showed remarkable peak after first dressing in prophase of the growth, being about 20 to 30 days after transplanting- Afterwards, amount of N2O emission almost reduced to the lowest level during rice growth- Compared to normal paddy control treatment, the GCRPS treatments increased N2O emission- The N2O emission amount of straw mulching plus CRF (T5) increased by 37 mg-m-2, the plastic film treatment (T2) by 367-15 mg-m-2, straw mulching plus lower N fertilizer (T4) by 170-63 mg-m-2 and straw-mulching (T3) (Urea) by 804-84 mg-m-2 respectively- Among GCRPS treatments, the T5 gave the least emission, and T3 was the most- It indicated that the former possessed the least N2O GWP, the later tended to enhance the N2O greenhouse effect-
Although N2O emission increased and CH4 decreased in GCRPS, total GWP of both CH4 and N2O decreased in the GCRPS compared to normal paddy- The GWP of normal paddy field was 1358392, while the GWP of T2 (plastic film), T3 (straw mulching), T4 (straw mulching plus lower N fertilizer), T5 (straw mulching plus CRF) were 294341, 522421, 328185, 286498 respectively- Compared to normal paddy treatment, the GWP of GCRPS treatments decreased by 61-5% to 78-9%- It was obvious that GCRPS could remarkably decrease the GWP- Within GCRPS treatments, mulch, fertilizers type and fertilization amount influenced the GWP (CH4 and N2O) significantly- Compared to normal paddy treatment, the GWP of T5 (straw mulching plus CRF), T2 (plastic film) and T4 (straw mulching plus lower N fertilizer) decreased by 75% more, while T3 (straw mulching) only by 61-5%- Many factors affected the CH4 and N2O emission in GCRPS, in which mostly included soil water content, soil temperature, pH, mulch material, fertilizer type, fertilization amount and so on-
The reason of decline of the GWP in GCRPS was that the CH4 emission amount remarkably decreased- It was shown that CH4 was one of the primary greenhouse effect gases to contribute or to affect GWP in paddy field, while the N2O emission amount was the dominant factor to GWP in GCRPS-Alternate abstract:本文采用静态箱法，通过田间试验研究了广东晚稻常规稻田和覆盖旱种稻田在水稻全生育期内的CH4、N2O的排放量和排放规律。通过对常规稻田和覆盖旱种稻田间、覆盖旱种条件下的各种覆盖物处理间、不同的氮肥品种及用量处理间稻田CH4 、N2O排放的对比研究，探讨地表覆盖水稻旱种生产体系（GCRPS）稻田CH4、N2O排放规律，并通过对各处理稻田CH4和N2O总温室效应量，即全球增温潜势（GWP）的比较，评价各处理稻田CH4、N2O排放量及其温室效应大小，为综合评价GCRPS的适应性和可行性提供理论依据。
研究结果表明，不论是常规水田处理还是覆盖旱种处理，稻田的CH4排放都主要集中在水稻生长前期，即水稻移栽后的前35天以内；在水稻生长中、后期除了常规水田处理仍有一定量的CH4排放外，所有GCRPS处理都几乎没有CH4排放。稻田甲烷的排放规律表现为，水稻移栽后几天内便出现甲烷排放峰，峰期可持续数日，在移栽后35天以后，无论是常规稻田还是旱种稻田，甲烷排放量几乎降至全生育期最低水平。相对于常规水田处理而言，GCRPS各种覆盖处理都能极显著减少稻田CH4排放，整生育期覆盖旱种稻田CH4排放较常规水田降低了16266 g--2～17923g--2，减幅都达到了79-8%以上，地膜覆盖旱种处理减幅达到了88%。表明各种覆盖旱种（GCRPS）处理都能达到很好的减排（CH4）效果，其中以地膜覆盖旱种处理效果最好，稻草覆盖旱种处理次之。
对稻田N2O排放而言，常规水田（T1）的氧化亚氮排放无明显的规律，即在水稻生长期，无明显的排放峰值和峰期。覆盖旱种几个处理的稻田氧化亚氮排放有一致的规律，即在水稻生长前期，在第一次追肥后，稻田出现明显的氧化亚氮排放峰，排放峰大致出现在移栽后的第20天到第30天内。峰期结束后，氧化亚氮的排放量几乎降到一生的最低水平。相对于常规稻田，覆盖旱种处理均增加稻田氧化亚氮排放量。覆草旱种控释肥处理（T5）稻田N2O排放量增加了37 g--2，地膜覆盖旱种（T2）的增加了367-15 mg-m-2，覆草旱种低氮处理（T4）增加了170-63 mg-m-2，覆草旱种（尿素常规用量）处理（T3）增加了804-84 mg-m-2。覆盖旱种处理中，以覆草旱种控释肥处理的氧化亚氮增加量最少，覆草旱种尿素常规用量的最多。说明前者的环保效果好，后者则易引起氧化亚氮排放而增加温室效应。
虽然水稻覆盖旱种处理两种温室气体一增（氧化亚氮增加）一减（甲烷降低），两者（CH4和N2O）的全球增温潜势（GWP）结果表明，常规水田处理的GWP为1358392，覆盖旱种处理T2、T3、T4、T5的分别为294341、522421、328185、286498。覆盖旱种处理稻田的GWP较常水田处理规稻田降低了61-5％～78-9%，可见地表覆盖旱种水稻能极显著降低稻田的全球增温潜势（GWP）。在地表覆盖旱种系统（GCRPS）内，覆盖方式、氮肥品种（形态）以及施肥量不同，稻田排放的温室气体（CH4和N2O）的全球增温效应（GWP）也存在显著差异。相对于常规稻田，覆草旱种控释肥（T5）、覆膜旱种（T2）及覆草旱种低氮（T4）处理的GWP值可降低75%以上，而覆草旱种尿素常规用量处理（T3）的减幅为61-5%。从降低稻田GWP来看，影响覆盖旱种稻田CH4、N2O排放的因素很多，主要有土壤水分、土壤温度，土壤pH、覆盖方式、肥料种类、施肥量等。
常规稻田改覆盖旱种后GWP降低的主要原因是甲烷排放量明显降低，说明常规稻田的温室效应气体及其GWP的效应以CH4为主，而覆盖旱种条件下稻田N2O的排放量多少则直接影响着各覆盖旱种处理GWP值的高低。

T1  - Characterization of physiological and transcriptome changes in the ancient Siberian permafrost bacterium <i>Psychrobacter arcticum 273-4</i> with low temperature and increased osmotica
AN  - 305465754
AB  - The Siberian permafrost is an extreme, yet stable environment due to its continuously frozen state. Average temperatures of -10 to -12°C concentrate solutes to an aw = 0.90 (5 osm), and limit nutrient diffusion into cells. The isolation of viable Psychrobacter arcticum 273-4 and Exiguobacterium sibericum 255-15 from ancient permafrost suggests that these bacteria have maintained some level of metabolic activity for thousands of years and are likely cryo-adapted. Past studies of cold-acclimated bacteria have focused primarily on organisms not capable of sub-zero growth. Siberian permafrost isolates E. sibericum 255-15 and  P. arcticum 273-4, which grow at subzero temperatures, were used to study cold-acclimated physiology. Changes in membrane composition and exopolysaccharides were defined as a function of growth at 24, 4 and -2.5°C in the presence and absence of 5% NaCl. As expected, there was a decrease in fatty acid saturation and chain length at the colder temperatures and a further decrease in the degree of saturation at higher osmolarity. A shift in carbon source utilization and antibiotic resistance occurred at 4 versus 24°C growth, perhaps due to changes in the membrane transport. Both isolates had excellent survival after one year of being frozen at -20°C and moderate ice nucleation activity.    To gain knowledge of the features for adaptation to low temperature and water activity, the genome of a Siberian permafrost isolate was sequenced.  Psychrobacter arcticum 273-4, a gamma-Proteobacterium grows at temperatures as low as -10°C and displays marked physiological changes under low temperature vs. mesophilic growth and in the presence of increased osmotica (salt). Differential gene expression analyses at 4°C and 22°C, using microarrays specific for the predicted genes of P. arcticum 273-4, reveal that only a few genes known to be low-temperature and salt-responsive in mesophiles and in some psychrotrophs are differentially expressed in P. arcticum. Total respiratory activity increased in the presence of salt, due to increased number of Na + dependent dehydrogenase and decarboxylase transcripts suggesting that P. arcticum has adapted for energy generation in the low temperature and low water activity of the permafrost environment. Growth in salt-amended ½ TSB leads to induction of capsule genes and a capsule is visible around cells grown at both 22 and 4°C, which could allow  P. arcticum to adhere to soil particles within the permafrost. Capsule production, lipid modification and compatible solute accumulation to balance internal osmolytes may allow P. arcticum to remain metabolically active within the low water activity of the Siberian permafrost.

T1  - Testing hypotheses about human adaptive evolution using matched molecular and phenotypic data
AN  - 305437407
AB  - Anthropological genetics and paleoanthropology traditionally occupied separate niches in the study of modern human origins, rarely cross fertilizing one another and occasionally adopting adversarial stances. This separation is unfortunate because of the critical interdependence of genetic and morphological approaches to understanding evolution. It is also completely surmountable due to the fact that there is a large body of evolutionary quantitative genetic theory available to study these problems. This dissertation includes a series of three studies demonstrating applications of evolutionary quantitative genetics to the study of the evolution of modern human phenotypes. The first study, addressed estimating the within- and among-region components of variance underlying different aspects of morphological size and shape. Only upper facial shape seemed to deviate from neutral expectations while other aspects of shape and size appear to be evolving neutrally. The second study involved comparing matrices of pairwise interpopulational genetic and phenotypic (cranial) distances in an extension of the comparative method. I used extremes of cold as a selective hypothesis. This allowed me to see which populations and which traits conformed to a neutral model of evolution and which did not. Cranial variation was largely neutral with the exception of measures of cranial breadth and nasal and facial width and height. A single population living in an extremely cold environment accounted for most of the deviations from neutrality. The third project presented a similar test of neutrality applied to the global distribution of skin pigmentation variation as measured by skin reflectometry at the 685nm wavelength. I used the same matrix comparison method as in the second project and incorporated latitude as a variable representing my selective hypothesis. The neutral model of skin evolution was rejected and the main cause of among population differentiation in skin reflectance at the global level appears to be adaptation by natural selection to local conditions consistent with adaptationist hypothesis of the selective importance of UV radiation.

T1  - Transcriptome and proteome analysis of <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</i> gene expression regulated by temperature
AN  - 305401793
AB  - Microorganisms adapted to high temperature have evolved a variety of mechanisms to survive in this environment (thermoadaptation). Biochemical studies have provided a vast array of information on thermoadaptation. For this work, a comprehensive analysis of changes in gene expression patterns was performed for a 15°C temperature difference within the Arrhenius range of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NUB3621. No differentially expressed transcripts were isolated by subtractive cloning at the defined temperatures of 50°C and 65°C. Yet, two-dimensional liquid chromatography identified 27 proteins which are upregulated and 101 proteins which are downregulated at 65°C.    Protein H2, which is upregulated at 65°C, was sequenced and its corresponding gene cloned. This gene encodes 183 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 20.3 kDa and pI of 4.64. The protein sequence shares multiple characteristics with YkuU from B. subtilis. The amount of ykuU transcript in G. stearothermophilus NUB3621 was comparable at both 50°C and 65°C. With this protein as a model, it was concluded that some temperature regulated genes are controlled by a post-transcriptional mechanism.    A 15°C temperature difference within the Arrhenius range alters expression of a family of proteins in G. stearothermophilus NUB3621. The function of these proteins and their role in cell survival at increased temperatures remains unknown. These thermoadaptation studies we have initiated with G. stearothermophilus have opened up a rather novel area of gene regulation. These studies will contribute to our understanding of how this organism has adapted and serve as a paradigm for investigations with microorganisms that exist near the extremes of planetary conditions. This is a challenging frontier of current biology that will have wide spread interest in both the scientific and the biotechnology communities.

T1  - Evolutionary changes at expanding range margins in the butterfly, <i>Pararge aegeria</i>
AN  - 305366038
AB  - In the UK, 25% of butterfly species have expanding distributions probably as a response to global warming as more habitat becomes climatically available. Predictions for future warming range from 1.4°C to 5.8°C by 2100, and it is becoming increasingly important to identify factors affecting range expansion in butterflies both currently and in the future.    In this study, some of the effects of range expansion were investigated in a British butterfly, Pararge aegeria. This study confirmed that range expansion results in an increase in dispersal capability at the expanding range margin due to the non-random colonisation by dispersers. However, this increase in dispersal resulted in a trade-off with reproduction resulting in a lower fecundity in range margin populations. Repeated founder effects during range expansion resulted in a linear decline in allozyme variation towards the range margin resulting in genetically-deficient margin populations. However, in an area with more continuous habitat, increased dispersal at the range margin was not selected for and genetic diversity remained similar despite range expansion. Warm temperatures and periods of larval starvation were also responsible for increased dispersal propensity in populations at an expanding range margin with margin populations being more sensitive to warmer temperatures and better adapted to periods of starvation compared to the core populations. This study also used computer models to investigate the importance of habitat availability and the pattern of habitat loss on range shifts. Dispersal capability and range expansion were found to decline with increasing habitat fragmentation and the pattern of habitat loss and the presence of flight behaviour proved to be important in determining range expansion. Despite increased dispersal at the range margin, it is suggested that further habitat fragmentation is likely to impede future range expansion in this species.

T1  - Thermal quality influences thermoregulation, behaviour and habitat selection at multiple scales in eastern milksnakes (<i>Lampropeltis triangulum</i>)
AN  - 305364673
AB  - Body temperature variation affects most physiological processes in terrestrial ectotherms and, therefore, can have a large effect on fitness. I studied eastern milksnakes at the northern extreme of their range, in a thermally challenging environment. Because of the particular importance of thermoregulation in thermal extremes, I hypothesized that thermal quality would influence thermoregulation, behaviour and habitat selection.    In chapter one, I demonstrated that when thermal quality decreased, milksnakes increased investment in thermoregulation, a result contrary to the central prediction of the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation. Because ecotherms obtain heat from their environment, I predicted that when thermal quality was low, milksnakes would bask more and select higher thermal habitat. Milksnakes did not alter their habitat use in response to thermal quality. They did, however, alter their behaviour and were seen basking more and concealed less when thermal quality was low.    In chapter two, my main goal was to determine if thermal quality affected habitat selection at multiple scales. Supporting my prediction, thermal quality influenced habitat selection at both the home range scale and the location scale. At both scales, milksnakes selected high thermal quality habitats (rocky outcrops, fields, and edges) and avoided low thermal quality habitat (forest). At the microhabitat scale, milksnakes selected locations with open canopy and many rocks. As a secondary objective, I tested the ability of 4 m resolution IKONOS imagery to accurately quantify habitat selection at the scale of the locations used by each snake. Although not as accurate as traditional field methods, remote sensing showed promise in measuring habitat selection at that scale.

T1  - Ecological genetics of heavy metal tolerant populations of <i>Suillus luteus</i>
AN  - 305349908
AB  - Genomic and transcriptomic aspects of the adaptation to increased environmental heavy metal concentrations were studied in relation to phenotypic observations of heavy metal tolerance in populations of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Suillus luteus. S. luteus sporocarps were collected at nine different locations in the Campine phytogeographic district (province of Limburg, Belgium). At six of these locations the soil is severely polluted with heavy metals due to past activities of several zinc smelters and phenotypic characterization, by means of in vitro growth experiments, revealed an obvious increase of the heavy metal tolerance in the populations at these sites. However, evidence for natural selection was not found at the genomic level. AFLP and microsatellite marker analyses both indicated high levels of genetic diversity within the total sample and within geographic subpopulations, but limited population differentiation. No current or past reduction of the genetic diversity of populations inhabiting polluted environments was discovered, nor was population differentiation found to be related to the environmental heavy metal pollution.    In accordance with the high level of genomic diversity revealed by the more-or-less neutral AFLP and microsatellite markers, considerable diversity was found at the level of the transcriptome by cDNA-AFLP analysis of a heavy metal tolerant and a nontolerant isolate. Although transcript profiling should be regarded as a tool for exploratory data analysis and some of the differences in expression level will be due to genetic hitchhiking and natural regulatory variation, some information was obtained about possible mechanisms that may explain the difference in tolerance level. Expression of a hydrophobin homologue, a water-repellent protein in the cell wall which is believed to protect against penetration of heavy metal containing solutions, may be partly responsible for the higher external zinc concentrations required to induce modulation of transcription in the tolerant isolate and candidate genes that may play a role in the detoxification of and cellular defense against heavy metals were identified as encoding a heat shock protein (HSP60), a putative metal transporter and several proteins involved in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.    The results of these different experiments show that heavy metal pollution has limited influence on the genetic diversity of S. luteus populations, a result that seems unlikely a priori but that has been described in several other organisms. In case of S. luteus  bottleneck events associated with the foundation of populations in polluted environments may have been prevented by the introduction of different tolerant genotypes, followed by sexual reproduction on the site and rapid evolution of the tolerance trait. Additionally, recurrent migration of tolerant genotypes that originate due to admixture in nonpolluted areas, which is very likely due to the high migration rates, may have attributed to the high levels of genetic diversity of populations in polluted habitats.

T1  - The quantitative genetic effects of small population size and environmental stress in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 305033447
AB  - The viability and persistence of natural populations may be threatened by genetic factors that accompany small population size. The principle genetic concerns associated with small population size are (i) the loss of adaptive potential and (ii) the loss of population fitness due to inbreeding depression. Experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster were used to address research questions associated with these genetic factors. Findings suggest that the loss of adaptive potential in small populations may be of equal or greater importance as inbreeding depression in maintaining population viability.    The sternopleural bristle number was used as a model quantitative trait to examine the long-term decline of adaptive potential in isolated populations and changes in adaptive potential after gene flow events. Significant declines in adaptive potential were found to occur within small populations over time, and following severe bottleneck events, losses of adaptive potential were larger than theoretically expected. In addition, it was found that the loss of adaptive potential after many generations of small population size was not completely recovered by hybridization of experimental lineages. These results are most likely due to the loss of rare alleles occurring during bottleneck events. In a separate study, it was demonstrated that levels of adaptive potential (underlying bristle number) are significantly increased by high temperature stress, and that such increases were not explainable by the direct effects of historical selection.    An analysis of male survivorship within small populations showed significant inbreeding depression for this life history trait, and demonstrated that the severity of inbreeding depression increased over the lifespan. In further experiments, factors potentially influencing inbreeding depression in small populations were investigated. It was found that high levels of ancestral inbreeding and inbreeding history significantly reduced inbreeding depression by 40% and 60%, respectively. In a separate study, the inbreeding rate was found to have no significant effect on inbreeding depression, but stressful inbreeding environments were associated with significant inbreeding depression declines of 80% or greater. Overall, strong support was obtained for the hypothesis that the effects of inbreeding depression can be limited by the purging of deleterious recessive alleles.

T1  - Seawater adaptation in juvenile green sturgeon, <i>Acipenser medirostris</i>
AN  - 305031583
AB  - Aspects of the seawater (SW) adaptation of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), an anadromous species along the Pacific Coast of North America, were examined. In their natal rivers, temperatures have changed from historic patterns. To determine the effect of elevated and cycling temperature regimes on post yolk-sac larva to early juveniles, growth rates were measured. Significant differences were found between final wet weights, total lengths (TL), and specific growth rates (24°C & cycling 19--24°C > 19°C), indicating that these temperatures do not adversely affect juveniles (∼0.1--10 g) with abundant food and oxygen. Because some salmonids show decreased swimming performance ( Ucrit) during their parr-smolt transformation, we tested the hypothesis that juvenile green sturgeon decrease U crit during their analogous ontogenetic stage. U crit increased up until the size that SW tolerance was achieved, and then either decreased or increased depending on the season. Therefore, ontogenetic and endogenous factors appear to influence swimming abilities. A salinity tolerance study was conducted to determine the earliest age/size at which SW survival was possible for short-term (72-h) and long-term (28-d) exposure. Juvenile green sturgeon salinity tolerance increased with increasing size and age, with 100% survival in 72-h exposed fish occurring by 134 days post-hatch (dph; 86 g, 266 mm TL), and 100% survival in 28-d exposed fish by 7 months in two size groups (139 g, 336 mm TL; 342 g, 434 mm TL). To determine the metabolic costs and osmoregulatory mechanisms involved in SW adaptation, sturgeon (100, 170, and 533 dph) were acclimated to salinities of <3‰, 10‰, and 33‰. There were no differences in body-mass-adjusted oxygen consumption rates, and osmo- and ionoregulatory abilities were comparable among <3‰ and 10‰ groups, and with the 533 dph 33‰ group. Na+, K+-ATPase activities increased in pyloric caeca at 33‰, presumably due to drinking and SW absorption. Gill chloride cell size increased between 100 and 170 dph, and abundance relative to wet mass decreased with increasing age/size. These results indicated an age/body size effect in hyperosmotic adaptability, and that juvenile green sturgeon most likely enter SW by 1.5 kg (75 cm TL).

T1  - Geographic and temporal patterns of evolution and extinction of brachiopods through the late Paleozoic ice age: Global and regional patterns
AN  - 304989381
AB  - The serial pattern of mass extinctions and rebounds that characterized the Paleozoic history of marine invertebrate diversity was interrupted in late Paleozoic time by a long interval of weak diversification and unusually low rates of origination and extinction. This interval of sluggish macroevolution coincided precisely with the most extensive glaciation of the Phanerozoic Era, the late Paleozoic ice age. Using a database of geographic and stratigraphic occurrences of brachiopod genera, I show that climatic conditions of the late Paleozoic ice age caused low macroevolutionary rates by altering the biogeographic composition of the global brachiopod fauna. The onset of cold and highly seasonal temperatures in late Mississippian time caused the preferential extinction of brachiopod genera with narrow latitudinal ranges, which lived primarily at low latitudes and were therefore adapted to only small seasonal temperature changes. It was not until the late Paleozoic ice age waned in middle Permian time that narrowly-distributed genera were able to re-evolve at low latitudes and return the brachiopod fauna to its pre-ice age configuration. Because latitudinal range size was correlated with temporal duration, the preponderance of widespread genera with long average durations during the ice age caused macroevolutionary rates to fall and remain low while the glacial climate persisted. These data also demonstrate the causal linkages between climate and latitudinal gradients of diversity, latitudinal range size, and macroevolutionary rates for brachiopods during late Paleozoic time, and suggest that these same factors underpin the modern latitudinal diversity gradient of marine genera.    Further analyses of brachiopod genera from Mississippian strata of the Central Appalachian basin reveal that the Late Mississippian mass extinction did not strongly select against genera because of their species diversity, regional relative abundance, body size, preferred facies, or environmental breadth. Mass extinctions in general did not select for traits known to influence background extinction rates; however, they did intensify background rates of extinction. This paradox can be reconciled for the Late Mississippian mass extinction because one trait, thermal tolerance, was amplified in importance during the glacial climate. This selective regime lasted through the glacial climate and underpinned the whole of the late Paleozoic ice age.

T1  - Knowledge based approach to waste utilisation for energy generation in Northern Ireland.
AN  - 301679916
AB  - Waste disposal has become an increasing problem in many countries. Waste recovery for energy generation is investigated within this research work using Northern Ireland as the specific example. For setting up a decision support system, different scenarios and case studies were examined as part of the knowledge acquisition. To understand the environmental effects of waste utilisation for energy purposes, combustible waste types are classified and analysed with respect to their compositions and origins. A detailed study of the waste availability in Northern Ireland is provided for assessing technological and socio-economical viabilities. Moreover, the impacts of harvesting forestry and wood residues for energy generation are elucidated.
  The information gathered from these activities is used to simulate different power plant technologies such as moving grate furnaces (MGF), circulating fluidised bed combustion plants (CFBC) and rotary kilns as well as downdraft gasifiers and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). Because of the lack of detailed operating data, the knowledge acquisition procedures were carried out using the ECLIPSE process simulation software. MGF results show the most cost-effective technology. IGCC demonstrates the best thermal conversion methods. This technology, however, is very susceptible to the feedstock properties such as moisture and incombustible content. Problematic waste types can be best processed within CFBC plants. Furthermore, the techno-economical feasibility of utilising manufacturing wastes for the internal energy supply is performed with respect to two industrial case studies.
  The results of over 154 simulations and information about 200 waste types are made available within two case libraries. In connection with the non-monotonic knowledge based system (case based reasoning), these cases are used as a decision support for assessing prospective waste to energy technologies. Some important results are schematically illustrated in terms of their case sequences. For case adaptation and extrapolation, least mean squares and artificial neural networks are used to tailor available scenarios to new situations. For assessing interactions and for case validations, multivariate methods such as self-organising maps, principal component analysis and multivariate validations are employed as part of the knowledge based system. For case optimisation, genetic algorithms are used in connection with optimal thermal processing values and desirable waste input.

T1  - Thermal acclimation processes in the grain aphid sitobion avenae (hemiptera: aphididae): characterising the effect of rapid cold hardening and seasonal acclimation on survival and movement thresholds at low temperature
AN  - 301663003
AB  - The ability of nymphs and adults of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae to rapidly cold harden and to increase cold hardiness through successive generations reared at low temperature was investigated.  Rapid cold hardening increased survival at -8°C from 20% to 80% and extended the lower lethal temperature by 3°C.  No ecological costs in terms of development, longevity or fecundity were associated with RCH.  'Seasonally' acclimating aphids by rearing at 10°C for >6 months, increased the RCH ability of aphids, and the combination of seasonal acclimation and RCH actually enhanced fitness.  The ability of this species to rapidly cold harden provides a significant survival advantage, allowing the cold hardiness of individuals to track daily changes in temperature.
  The short generation times of aphids mean that developing embryos are subject to the same environmental temperatures as their mother.  Because of this so-called 'telescoping of generations', the cold hardiness of new-born nymphs is a function of both pre- and post-natal environmental temperatures.  Rearing aphids at 10°C extended the lower lethal temperature of the population by 3°C compared to aphids reared at 20°C.  Nymphs were consistently more cold hardy than adults, with first born nymphs exhibiting greater cold hardiness than those born later in the mothers reproductive life, suggesting that low temperature exerts an intergenerational selection for increased cold tolerance, combined with a preferential investment of increased cold tolerance in first born progeny through successive generations.  
  The role of rapid and intergenerational cold hardening in the overwintering ability of Sitobion avenae are discussed with reference to the implications of global warming and the importance of this aphid as a vector of barley yellow dwarf virus.

T1  - Monitoring tropospheric composition using time of flight chemical ionisation mass spectrometric techniques
AN  - 301621510
AB  - The use of proton transfer reactions (PTR) to quantify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) occurring in a variety of environments has increased in recent years. Here a 44.4 MBq 241Am source is used to ionise water vapour generating H3O+ protonated water molecules. This thesis describes how proton transfer reaction products fed into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS), can produce simultaneous mass spectra for the entire mass range of reacting species in an experiment and produce a mass resolution m/Δm greater than 1000.   The scope of application of the investigation has been expanded to include the use of alternative chemical ionisation reagents with proton transfer reactions to form a broader based technique called chemical ionisation reaction mass spectrometry or CIRMS.   Measurements of atmospheric VOC loadings at the University of  Leicester show pronounced weekday and subdued weekend cyclic variations in atmospheric VOC loading and demonstrate the value of the equipment in monitoring Leicester's growing urban pollution.   The PTR-TOF-MS is shown to support chemical ionisation reactions using the reagents, NO+, O2+, as in earlier selected ion flow tube (SIFT) work. In experiments using a selection of commonly occurring VOCs as analytes, NO+ and, to a lesser extent, O 2+ were found to be useful alternatives reagents to H 3O+. The results obtained were similar to the SIFT work with the same reagents, but they show the influence of the increased collision energy introduced by the potential gradient applied to the drift-tube and demonstrate the advantages of the broader based CIRMS approach.   The value of switching to NO+ or O2 + as alternative chemical ionisation reagents has been demonstrated for use in the time-of-flight mass spectrometry environment.

T1  - Patterns and processes of life history variation in the smallmouth bass, <i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>
AN  - 276539238
AB  - This research explores the degree and causes of life history variation in the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu. Smallmouth bass are an interesting study species for exploring life history variation for two main reasons: (i) many populations are in various stages of colonization thereby allowing characterization of life history dynamics as a population adapts to a new environment; (ii) they show paternal care, the presence of which may modify patterns of life history response. Variability is examined over a broad scale of geographically diverse populations, between adjacent populations, and temporally within populations. Results indicate that there is a large degree of variation in somatic growth and maturation among smallmouth bass populations and that climate, food availability, and mortality are important drivers of this variation. A significant amount of the among-population differences represent a combination of plastic responses and genetic adaptation to these three forces. Among populations spread over the present North American range of the species, there is a positive relationship between temperature and early growth but the association weakens in non-native populations. On a local scale, food availability and lack of ontogenetic diet shifting appear to have driven much of the phenotypic divergence in growth and maturation between two populations introduced from a common source a century ago. Finally, the results of an individual-based model show that selective mortality can influence population dynamics, somatic growth, and evolution of maturation in a short time span. However, the addition of survival functions associated with parental care reduces the magnitude of evolutionary response. This study underscores the importance of considering population life history as dynamic and capable of showing rapid plastic and/or genetic responses to both natural and human forces.

T1  - Studies on the artificial induced parthenogenesis of Singuo red carp (Cyprinus carpio var Singuonensis)
TT  - 人工诱导兴国红鲤单性发育研究
AN  - 1027912775
AB  - Singuo red carp (Cypriinus carpio var Singuonensis) and Crucican carp（Carassius auratus gibelio） were employed to investigate the production of parthenogenesis, the development of parthenogenetic embryo were also observed. The results were as follows:
1.Viable gynogenetic diploid larvaes of Singuo red carp were acquired by thermal shock after fertilization of inactivated Crucican carp sperms with the mature eggs of Singuo red carp. The sperms of Crucian carp were inactivated by UV with the dosage of 375mJ/cm2 -750mJ/cm².Temperature shock were selected to inhabit the polar-body release in 1min -3min after fertilization, or inhabit the first cleavage in 21min-39min after fertilization , heat shock were treated at 40.5℃-41℃ for 1min-3min, cold shock at 4℃-6℃ for 20min-40min. The results showed that the optimum inactive UV-irradiation dosage of Crucican carp sperms was 500mJ /cm². The highest hatching rate of 21.7% was obtained by cold shock in 2min after fertilization to induce polar gynogenesis. When the heating shock was applied in 27min and cold shock in 30min after fertilization, the hatching rates were 1.8% and 4.3% respectively. The first treating time was basically unanimous for heat shock and cold shock, but cold shock obviously abtained more viable larveas than heat shock.According to the chromosome numbers and morphology charasteristic of larveas , the all-female inheritance were found .The offsprings were identified as the gynogenetic cloning fishes of Singuo red carp. 
2. Androgenetic diploid cloning fishes were induced by thermal shock after fertilization of inactivated Crucican carp eggs with the mature spermatozoas of Singuo red carp .When the hatching water temperature was 19℃-21℃,the eggs of crucican carp were immersed in three different ovarian fluids including EM,OF and SA.The eggs inactivated by UV with the dosages of  38mJ/cm2-190mJ/cm2.The haploid groups were merely irradiated by UV,the optimum dosage of UV treatment were determined according to the inductive percentage of haploid emryos.The groups of heat skock were exposed at 40.5℃-41℃ for 1min-3min to inhabit the first mitotic division in 24min-72min after fertilization,at intervals of 3min.The results showed that the optimum inactative outcomes of eggs were obtained when UV was used with the dosages of 76mJ/cm2 and the eggs were exposed in EM ovarian preserving fluids.The percentage of androgenetic haploid rates reache 57.2%.The times of diploidization treatment appeared two inductive heights in 24min-42min and 63min-72min after fertilization, the optimum hatching ratio of androgenetic embryos was 5.7 % when the time of heat shock were applied in 27min after fertilization.More androgenetic larvaes were obtained for the early shock than the later shock. According to the characters of androgenetic offsprings,the all-paternal morphology were found with the red homozygous recessive character, androgenetic offsprings were identified as the cloning fishes of Singuo red carp.
 3.The production of androgenetic and gynogenetic haploid ,diploid embryo of Singuo red carp artificially induced by thermal shock in 20.5℃-21.5℃,observing the morphology characteristic and the development time sequence of different embryo and comparing the embryo development with the inbred carp in succession.The results showed the morphology character of haploid embryo was similar to diploid.The androgenetic haploid developed more slowly than gynogentic haploid and showed haploid syrdrome earier. Compared with androgenetic haploid ,the gynogentic haploid have more viable embryo, the development speeds of gynogentic embryo was similar to inbreed diploid carp. Both of the two kinds of haploid embryo couldn’t hatch the normal larvaes. The hatching time sequence of three kinds of diploid embryo was different as follows: androgenetic diploid 102.2h,gynogenotic diploid 78.5h and inbred carp 76.2h respectively. Androgenetic diploid embryo appeared obvious stagnantment at blastula stage and dosure of blastopore stage with two long-time development stage. The embryonic development of gynogenetic diploid kept basically pace with the inbreed carp.The hatching accumulated temperature of three kinds of diploid were androgenetic carp 1813.5[℃.h],gynogentic carp 1520.0[℃.h] and inbred carp 1455.6[℃.h] respectively , and indicated that parthenogenetic diploid embryo needed more hatching accumulated temperature.Alternate abstract:本文以兴国红鲤 （Cyprinus carpio var Singuonensis）和银鲫（Crucican carp）为材料，探讨了人工诱导兴国红鲤单性发育的不同途径，同时对单性胚胎发育进行了研究。主要结论如下：
1.银鲫精子经紫外线照射后与兴国红鲤卵子受精，再进行休克处理使染色体加倍，获得兴国红鲤雌核发育二倍体。具体方法是：银鲫精子在紫外线照射剂量375 mJ/cm2-750mJ/cm²，水温20.5℃-21.5℃,分别在受精后1min-3min、受精后21min-39min进行休克处理阻止第二极体排出或抑制第一次有丝分裂，热休克采取40.5℃-41℃处理1min-3min，冷休克4℃-6℃处理20min-40min,结果表明：UV照射剂量为500mJ/cm²（照射时间20min）对银鲫精子获得最佳灭活效果。受精后2min热休克或冷休克处理，可以诱导出极体雌核发育后代，分别获得10.3%和21.7%的出苗率；受精后27min进行热休克或受精后30min冷休克处理，可成功诱导出有丝分裂雌核发育后代,分别获得1.8%和4.3%的出苗率。极体雌核发育比有丝分裂雌核发育得到更多诱导成活后代，冷休克诱导效果优于热休克。雌核发育后代经染色体数目和形态学鉴定，与母本兴国红鲤表型一致。
2.银鲫卵子遗传失活与兴国红鲤成熟精子受精后经热休克处理，获得雄核发育二倍体克隆鱼。UV以38mJ/cm2-190mJ/cm2剂量分别照射浸泡在3种不同卵子保存液中的银鲫卵子，孵化水温19℃-21℃时，受精后24min-72min（每3min为一个梯度）进行热休克处理，将受精卵置于40.5℃-41℃温水中处理2min，以阻止第一次有丝分裂。结果表明：UV照射剂量为76mJ/cm2、使用EM卵子保存液时卵子获最佳灭活效果，单倍体诱导率达到57.2%；二倍化休克处理的时间在距受精后24min-42min和 63min-72min出现二个诱导高峰，其中受精后27min获得20h时胚胎存活率47.3%和出苗率5.7%。经过形态学和染色体数目鉴定，诱导后代与父本兴国红鲤表型一致。  
3.热休克人工诱导出兴国红鲤雄核发育、雌核发育单倍体、二倍体胚胎，在水温20.5℃-21.5℃下连续观察各种胚胎发育的时序及形态变化特征，并与鲤自交后代胚胎发育进行比较。结果发现：单倍体胚胎与二倍体胚胎的各期形态特征相似，发育时序延迟。雄核发育单倍体发育速度慢于雌核发育单倍体，更早出现单倍体综合症。雌核发育单倍体发育速度与自交二倍体相似，出膜前期大量胚胎死于单倍体综合症。二种单倍体胚胎均无正常后代孵出。雄核发育二倍体，雌核发育二倍体和鲤鱼自交二倍体胚胎发育至孵出历时分别为102.2h、78.5h、76.2h。雄核发育二倍体胚胎在囊胚期和胚孔期存在二次较长时间的发育停滞。雌核发育二倍体胚胎发育速度与自交二倍体基本同步，出膜前期大量胚胎发育异常而死亡。三种二倍体的孵化积温依次为雄核鲤1813.7(℃.h)，雌核鲤1520.0(℃.h)，自交鲤1455.6(℃.h)，说明单性发育胚胎需要更多的孵化积温。

T1  - A New Dynamical Evolutionary Algorithm Based on the Entropy and its Application
TT  - 基于熵的动力学演化算法及其应用
AN  - 1026920580
AB  - Evolutionary Algorithm (EAs) gets inspiration from natural evolution and adaptation. Its fundamental principles are the survival of the fittest and the evolution in nature. It is a searching method owing the parallel, random and robust characteristics. In comparison with traditional methods, because of owing many superior properties, and no need of knowing additional information like glad and derivative, Evolutionary Algorithm can get many good results when dealing with some complex or non-linear problems.
 
Nowadays, researchers in evolutionary computation pay much attention on the natural inspired computation, which suggests that we can employ some natural principles from natural sciences and the natural world to propose new computational models and methods. In this thesis, after the introduction of the EAs, a new dynamical evolutionary algorithm is proposed based on principle of minimal free energy from the statistical mechanics. This work is to indicate a new way or a new method in the research of EAs. 

The population of EAs is looked as a dynamical system or a particle system and those individuals are looked as particles. Based on the famous principle of minimal free energy and the knowledge of information theory, a new selection and acceptance strategy is defined. After the definition of the entropy of the particle system, the law of entropy increment is applied to control the algorithm running. In this process, the diversity of the population can be kept well. Meanwhile, by utilizing the temperature method of the Simulated Annealing Algorithm, the weight of the diversity would be decreased during the running of the computing for the purpose of quickly converging.

The new algorithm is used to solve some global optimal problems and satisfactory numerical results are achieved. The results show it is good at keeping diversity of the system during the searching process, which gives us the confidence that the dynamical evolutionary algorithm is of some valuable performance for further research.

The new dynamical evolutionary algorithm is also improved to use to solve some hard works, the multi-objectives optimization problems (MOP). The new models are built for some constrained MOPs. The good performance can be also got from the numerical experiments. Further research work on dynamical evolutionary algorithm is hoped under what we have done in this thesis.Alternate abstract:演化算法是一种借鉴生物界自然选择和进化机制发展起来的高度并行、随机、自适应搜索算法。与传统的优化方法相比，它具有普适性、鲁棒性、隐含并行性和自组织等智能特性，不需要知道更多的额外信息如梯度和导数的情况，并且通常能获得更好的结果。由于这些特性，演化算法特别适应于处理传统搜索算法解决不好的复杂的和非线性问题。
在现今的演化算法的研究中，学科之间的交叉以及将一些基础科学中的理论原则用于描述算法过程的方法得到了越来越多的重视。本文在介绍了演化算法的基本方法的基础上，就提出了一种基于统计力学中自由能极小化原理的新的动力学演化算法，为演化算法的研究提供新的途径。
本文将演化计算中的个体种群看作是统计力学中的一个粒子系统，根据著名的自由能极小化原理和信息论的知识，我们定义了一个新的选择接收策略。在给出了粒子系统的熵的计算方法后，利用熵增原理来控制整个程序的执行过程。利用能量变小而熵增加的原理，在算法的整个进化过程中较好地保持了种群的收敛性和多样性。同时，利用模拟退火算法的温度策略对我们的熵增过程进行温度控制，通过调解温度参数，是得多样性的权重在整个进化过程中逐渐减小，从而能更快地收敛到最优解。
在应用问题中，新的动力学演化算法被用于解决一些单目标全局优化问题，我们也得到了一些满意的解。数值结果显示出，算法能在搜索过程中很好地保持系统的多样性，从而避免过早收敛。
我们还将新的动力学演化算法应用于现今研究比较热门的领域，比如多目标优化问题。通过在单目标动力学演化算法的基础上进行改进，新的动力学演化算法在解决多目标优化问题的时候也取得了较好的结果。动力学演化算法的良好性能也让我们期待更加深入的研究。它为演化算法的研究加入了新的想法，也开辟了新的途径。

T1  - Several applied basic studies on main Trichogramma species for application in biological control in China
TT  - 我国主要应用赤眼蜂种的若干应用基础研究
AN  - 1026553630
AB  - Egg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma are widely used in biological control against Lepidopterous pests. In considering future development of biological control, the focus should be placed on the applied basic research and the development of some key technologies. However, an insufficiency of basic research on Trichogramma wasps in China shows unconformity with its leading place in the world on application. This paper based on the present state of Trichogramma research, used main Trichogramma species of researching and applying in China as the studying target, aimed at key issues on influence of environmental factors in field, cold storage, species identification and non-target effect, studied concretely effects of high temperature shocks on Trichogramma dendrolomi reared on Antheraea pernyi eggs, effect of pollen of regular cotton and transgenic Cry1Ac+CpTI cotton on reproduction and survival of the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma chilonis, effects of cold storage on T. dendrolomi reared on A. eggs , system and application of molecular identification based on species-specific primers for important Trichogramma species in China, prefenence of Trichogramma dendrolimi and Trichogramma chilonis for eggs of predatory insects. The main results were summarized as follows:1 Effects of high temperature shocks on Trichogramma dendrolomi reared on Antheraea pernyi eggsTrichogramma wasps reared on Antheraea pernyi eggs have been widely used throughout China as biological control agent against some pests. However, in certain regions, high temperature prevailing in summer is suspected to execute a negative influence on the parasitoids. To simulate these adverse conditions, we applied single heat shocks (35℃ and 40℃) for 6 hours to middle stage and late stage of pupae of Trichogramma dendrolomi, and recorded the percentages of adult emergence rate, number of wasps per host egg, female ratio and longevity as well as the number of wasps with parasitization, percent emergence, number of wasps per host egg and female ratio in the next generation. The results showed the susceptibility of both middle stage and late stage of pupae to high temperature shocks, especially at 40℃. At this temperature, percent emergence and number of wasps per host egg were substantially reduced, and especially when the parasitoids experienced the high temperature shocks at late pupal stage, they nearly failed to achieve any emergence. For the progeny generation, all parameters as a whole seem to be little affected by the heat shock experienced in the parent generation.2 Effect of Pollen of regular cotton and transgenic Cry1Ac+CpTI cotton on reproduction and survival of the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma chilonisThe availability and quality of food played an important role in determing the effectiveness of parasitoids as control agents. The effects of pollen of regular cotton and transgenic Cry1Ac+CpTI cotton as a food source for Trichogramma chilonis were assessed in the laboratory by investigating paratization rate, prgeny survival and sex ratio. The results of this study under laboratory conditions are then considered in relation to determine whether pollen availability is likely to be an important factor in field performance and whether transgenic cotton pollen could affect survival and reproduction of T. chilonis. Females fed on a suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water lived as long as those fed on water alone or urfed, but significantly shorter than than those fed on honey alone and suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in honey, either with or without eggs rice moth (Corcyra cephalonica). T. chilonis females fed on suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in honey parasitized and produced significantly more eggs, offspring and males than those fed on honey or water alone, suspention of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water and unfed. T. chilonis females fed on honey parasitized and produced significantly more eggs, offsping and males than those fed on suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water, water alone and unfed. No significant differences were found among those feeding on suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water, water alone and unfed. The longevity, numbers of parasitized eggs, progeny survival and sex ratio of T. chilonis fed on suspension of pollen of transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water or honey did not differ significantly from those fed on suspension of pollen of regular cotton in water or 10% honey. Pollen and honey supplied a complete diet for reproduction and survival of T. chilonis and transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton pollen did not affect T. chilonis.3 Effects of cold storage on Trichogramma dendrolomi reared on Antheraea pernyi eggsTrichogramma wasps reared on Antheraea pernyi eggs have been widely used throughout China as biological control agent against some pests. Cold storage can permit more effective commercial rearing, transportation and inundative releasing of Trichogramma spp.. The effects of storage temperature (4℃, 7℃, 10℃ and 13℃), stage (egg, larva, prepupa and pupa) and time (2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks) were investigated on Trichogramma dendrolimi reared in A. pernyi eggs, by comparing percentages of adult emergence rate, number of wasps per host egg and female ratio in different combination. The results showed storage temperature, stage and time and interactions between these three factors substantially reduced the percentages of adult emergence rate, number of wasps per host egg, but not lowed female ratio. Among all stored temperatures, T. dendrolimi was susceptive to 10℃, its emergence was greatly impacted by this temperature, therefore was considered as unfavorable temperature for long-time storage. T. dendrolimi was not susceptive to 7℃ comparatively, which is favorable temperature for long-time storage. Favorable storage stage for long-term storage was different with temperatures (4℃ and 7℃). Larva and pupa stage at 4℃ and egg and pupa stage at 7℃ was found to be the most appropriate stage for storage, resulting in little adverse effects on the percentages of adult emergence rate and number of wasps per host egg. Compared to 25℃ controls, egg stage storage at 7℃ based on the percentages of adult emergence rate and pupa stage storage at 4℃ based on number of wasps per host egg were optimal cold storage conditions for T. dendrolimi reared on Antheraea pernyi eggs. 4 System and application of molecular identification based on species-specific primers for important Trichogramma species in ChinaSpecies-specific primers of Trichogramma chilonis, T. evanescens, T. ostriniae, T. brassicae, T. embryophagum, T. cacoeciae has been designed based on their rDNA- ITS2 sequence in this paper, and the specific primers of T. dendrolimi, T. ostriniae and the genus Trichogramma were retrieved from previously published articles. All of the specific primers were then applied to identification of multiple Trichogramma and host eggs samples through PCR assays. The results showed that our methods could produce clear, unique and reproducible target DNA bands from individual adult wasp. Furthermore, the species-specific primer-based results were fully consistent with those derived from morphological-based ones. So it can be concluded that molecular identification of the four important Trichogramma species in China, namely T. dendrolimi, T. chilonis, T. evanescens and T. ostriniae, and three exotic Trichogramma species, namely T. brassicae, T. embryophagum, T. cacoeciae can be realized by using the above-described diagnostic primers.The success or failure of application and research on Trichogramma spp. could depend on the investigate of endoparaitism and species in field. The identification of Trichogramma wasps remains very difficult owing to its minuteness, indistinguishable morphology and susceptibility to hosts and environment. Molecular identification technology based on species-specific primers was applied on (1) detecting of parasitism on sentinel eggs, in four treatments of Trichogramma spp. on controlling Helicoverpa armigera in cotton field; (2) identification of samples collecting from corn field. The results show that: (1) 6 and 9 eggs parasitized by T. dendrolimi were found in cotton fields with T. dendrolimi and combination of T. dendrolimi and T. chilonis released, and none of parasitized eggs were found in field with T. chilonis and T. brassicae released or control; (2) 114 samples from corn field all were indentified as T. ostriniae with 98.25% accuracy. The above results indicate that molecular assay may be used as high-efficiency tool on efficacy of biocontrol and investigation in field. Furthermore, limits and prospects of molecular identificaton basen species-specific primers were discussed.5 Prefenence of Trichogramma dendrolimi and Trichogramma chilonis for eggs of predatory insectsThe acceptability and suitability of eggs of five predatory insects to parasitization by Trichogramma were observed under no choice and choice situations in the laboratory. The results from no choice experiments showed that both T. denrolimi and T. chilonis could parasitize and emerge from Chrysoperla sinica and Chrysopa septempunctata, but could not parasitize Propylaea japonica, Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata. In choice experiments, T. denrolimi substantially preferred eggs of C. sinica to the target host Ostrinia furnacalis as indicated by both contacts with host eggs and the number of eggs laid in the hosts. Trichogramma chilonis also contacted and parasitized more eggs of C. sinica than eggs of the target host Helicoverpa armigera, but the difference was not significant. In both parasitoids, there was no significant difference in number of wasps per host egg, female ratio of progeny and percentages of wasps with parasitization between target host and C. sinica.Alternate abstract:赤眼蜂属是生物防治中广泛用来防治鳞翅目害虫的一类重要天敌昆虫。应用基础研究及某些关键技术的研究是生物防治学科发展的主体。我国赤眼蜂的应用虽已步入世界先进行列，但基础研究不足，与我国的世界赤眼蜂应用大国身份不符。本论文基于国内外研究现状，以我国主要研究应用的蜂种为研究对象，结合实际生产和应用需求，针对与赤眼蜂应用密切相关的田间环境因子的影响、贮存、分类鉴定和非靶标效应等问题，具体开展了5项基础研究，旨在为推动我国赤眼蜂应用提供相应依据及科学工具。主要结果如下：1 高温冲击对柞蚕卵繁殖赤眼蜂的影响我国普遍应用柞蚕卵繁殖和大量释放赤眼蜂防治多种农林害虫。然而，某些地区夏季高温可能会对其产生负面影响。为此，研究了柞蚕卵繁殖的松毛虫赤眼蜂于蛹中期和蛹后期经历6h35℃和6h40℃高温单次冲击处理，对当代羽化出蜂率、单卵出蜂数、单卵雌蜂比、寿命等4个指标和处理子代有效繁殖个体数、羽化率、单卵出蜂数、单卵雌蜂比等4个指标的影响。研究结果表明，当松毛虫赤眼蜂处于蛹中期阶段和蛹后期阶段，在处理当代易受高温冲击影响，尤以40℃高温不利影响明显，主要表现在羽化出蜂率、单卵出蜂数两指标明显降低，其中蛹后期经历6h40℃高温冲击后，几乎不能继续发育羽化；而总体来看高温冲击对子代蜂各指标未表现出明显影响。2 常规棉花粉和转Cry1Ac+CpTI棉花粉对螟黄赤眼蜂繁殖和存活的影响在室内评价了常规棉花粉和转Cry1Ac+CpTI棉（Bt棉）花粉通过不同处理方式作为食物源对螟黄赤眼蜂寿命、寄生卵数、子代羽化数和性比等繁殖和存活特征的影响。共设计7个饲喂处理，即不饲喂（UNFED）、水（W）、水+常规棉花粉（W+P）、水+Bt棉花粉（W+BtP）、10%蜂蜜水（H）、10%蜂蜜水+常规棉花粉（H+P）和10%蜂蜜水+转Bt棉花粉（H+BtP）。在提供或不提供米蛾卵条件下，经W+P或W+BtP饲喂的雌蜂寿命与W或UNFED间无显著差异，但均显著短于H和H+P或H+BtP饲喂的雌蜂，而经H+P或H+BtP饲喂的雌蜂寿命又均显著长于经H饲喂的雌蜂。比较每雌寄生卵数和子代羽化数来看，各处理明显分为3类，即UNFED、W、W+P和W+BtP为最低，H为居中，H+P和H+BtP为最高。比较每雌子代性比来看，各处理也明显分为3类，即H、H+P和H+BtP为最低，W+P和W+BtP为居中，UNFED和W为最高。饲喂W+P和W+BtP的雌蜂寿命、寄生卵粒数、子代羽化数和性比分别与W+BtP和H+BtP饲喂间无显著差异。棉花花粉与蜂蜜组合成为螟黄赤眼蜂实现其最大存活和繁殖力的食物；初步表明Bt棉花粉对螟黄赤眼蜂无影响。3 冷贮对柞蚕卵繁殖赤眼蜂的影响柞蚕卵繁殖的松毛虫赤眼蜂是我国最主要的生防产品，冷贮有助于其商品化生产、运输和释放应用。为了全面评价冷贮对柞蚕卵繁殖赤眼蜂的影响，作者采用柞蚕卵为寄主，以贮存温度（4℃、7℃、10℃和13℃）、贮存虫期（卵、幼虫、预蛹和蛹期）和贮存时间（2周、4周、6周和8周）为参试因子，研究了冷贮对松毛虫赤眼蜂羽化出蜂率、单卵出蜂数、单卵雌蜂比的影响。结果表明，三个因素均可单独和互作显著降低羽化出蜂率和单卵出蜂数，尤以贮存虫期的影响更为明显；但三个因素对单卵出蜂性比影响不大。综合各虫期对低温的反应，松毛虫赤眼蜂对10℃反应敏感，各虫期羽化出蜂率和单卵出蜂数明显降低，不适宜长期冷贮，对7℃反应相对较不敏感，最适宜长期贮存。适宜长期冷贮温度（4℃和7℃）条件下，适宜贮存虫期有所不同。在4℃条件下，为幼虫期和蛹期，7℃条件下为卵期和蛹期，羽化出峰率和单卵出蜂数相对其他虫期受冷贮不利影响较小。从对羽化出蜂率的影响来看，于卵期7℃下冷贮为最适宜；从对单卵出蜂数的影响来看，于蛹期在4℃和7℃为适宜。4 我国主要应用蜂种的分子鉴定体系及其应用根据螟黄赤眼蜂rDNA-ITS2序列设计了螟黄赤眼蜂、广赤眼蜂、玉米螟赤眼蜂及外引蜂种甘蓝夜蛾赤眼蜂、食胚赤眼蜂和卷蛾赤眼蜂的特异引物，同时采用文献中发表的松毛虫赤眼蜂和玉米螟赤眼蜂的特异引物以及赤眼蜂属特异引物对赤眼蜂成虫及寄主卵样品进行了PCR特异扩增分析。结果表明，采用上述特异引物可从单头蜂稳定地扩增出明显的目的DNA条带，并且分子鉴定结果与形态学鉴定结果完全吻合。因此，采用上述特异引物可以实现对我国4种重要赤眼蜂种，即松毛虫赤眼蜂、螟黄赤眼蜂和玉米螟赤眼蜂，及3种外引蜂种甘蓝夜蛾赤眼蜂、食胚赤眼蜂或卷蛾赤眼蜂的分子鉴定，形成了我国主要研究与应用蜂种的分子鉴定体系。客观评估赤眼蜂的田间控害作用及蜂种调查是赤眼蜂研究与应用中的重要环节。赤眼蜂体小，近缘种间形态难辨，难以鉴定雌蜂和幼期虫态，给上述问题的研究带来很大困难。本研究采用基于诊断引物的分子鉴定技术研究：（1）4种赤眼蜂放蜂防治棉田棉铃虫处理田间寄生率；（2）玉米田蜂种优势度。研究表明：（1）对照区无寄生，松毛虫放蜂区寄生9粒，松毛虫赤眼蜂和螟黄赤眼蜂混合放蜂区寄生6粒，螟黄赤眼蜂放蜂区和甘蓝夜蛾放蜂区未见寄生，采回的寄生卵经诊断引物Td596f/Td596r检测，结果均为松毛虫赤眼蜂；（2）采自玉米田间114个样品经诊断引物TrichF/ToR545检测，结果均为玉米螟赤眼蜂，一轮操作鉴定成功率达98.25%。上述结果确证，我们所构建的分子鉴定体系，可应用于大规模的田间生防效力评估和蜂种调查。5 两种赤眼蜂对捕食性天敌卵的选择性在室内采用非选择性和选择性方法，研究了松毛虫赤眼蜂和螟黄赤眼蜂对5种捕食性天敌卵的选择性。结果表明, 两种赤眼蜂均可寄生中华通草蛉和大草蛉卵，并成功在卵内完成发育；但均不寄生龟纹瓢虫、异色瓢虫和七星瓢虫。同时面临防治靶标和草蛉卵时，两种赤眼蜂均选择寄生草蛉卵，但嗜好程度存在明显差异。松毛虫赤眼蜂对中华通草蛉卵的接触次数和寄生粒数显著要多于亚洲玉米螟卵；螟黄赤眼蜂对中华通草蛉卵的接触次数和寄生粒数也多于棉铃虫卵，但未达显著水平。在子代性比、每寄主出蜂数和寄生雌蜂百分率几项指标上，两种赤眼蜂在各自靶标和中华通草蛉之间均差异不显著。

T1  - Geologic characterization and modeling of the updip basement ridge play of the Smackover Formation in the Vocation and Appleton Field areas, southwest Alabama
AN  - 305209874
AB  - The Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) Smackover Formation is one of the most prolific oil and gas producers in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico coastal plain. In the Conecuh and Manila Sub-basins, in southwest Alabama, shallow marine carbonate deposits of the Smackover Formation accumulated on local Paleozoic crystalline basement highs, defining the Smackover updip basement ridge play. In this geologic setting, Smackover accumulation occurred in four depositional packages that are easily identifiable in well logs: (1) shallow sub-wave base level, (2) microbial reefs, (3) shoreface/shoal/lagoon, and (4) tidal flat/sabkha. The distribution of the depositional environments has been illustrated in three-dimensional geologic models for the Vocation and Appleton Field areas.    Smackover deposits have been affected by diagenetic events that have modified their petrophysical properties. Pervasive dolomitization is the most important diagenetic event from the point of view of hydrocarbon exploration. This early diagenetic process increased the permeability of rocks by connecting the pore system through the generation of intercrystalline porosity. Nonetheless, the original depositional fabric of the rock is the main control on the location of Smackover reservoirs. High quality reservoir rocks consist of thrombolite doloboundstone that identifies large microbial buildups, and ooid, oncoid dolograinstone to dolopackstone deposited in shoal and shoreface environments. A third type of reservoir is crystalline dolostone, which is primarily diagenetic in origin.    The Smackover depositional sequence occurred during a transgressive-regressive cycle. In marginal areas proximal to its updip pinchout, Smackover accumulation was the result of the complex interaction of several regional and global variables (eustasy and tectonic/thermal subsidence), in addition to local factors such as paleotopography and carbonate productivity, which is strongly related to the environmental conditions.    The exploration strategy in this oil play has to be oriented toward the location of basement structures thorough extensive gravimetric and/or magnetometric studies. The development of 3-D seismic surveys can then be focused on the identified basement paleohighs to improve the interpretation of their geometry, to determine if the Smackover Formation is completely or only partially covering the structure, and to search for the location of large microbial buildups.

T1  - Population genetics of accessory gland proteins and male-female post-mating interactions in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 305208339
AB  - It has been argued that male-female post-mating interactions drive rapid divergence of reproductive proteins between populations, leading to reproductive isolation and speciation. Here I report on three studies of Drosophila melanogaster populations that aim to shed light on the role of post-mating interactions in reproductive protein evolution, population divergence, the evolutionary processes that influence postmating interactions, and the potential genetic mechanism involved in the evolutionary processes. First I tested the hypothesis of rapid inter-population divergence of reproductive proteins by comparing a pair of populations reported to be undergoing sympatric speciation in Evolution Canyon, Israel. Contrary to expectations, I found no evidence of genetic differentiation between the two populations. I also conducted mate choice tests to determine if populations mate assortatively, as had been suggested by previous work. There was no significant departure from random mating in mixtures of flies from the two populations. I concluded that these two populations are not experiencing incipient sympatric speciation. Secondly, I tested for the influence of four evolutionary effects (sexual conflict, sexual selection by cryptic female choice, temperature-dependent selection, and inbreeding avoidance) on post-mating interactions using a pair of allopatric populations and a pair of temperature-selected lines. I demonstrate that relatedness of mates is a key determinant of male-female post-mating interactions by suppressing offspring productivity of singly mated females. This supports the post-mating inbreeding avoidance hypothesis. Lastly, I investigated two candidate reproductive protein loci (Acps) for their role in post-mating inbreeding avoidance and recognition of relatedness. Females from a U.S. population were crossed to males from an Israel population and matched for the same or different  Acp genotype. After controlling for the effect of intrinsic male differences on offspring productivity, I found a significant association between lowered female fecundity and the similarity of the female and male at one of the Acp loci, Acp29AB. This is a novel finding that locus Acp29AB is involved in mediating the recognition of relatedness necessary for post-mating inbreeding avoidance in  D. melanogaster.

T1  - Interspecific hybridization between sympatric coastal cutthroat and coastal rainbow/steelhead trout on Vancouver Island, British Columbia: A conservation and evolutionary examination
AN  - 305173023
AB  - Sympatric coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki ) and coastal rainbow/steelhead trout (O. mykiss irideus ) are thought to be reproductively isolated primarily by spatial and temporal separation. However, interspecific hybridization has been documented, thus raising the questions of how widespread hybridization is within their native range, and what are the nature and status of reproductive isolating mechanisms (i.e. prezygotic or postzygotic) in the hybridizing sympatric populations?    In a broad survey of 37 populations on Vancouver Island, hybridization between these trout species was found to be widespread (Chapter 2). The frequency of hybridization varied among locations (HI = 3%–88%; II = 2%–54%), with some populations displaying hybrid levels indicative of hybrid swarms and may be undergoing ‘hybrid meltdown’. Several environmental factors appear to influence hybridization (e.g. forest harvesting, stocking, habitat availability, watershed size), however, no single factor appears to have a dominant effect.    There is no consistent evidence for selection acting against first-generation (F1) hybrids, and in backcross hybrids inconsistent results implicate environment-dependent (i.e. extrinsic) selection (Chapter 3). Hybridization is reciprocal, but nuclear marker patterns show that the direction of hybridization is unidirectional in some populations (n = 5 out of 13 populations). Based on cytonuclear disequilibrium levels, a remarkable reproductive bias appears to exist (i.e. frequency of backcross hybrids with matched nuclear-mitochondrial marker composition exceeded mismatched genotypes). Selection against mismatch genotypes may be occurring, although a behavioural mating bias is more likely.

T1  - Environmental factors influencing weed interference in agricultural systems
AN  - 305164409
AB  - In all agricultural systems using few or no herbicides, cultural and mechanical techniques are crucial to economic viability. Further advances in non-chemical weed control will require in-depth knowledge of weed biology. The objective of new strategies likely will be to alter competitive interactions between crop and weed species.    An important part of weed biology, and often the basis for competitiveness, is species response to the environment. Environmental conditions differ greatly in different parts of the world. In agricultural systems, the low nitrogen status of some soils requires most crops to be amended. Weed populations can experience a wide range of fertilization regimes from year to year due to different crop rotations. Fertilization patterns in a rotation can lead to differential growth and reproductive performance of weeds and competitiveness with crops. In research described in the first two chapters, we attempt to determine the extent that lowering parental nutrition would impact weed growth, reproduction, and offspring vigor. The purpose was to begin evaluating benefits of controlling nitrogen fertility in agronomic systems on low fertility soils.    Another environmental factor that could influence weed competitiveness is temperature. The significance of temperature responses will become increasingly important in the future. Global climate change models are predicting increases in the earth's average surface temperature between 1.4–5.8°C during the 21st century. As temperatures increase it is conceivable that warmer temperatures will alter competitive balance between crop and weed species, intensifying weed pressures. The expression of temperature response also will be a function of other interacting factors such as the ability to acquire water and nutrients. Resource acquisition is controlled to a large extent by root growth and interactions with soil microorganisms. The third chapter of this thesis is focused on temperature responses of selected plant species from an agroecological system. The purpose was to begin assessment of possible climate change effects on weed competitiveness. All of our experiments made extensive use of the weed Senna obtusifolia  due to its importance in crops in the Southeastern U.S.

T1  - Mechanisms of coexistence in the sympatric lizards, <i>Ctenotus robustus</i> and <i>Ctenotus taeniolatus</i> (Scincidae) on the sand -mined coastal dunes of Port Stephens-Myall Lakes
AN  - 305100734
AB  - This study examined mechanisms of coexistence in Ctenotus robustus  and C. taeniolatus on sand-mined dunes in the Port Stephens-Myall Lakes region, south eastern Australia. Ctenotus robustus  and C. taeniolatus coexisted in medium vegetation, but C. taeniolatus were rare in or absent from open vegetation and C. robustus rare in or absent from dense vegetation. With regeneration from open to dense vegetation: canopy cover, litter mass, and understorey patchiness increased; and patchiness of litter decreased.    Ctenotus robustus attained larger snout-vent lengths (SVL) than  C. taeniolatus. Sexes hatched at similar sizes but SVL at maturity was smaller for males than females. Relative to SVL, both species showed male-larger sexual dimorphism and C. robustus were heavier with a larger head than C. taeniolatus. However, all morphological differences were small. Growth was faster in more open vegetation, and juvenile  C. robustus grew faster than juvenile C. taeniolatus. Only male C. taeniolatus showed potential to breed within 12 months of hatching. However, larger size at first breeding may have been an advantage due to intraspecific interactions, and increased clutch size with SVL.    Ctenotus taeniolatus selected lower laboratory temperatures and cooler microhabitat (0–50% time from 0800–1600 h > 40°C) in medium vegetation than C. robustus. In open vegetation  C. robustus used the relatively uncommon cooler microhabitats which were hotter than equivalent microhabitats in medium vegetation. Ctenotus taeniolatus survived on open vegetation when competitive effects of C. robustus were reduced. However, reduced residency times and lack of breeding showed that open vegetation was less suitable for  C. taeniolatus than medium or dense vegetation. Removal of  C. robustus from medium vegetation resulted in an influx of  C. taeniolatus and improvement in their body condition. Removal of  C. taeniolatus from medium vegetation increased residency times of  C. robustus (probably juveniles) However, slower growth of  C. robustus in medium vegetation suggested that it was less suitable habitat than open vegetation. In dense vegetation hotter microhabitats (75–100% time from 0800–1600 h > 40°C) were uncommon and cooler than equivalent microhabitat in medium or open vegetation. Competitive effects from C. taeniolatus prevented juvenile C. robustus  using dense vegetation but dense vegetation did not provide suitable habitat for adult C. robustus.    Overall, thermal requirements seemed more important than the relatively weak competitive effects. However, the two are likely to have interacted to determine pattern of distribution of C. robustus and  C. taeniolatus across the vegetation regeneration states.

AN  - 305093537
AB  - This study focuses on the purposes for literacy that people of southern West Virginia have constructed during their lifetimes. Although it is concerned with the literacy histories of people who were born and raised in southern West Virginia, it primarily focuses on the connection between that literacy history and the economic and cultural history of southern West Virginia. By studying three families and three generations within those families, the study constructs an historical perspective of the economic and cultural changes this region has endured and works to illuminate the effect these changes have had on literacy development.    This study should be considered a “local narrative” of literacy rather than a “little narrative.” The term “local narrative” places more emphasis on the importance of geography in constructing people's literacy practices. The goal for this study is to uncover some of the purposes of vernacular literacy practices for the people in West Virginia. This study examines the ways that the context of southern West Virginia has constructed purposes for people's everyday reading and writing, and what people think and feel about those purposes.    The primary methodology used to collect the field texts was interviewing. One member from three different generations of three different families was interviewed. Eleven different life-history interviews were conducted. To ensure their validity, they were recorded, with the subject's permission, as well as transcribed, and field notes were also taken.    The completed study features three case studies of the families. The categories that Barton and Hamilton (1998) identified in Local Literacies: Reading and Writing in One Community describe themes that held true across the case studies. The lists for literacy uses that Shirley Brice Heath (1983) constructed in Ways with Words: Language, Life, and Work in Communities and Classrooms and Denny Taylor and Catherine Dorsey-Gaines (1988) constructed in Growing Up Literate: Learning from Inner-City Families also held true across the case studies. This study adds three different categories to these three lists: popular-culture reading, as well as personal-improvement reading and writing.

T1  - Evolutionary changes at expanding range margins in the butterfly, <i>Pararge aegeria.</i>
AN  - 301626437
AB  - In the UK, 25% of butterfly species have expanding distributions probably as a response to global warming as more habitat becomes climatically available.  Predictions for future warming range from 1.4ºC to 5.8ºC by 2100, and it is becoming increasingly important to identify factors affecting range expansion in butterflies both currently and in the future.
  In this study, some of the effects of range expansion were investigated in a British butterfly, Pararge aegeria.  This study confirmed that range expansion results in an increase in dispersal capability at the expanding range margin due to the non-random colonisation by dispersers.  However, this increase in dispersal resulted in a trade-off with reproduction resulting in a lower fecundity in range margin populations.  Repeated founder effects during range expansion resulted in a linear decline in allozyme variation towards the range margin resulting in genetically-deficient margin populations.  However, in an area with more continuous habitat, increased dispersal at the range margin was not selected for and genetic diversity remained similar despite range expansion.  Warm temperatures and periods of larval starvation were also responsible for increased dispersal propensity in populations at an expanding range margin with margin populations being more sensitive to warmer temperatures and better adapted to periods of starvation compared to the core populations.  This study also used computer models to investigate the importance of habitat availability and the pattern of habitat loss on range shifts.  Dispersal capability and range expansion were found to decline with increasing habitat fragmentation and the pattern of habitat loss and the presence of flight behaviour proved to be important in determining range expansion.  Despite increased dispersal at the range margin, it is suggested that further habitat fragmentation is likely to impede future range expansion in this species.

T1  - Evolutionary genetics of the land snail <i>Cepaea nemoralis</i> in the Central Pyrenees
AN  - 1504825825
AB  - The pattern of life is a discontinuous one: both fossils and modem taxa show a clustering of forms separated by gaps. Evolutionary theory explains these gaps by relatively rapid transitions happening long ago, leaving few identifiable intermediates. One mechanism for this 'punctuated equilibrium' process suggests that these dramatic changes take place in small isolated populations at the edges of a species' range. This notion was tested in the land snail Cepaea nemoralis in the French and Spanish Pyrenees. Geographical patterns of genetic differentiation in enzyme polymorphisms ('molecular area effects') suggest that the population was once fractured into smaller units which, after a process of genetic disruption, recolonised their original range. The interface between two of these areas was mapped by an analysis of enzyme polymorphisms. Pure populations and their hybrids were then compared for adaptational differences (shell and body colour, thermal behaviour and mortality rates), and for reproductive isolation (as calculated by estimates of selection against hybrids from the enzyme dine width using field determinations of dispersal rate). No significant adaptive differentiation or reproductive barrier could be established between the two molecular areas. Instead, the same processes of adaptation seem to have taken place within the areas, in response to altitude and insolation. Furthermore, I investigated the possibility of a hybrid advantage effect taking place within the zone of hybridisation, where mean shell size is larger, resulting in more eggs being laid. Hybrid genotypes are thus likely to disperse faster than those of the pure types, dissipating the genetic differentiation between area effects more quickly than by random mixing. Present day selection is unlikely to determine the pattem of molecular area effects, as they do not coincide with geological, climatic, and vegetational discontinuities. Rather, they are relics of history, arising from the expansion of glacial refuges. The dynamics of this process were investigated by tracking vegetation patterns from ancient pollen cores, and by an analysis of mtDNA and enzyme variant distribution. The results of this study counter the expectations of the proposed mechanism of punctuated equilibrium. They are a reminder that, for most of the time, living organisms are robust to dramatic evolutionary change.

T1  - Evolution and plasticity of body size of <i>Drosophila</i> in response to temperature
AN  - 1502060666
AB  - Ectotherm body size is positively correlated with latitude, giving rise to body size clines, found in different continents. Ectotherm body size also shows a developmental response to temperature, increasing at lower developmental temperatures. To investigate the effects of temperature in the evolution and plasticity of body size dines, I used two species of the genus Drosophila as model organisms. To investigate the cellular mechanism underlying the evolution of wing size clines the two newly established D. subobscura wing size clines in the Americas were compared with the ancestral European dine. Clinal differences in Europe and South America were due to changes in cell number, whereas clinal differences in North America are due to changes in cell area. These results suggest that the cellular mechanism underlying the establishment of wing size clines is contingent and not predictable. The genetic control of body size in the D. melanogaster South American body size cline was investigated by means of QTL mapping. The results found in South America were consistent with those previously found in Australia, and in both continents the inversion In(3R)P was associated QTL controlling wing area. Genes of the insulin signalling pathway, known to affect size, were characterized in their effects under different temperature and larval crowding regimes. The evolution of plasticity of body size traits was analysed using different thermal selection regimes. The phenotypic plasticity of wing size and its cellular components was examined by rearing flies, selected under fixed or variable thermal environments, at two different experimental temperatures. Plasticity of wing size did not vary among the different selection lines, however, plasticity of both cellular components of body size did. Costs and benefits of adaptation to cyclical thermal environments were assessed with larval competition assays and by assessing size when all lines were reared under cyclic thermal conditions.

But neutral protein, such as insulin, does not response to anions. It was found that HSO4-, IO4-, ClO4-, H2PO4-, HCO3- and AcO- have strong affinity to interact with HEWL under present condition, but HSO3-, NO3-, Cl- and F- could not be trapped by HEWL.

T1  - The effects of hypohydration on selected physiological responses in healthy smokers and nonsmokers during exercise

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effects of hypohydration on cardiovascular responses, fatigue, and metabolic responses in healthy male cigarette smokers (S) and male nonsmokers (NS) during long duration, submaximal exercise. Variables measured were heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, rating of perceived exertion, tympanic temperature, relative oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate, and blood glucose. Eight untrained male S (M ± SD: age 25.8 ± 5.3; VO2PEAK  34.9 ± 7.6) and eleven untrained male NS (M ± SD: age 25.6 ± 3.4; VO2PEAK 31.8 ± 5.4) participated in the study. Subjects performed 60 minutes of cycle exercise at 50% VO2PEAK  under a euhydrated treatment and hypohydrated treatment. The order of treatments was random and a time period of at least three days separated the treatments. Both treatments were performed in a temperature-controlled environment of 23 to 25 degrees Celsius. Hypohydration induced by controlled sauna exposure and fluid restriction the night prior to testing yielded percent body weight reductions for S and NS of 2.2 ± 0.6 and 2.4 ± 0.5 respectively. Physiological measurements were recorded at rest, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes of exercise. Response variables “Δ” (hypohydrated minus euhydrated) were compared using repeated measures ANCOVA for group (S and NS) and time (rest, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes). Additionally, steady state measurements for variables were determined by averaging values recorded at 30, 45, and 60 minutes of exercise. Steady state response variables “Δ” (hypohydrated minus euhydrated) were compared between groups using 2-sample t-tests. Paired t-tests were used to make within-group comparisons. Smokers demonstrated significantly higher Δ glucose values over time,  F(5,85) = 2.86, p < .05. Pairwise comparisons indicated that at five, t(85) = 2.52, p < .05, and 45, t(85) = 2.03,  p < .05) minutes of exercise, Δ glucose values for the smoking group were significantly (p < .05) higher than those for the nonsmoking group. Two-sample and paired t-tests comparing steady state measurements indicated no significant differences for any variables. The results from this study suggest that healthy male cigarette smokers and male nonsmokers have similar responses to submaximal exercise performed at room temperature in a mild hypohydrated state.

T1  - A genetic analysis of the adaptation to high temperature in selected lines of <i>Escherichia coli</i>
AN  - 305340191
AB  - Dissecting the genetic basis of adaptation has long challenged biologists, but the advent of high-density array technology makes the genetic and molecular characterization of adaptation possible. Using six lines of experimentally evolved populations of Escherichia coli grown for 2000 generations at high temperature (42°C), the genetic and molecular basis of adaptation was studied at the levels of gene copy number and gene expression. A total of 5 duplication and deletion events occurred in three independently derived lines during the adaptation to high temperature. The remaining three lines had no detectable gene duplication and deletions events. In one case, the same region of the chromosome was duplicated in all three lines and in this region of common duplication are a number of candidate genes known to play a role in stress and stationary phase survival. At the level of gene expression,  a priori candidate genes, the heat-inducible genes, exhibited significantly different patterns of expression in three evolved lines relative to their ancestor. Genome wide measures of the transcriptome in a subset of three lines indicate that evolutionary changes in the expression of heat inducible genes in the extracytoplasmic stress response play an integral role in high temperature adaptation. Overall, heat inducible genes were significantly more likely than non-candidate genes to exhibit significant evolutionary expression changes. A genome wide examination of evolved changes in expression reveals that for each line a large portion of the genome (5%) experiences expression changes, however this is only slightly more than expected due to chance alone. A total of thirty-nine genes, 92% more than expected due to chance alone, show at least moderate levels of evolutionary replicability across independently derived lines. In comparison, adaptation at the level of functional groups is slightly more replicable suggesting that selection may work to modify overall function as opposed to the expression level of individual genes. In total, these studies begin to uncover the complicated and heterogeneous ways to achieve high temperature adaptation in bacteria.

T1  - Phytate utilization by <i>Tetrahymena</i>
AN  - 305334548
AB  - Phytate, myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, is the storage form of phosphate in seeds and grains and is a major form of environmental phosphate loading from fertilizer inputs and agricultural runoff. Little is known about the effects of phytate on heterotrophic protozoa. Members of the genus  Tetrahymena were chosen as the model organisms for this study because of their wide geographic distribution and adaptability. I found that  Tetrahymena can use phytate as their sole phosphate source when grown in comparable concentrations to cells grown in media containing orthophosphate. The internal phytate concentration increases dramatically during the logarithmic phase of growth and then decreases during the stationary phase. These internal levels are as much as 10-fold greater for T. vorax than those for cells grown in phosphate and no phytate, suggesting diet as a main source of accumulation. Results for similar assays on T. thermophila showed comparable internal levels, whether cells were grown in phytate or phosphate. Multiple potential phytases were identified by gel activity assays. A 170 kDa phytase was found associated with the pellicle. This phytase is located in the cell membrane facing the exterior of the cell. A pH optimum of 5.0–5.5 and temperature optimum 55°C for the pellicle phytase is similar to known phytases of microbial and plant origin. Potential inhibitors and substrates were also investigated.

T1  - Size variation and fitness consequences in age 0 westslope cutthroat trout
AN  - 305328736
AB  - Phenotypic diversity is an important component of ecological diversity in fishes, potentially leading to divergence and speciation via local adaptation stabilizing populations in variable environments. Although benefits of being large are well documented, size variation may have benefits as well. Understanding the spatial distribution of size variation across important productivity gradients will contribute to understanding of relationships between inland salmonids and their environment. For age 0 westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi) in the Coeur d'Alene basin, Idaho, I found most size variation to occur at the broadest scale studied (10km2) associated with temperature and productivity gradients. Instream habitat variables but not age 0 size structure differed between wide and narrow valley streams. At the stream reach scale, habitats occupied by large and small age 0 cutthroat trout differed, but at the habitat unit scale, units occupied by homogeneously-versus heterogeneously-sized individuals did not differ. Maintenance of population abundance and diversity may depend on diverse habitats at the reach scale whereas maintenance of meaningful habitat complexity may depend on management at the stream scale. I used the growth record available in sagittal otoliths to examine overwinter size selective mortality and phenotypic adaptations in two streams that differed in temperature. I found overwinter selection for growth rate in 2001–02 but not in 2000–01. Direction of selection was different in the two streams, favored fast growth in the warm stream and slow growth in the cold stream. Fish in the warmer stream varied more in emergence timing whereas fish in the colder stream showed compensatory growth characteristics that reduced intrapopulation size variation and increased average size. Populations at the extremes of critical environmental gradients may be less variable and therefore more sensitive and less resilient to disturbance, but may also represent intraspecific diversity that is important to conserve. Conservation of intraspecific variation will likely require the maintenance of high quality habitats across multiple gradients, including landform, temperature, and productivity, and across the spatial scales at which those gradients occur.

T1  - Life history influences the genetic structure of populations of Fundulus heteroclitus, Menidia menidia, and Geukensia demissa in a PCB-contaminated estuary, New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts, United States
AN  - 305322874
AB  - Genetic diversity is essential for the long-term persistence of a population or species because it is required for adaptation to environmental change. Exposure to toxic chemicals causes directional selection that reduces genetic diversity, potentially leaving populations unable to adapt to future environmental change. The life history of a species, particularly patterns of migration and dispersal, strongly influences the distribution of genetic variation among populations. This research was conducted to determine whether populations of species with distinct life histories in New Bedford Harbor (NBH), MA, an estuary contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), exhibit a loss of genetic diversity or altered genetic structure.    Populations of two marine fishes, the non-migratory Fundulus heteroclitus and the migratory Menidia menidia, and one bivalve, Geukensia demissa, were sampled at sites in and around NBH. Allele frequencies at enzymatic loci were used to assess genetic structure and diversity. Selection experiments using PCB 126 were conducted with the fishes to determine if genetic patterns at field sites could be attributed to contaminants.    Although F. heteroclitus populations inhabiting NBH are highly resistant to the effects of PCBs, no relationship between allozyme patterns and contamination or PCB-tolerance was detected. However, genetic distance among populations was strongly related to geographic distance among sites. Menidia menidia surviving embryonic exposure to PCB 126 in laboratory selection experiments were distinct from controls at one enzymatic locus, phosphoglucomutase (PGM*). Juveniles of this species collected from NBH exhibited genotypic frequencies significantly different from those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium conditions, suggesting a correlation between PGM* genotype and tolerance to PCB exposure.    Allele frequencies among populations of G. demissa were homogeneous at all loci except the leucine aminopeptidase (LAP*) locus, but it is likely that this resulted from local differences in temperature and/or salinity. The smallest size class had higher heterozygosity at a malate dehydrogenase (MDH-2*) locus, but patterns were similar between sites inside and outside NBH, and, therefore, were not attributed to contaminants.    The results of this study indicate neither significant loss of genetic diversity nor alteration of allele frequencies for populations of these species in NBH, but genetic patterns clearly reflected differences in life history.

T1  - Regulatory evolution of Hsp70 in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 305294132
AB  - The research described in this thesis aims to elucidate adaptive evolution of Hsp70 expression in Drosophila melanogaster. First I analyze heat shock transcription factor (HSF) activation in  D. melanogaster lines that have been evolving in the laboratory at different temperatures for several years. These populations have evolved differences in Hsp70 expression and thermotolerance levels, and I show that the magnitude and time course of HSF activation also differ among these lines. Thus, HSF activation can evolve rapidly and likely plays an important role in the evolution of the heat shock response. Second, I describe three D. melanogaster  populations that are polymorphic for transposable element (TE) insertions that disrupt the promoter of the hsp70Ba gene. These insertions alter Hsp70 expression, inducible thermotolerance, and fecundity, suggesting that TEs can create intraspecific variation in gene expression that selection can act upon. Indeed, that the TEs have inserted within the same region of the hsp70 promoter and have common phenotypic and fitness effects suggests that these insertions represent a general mechanism through which selection manipulates hsp70 gene expression. Third, I characterize an additional TE that disrupts an hsp70 promoter—in this case the hsp70Bb gene. This TE provides additional evidence that the hsp70 promoters are vulnerable to such insertions. I directly test the consequences of all 4 TEs in a common genetic background, and show that each of the TEs reduces reporter gene expression after heat shock and 3 of the insertions significantly reduce heat-inducibility of the  hsp70 promoter. This thesis constitutes the first elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of Hsp70 expression in  Drosophila. Further, it is one of few studies to show that TEs—which are often deleterious or neutral—can also have positive fitness consequences and in natural populations. Finally, in characterizing the nucleotide sequence variants that underlie intraspecific changes in gene expression, organismal phenotype and fitness, this dissertation sheds light on the process of adaptive regulatory evolution.

T1  - Charmonium production in heavy -ion collisions
AN  - 305260287
AB  - We investigate the production of charmonia in collisions of heavy nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies. We first construct a two-component model of charmonium production in heavy-ion collisions, which includes (i) early hard J/ψ production coupled with nuclear, Quark-Gluon Plasma and Hadron Gas suppression and (ii) statistical production of J/ψ's by coalescence of c and  c¯ at the hadronization transition. We present a new calculation of J/ψ interactions in the QGP and both components are evaluated within a common thermal evolution scenario. Available data on  J/ψ production at CERN-SPS and BNL-RHIC energies are reasonably well reproduced, although the ψ′/ψ ratio indicates that ψ′ hadronic suppression is underestimated. We then improve our approach to account for in-medium effects on open and hidden charm states, inferred from recent lattice QCD results. Within a kinetic theory framework, we solve rate equations for charmoniurn abundances during the course of a heavy-ion collision. The survival of J/ψ states above the phase transition temperature Tc favors their recreation in the QGP. In-medium effects in the hadronic phase, possibly linked to the (partial) restoration of chiral symmetry, largely resolve earlier identified discrepancies in the ψ′/ψ ratio.

T1  - Evolution of cadmium resistance in <i>Daphnia magna</i>
AN  - 305235980
AB  - A diverse population of Daphnia magna Straus was formed in the laboratory by combining individuals from eight sources (48-hour EC50s from cadmium toxicity tests with these eight groups ranged from 26 to >120 μg/L). Selection for increased resistance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium was accomplished by determining the cadmium EC50 value, exposing neonates to that concentration for 48 hours, raising the survivors in cultures without cadmium, and using their offspring to repeat the procedure. After eight generations, this selection process increased the mean EC50 from 61 μg/L to 180 μg/L cadmium. No differences in life span, offspring production, time to first brood, number of offspring in the first brood, or the intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were observed between the cadmium-adapted population and the control under ideal conditions or conditions of temperature or feeding ration stress, but cadmium-adapted daphnids were smaller. The absence of differences between the two populations other than size suggests a lack of metabolic cost for the increased resistance. Gel electrophoresis indicated the presence of metallothionein, a metal binding protein, in daphnids. Because metallothionein is an inducible protein, the lack of apparent metabolic cost might be explained if elevated concentrations of metallothionein are only produced during cadmium exposure, when increased metabolic costs would be offset by greater survival probability. The EC50 values for the control and cadmium-adapted populations were not different during acute toxicity tests with copper or malathion, but the cadmium-adapted population was less sensitive to lead and more sensitive to phenol. Amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of DNA showed a decrease in genetic diversity in the cadmium-adapted population based on the number of polymorphic markers and the calculated gene diversity, and this loss of diversity was reflected in reduced slopes of the concentration-response curves during cadmium toxicity tests. Although the evolved resistance would allow the adapted population to exist in areas where cadmium concentrations would be toxic to control daphnids, the decreased genetic diversity, smaller size, and increased sensitivity to at least one other toxicant would likely reduce the probability of long-term survival, even in the absence of future cadmium exposure.

T1  - Effects of temperature on the behaviour and life-history traits of two species of temperate grasshopper. (BL: DXN070008)
AN  - 301647617
AB  - The nymphal and adult life-history traits of three ecotypes of Chorthippus brunneus, representing a cline in climate continentality, were monitored at four ambient rearing temperatures, ranging from 25 to 40oC.  Significant genotype-environment interactions showed evidence of counter-gradient selection.  Ecotype responses were interpreted as evidence of local adaptation to thermal conditions.  Fitness values were calculated for each ecotype in respect to rearing temperatures.
  The relative nymphal and adult life-history trait responses, of three C. brunneus ecotypes, to an increase in ambient temperature versus an addition of radiant heat were compared.  Contrary to predictions, ecotypes showed a co-gradient response in thermoregulatory ability in respect to thermal conditions.  The results are discussed in respect to trade-offs in thermoregulation.
  The effects of the nutritional environment on the nymphal and adult life-history trait responses of C. brunneus to an increase in radiant heat were assessed.  Responses to an increase in radiant heat were greater on the higher quality food.  However, compensatory mechanisms on the low food quality diet, including an extended ovipositioning period, reduced variation in reproduction output between the two diets.
  The reasons for Orthoptera's notable exception to Bergmann's rule are explored.  Using a deterministic model, based on data collected in previous chapters, I tested three possible hypotheses for this phenomenon.  The model suggests that differential plasticity of potential clutch size and potential clutch number, in respect to temperature, is the most likely explanation for reduced size at maturity in colder environments.
  The local movements of Chorthippus albomarginatus were assessed in the field and were significantly correlated to temperature.  A random walk model was constructed and parameterised with the data collected.  Step movements were derived from a skewed distribution.  The effects of a rise in temperature on rates of dispersal are predicted.

T1  - Natural history of the Gila monster in Nevada
AN  - 250186599
AB  - Aspects of the natural history of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) were investigated in southern Nevada. A model was developed to describe attributes of the habitat where Gila monsters are found in southern Nevada by comparing reported localities against elevation and structural geology variables. The most suitable habitat in southern Nevada is located in low elevation areas (400–1200 m) with relatively complex geologic structure. Gila monsters were also studied over two seasons at a single field site using radio-telemetry to investigate activity, thermal biology, refuge selection, hibernation, and home range. Gila monsters were most active in late May and early June. They generally maintained lower body temperatures than do other diurnal lizard species in this area by remaining in underground refugia for most of the year. Refuge site selection differed among seasons and was influenced primarily by the above-ground thermal environment. Gila monsters in Nevada typically travel over twice as far as Gila monsters in southwestern Utah. Nevada Gila monsters also had larger home ranges than those from either southwestern Utah or western New Mexico, even though the Nevada lizards are significantly smaller in body size.

T1  - Research of Carbon Sink Capacity Caused by Rock Weathering Process in China
TT  - 中国岩石风化对大气CO2的汇效应研究
AN  - 1027907417
AB  - Rock weathering caused by the carbonic acid reaction with minerals to produce dissolved bicarbonates which are carried by rivers to the oceans is an important part in carbon cycle. The process causes significant carbon dioxide consumption, the accurate calculation of which may partly explains the missing sink of carbon and may do some contribution to the research in Global Change. 
The CO2 uptake by carbonate dissolution (which is also called karstification) on the continents is counterbalanced by the CO2 release by carbonate precipitation in the ocean. The same is not true for silicate weathering. Silicate weathering is more important than carbonate weathering as a long-term control on atmospheric CO2.
Rock weathering is controlled by a great range of factors which includes rock property, climatic conditions, CO2 concentration in atmosphere/soil, vegetation and so on. Analyses of the influences of factors to rock weathering show that sometimes the weathering process may be controlled mainly by one factor, but in most cases rock weathering is controlled by all factors integratedly.
A global erosion model (GEM-CO2) developed by Amiotte Suchet allows to calculate the flux of atmospheric/soil CO2 consumed by chemical erosion of continental rocks. In the thesis, the CO2 consumption by rock weathering in China is estimated based on GEM-CO2 and the Chinese Resources and Environment Database, and its distribution is show in a GRID map with a spatial resolution of 1000m*1000m. The total carbon consumption is about 4.72*107TC/a, about 52.65% of which are caused by carbonate and 47.35% of which are caused by silicate. The model results are close to previous estimation by other researches. The flux of CO2 consumed by rock weathering increases where carbonate rock outcrops are more abundant and when drainage intensity increases. The results show that the main consumption of CO2 is localized in Guangxi province, Guizhou province, Chongqin, North Hubei province, and Southwest of Hunan province, because of large area with a high proportion of carbonate rocks and high humidity.
Karstification is a good connector of Geological processes and Biological processes. Many methods are tried in order to accurately estimate the karst solutional speed and then the CO2 consumption by karstification, such as analyzing elements in river, dissolution kinetics, dissolution survey experiments and so on. In the thesis, the karst solutional speed is estimated by a model. Analyses of the influences of some factors to karstification get following conclusions: 1.Temperature and precipitaion are main climatic factors involving in karstification. There is an obvious positive correlation between the karst solutional speed and precipitation. But it’s not the same between the karst solutional speed and temperature. Temperature influences karstification in a more complex way; 2.Biological processes influences karstification through increasing the acidity of water by metabolic outcome, and then accelerating the reaction between water and rock and hastening the releasing of Calcium element from soil. The intensity of biological process can be assessed with the value of NPP(Net Primary Productivity); 3.As part of reactor, the soil CO2 drives karstification, which can be verified by the positive correlation between the concentration of [HCO3－] in river or in spring and the CO2 concentration in soil. There is a positive correlation between the intensity of soil respiration and the CO2 concentration in soil.Based on above knowledge and data from continuous experiments and observations, a karst solutional speed model in tropic and subtropical zone in China is developed to describe the relationship between karst solutional speed and temperature, precipitation, NPP, and intensity of soil respiration. The data was non-dimensionized to improve the comparability of different parameters. The archetype of the model was selected with Response Surface Analysis. The effect of correlations between independent factors was analyzed. And the regression equation was worked out. Statistical test show that the adj.r-square of the model is 0.9171 and the significant level is 99.5%. The forecasting karst solutional speed values by the model are close to the observational data. So the model is highly significant. 
 
The model was applied in Zhujiang Drainage Basin which is located in subtropical zone. The data of distribution of temperature and precipitation were produced based on observed data in weather stations climate interpolation and through interpolating and topographty rectifying. The data of distribution of NPP and soil respiration intensity were produced by TEPC model (Tessrestrial Ecosystem Production process model in China). Then the distribution of karst solutional speed in Zhujiang Drainage Basin is calculated with the model and the environmental data. The karst solutional speeds estimated by above models are close to the estimations by different models.Alternate abstract:岩石的风化作用同时参与了短时间尺度和长时间尺度的全球碳循环，科学揭示岩石风化对碳循环影响的机制和程度，对于全球碳循环研究、全球变化研究有重要意义，不仅可以部分地解决“遗漏汇”问题，还能为完善碳循环模型作贡献。
本文首先评述了当前岩溶、岩石风化以及碳循环的研究现状和存在问题，探讨了硅酸盐岩和碳酸盐岩在不同时间尺度上的碳汇意义，全面分析了影响岩石风化的多种因素及其控制机理。针对传统岩溶研究在区域尺度研究上的不足，将遥感和GIS方法引入数据获取、处理及分析过程中，实现了数据和研究成果从点源向区域面上的尺度转化。为此，作者详细讨论了从多波段遥感数据提取地质信息以及空间数据的插值、订正等方法，并进行了相应的实验研究。
在此基础上，作者一方面依据成熟的GEM-CO2模型，对中国的岩石风化的碳汇效应进行了完整而全面的估算，对其空间分布格局进行了深入分析，填补了我国在岩石风化的碳汇效应估算方面的空白；另一方面，作者基于桂林岩溶试验场十余年来的连续定点观测数据，选取平均气温、降水、土壤呼吸和NPP为影响因素，经过观测数据的极差标准化，基于反应面分析模型的模型原型选择；变量的共线性诊断；及参数估计与显著性分析等过程，建立了碳酸盐岩溶蚀速率模型。显著性检验表明，该模型具有良好的拟合优度，并且99.5％的显著性水平下仍然显著成立。为将此模型推广应用到珠江流域，使用遥感数据和TEPC模型计算得到珠江流域NPP以及土壤呼吸强度数据。同时利用本文第三章计算的气候数据，最终计算得到中国珠江流域的溶蚀率以及碳汇的空间分布及值域。对热带亚热带岩溶的典型区域－珠江流域岩溶作用的碳汇效应进行的实验表明：珠江流域年溶蚀量为8159612.303t碳酸钙，碳979153.48t，其中1/2的碳，约489576.74t来自大气或土壤CO2。通过和其它模型的对比，各模型估算的结果数量级相同，说明本文建立的热带亚热带岩溶区溶蚀率模型是可信的。

T1  - Temperature-dependent sex determination and the evolutionary potential for sex ratio in the painted turtle, <i>Chrysemys picta</i>
AN  - 305585826
AB  - Many reptiles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a sex-determining mechanism in which the incubation environment permanently determines offspring sex. This research had two main objectives: (1) to evaluate the roles of two traits (nesting behavior by females and offspring sex ratios in response to thermal incubation conditions) thought to be important for maintaining sex ratios in this system, using the painted turtle ( Chrysemys picta), and (2) evaluate the adaptive significance of TSD in a genotypic sex determining system (GSD).    Observations on the nesting behavior of painted turtles suggest that either females in this population do not use soil surface temperature as a cue for selecting nest sites, or select sites with intermediate soil surface temperatures that may be less likely to bias sex ratios.    Geographic comparisons from two populations of C. picta inhabiting differing climates (Illinois and New Mexico) demonstrated that the New Mexico population exhibited a significantly higher pivotal temperature (temperature producing a 1:1 sex ratio) than the Illinois population. However, this difference was small compared to differences in climatic conditions experienced by the populations.    Chrysemys picta nests from Illinois and New Mexico experienced similar nest temperatures despite a relatively hot year in New Mexico. Nests in New Mexico were not laid in sites most likely to reduce nest temperatures, but instead at sites experiencing high soil moisture, which indirectly reduced nest temperatures.    In simulation models, pivotal temperatures evolved more rapidly than did nest-site choice by females in response to perturbed sex ratios. Natal philopatry to nest sites also caused maladaptive nesting behavior in terms of Fisherian sex ratio selection.    Simulation models demonstrated that TSD invades populations exhibiting GSD and reaches fixation through several avenues that do not include a widely accepted adaptive function for TSD (the Charnov-Bull model).    Results from these studies suggest that the likelihood of TSD being relatively neutral compared to GSD in reptiles deserves more attention. Consequently, selection for female behavior and offspring thermal sensitivity to adaptively adjust sex ratios may be fairly weak. This conclusion is supported by the small observed differences in pivotal temperatures and lack of strong patterns of thermally-based nest-site selection.

T1  - The genetic architecture of <i>Drosophila</i> sensory bristle number
AN  - 305566276
AB  - We mapped QTL effects on the X and third chromosomes affecting Drosophila bristle number, to describe quantitative variation in terms of complex genetics, rather than statistically. Recombinant inbred mapping populations for each chromosome were derived by crossing lines selected for low or high sternopleural or abdominal bristle number to a standard inbred strain with wild type bristle numbers ( Sam). Recombination breakpoints were determined using polymorphic  roo transposable element insertion sites. In order to estimate additive and dominance QTL effects, as well as QTL × environment interaction, each RI line was crossed to Sam and the other parental strain, and the progeny were raised in three temperatures: 18, 25, 28 degrees Celsius.    Bristle number QTL were mapped separately for each chromosome, trait and environment, using composite interval mapping. A total of 142 QTL were mapped for sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, pooled over all six mapping populations, three temperature environments, and two sexes. Generally the effects of the QTL were moderately large.    QTL effects were often sex- and environment-specific. The significance of QTL × sex, QTL × temperature interactions and epistatic (QTL × QTL) interactions was determined by analysis of variance, with the significance level determined using Bonferroni correction. Interactions with sex and temperature were common for QTL affecting both sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, but were more frequent for the latter trait. There were 30 (9.0%) and 25 (11.0%) significant epistatic interactions affecting sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, respectively, after Bonferroni correction.    Comparisons made between the six populations showed a total of 53 individual QTL, of which 11 mapped to the X and 42 to the third chromosome. A total of 33 and 31 QTL were found to affect sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, respectively; of these 11 QTL affected both bristle traits. Many of the QTL mapped to the same location as candidate bristle development loci, but several QTL regions did not encompass obvious candidate genes.
