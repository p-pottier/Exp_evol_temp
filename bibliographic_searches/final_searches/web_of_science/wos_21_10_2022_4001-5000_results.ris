AB  - The thermal management of electronics is becoming an increasing concern as industry continues to simultaneously push performance while shrinking the size of electronic devices. Microchannel cooling is a promising technology to accommodate the heat dissipation rates and associated fluxes projected for future generations of electronics while also satisfying the need for a reduced footprint to accommodate ever-shrinking device sizes. One shortfall of microchannel cooling, however, is the large pressure drop associated with pumping liquids through microchannels, i.e., channels in which the smallest dimension is between about I micron and I mm. Superhydrophobic surfaces combine roughness features with low surface energy coatings to create materials with substantially decreased wettability and drag resistance in laminar flows and represent a promising technology for reducing the flow resistance of microchannels. The presence of an (insulating) air layer that is trapped within the superhydrophobic surface, and which separates the microchannel wall from the working fluid, gives rise to a low shear-stress region responsible for the observed reduction in flow resistance. There have been a limited number of studies on the fluid mechanics in superhydrophobic microchannels and, to our knowledge, heat transfer has not been examined. Quantifying the trade-off between the enhanced heat transfer due to pressure drop reduction versus the insulating characteristics of the air layer is of paramount importance for determining the viability of superhydrophobic surfaces as a technology for enhancing microchannel heat transfer. In this work we compute friction factors and Nusselt numbers for the fully-developed (with respect to energy and momentum) flow of a fluid in a parallel-plane microchannel with different heat flux and momentum boundary conditions at the upper and lower channel walls. Two approximations are taken for modeling the superhydrophobic microchannel. In the first case we study the single-phase flow of a fluid in a microchannel where one or both microchannel walls is assumed to be superhydrophobic and where the superhydrophobicity is modeled via application of Navier's slip model at the microchannel wall. Solutions for the velocity profiles are then employed to calculate theoretical friction factors and Nusselt numbers for the constant heat flux condition. This analysis is then extended to examine the implications on the thermal resistance of a superhydrophobic surface due to the presence of a purely conductive air layer. In the second case we model the fluid flow in the presence of a recirculating air layer that separates the fluid from the microchannel wall. In this instance the low-viscosity air layer gives rise to apparent fluid slip for the working fluid which is dependant on the thickness of the air layer and the viscosity ratio of the two working fluids. This case represents an upper apparent-slip limit as the characteristic spacing of the surface roughness becomes large relative to the channel height and air-layer thickness.

AB  - Armyworm Mythimna separata larvae show changes in cuticle darkening depending on population densities and are roughly categorized into two phenotypes, a pale brown solitary type and black-colored gregarious type. Although the color difference in both larval types is apparent, it remains ambiguous whether any change in physiological traits accompanies the cuticle darkening. To answer this query, we repeated genetic selection of the blackness phenotype over one hundred generations in our laboratory colony and produced a black-colored (BL) strain. Comparison between non-selected control (CTL) and BL strains revealed an increased fecundity and adult life span in the BL strain compared with the CTL strain. In contrast, BL strain larvae were found to be significantly more sensitive to heat stress than those in the CTL strain. Hemolymph reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were higher in the BL strain than in the CTL strain under both non-stress and heat stress conditions. Antioxidant activities of the hemolymph were not significantly different between the two strains under nonstress condition, but the activities increased to higher levels in the CTL strain than those in the BL strain after heat stress. Activities and gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the fat body were significantly higher in CTL strain larvae than in BL strain larvae after heat treatment. Thermal stress tolerance of the offspring of crossings between the two strains showed a tolerance level almost equivalent to the maternal one: the cross between CTL females and BL males produced offspring with the higher tolerance compared with the oppositely crossed offspring. Expression levels of the antioxidant enzyme genes of the former offspring were found to be similar to those of CTL strain. These results indicate a trade-off between reproductive activity and stress resistance: the BL strain had acquired high reproductivity but had lost stress tolerance through repeated genetic selection. Furthermore, the present genetic analyses demonstrated that the phenotype of stress tolerance is derived from the maternal parent.

AB  - A 2D coupled Cellular Automaton (CA)-Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model has been developed to simulate grain structure evolution during powder-bed-based, layer by layer, additive manufacturing (AM). The presented model includes algorithms for random powder layer generation, electron beam energy absorption, evaporation, capillarity and wetting, meltpool dynamics, its temperature evolution and face centered cubic grain solidification. The model is first validated against the experimental findings of single track electron beam melting and solidification of a baseplate and then applied to simulate the grain structure produced during AM. Influence of the hatching strategy on grain structure is presented as well as stray grain formation resulting from partially molten powder particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bacteria living within the surface mucus layer of corals compete for nutrients and space. A number of stresses affect the outcome of this competition. The interactions between native microorganisms and opportunistic pathogens largely determine the coral holobiont's overall health and fitness. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that commensal bacteria isolated from the mucus layer of a healthy elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, are capable of inhibition of opportunistic pathogens, Vibrio shiloi AK1 and Vibrio coralliilyticus. These vibrios are known to cause disease in corals and their virulence is temperature dependent. Elevated temperature (30 degrees C) increased the cell numbers of one commensal and both Vibrio pathogens in monocultures. We further tested the hypothesis that elevated temperature favors pathogenic organisms by simultaneously increasing the fitness of vibrios and decreasing the fitness of commensals by measuring growth of each species within a co-culture over the course of 1 week. In competition experiments between vibrios and commensals, the proportion of Vibrio spp. increased significantly under elevated temperature. We finished by investigating several temperature-dependent mechanisms that could influence co-culture differences via changes in competitive fitness. The ability of Vibrio spp. to utilize glycoproteins found in A. palmata mucus increased or remained stable when exposed to elevated temperature, while commensals' tended to decrease utilization. In both vibrios and commensals, protease activity increased at 30 degrees C, while chiA expression increased under elevated temperatures for Vibrio spp. These results provide insight into potential mechanisms through which elevated temperature may select for pathogenic bacterial dominance and lead to disease or a decrease in coral fitness.

AB  - The life cycle of Lethocerus deyrollei (Vuillefroy) in Sayo-cho, Hyogo, Japan (35 degrees 00' N, 134 degrees 21' E), was studied in terms of flight, reproduction, and energy allocation as well as developmental zero (t(0)) and required heat units (K) for a generation. Counts of bugs attracted to electric lighting showed that L. deyrollei flew most frequently in July, the second half of the mating season. The weight of aight muscle showed no significant yearly change despite a conspicuous difference in the aight activities. Fat content in the abdomen was low during summer, when oviposition activity reached a high level in females. Thereafter, lipid accumulation increased to mid-October when aight to an overwintering site took place. The lipid reservoir in late summer may be critical for surviving winter but no significant decrease was observed during overwintering. The number of eggs in the ovary indicated univoltism because no females had mature eggs late in the year. t(0) and K were calculated based on laboratory rearing at different temperatures. Thus, estimated K(635 degree days) and local heat mass suggest a univoltine life cycle in Sayo-cho. The possible areas for successful inoculation of L. deyrollei were examined on the basis of available heat mass and day length in places where the species is extinct or not observed. Based on the estimated K and critical day length for reproductive maturation, Niigata and Tokyo fulfill suitable conditions of the Sayo population to complete a univoltine life cycle.

AB  - Soft electronics have garnered considerable attention as a promising alternative to conventional electronics with fixed shapes and sizes because of their facile and intimate shape-adaptability to complex operating environments. Their practical applications, however, have been plagued by limited maneuverability, which predominantly stemmed from tethered electrical cords or rigid/bulky power sources. Here, we present light-triggered autonomous shape-reconfigurable and locomotive rechargeable power sources (SL-PSs), in which quasi-solid-state supercapacitors (SCs) are monolithically integrated with thermoresponsive liquid crystalline polymer networks (LCNs) substrates using a device-customized printing process. The SCs are designed to enable photothermal effect as well as adjustable capacitive storage. The LCNs are synthesized to provide thermomechanical deformation by programmable anisotropic molecular contract/expansion. Upon exposure to light or heat, the SL-PSs exhibit autonomous and reversible shape-morphing within a few seconds without impairing their electrochemical performance. Moreover, the SL-PSs convey a model cargo through photothermal stimuli-induced wire-crawling and simultaneously transfer their on-board stored electrical energy, demonstrating their potential viability as an untethered soft robotic power source.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. Studies of bioclimate of a territory are aimed at determining the favorable and adverse impacts of various climatic factors and their combinations on the human body. Complex urban morphology has a significant impact on microclimate and, accordingly, on thermal comfort of a person in such an environment. The height of buildings, street orientation, and distance between buildings alter the solar energy inlet, affect thermal regime, transform the wind speed and direction at the street level. Studies of the bioclimatic conditions of urban areas during the warm season are highly relevant as they provide an opportunity to evaluate human thermal sensations in the city, as well as the potential effectiveness of adaptation measures to heat stress (architectural measures and measures based on the use of green areas and water bodies).
   The purpose of the article. The aim of this research is to simulate the bioclimate of an urban environment to determine the human thermal load in summer months based on modern bioclimatic indices and software.
   Methods. For the purpose of this study, a part of the territory of the Osokorky residential area of Kyiv was selected. To get values of the main meteorological parameters of the researched area, a three-dimensional, prognostic, microscale model ENVI-met was used. ENVI-met pertains to the CFD-models (computation fluid dynamics model) and is designed for microscales with a horizontal resolution from 0.5 to 10 m and with a time step of 10 seconds as maximum. The PET calculation was performed using the RayMan model.
   Results. A clear hot summer day (04 August 2017) was chosen for the simulation. The simulation was performed from 6:00 EEST on 4 August till 6:00 EEST the next day (output interval - 1 hour). The simulation results show that the values of the main meteorological parameters (air temperature and humidity, wind characteristics) and physiologically equivalent temperature differ significantly within urban spaces, even across small areas. The amplitudes of PET value were maximum in the daytime and made 12 degrees-15 degrees C. The decrease in the amplitude of the air temperature within the researched area in the evening and night hours led to a notable decrease in the PET amplitude to 2 degrees-3 degrees C. The analysis of the simulated PET values for the researched area confirmed that the residents of the urban areas experience the most intense heat stress while staying in the open asphalted areas during the daytime. The duration of the period with comfortable conditions during the researched day was very short - from 22:00 EEST through midnight. The range of the daily course of PET values at different points of the researched area varied from 19.4 degrees (at point No. 7) to 37.1 degrees C (at point No. 5 located in the well courtyard).
   Based on the PET values simulated for the researched area and for CAWS Kyiv was found the significant differences between thermal comfort conditions within the complex urban spaces and at the weather station. Therefore, the values of bioclimatic indices simulated based on the weather station data can not be applied with any approximation to solve scientific and applied tasks that require information on the bioclimate at particular points in the urbanized environment. To solve such tasks, it is recommended to apply modern methods - ENVI-met and RayMan models.
   Scientific novelty and practical significance. For the first time in Ukraine, microclimate and thermal comfort conditions within the complex urban environment has been simulated using ENVI-met and RayMan models. The results of such simulation can be used to choose heat adaptation measures which would help to increase the comfort of the urban areas. The simulation of microclimate and thermal comfort conditions of some parts of the city territory is important stage of design of the buildings, in order to choose the optimal location for buildings and trees and to create the most comfortable conditions for people.

AB  - The Chinese Government established an industrial environmental management system to execute its pollutants gross control policy in 2006. A key component of this system is the Best Available Techniques (BAT) determination method and pollution control management. This paper augments BAT with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to create a technology selection model for thermal power techniques as case study. Emissions reduction and energy conservation potentials can be weighed against technological feasibility to create best fit assessments for a wide variety of power generation installations. Using this model improves the ability of policymakers and plant owners alike to plan appropriate technology consolidation and upgrade paths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smelting in autumn in age 0 + Salmo salar was improved by 2 months of short photoperiod in an otherwise constant long photoperiod regime. Four groups of fry were reared under either constant-long photoperiod (LD 17:7), or LD17:7 interrupted by LD7:17 for one (Imo-short; July 27-September 1) or 2 months (2mo-short; June 30-September 1), or simulated natural day length (LDN). Bimodality in size-frequency developed in all groups by August. Probability of an individual entering the upper-modal group (UMG) was related positively to fork length in late June. The LDN regime had the highest proportion of both lower-modal group fish (46% vs. 25-27%), and 0 + sexually mature males of the four groups (26% vs. 10-12%). Smelt development in autumn was highest in the 2mo-short group, but was inferior to normal spring smelts, as judged by hypoosmoregulatory ability and gill Na+ K+ ATPase activity. Following transfer of UMG fish to a sea-cage in November, the 2mo-short group exhibited best survival and growth over winter. From spring onwards all groups grew well, reaching harvest size (3-4 kg) in August after 20 months in sea water. Mortality in sea water was 24% and 28% in the 2mo- and 1mo-short groups, and 54% and 67% in the constant-long and LDN groups, The study indicated the feasibility of stabilising the undesirable seasonal fluctuation in commercial salmon production by producing 'off-season' smolts 6 months out-of-phase from regular spring smelts.

AB  - Reverse osmosis (110) is a widely used and rapidly growing desalination technology. A major disadvantage of this process is that the concentrate from the RO process, which could be as much as 25% of the feed represents a polluting stream. This waste stream could pose a significant challenge to the implestream, mentation of this process, particularly for inland communities which do not have the option of ocean disposal. An excellent environmentally benign approach to disposal could be beneficial reuse of the waste stream. This study presents two innovative beneficial reuse strategies for RO concentrate produced by an integrated membrane system (IMS) from a wastewater reclamation facility. The technologies evaluated in this study included bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) for conversion of RO concentrate into mixed acid and mixed base streams, and electrochlorination (EC) for onsite chlorine generation. Bench-scale studies conducted with BMED demonstrated that RO concentrate could be desalted while producing mixed acids and mixed bases with concentrations as high as 0.2N. Similarly, the EC process was capable of producing a 0.6% hypochlorite solution from RO concentrate. The acids and bases as well as the hypochlorite produced could be directly applied to the RO process as well as upstream pre-treatment processes. A preliminary economic evaluation of the viability of these two approaches was conducted by conducting rough order of magnitude cost estimates based on the bench-scale performance of these processes on RO concentrate. A comparison of the overall costs of an Integrated Membrane System utilizing these innovative reuse strategies with conventional disposal options and thermal zero liquid discharge treatment is presented. This comparison indicates that a reuse approach might be economically viable for inland wastewater reuse facilities that utilize RO membranes and have limited options for concentrate disposal.

AB  - Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) may be an important mechanism for marine organisms to acclimate to climate change stressors including ocean warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA). Conversely, environmental stress experienced by one generation may have detrimental latent effects on subsequent generations. We examined TGP in the embryos and larvae of the pan-tropical sea urchin, Tripneustes gratilla, in response to OA (pH 7.77), OW (+2 degrees C), or both OA and OW, OAW (+2 degrees C, pH 7.77) using a parent (F-0) generation reared in treatments from the early juvenile to the mature adult, incorporating gonadogenesis and germline differentiation. Embryos and larvae of acclimated parents were reared in all four treatments to the 2-day-old pluteus stage. Larvae from OA and OAW parents were resilient to the effects of acidification, while larvae from OW and OAW parents were more tolerant to warmer temperature (29 degrees C). Parental acclimation, however, had predominantly negative effects on the size of offspring with reductions in larval arm lengths by as much as 21.4%, while eggs were up to 21.8% smaller in females raised at 29 degrees C. We highlight the complexity and trade-offs of TGP in this first transgenerational climate change study on a marine macroinvertebrate where the F-0 generation was acclimated over their reproductive life.

AB  - Paleozoic and Mesozoic outcrop and core samples (REMINA Dekese and REMINA Samba wells) covering various stratigraphic intervals from the central Congo Basin were analyzed for total organic carbon (C-org), total inorganic carbon (C-inorg), and total sulfur content. Rock-Eval analysis and vitrinite reflectance (R-o) measurements were performed on the basis of the C-org content. Fifteen samples were chosen for molecular organic geochemistry. Nonaromatic hydrocarbons (HCs) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) flame ionization detection and GC-mass spectrometry.
   Samples of the Alolo shales from the Aruwimi Group (Lindi Supergroup, late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic) are in general very poor in C-org (most samples <0.5%) and contain a high amount of degraded organic matter (OM). All samples of this group revealed a type III to IV kerogen and cannot be considered as a potential source rock. Permian-Carboniferous sediments from the Lukuga Group (Dekese well and outcrop samples) contain moderate contents of organic carbon (<2%). The T-max values (heating temperature at which the top peak of S-2 occurs) indicate early mature OM, partly also a higher level of maturity because of Ro (0.6-0.7%) and production index values (S-1/S-1 + S-2 < 0.2). All samples contain hydrogen-poor type III to IV kerogen with low HC generation potential, only having a very minor gas generation potential. The kinds of OM, as well as the biological markers, indicate a terrestrial-dominated depositional environment.
   Organic geochemical investigations on Upper Jurassic (Stanleyville Group) to Lower Cretaceous (Loia Group) samples from the Samba well and outcrops in the northeastern part of the Congo Basin reveal moderate to high contents of organic carbon (as much as 25%). The kerogen has very high hydrogen index (HI) values reflecting type I kerogen of excellent quality in the Stanleyville Group (as much as 900 mg HC/g C-org) and type I to II kerogen in the overlying Loia Group (as much as 900 mg HC/g C-org). Outcrop samples from the Stanleyville Group have variable partly high C-org contents and are also characterized by very high HI values (as much as 900 mg HC/g C-org). The samples studied are too immature for petroleum generation. Based on biomarker analysis, an aquatic anoxic depositional environment can be assumed for the Stanleyville Group, whereas a lacustrine deposition is likely for the samples of the Loia Group. Based on the geologic knowledge of the area, deposition under lacustrine conditions is most likely also for the Stanleyville Group. Both the Stanleyville and Loia groups can be regarded as excellent petroleum source rocks and could be part of a petroleum system if sufficient burial and maturation have occurred. The presence of resedimented vitrinite particles in the Lukuga Group of the Dekese well with a slightly higher maturation rank than the autochthonous vitrinites suggests that 3000-4000 m (9840-13,120 ft) of Carboniferous to Devonian sediment has been eroded from the eastern margin of the Congo Basin.
   Finally, R-o data were used to create one-dimensional models for the Dekese and Samba wells, giving an overview of the burial, thermal, and maturity histories of the area.

AB  - Heat-shock (HS) assays to understand the connection between standing inversion variation and evolutionary response to climate change in Drosophila subobscura found that "warm-climate" inversion O3+4 exhibits non-HS levels of Hsp70 protein like those of "cold-climate" O-ST after HS induction. This was unexpected, as overexpression of Hsp70 can incur multiple fitness costs. To understand the genetic basis of this finding, we have determined the genomic sequence organization of the Hsp70 family in four different inversions, including O-ST, O3+4, O3+4+8 and O3+4+16, using as outgroups the remainder of the subobscura species subgroup, namely Drosophila madeirensis and Drosophila guanche. We found (i) in all the assayed lines, the Hsp70 family resides in cytological locus 94A and consists of only two genes, each with four HS elements (HSEs) and three GAGA sites on its promoter. Yet, in O-ST,O- the family is comparatively more compact; (ii) the two Hsp70 copies evolve in concert through gene conversion, except in D. guanche; (iii) within D. subobscura, the rate of concerted evolution is strongly structured by inversion, being higher in O-ST than in O3+4; and (iv) in D. guanche, the two copies accumulated multiple differences, including a newly evolved "gap-type" HSE2. The absence of concerted evolution in this species may be related to a long-gone-unnoticed observation that it lacks Hsp70 HS response, perhaps because it has evolved within a narrow thermal range in an oceanic island. Our results point to a previously unrealized link between inversions and concerted evolution, with potentially major implications for understanding genome evolution.

AB  - A large colony of Euscorpius flavicaudis was studied at Sheerness Docks, Isle of Sheppey, Kent. It was probably established in the late nineteenth century. The scorpions inhabit cracks in the dockyard perimeter wall where the mortar pointing has crumbled away. They are nocturnal, 'sit-and-wait', generalist predators. They are extremely sedentary: females leave their cracks fewer than 10 times per year; males are more active as they become vagrant prior to the mating season, which occurs in summer. Marked adults were resighted at intervals of over a year and the distance scorpions moved between resightings was not proportional to the interval. The number of scorpions seen per night was influenced by temperature, amount of rainfall and phase of the moon. In winter, the scorpions retreated far into the wall and, by doing so, reduced the risk of suffering mortality due to cold. During this time, they were seldom active. In general, this species does not behave in any way that can be correlated with living in a temperate rather than a desert area, This illustrates the extreme adaptability of scorpions.

AB  - The evolutionary lability of sex-determining mechanisms across the tree of life is well recognized, yet the extent of molecular changes that accompany these repeated transitions remain obscure. Most turtles retain the ancestral temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) from which multiple transitions to genotypic sex determination (GSD) occurred independently, and two contrasting hypotheses posit the existence or absence of reversals back to TSD. Here we examined the molecular evolution of the coding regions of a set of gene regulators involved in gonadal development in turtles and several other vertebrates. We found slower molecular evolution in turtles and crocodilians compared to other vertebrates, but an acceleration in Trionychia turtles and at some phylogenetic branches demarcating major taxonomic diversification events. Of all gene classes examined, hormone signaling genes, and Srd5a1 in particular, evolve faster in many lineages and especially in turtles. Our data show that sex-linked genes do not follow a ubiquitous nor uniform pattern of molecular evolution. We then evaluated turtle nucleotide and protein evolution under two evolutionary hypotheses with or without GSD-to-TSD reversals, and found that when GSD-to-TSD reversals are considered, all transitional branches irrespective of direction, exhibit accelerated molecular evolution of nucleotide sequences, while GSD-to-TSD transitional branches also show acceleration in protein evolution. Significant changes in predicted secondary structure that may affect protein function were identified in three genes that exhibited hastened evolution in turtles compared to other vertebrates or in transitional versus non-transitional branches within turtles, rendering them candidates for a key role during SDM evolution in turtles.

AB  - On the south-east coast of Australia, the impermeability of the Southeast Australian Biogeographic Barrier (SEABB) limits the dispersal of many intertidal taxa, but current flow across the SEABB is expected to be increasing under climate change. The surf barnacle Catomerus polymerus has extensive populations on either side of the barrier that both mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) sequence data and surveys using 4-6 microsatellite loci imply have been separated for millennia (>167 000 yr). Nevertheless, these data sets (based on collections from 2005-2012) also imply that there has been some recent dispersal across the SEABB. If transbarrier migration is now possible, then in the absence of selection the differentiation of lineages should be eroded. Next-generation sequencing provides the opportunity to both better quantify levels of population differentiation attributable to the SEABB and to determine if there is regional selection. Our data (3801 single nucleotide polymorphisms) for individuals collected in 2019 within 3 eastern and 4 western sites support earlier reports of low population differentiation within eastern and western regions (F-ST < 0.021) and the strong regional separation of eastern and western lineages (F-RT = 0.23). Moreover, in contrast to earlier studies, we did not detect any putative migrants, with all individuals assigning most strongly to their sampling region. Most strikingly, analysis using BAYESCAN implied that 47 loci (1.24 %) of our surveyed loci show evidence of significant regional diversifying selection, which implies that even if C. polymerus larvae are able to cross the barrier, they will be strongly disfavoured by selection.

AB  - Few studies have compared the response of native and invasive populations under stressful conditions. Furthermore, there is little consensus as to whether a plastic response is related to invasiveness in stressful environments. Exotic species have recently been reported in the high Andes of central Chile, where individuals have to cope with drought and poor soils, in addition to extreme temperatures. We explored if the exotic species Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) has plastic responses to soil moisture and nutrient availability, and whether two sets of alpine populations derived from native and introduced populations can converge to similar plastic responses to environmental constraints. Using a common garden approach, we compared plants grown from seeds collected in alpine populations of its native range (Alps, France) and in alpine populations of its introduced range (Andes, Chile) under a drought experiment, a potassium gradient, and a nitrogen gradient. Plasticity was only found as a response to drought. Moreover, different responses were found between both origins. Andean individuals are drought-resistant, while individuals from the Alps were drought-sensitive. According to the nutrient experiments, Andean dandelions behave as a nitrogen demanding-potassium avoiding species, whereas individuals from the Alps did not show any particular dependency or repulsion tendency to either of these two nutrients. Results suggest that differences in life history traits of both derived sets of populations may have an important role in determining the response of dandelions under the evaluated conditions. However, the relative importance of genetic adaptation in these responses is still unclear. Although T. officinale is a cosmopolite weed, this is the first study that compares individuals coming from its native and invaded range under stressful conditions.

AB  - The combined effects of predicted ocean acidification and global warming on the larvae of the cold-eurythermal spider crab Hyas araneus L. were investigated in 2 populations: a southern-most around Helgoland (North Sea, 54 degrees N) and a northernmost at Svalbard (North Atlantic, 79 degrees N). Larvae were exposed at temperatures of 3, 9 and 15 degrees C to present day normocapnia (380 ppm CO2) and to CO2 conditions predicted for the near or medium-term future (710 ppm by the year 2100, 3000 ppm by 2300 and beyond). Larval development time, growth and C/N ratio were studied in the larval stages Zoea I, II, and Megalopa. Permanent differences in instar duration between both populations were detected in all stages, likely as a result of evolutionary temperature adaptation. With the exception of Zoea II at 3 degrees C and under all CO2 conditions, development in all instars from Svalbard was delayed compared to those from Helgoland. Most prominently, development was much longer and fewer specimens morphosed to the first crab instar in the Megalopa from Svalbard than from Helgoland. Enhanced CO2 levels (particularly 3000 ppm) extended the duration of larval development and reduced larval growth (measured as dry mass) and fitness (decreasing C/N ratio, a proxy of the lipid content). Such effects were strongest in the zoeal stages of Svalbard larvae, and during the Megalopa instar of Helgoland larvae. The high sensitivity of megalopae from the Svalbard population to warming and of those from Helgoland to enhanced CO2 levels suggests that this larval instar is a physiologically sensitive bottleneck within the life cycle of H. araneus.

AB  - Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Columbia River basin (CRB) comprise three lineages-lower Columbia River and sympatric interior ocean and stream types-each with distinct biological attributes. To evaluate the adaptive and neutral genetic variation of this species in the CRB, we genotyped 54 Chinook salmon populations using a panel of 96 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. All three lineages were represented among the collections and were widely distributed across locations, ranging from the upper Salmon River to near the Columbia River estuary. Our goal was to explore local adaptation as a process shaping the population structure and genetic variation among Chinook salmon beyond the inferences possible with neutral marker data. In our analyses with putatively neutral SNPs, the population structure of Chinook salmon throughout the CRB was generally concordant with that of previous studies using microsatellites. Regression analyses and outlier methods identified 28, 17, and 29 candidate SNP loci for positive selection among stream-type, ocean-type, and lower-river Chinook salmon, respectively. The candidate SNP markers were tested for association with seven environmental variables using multiple methods. We identified unambiguous markers, including nine candidates in the stream-type lineage and seven in the ocean-type lineage that were significantly correlated with elevation and/or temperature. The association of six candidates markers in the lower-river lineage could not be confirmed by population structure analyses and remained ambiguous. We observed a significant association of isolation by distance for the ocean-and stream-type lineages with our SNP panel; however, there was also a significant relationship between pairwise F-ST and several habitat variables. In all cases, the apparent adaptive variation complemented the results of demographic genetic structure but with higher resolution of population differentiation.

AB  - This study develops a quantitative approach to the establishment of a maximum allowable thermal discharge into a freshwater body (the Beloyarsk Reservoir) incorporated in the once-through cooling technology at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant (NPP) (South Urals, Russian Federation). The study is based on a 3-D hydrodynamic model, embracing water circulation, heat transfer, and ice-cover formation in the Beloyarsk Reservoir. The model is driven by atmospheric forcing, river runoff, and the discharge/intake of NPP cooling water. It was used to simulate the horizontal and vertical distribution of water temperature under the effect of the operation of existing (number 3) and anticipated (numbers 4 and 5) nuclear power units. The model is validated by the comparison of the computation results with observed water temperature distribution and ice-cover configuration obtained with remote sensing techniques. The model was also used to predict the future evolution of water temperature after the launching of two new power units, which, having a common cooling system, may affect each other. It was shown that the first of the new units, no. 4, will not dramatically affect the existing thermal conditions in the reservoir, while launching one more unit, no. 5, will apparently result in overheating of the reservoir water in response to the greater volume of cooling-water discharge from the two power units. Because of a specific configuration of the recirculation flow, the reservoir may fail to cope with the dissipation of the generated heat, leading to a steady (uncontrolled) rise of water temperature in the inlet channel to one of the power units. This will reduce the potential of NPP, using the once-through cooling technology, and will most likely have an adverse effect on the survival of aquatic organisms in the Beloyarsk Reservoir. Therefore, some other environment-saving technologies must be developed for removing surplus heat from the unit no. 5 of the Beloyarsk NPP.

AB  - Energy metabolism is fundamental for animal fitness because it fuels locomotion, growth, and reproduction. Mitochondrial capacities often acclimate to compensate for negative thermodynamic effects. Our aim was to determine the importance of transcriptional regulation and membrane fatty acid composition in modulating oxidative capacities at body temperatures selected in a cold and a warm environment by a reptile (Crocodylus porosus). In the cool environment (mean selected T-b = 21 degrees C), mRNA concentrations of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and its coactivator PPAR gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), as well as of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunits COX1 and COX5, were significantly higher in the liver but not in skeletal muscle compared with animals in the warm environment (mean selected T-b = 29 degrees C). FOF1-ATPase subunit alpha mRNA concentrations were significantly higher in both muscle and the liver in the cool animals. A positive relationship between PGC-1 alpha and PPAR gamma mRNA concentrations, with an indicator of mitochondrial density (16S rRNA) in muscle and COX and FOF1-ATPase subunit alpha mRNA concentrations in liver, suggest that these proteins regulate quantity increases of mitochondria during acclimation. The percent saturated fatty acids in liver membranes of cool animals was significantly lower, and the n3 fatty acid content was significantly higher, compared with in warm animals. The n3 fatty acid content was positively related to COX enzyme activity in the liver, and there was a negative relationship between n7 fatty acid content and COX activity in muscle. Hence, metabolic acclimation is mediated by both transcriptional regulation and membrane fatty acid composition. The importance of PGC-1 alpha and PPAR gamma in a reptile indicate that the mechanisms that regulate metabolism are conserved among vertebrates.

AB  - Key message Large genetic variation was found in Prunus avium L. populations from the northern parts of the species distribution range. The ranking of genotypes in terms of growth was stable when tested at three trial sites within the northern parts of the species distribution range.
   Context Peripheral populations especially those in the leading edge are isolated from rest of the areas in the species distribution range. This can make them less genetically diverse yet genetically distinct from the rest of the populations in the species distribution range. Evaluation of their genetic diversity is thus crucial in understanding the local adaptation potential of a species.
   Aims We investigated the genetic diversity and genotype by environment interaction at the northern parts of the distribution range of P. avium.
   Methods Quantitative genetic variation of growth, stem form, and spring phenology were assessed in progenies from 93 plus trees of P. avium selected from 43 locations at the north of the species distribution range in Sweden and tested at two Swedish sites and one Danish site.
   Results We find large quantitative genetic variation in growth and phenology at the northern part of the distribution range of P. avium. Only a limited genotype by environment interaction was observed with no clear indication of local adaptation at the northern parts of the species distribution.
   Conclusion We conclude that P. avium harbors a high level of genetic diversity at the north of its distribution range. Present patterns therefore reflect more likely the recent introduction of the species and dispersal dynamics rather than a long-term loss of diversity along South-North ecological clines during the Holocene. With no indications of genetic depletion in growth or phenology, the gene pool in the breeding program is considered suitable for the future propagation of the species in the tested area.

AB  - The anthropozoonotic metastrongyloid nematodes Angiostrongylus cantonensis and Angiostrongylus costaricensis, as well as Angiostrongylus vasorum, Crenosoma vulpis, Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior are currently considered as emerging gastropod-borne parasites and have gained growing scientific attention in the last years. However, the knowledge on invertebrate immune responses and on how metastrongyloid larvae are attacked by gastropod immune cells is still limited. This work aims to describe an in vitro system to investigate haemocyte-derived innate immune responses of terrestrial gastropods induced by vital axenic metastrongyloid larvae. We also provide protocols on slug/snail management and breeding under standardized climate conditions (circadian cycle, temperature and humidity) for the generation of parasite-free F0 stages which are essential for immune-related investigations. Adult slug species (Arion lusitanicus, Limax maximus) and giant snails (Achatina fulica) were maintained in fully automated climate chambers until mating and production of fertilized eggs. Newly hatched F0 juvenile specimens were kept under parasite-free conditions before experimental use. An improved protocol for gastropod haemolymph collection and haemocyte isolation was established. Giemsa-stained haemolymph preparations showed adequate haemocyte isolation in all three gastropod species. Additionally, a protocol for the production of axenic first and third stage larvae (L1, L3) was established. Haemocyte functionality was tested in haemocyte-nematode-co-cultures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy analyses revealed that gastropod-derived haemocytes formed clusters as well as DNA-rich extracellular aggregates catching larvae and decreasing their motility. These data confirm the usefulness of the presented methods to study haemocyte-mediated gastropod immune responses to better understand the complex biology of gastropod-borne diseases.

AB  - The regulation of body temperature in ectotherms has a major impact in their physiological and behavioral processes. Observing changes in thermal parameters related with reproduction allows is to better understand how Rhinella arenarum optimizes a thermal resource. The aim of this study was to compare the thermal parameters of this species between breeding and non-breeding periods. In the field, we recorded the body temperature from captured animals, the air temperature, and the temperature of the substrate. In the laboratory, we measured the temperature R. arenarum selected on a thermal gradient and the critical extreme temperatures. The results of our study show variations in thermal parameters between the two situations studied. This species makes efficient use of thermal resources during the breeding period by basking to significantly increase body temperature. Because calling is energetically costly for males, this behavior results in increased efficiency to callers during the breeding period. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(1): 347-353. Epub 2011 March 01.

AB  - One hypothesis for the success of invasive species is reduced pathogen burden, resulting from a release from infections or high immunological fitness of invaders. Despite strong selection exerted on the host, the evolutionary response of invaders to newly acquired pathogens has rarely been considered. The two independent and genetically distinct invasions of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas into the North Sea represent an ideal model system to study fast evolutionary responses of invasive populations. By exposing both invasion sources to ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse pathogens (Vibrio spp.), we demonstrate that within a few generations hosts adapted to newly encountered pathogen communities. However, local adaptation only became apparent in selective environments, i.e. at elevated temperatures reflecting patterns of disease outbreaks in natural populations. Resistance against sympatric and allopatric Vibrio spp. strains was dominantly inherited in crosses between both invasion sources, resulting in an overall higher resistance of admixed individuals than pure lines. Therefore, we suggest that a simple genetic resistance mechanism of the host is matched to a common virulence mechanism shared by local Vibrio strains. This combination might have facilitated a fast evolutionary response that can explain another dimension of why invasive species can be so successful in newly invaded ranges.

AB  - The significant influence of thermal acclimation on physiological and behavioral performance has been documented in many ectothermic animals, but such studies are still limited in turtle species. We acclimated hatchling soft-shelled turtles Pelodiseus sinensis under three thermal conditions (10, 20 and 30 degrees C) for 4 weeks, and then measured selected body temperature (T-set), critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax), and locomotor performance at different body temperatures. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal preference and resistance of P sinensis hatchlings. Hatchling turtles acclimated to 10 degrees C selected relatively lower body temperatures and were less resistant to high temperatures than those acclimated to 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The turtles' resistance to low temperatures increased with a decreasing acclimation temperature. The thermal resistance range (i.e. the difference between CTMax and CTMin, TRR) was widest in turtles acclimated to 20 degrees C, and narrowest in those acclimated to 10 degrees C. The locomotor performance of turtles was affected by both body temperature and acclimation temperature. Hatcliling turtles acclimated to relatively higher temperatures swam faster than did those acclimated to lower temperatures. Accordingly, hatchling turtles acclimated to a particular temperature may not enhance the performance at that temperature. Instead, hatchlings acclimated to relatively warm temperatures have a better performance, supporting the "hotter is better" hypothesis.

AB  - Many icy Solar System bodies possess subsurface oceans. On Pluto, Sputnik Planitia's location near the equator suggests the presence of a subsurface ocean and a locally thinned ice shell. To maintain an ocean, Pluto needs to retain heat inside. On the other hand, to maintain large variations in its thickness, Pluto's ice shell needs to be cold. Here we show, by thermal evolution and viscous relaxation calculations, that the presence of a thin layer of clathrate hydrates (gas hydrates) at the base of the ice shell can explain both the long-term survival of the ocean and the maintenance of shell thickness contrasts. Clathrate hydrates act as a thermal insulator, preventing the ocean from completely freezing while keeping the ice shell cold and immobile. The most likely clathrate guest gas is methane, derived from precursor bodies and/or cracking of organic materials in the hot rocky core. Nitrogen molecules initially contained and/or produced later in the core would probably not be trapped as clathrate hydrates, instead supplying the nitrogen-rich surface and atmosphere. The formation of a thin clathrate hydrate layer cap to a subsurface ocean may be an important generic mechanism to maintain long-lived subsurface oceans in relatively large but minimally heated icy satellites and Kuiper belt objects.

AB  - Mutation and immobilization techniques were applied to uridine phosphorylase (UP) from Escherichia coli in order to enhance its thermal stability and hence productivity in a biocatalytic reaction. UP was evolved by iterative saturation mutagenesis. Compared to the wild type enzyme, which had a temperature optimum of 40 degrees C and a half-life of 9.89 h at 60 degrees C. the selected mutant had a temperature optimum of 60 degrees C and a half-life of 17.3 h at 60 degrees C. Self-immobilization of the native UP as a Spherezyme showed a 3.3 fold increase in thermostability while immobilized mutant enzyme showed a 4.4 fold increase in thermostability when compared to native UP. Combining UP with the purine nucleoside phosphorylase from Bacillus halodurans allows for synthesis of 5-methyluridine (a pharmaceutical intermediate) from guanosine and thymine in a one-pot transglycosylation reaction. Replacing the wild type UP with the mutant allowed for an increase in reaction temperature to 65 degrees C and increased the reaction productivity from 10 to 31 gl(-1) h(-1). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Meiotic recombination rates vary in response to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Recently, heat stress has been shown to reveal plasticity in recombination rates in Drosophila pseudoobscura. Here, a combination of molecular genotyping and X-linked recessive phenotypic markers were used to investigate differences in recombination rates due to heat stress. In addition, haplotypes from the genetic crosses were compared to test if they deviated from equal proportions, which would indicate viability selection. To avoid this potential bias, SNP genotyping markers overlapping the regions assayed with mutant markers were used to further investigate recombination rate. Interestingly, skews in haplotype frequency were consistent with the fixation of alleles in the wild-type stocks used that are unfit at high temperature. Evidence of viability selection due to heat stress in the wild-type haplotypes was most apparent on days 7-9 when more mutant non-crossover haplotypes were recovered in comparison to wild type (p < 0.0001). Recombination analysis using SNP markers showed days 9-10 as significantly different due to heat stress in 2 pairs of consecutive SNP markers (p = 0.018; p = 0.015), suggesting that during this time period the recombination rate is most sensitive to heat stress. This peak timing for recombination plasticity is consistent with Drosophila melanogaster based on a comparison of similarly timed key meiotic events, enabling future mechanistic work of temperature stress on recombination rate.

AB  - Experiments with temperature effect on survival of a terrestrial mollusk, Bradybaena fruticum, revealed differential mortality rate of specimens differing by shell and biochemical phenotypes. Among young specimens, vitality is shown to be higher in stripeless and yellow morphs than in striped and pink ones, while in adults no differences between these morphs are indicated. It is supposed that these experimental data indicate one of the non-specific esterase marking certain shell traits allele has selective advantage under high temperature conditions. These data are in favor of selective value of enzyme polymorphism.

AB  - A variety of phenotypic traits in reptiles are affected by conditions during embryonic development, a phenomenon known as developmental plasticity. In particular, many traits in which expression changes with temperature, such as locomotor performance or growth rates, are also developmentally plastic. However, much less is known about the extent to which traits associated with thermal ecology, such as thermal tolerance and behavioral thermoregulation, are developmentally plastic. Here, we review the literature on developmental plasticity in physiological and behavioral traits associated with thermal ecology in reptiles. Most studies on developmental plasticity of thermal traits have assessed plasticity in behavioral traits, such as selected temperature or time spent basking, and these studies have found mixed support for the presence of developmental plasticity in behavioral thermal traits. In contrast, very few studies have assessed developmental plasticity in physiological traits, yet these studies generally support a developmentally plastic basis for thermal tolerance. Most studies have only tested for developmental plasticity in thermal ecology traits at the hatchling stage, which limits our understanding of the benefits of developmental plasticity to individuals, or the adaptive significance of developmental plasticity in populations. We recommend that research on developmental plasticity in reptile thermal ecology be expanded to include incubation conditions other than mean temperature, consider traits associated with cold-tolerance, and endeavor to understand how developmental plasticity in thermal ecology traits is beneficial. In particular, determining how long differences persist over ontogeny, and testing for benefits of developmental plasticity across multiple life stages, are crucial first steps towards understanding the adaptive significance of developmental plasticity in thermal ecology traits.

TI  - Reducing the fuel temperature for pressure-tube supercritical-water-cooled reactors and the effect of fuel burnup
T2  - NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA  - English
AB  - The Pressure-Tube Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (PT-SCWR) is one of the concepts under investigation by the Generation IV International Forum for its promise to deliver higher thermal efficiency than nuclear reactors currently in operation. The high coolant temperature (>625 K) and high linear power density employed by the PT-SCWR cause the fuel temperature to be fairly high, leading to a reduced margin to fuel melting, thus increasing the risk of actual melting during accident scenarios. It is therefore desirable to come up with a fuel design that lowers the fuel temperature while preserving the high linear power ratio and high coolant temperature. One possible solution is to separate the fertile (ThO2) and fissile (PuO2) fuel materials into different radial regions in each fuel pin. Previously-reported work found that by locating the fertile material at the centre and the fissile material at the periphery of the fuel pin, the fuel centreline temperature can be reduced by 650 K for fresh fuel compared to the case of a homogeneous (Th-Pu)O-2 mixture for the same coolant temperature and linear power density. This work provides a justification for the observed reduction in fuel centreline temperature and suggests a systematic approach to lower the fuel temperature. It also extends the analysis to the dependence of the radial temperature profile on fuel burnup. The radial temperature profile is determined from the analytical solution of the steady-state heat conduction equation in the fuel pin, ignoring azimuthal dependence and axial heat flow. The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity is accounted for, as is the radial dependence of the volumetric power density, which is determined from detailed lattice-level transport calculations performed using the lattice code DRAGON. The reduction in the centreline fuel temperature is shown to be caused partly by a reduction in the heat flux in the case of the two-region fuel and partly by the higher thermal conductivity of both pure ThO2 and pure PuO2 compared to that of a ThO2-PuO2 mixture. The centreline temperature of the two-region fuel is shown to be higher for irradiated fuel than for fresh fuel, a fact explained by the depletion of the fissile material in the peripheral region and the buildup of fissile material in the central region.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the evolution of organic solderability preservatives (OSPs) technology from a temporary anti-tarnish to an approved process for the lead-free assembly of high-reliability printed circuit boards (PCBs). Design/methodology/approach - As this is an informational paper, the main approach was to compare and contrast various types of OSP molecules and their fitness for use.
   Findings - The active ingredient of an OSP is one of the most important ingredients that can help to improve the heat resistance, which becomes much more important in conjunction with lead-free solder. The latest OSP shows excellent stability, even at more than the peak reflow temperatures used with lead-free solders. The success of any OSP process is highly correlated to process control and maintenance and OSP formulations are not created equal. The thickness of the film is only one difference. However, the key differentiators for OSP coatings are the overall ability of the organic film to resist oxygen penetration and humidity; and withstand the higher temperatures of lead-free assembly. The author suggests that original equipment manufacturer (OEMs), contract manufacturers and PCB fabricators perform testing and qualification of OSPs using industry-accepted reliability and solderability testing methods.
   Research limitations/implications - This work represents the author's extensive experience with OSP technology, as well as the results of a collective collaboration with Shikoku Chemical Corporation. The findings represent reliability and solderability testing carried out in various manufacturing sites including cooperation with certain OEMs that are users of circuits fabricated with OSP technology.
   Originality/value - This paper details how critical advances in OSP technology have enabled improvements in solderability and reliability over earlier commercial generations and have further enhanced the solderability of lead-free assemblies.

AB  - The existence of genetic variability is a key element of the adaptive potential of a natural population to stress. In this study we estimated the additive and non-additive components of the genetic variability of net reproductive rate (R-0) in a natural Daphnia magna population exposed to Cd stress at two different temperatures. To this end, life-table experiments were conducted with 20 parental and 39 offspring clonal lineages following a 2 x 2 design with Cd concentration (control vs. 3.7 mu g Cd/L) and temperature (20 vs. 24 A degrees C) as factors. Offspring lineages were obtained through inter-clonal crossing of the different parental lineages. The population mean, additive and non-additive genetic components of variation in each treatment were estimated by fitting an Animal Model to the observed R-0 values using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. From those estimates broad-sense heritabilities (H-2), narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2)), total (CVG) and additive genetic coefficients of variation (CVA) of R-0 were calculated. The exposure to Cd imposed a considerable level of stress to the population, as shown by the fact that the population mean of R-0 exposed to Cd was significantly lower than in the control at the corresponding temperature, i.e. by 23 % at 20 A degrees C and by 88 % at 24 A degrees C. The latter difference indicates that increasing temperature increased the stress level imposed by Cd. The HA(2) and CVG were significantly greater than 0 in all treatments, suggesting that there is a considerable degree of genetic determination of R-0 in this population and that clonal selection could rapidly lead to increasing population mean fitness under all investigated conditions. More specifically, the HA(2) was 0.392 at 20 A degrees C+Cd and 0.563 at 24 A degrees C+Cd; the CVG was 30.0 % at 20 A degrees C+Cd and was significantly higher (147.6 %) in the 24 A degrees C+Cd treatment. Significant values of h(2) (= 0.23) and CVA (= 89.7 %) were only found in the 24 A degrees C+Cd treatment, suggesting that the ability to produce more offspring under this stressful condition may be inherited across sexual generations. In contrast, in the less stressful 20 A degrees C+Cd treatment the h(2) (0.06) and CVA (7.0 %) were very low and not significantly higher than zero. Collectively our data indicate that both the asexual and sexual reproduction phases in cyclic parthenogenetic D. magna populations may play a role in the long-term adaptive potential of Daphnia populations to chemical stress (with Cd as the current example) and that environmental variables which influence the stress level of that chemical may influence this adaptive potential (with temperature as current example).

AB  - The potential of species for evolutionary adaptation in the context of global climate change has recently come under scrutiny. Estimates of phenotypic variation in biological traits may prove valuable for identifying species, or groups of species, with greater or lower potential for evolutionary adaptation, as this variation, when heritable, represents the basis for natural selection. Assuming that measures of trait variability reflect the evolutionary potential of these traits, we conducted an analysis across trematode species to determine the potential of these parasites as a group to adapt to increasing temperatures. Firstly, we assessed how the mean number of infective stages (cercariae) emerging from infected snail hosts as well as the survival and infectivity of cercariae are related to temperature. Secondly and importantly in the context of evolutionary potential, we assessed how coefficients of variation for these traits are related to temperature, in both cases controlling for other factors such as habitat, acclimatisation, latitude and type of target host. With increasing temperature, an optimum curve was found for mean output and mean infectivity, and a linear decrease for survival of cercariae. For coefficients of variation, temperature was only an important predictor in the case of cercarial output, where results indicated that there is, however, no evidence for limited trait variation at the higher temperature range. No directional trend was found for either variation of survival or infectivity. These results, characterising general patterns among trematodes, suggest that all three traits considered may have potential to change through adaptive evolution.

AB  - Older employees face a severe employability problem, partly because of dominant stereotypes about them. This study investigates stereotypes of older employees in corporate and news media. Drawing on the Stereotype Content Model, we content analysed newspaper coverage and corporate media of 50 large-scale Dutch organisations, published between 2006 and 2013. The data revealed that stereotypical portrayals of older employees are more common in news media than in corporate media and mixed in terms of valence. Specifically, older employees were positively portrayed with regard to warmth stereotypes, such as trustworthiness, but negatively with regard to competence stereotypes, such as technological competence and adaptability. Additionally, stereotypical portrayals that do not clearly belong to warmth or competence dimensions are found, such as the mentoring role stereotype and the costly stereotype. Because competence stereotypes weigh more heavily in employers' productivity perceptions, these media portrayals might contribute to the employability problem of older employees. We suggest that older employees could benefit from a more realistic media debate about their skills and capacities.

AB  - Climate in the semiarid central Great Plains is expected to become warmer and drier in coming decades, with potentially greater variability in precipitation and temperature. Cropping systems that include forages and allow flexibility for determining if a crop should be planted and which crop to plant (based on available soil water at planting) may provide the opportunity to maintain economic viability in a changing climate environment. The objective of this study was to compare cropping system productivity and profitability of flexible rotations that incorporate forages against grain-based cropping systems that are set rotational sequences. Yield and net returns for five set rotations and three flexible rotations were compared at Akron, CO, over 5 yr. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields were reduced by 57% when the fallow period prior to wheat production was replaced with crop production. Average net income was greatest for the continuously cropped all-forage set 3-yr rotation followed by the flexible 3-yr rotations that included wheat and forage phases. The lowest net returns were seen for the set grain-based rotations and the flexible wheat-grain crop rotation. Incorporating forage production as a phase in dryland wheat rotational systems can add profitability and sustainability to the production system in the face of climate variability.

AB  - The stars in the Magellanic Clouds with the largest degree of obscuration are used to probe the highly uncertain physics of stars in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of evolution. Carbon stars in particular provide key information on the amount of third dredge-up and mass-loss. We use two independent stellar evolution codes to test how a different treatment of the physics affects the evolution on the AGB. The output from the two codes is used to determine the rates of dust formation in the circumstellar envelope, where the method used to determine the dust is the same for each case. The stars with the largest degree of obscuration in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are identified as the progeny of objects of initial mass 2.5-3 M-aS (TM) and similar to 1.5 M-aS (TM), respectively. This difference in mass is motivated by the difference in the star formation histories of the two galaxies, and offers a simple explanation of the redder infrared colours of C-stars in the LMC compared to their counterparts in the SMC. The comparison with the Spitzer colours of C-rich AGB stars in the SMC shows that a minimum surface carbon mass fraction X(C) similar to 5 x 10(-3) must have been reached by stars of initial mass around 1.5 M-aS (TM). Our results confirm the necessity of adopting low-temperature opacities in stellar evolutionary models of AGB stars. These opacities allow the stars to obtain mass-loss rates high enough (a parts per thousand(3)10(-4) M-aS (TM) yr(-1)) to produce the amount of dust needed to reproduce the Spitzer colours.

AB  - Foliage edibility of Scots pine clones of French and Polish origin (woodlands near Haguenau in Alsace and near Taborz in Mazury) is tested on the pine sawfly Diprion pini L.
   Feeding bioassays were first performed with larvae of the first instar, larval mortality being appreciated after 10 or 12 days of foliage feeding.  These tests were realized in standard laboratory conditions (20-degrees-C, 16h30/7h30 photoperiod and 16-degrees-C, 15h/9h photoperiod) with the foliage of 27 clones selected according to morphological characteristics.
   These experiments enabled us to select 4 clones showing well differentiated capacities of edibility, to feed more aged larvae, from the 4th instar to cocoon spinning.  Several biological characteristics as development rate, size, fecundity and diapause rate were then observed in addition to mortality on diprions fed with the foliage of these clones.  This later test was carried out in natural conditions of temperature and photoperiod.
   The whole of these experiments shows that some clones are favourable or unfavourable to the sawfly survival and development.  Unfavourable clones are mainly found in clone population of Taborz origin.  In addition to high mortality, consumption of the needles of these pines induces decrease in foliage eating and deterioration of the physiological state of the surviving insects:  decrease in size and in fecundity, changes in development and diapause rate.
   These effects are compared, by bioassays on aged larvae, to consumption incidence of the young needles.

AB  - Jatropha curcas Linn, a tree bearing non-edible oil seeds, grows well in tropical countries throughout semi arid Asia and Africa. It is very hardy, can tolerate high temperature and can grow in 5% to 75% soil moisture. It is quick growing and non palatable to the browsing animals. The plant has multiple economic value each of its part being commercially viable. The most important is its seed oil which is semidrying and is a diesel substitute having characteristics close to those of diesel. It can also be used as lubricant, illuminant and in several other industires like soap, candle etc. Latex has many pharmaceutical applications. Looking at the importance of the plant, various experimentations have been carried out to optimise its growth, productivity with respect to moisture requirement, planting time, starting material, pretreatment, temperature reactivity, light influence and other growth parameters. Comparison has also been done with different genotypes from different parts of the world.
   The qualitative and quantitative analysis of oil has been made from the different germ plasm. And the adaptability of different germ plasm from different parts of the world in Indian conditions has also been studied. It was observed that seed soil content qualitatively and quantitatively was variable with respect to different germ plasm.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a molecule dissolved in many thermal spring waters at variable concentration. The H2S effects of thermal waters treatments have long been studied, for dermatological and clinical treatments, but its role in recreational waters was never investigated. The use of sulfur spring waters in pools raises concerns related to disinfection by oxidants. The aim of this work is to evaluate the survival rate of microbial species in waters with different titers of H2S. Four selected thermal waters collected from Italian springs, belonging to different chemical categories, have been tested in comparison to Tyrrhenian sea water and natural mineral bottled water. Results show inhibition properties on bacterial proliferation that seem related to H2S concentrations. To further asses this phenomenon H2S was added to thermal and natural mineral waters. The results strongly support a bactericidal role of H2S in thermal spring waters used for recreational purposes. These observations open up new perspectives for a disinfectant role of H2S in pool treatment and management. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plasma ion values and mortality rates were compared for 450 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) of three sizes following direct transfer from fresh water to Black Sea water of about 18 ppt. In fish of 14.29+/-0.30 g, plasma Na+, Cl- and K+ levels significantly (p<0.05) rose above initial values five days after the transfer and peaked at 178.6+/-5.66, 153.9+/-0.14 and 1.14+/-0.04 mM/l, respectively. In 20.45+/-0.48 g fish, these values also rose significantly, reaching 172.4+/-4.24, 151.8+/-6.65 and 0.98+/-0.04 mM/l by day 5. In fish of 29.91+/-0.99 g, however, plasma Na+ and Cl- concentrations peaked 19 days after transfer, reaching only 165.5+/-6.43 and 142.9+/-8.34 mM/l, while plasma K+ reached its highest concentration of 1.02+/-0.06 mM/l on day 12, All three concentrations dropped to near initial values on day 26. In all groups, the plasma Ca2+ level rose significantly (p<0.05) above the initial value five days after transfer and then declined while the plasma P5+ concentration dropped on day 5, reaching a minimum on day 12 and recovering the initial level on day 26. The lowest mortality (8.0+/-1.89%) was recorded in the 30 g group, followed by 19.3+/-0.94% and 24.7+/-0.94% in the 20 g and 14 g groups. The failure of the smallest fish to adapt after direct transfer to sea water was likely due to excessively high plasma Na+ and Cl- concentrations and tissue dehydration, indicating that fish of 30 g best adapt to a seawater environment of 18 ppt.

AB  - Transgenerational effects, which involve both selection and plasticity, are important for the evolutionary adaptation of echinoderms in the changing ocean. Here, we investigated the effects of breeding design and water temperature for offspring on fertilization, hatchability, larval survival, size, abnormality and metamorphosis of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius, whose dams and sires were exposed to long-term (similar to 15 months) elevated temperature (similar to 3 degrees C above ambient) or ambient temperature. There was no transgenerational effect on fertilization and metamorphosis of S. intermedius, while negative transgenerational effects were found in hatchability and most traits of larval size. Dam and sire effects were highly trait and developmental stage dependent. Interestingly, we found S. intermedius probably cannot achieve transgenerational acclimation to long-term elevated temperature for survival provided their offspring were exposed to an elevated temperature. The present study enriches our understanding of transgenerational effects of ocean warming on sea urchins.

AB  - Heat hardening increases thermal resistance to more extreme temperatures in the laboratory. However, heat hardening also has negative consequences, and the net benefit of hardening has not been evaluated in the field. We tested short-term heat hardening effects on the likelihood of Drosophila melanogaster to be caught at different temperatures at baits in field sites without natural resources. We predicted that hardened flies should be more frequently caught at the baits at high but not low temperatures. Under cool conditions, flies hardened at 36 degrees C, and to a lesser extent at 34 degrees C, were less frequently caught at baits than nonhardened flies a few hours after release, indicating a negative effect of hardening. In later captures, negative effects tended to disappear, particularly in males. Under warm conditions, there was an overall balance of negative and positive effects, though with a different temporal resolution. Under very hot conditions, when capture rates were low, there was a large benefit of hardening at 36 degrees C and 34 degrees C but not 33 degrees C. Finally, based on climatic records, the overall benefit of hardening in D. melanogaster is discussed as an evolved response to high temperatures occasionally experienced by organisms at some locations.

AB  - YThe reproducibility of adaptive evolution is a long-standing debate in evolutionary biology. Kempher et al. (M. L. Kempher, X. Tao, R. Song, B. Wu, et al., mBio 11:e00569-20, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00569-20) used experimental evolution to investigate the effect of previous evolutionary trajectories on the ability of microbial populations to adapt to high temperatures. Despite the divergence caused by adaptation to previous environments, all populations reproducibly converged on similar final levels of fitness. Nevertheless, the genetic basis of adaptation depended on past selection experiments, reinforcing the idea that previous adaptation can dictate the trajectories of later evolutionary processes.

AB  - The olive (Olea europaea L.) is characterized by high drought tolerance and its roots show high transmigration capability and adaptability to changing conditions. Root growth is affected by the environment as is the functional specialization of each root structure. A quantity based analysis gives just a partial notion of the complexity of the process which allows the olive to be so adaptable. An experiment using rhizotrones was carried out that allowed sequential root growth, distribution, differentiation and mortality to be directly observed. Four olive trees were selected and a glass window for each tree (0.8 m deep by 1.3 m wide) was placed underground, 0.5 m away from the trunk in September 2007. Bi-weekly observations throughout the growing season made it possible to identify root growing rate and morphological changes. Based on their morphology roots observed have been divided into two different clusters <0.2 mm very fine (VF) roots, and >0.2 mm fine (F) roots. At no point during the observation period (from September 2007 to September 2008) did root growth stop, including winter months. The two clusters of roots behaved in a different way during the season. VF root growth peaked in February and F root growth from April to May. In both cases root growth drastically weakened from June to August with a faster reduction of VF roots. Root mortality was very low during the winter accelerating in May, likely influenced by an increase in temperatures. Root mortality slowed down deeper in the soil where moisture and temperature changes were not as high. All the presented results seem to be applicable to modern oliviculture, in high density orchard management, to obtain better control of the development of the whole plant and to reduce costs.

AB  - Countergradient variation (CGV) is defined as genetic variation that counteracts the negative influences of the physical environment, minimising phenotypic variability along an environmental gradient. CGV is thought to have relevance in predicting the response of organisms to climate variability and change. To test the hypothesis that growth rate increased with latitude, consistent with CGV, young-of-the-year (YOY) Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, were examined along a similar to 27 degrees latitudinal gradient in central and eastern Canada. Growth rates were estimated from fork lengths standardised by the thermal opportunity for growth based on experienced water temperatures derived using otolith oxygen stable isotopes. Results demonstrated patterns consistent with CGV, where northern populations demonstrated faster growth rates. A secondary aim was to test for similar geographical patterns in otolith-inferred metabolic rates, which reflect the energetic costs of standard metabolic rate (SMR) and other processes such as feeding, locomotion, thermoregulation, reproduction and growth. Results demonstrated a significant, positive relationship between otolith-inferred metabolic rate and latitude, which may reflect an increase in one, or a combination, of the above-noted physiological processes. The similar latitudinal pattern in growth and otolith-inferred metabolic rates suggests greater intake of food per unit of time by northern fish. The phenotypic variation in physiological traits observed here demonstrates the significant adaptability of Arctic charr to different thermal regimes with different growing season lengths. Determining the relative contributions of phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation to the observed latitudinal variation will be critical to predicting the responses of Arctic charr to climate change more accurately.

AB  - Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar L.) of wild (Namsen) and farmed (AquaGen) strains were transferred to fall-strength seawater (33 parts per thousand) for 0 (initial control group), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 30, 42 and 60 days at three different temperatures (4.3, 9.4 and 14.3 degreesC). Freshwater temperature in each tank was adjusted to test conditions 10 days prior to transfer. Physiological adaptation was monitored as changes in plasma growth hormone levels, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, plasma chloride levels and survival in seawater. Overall, smolts from the wild strain were better able to tolerate transfer to seawater than smolts from the hatchery strain. A delay in the osmotic disturbance and a prolonged period of osmotic stress were observed at the low temperature. Circulating GH levels increased transiently in all groups during the first 12-48 h in seawater and long-term GH levels were positively correlated with seawater temperature. Growth rates were influenced by temperature and strain, with the farmed smolts showing a higher growth than the wild smolts. Food Conversion Efficiency (FCE) was higher in smolts from the farmed strain, whereas no differences in daily food consumption were observed. Optimum temperature for FCE was calculated to be 10.5 degreesC, whereas the optimal temperature for growth in seawater was calculated to be 13.0 degreesC. We suggest that the observed differences in seawater tolerance, growth and food conversion probably are genetic and may reflect the fact that the hatchery fish have been bred for rapid growth for several generations.

TI  - Mitigation of Pollution-induced Deterioration of Digital Prints through Low-Temperature Storage
T2  - NIP29: 29TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL PRINTING TECHNOLOGIES / DIGITAL FABRICATION 2013
LA  - English
CP  - 29th International Conference on Digital Printing Technologies (NIP29) / Digital Fabrication 2013
AB  - An IPI survey found that approximately 87% of museums, libraries and archives already have digital prints in their collections and that they are concerned about increasing influxes of these materials. The survey also showed that objectionable deterioration has already occurred to some of their prints including fading, yellowing, color bleed, surface cracking and delamination. In total, 71% of institutions have already experienced deterioration in their digital print collections. Previous experimental research, both by IPI and others, has been able to establish a clear connection between ozone and nitrogen dioxide exposure and each of those forms of decay. Development of effective methods to mitigate such damage will, therefore, be critical to the survival of these objects for future generations. This study was aimed specifically at determining the efficacy of one particular approach, mitigating pollutant damage to digital prints through lowered-temperature storage. Since the deterioration due to pollutants occurs through chemical reactions, it may be possible to slow decay through cool or cold storage.
   The Arrhenius method was used to predict the times to significant fade or yellowing of prints exposed to 1 ppm ozone or 5 ppm nitrogen dioxide. Test targets were incubated at 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 45 degrees C at 50% RH for multiple intervals up to 56 days. Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black color patches were monitored using ANSI Status A density for density loss. Unprinted, white areas were monitored using ANSI Status A blue density for paper yellowing. It was found that lower temperature does in fact reduce the rates of decay but not equally for both pollutants. Low temperature was more effective at reducing yellowing caused by nitrogen dioxide than it was at reducing the fade caused by ozone; however, cool or cold storage can clearly mitigate damage and extend the usable life of digital prints in collections.

AB  - The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has been a serious public health emergency since 2015. Since Zika is a vector-borne disease, the size of the vector population in the affected area plays a key role in controlling the scale of the outbreak. The primary vectors for Zika, the Aedes Agypti and Aedes Albopictus species of mosquitoes, are highly sensitive to climatic conditions for survival and reproduction. Additionally, increased international travel over the years has caused the disease outbreak to turn into a pandemic affecting five continents. The mosquito population and the human travel patterns are the two main driving forces affecting the persistence and resurgence of Zika and other vector-borne diseases. This paper presents an enhanced dynamic model that simulates the 2013-2014 French Polynesia Zika outbreak incorporating the temperature dependent mosquito ecology and the local transit network (flights and ferries). The study highlights the importance of human travel patterns and mosquito population dynamics in a disease outbreak. The results predict that more than 85% of the population was infected by the end of the outbreak and it lasted for more than five months across the islands. The basic reproduction number (R-0) for the outbreak is also calculated using the next-generation-matrix for validation purposes. Additionally, this study is focused on measuring the impact of intervention strategies like reducing the mosquito population, preventing mosquito bites and imposing travel bans. French Polynesia was chosen as the region of interest for the study because of available demographic, climate and transit data. Additionally, results from similar studies for the region are available for validation and comparison. However, the proposed system can be used to study the transmission dynamics of any vector-borne disease in any geographic region by altering the climatic and demographic data, and the transit network.

AB  - In recent decades, the climate in northwest China has warmed significantly, especially since the 1980 s, and there has been a period of rapid temperature increase and abundant precipitation since 2010. This has a profound impact on the species structure, distribution and productivity of forest ecosystems. The results of many studies indicate that the response of radial tree growth to global climate change is nonlinear at high altitudes and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. However, altitudinal trends of tree radial growth response to climate change need to be investigated at different locations because of existing local variability in site-specific climatic conditions. Therefore, tree ring chronologies at high (2562 m), middle (2446 m) and low (2328 m) altitudes of Changling Mountain on the southern edge of the Tengger Desert were established to investigate the response to climate change. The results indicated that the interannual variation trends of the basal area increment (BAI) of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) at the three altitudes showed first increases, then decreases, and then showed increases again. Trees at the high altitude showed a significant decline in 1997, and those at the middle and low altitudes significantly declined after 1982, while all trees showed growth after 2010. The radial growth of Chinese pine at the three altitudes was mainly restricted by drought stress, but the radial growth at the middle and low altitudes was more restricted by mean temperature and mean maximum temperature. Chinese pine showed unstable responses to climatic factors at the three altitudes, with the middle and high altitudes showing a more stable response to precipitation in the previous year. The drought resistance of Chinese pine first increased and then decreased under drought events, while the resilience first decreased and then increased with climate change. The relationship between trees and climatic factors, as well as the growth pattern and resistance of trees, change with climate change, resulting in differences in survival strategies and adaptability to future climate conditions among trees at the three altitudes.

AB  - In the first generation (nymphal stage, about 20-degrees-C on average in Kochi) of a water strider, Aquarius paludum (Fabricius), the preoviposition period was longer than in the second generation (> 27-degrees-C) in both macropterous and brachypterous forms under natural conditions. The adults of both wing-forms showed lower fecundity in the early reproductive period than in the late one in the first generation. The oviposition process in the second generation, however, was the opposite of the first generation. Half of the females in the second generation entered diapause after the reproductive period. A high temperature of 28 +/- 2-degrees-C in the nymphal stage induced a shorter preoviposition period and higher fecundity than a low temperature of 20 +/- 2-degrees-C in both wing-forms. A stepwise reduction in photophase (14.5-12-10 h) in the early adult stage caused lower fecundity than a reduction of 14.5-10 h.

AB  - Using differential scanning calorimetry, we demonstrated the presence of biological glasses and measured the transition temperatures in dry encysted embryos (cysts) of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana. Cysts from the following three geographic locations were studied: San Francisco Bay (SFB); the Great Salt Lake, Utah (GSL); and the Mekong Delta, Vietnam (VN; these cysts were produced from previous sequential inoculations of SFB cysts into growth ponds). Values for the glass transition temperature, T g, were highest in VN cysts. This study indicates that the composition and properties of these biological glasses can be altered by natural selection and thermal adaptation. To our knowledge, T g values for all three kinds of cysts were significantly higher than those for any other desiccation-tolerant animal system. To gain insight into the significance of T g, we examined the thermal stability of these dry cysts at 80 degrees C. GSL cysts were the least tolerant, by far, with VN cysts being extremely tolerant and SFB cysts not far behind. Those results correlated with the thermal transition values. Also measured were alcohol-soluble carbohydrates, similar to 90% of which is the disaccharide trehalose, a known component of biological glasses. Amounts in the GSL cysts were significantly less than those in the other two kinds of cysts. Several stress proteins were measured in the three groups of cysts, with all of them being in lesser amounts in GSL cysts compared with the SFB and VN cysts. We interpret the data in terms of mechanisms involved with desiccation tolerance and thermal conditions at the sites of cyst collection.

AB  - This study examines the viability analysis of fixed-tilt and two axis tracking stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) power systems for electrical power generation in bioclimatic classification zones of the northeastern (NE) states of India where many remote villages are still un-electrified. Grid extension is not possible in many zones of the NE states of India because of the mountainous terrain. Therefore, as an alternative for un-electrified remote villages, the usage of stand-alone PV power systems may mitigate the power shortage problem. Based on the simulation model, the techno-economic analysis is carried out by using 22 years' of satellite-based monthly average solar radiation and temperature data. The typical load profile is also assumed for the purpose of analysis, which replicates the electrical appliances used by the end-users. The optimal fixed-tilt and optimal tracking PV system configuration along with optimal cost of energy (COE) is also obtained. The COE is found to be 0.383-0.497 $/kWh for the fixed-tilt PV system, and the same for the tracking PV system is obtained in the range of 0.523-0.732 $/kWh. From the fixed-tilt and tracking PV system, the monthly average electrical power, monthly average excess electrical power, monthly average unmet electrical load, monthly average inverter power, battery state of charge, and battery input power over the year are detailed, analyzed, and compared. Moreover, the capacity factor obtained in the case of a fixed-tilt PV system lies within the range of 14.2%-17.7% and the same is 17.6%-22.7% for the tracking PV system. Also, the findings of this study reveal detailed information regarding techno-economic and performance analysis of fixedtilt and tracking PV power systems, which may help policy makers or investors to develop PV technology for the NE states of India.

AB  - The Martian cryosphere is defined as that region of the crust where the temperature remains continuously below the freezing point of water. Previous estimates of its present thickness have ranged from similar to 2.3-4.7 km at the equator to similar to 6.5-12.5 km at the poles. Here we revisit these calculations, review some of the assumptions on which they were based, and investigate the effects of several parameters, not previously considered, on the cryosphere's thermal evolution and extent. These include astronomically driven climate change, the temperature-dependent thermal properties of an ice-rich crust, the potential presence of gas hydrate and perchlorate-saturated groundwater, and consideration of recent lower estimates of present-day global heat flow (which suggest a mean value roughly half that previously thought, effectively doubling the potential thickness of frozen ground). The implications of these findings for the continued survival of subpermafrost groundwater and its potential detection by the MARSIS radar sounder onboard Mars Express are then discussed. Although our estimates of the maximum potential thickness of the cryosphere have significantly increased, consideration of the likely range and spatial variability of crustal heat flow and thermal properties, in combination with the potential presence of potent freezing point depressing salts, may result in substantial local variations in cryosphere thickness. The locations that appear best suited for the detection of groundwater are those that combine low latitude (minimizing the thickness of frozen ground) and low elevation (minimizing the depth to a water table in hydrostatic equilibrium). Preliminary results from a MARSIS investigation of one such area are discussed.

AB  - Introduction - Sinigrin, a major glucosinolate present in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) seeds as the precursor of the anticancer compound allyl isothiocyanate, shows a wide range of biological activities. It's necessary to optimize the extraction methods and conditions, in order to improve the extraction productivity and save raw material.
   Objective - To systemically investigate and optimize the most important factors affected the productivity of sinigrin in the process of extraction using response surface methodology.
   Methodology - The ranges of three main factors including the ethanol concentration, extraction time and extraction temperature were selected by the one-factor-at-a-time method. The conditions of ultrasonic-stimulated extraction of sinigrin from defatted Indian mustard seed powder were optimized by Box-Behnken design to obtain the maximum productivity.
   Result - The predicted productivity (3.81%) was obtained using 57% ethanol concentration at 81 degrees C for 60 min, with the coefficient of the model R-2 > 0.96 (n = 17). The actual productivity (3.84 +/- 0.02%) of sinigrin under the optimized condition was increased by 70.67% compared with the result of conventional extraction. Meanwhile, HPLC, UV and IR were applied to examine if there is a difference between the ultrasonic-stimulated solvent extraction and conventional extraction, and the improvement of productivity of sinigrin depended on the destruction of cell wall caused by the elimination of outer pectinous material was explained by SEM and composition content analysis.
   Conclusion - The ultrasonic-stimulated solvent extraction was suggested to be a promising method to improve the productivity of sinigrin. And the results demonstrated that sinigrin productivity may be related to pectinous materials existed in the seeds. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Feed efficiency is a major goal for aquaculture sustainability, and selecting fish to genetically enhance this trait would be highly valuable. However, no selective breeding program specifically targeted to feed efficiency exists for farmed fish, mostly because of the difficulty of measuring individual feed intake. However, a negative phenotypic correlation between feed efficiency and weight loss at fasting has been previously demonstrated in sea bass submitted to feed deprivation (FD). We mated sea bass parents selected for their high (FD+) or low (FD-) weight loss at fasting to produce FD+ and FD- progeny, which were reared in a single tank to avoid common environmental effects. At 8 months of age, 1200 of those fish were submitted to three alternating periods of fasting (3 weeks) and re-feeding (3 weeks). Individuals were weighed at the end of each feeding and fasting period. Their line of origin was identified by genotyping of 12 microsatellite markers, resulting in 1130 unambiguously assigned fish (484 FD-, 686 FD+). FD- offspring lost significantly less weight than FD+ offspring in this feed deprivation trial. After that the feed efficiency of eight groups of 50 FD+ fish and eight groups of 50 FD- fish was evaluated in four successive 20-day periods. At the end of the fourth period, 10 fish per tank were sacrificed to evaluate their carcass yield. The FD- fish had a better overall growth and were fatter, and FD+ fish had a better carcass yield. A better feed efficiency was expected for the FD- fish, but differences between the two groups for this trait, measured either with feed efficiency ratio or with residual feed intake, were not consistently significant Although the two lines were clearly divergent for several traits, demonstration of feed efficiency differences between the FD+ and the FD- lines was not consistently observed in sea bass. A second generation of selection may allow further divergence in the lines and reveal differences in feed efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The potential to adapt to a changing climate depends in part upon the standing genetic variation present in wild populations. In corals, the dispersive larval phase is particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental stress. Larval survival and response to stress during dispersal and settlement will play a key role in the persistence of coral populations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To test the hypothesis that larval transcription profiles reflect location-specific responses to thermal stress, symbiont-free gametes from three to four colonies of the scleractinian coral Montastraea faveolata were collected from Florida and Mexico, fertilized, and raised under mean and elevated (up 1 to 2 degrees C above summer mean) temperatures. These locations have been shown to exchange larvae frequently enough to prevent significant differentiation of neutral loci. Differences among 1,310 unigenes were simultaneously characterized using custom cDNA microarrays, allowing investigation of gene expression patterns among larvae generated from wild populations under stress. Results show both conserved and location-specific variation in key processes including apoptosis, cell structuring, adhesion and development, energy and protein metabolism, and response to stress, in embryos of a reef-building coral.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results provide first insights into location-specific variation in gene expression in the face of gene flow, and support the hypothesis that coral host genomes may house adaptive potential needed to deal with changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Past research with high temperature molten carbonate electrochemical cells has shown that carbon dioxide can be separated from flue gas streams produced by pulverized coal combustion for power generation. However, the presence of trace contaminants, i.e., sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides, will impact the electrolyte within the cell. If a lower temperature cell could be devised that would utilize the benefits of commercially-available, upstream desulfurization and denitrification in the power plant, then this CO2 separation technique can approach more viability in the carbon sequestration area. Recent work has led to the assembly and successful operation of a low temperature electrochemical cell. In the proof-of-concept testing with this cell, an anion exchange membrane was sandwiched between gas-diffusion electrodes consisting of nickel-based anode electrocatalysts on carbon paper. When a potential was applied across the cell and a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide was flowed over the wetted electrolyte on the cathode side, a stream of CO2 to O-2 was produced on the anode side, suggesting that carbonate/bicarbonate ions are the CO2 carrier in the membrane. Since a mixture of CO2 and O-2 is produced, the possibility exists to use this stream in oxy-firing of additional fuel.
   From this research, a novel concept for efficiently producing a carbon dioxide rich effluent from combustion of a fossil fuel was proposed. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are captured from the flue gas of a fossil-fuel combustor by one or more electrochemical cells or cell stacks. The separated stream is then transferred to an oxy-fired combustor which uses the gas stream for ancillary combustion, ultimately resulting in an effluent rich in carbon dioxide. A portion of the resulting flow produced by the oxy-fired combustor may be continuously recycled back into the oxy-fired combustor for temperature control and an optimal carbon dioxide rich effluent.

AB  - The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft was placed into Mars orbit on September 11, 1997, and by March 9, 1999, had slowly circularized through aerobraking to a Sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit with an average altitude of 378 km. The science payload includes the Mars Orbiter Camera, Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, Thermal Emission Spectrometer, Ultrastable Oscillator (for Radio Science experiments), and Magnetometer/Electron Reflectometer package. In addition, the spacecraft accelerometers and horizon sensors were used to study atmospheric dynamics during aerobraking. Observations are processed to standard products by the instrument teams and released as documented archive volumes on 6-month centers by the Planetary Data System. Significant results have been obtained from observations of the interior, surface, and atmosphere. For example, Mars does not now have an active magnetic field, although strong remanent magnetization features exist in the ancient crust. These results imply that an internal dynamo ceased operation early in geologic time. Altimetry and gravity data indicate that the crust is thickest under the south pole, thinning northward from the cratered terrain to the northern plains. Analysis of altimetry data demonstrates that Mars is "egg-shaped" with gravitational equipotential contours that show that channel systems in the southern highlands drained to the north, largely to the Chryse trough. A closed contour in the northern plains is consistent with the existence of a great northern ocean. Emission spectra of low-albedo regions show that basaltic rocks dominate spectral signatures on the southern highlands, whereas basaltic andesites dominate the northern lowlands. The bright regions show nondiagnostic spectra, similar to that of dust in the atmosphere. Signatures of aqueous minerals (e.g., clays, carbonates, and sulfates) are noticeably absent from the emission spectra. High spatial resolution images show that the surface has been extensively modified by wind and that layering is nearly ubiquitous, implying that a complex history of events is recorded in surface and near-surface materials. Altimetry data imply that both permanent caps are composed of water ice and dust, with seasonal covers of carbon dioxide frost. Finally, the altimetry data, coupled with thousands of atmospheric profiles, are providing new boundary conditions and dynamic controls for the generation and testing of more realistic dynamic models of the global circulation of the atmosphere.

AB  - Adaptation of natural drosophila populations from the area radiocontaminated due to the Chernobyl accident (Vetka district of Gomel region) and from the control area (Berezinsky National Reserve) to irradiation was studied. Additional exposure to 40 Gy gamma-rays resulted in different responses of population samples - much more dominant and recessive lethal mutations arose in the population from the control area than from that with "radiation history". Viability of flies from Vetka district was much higher after additional irradiation in comparison with flies from Berezinsky Reserve. These facts prove that Vetka population is more resistant to radiation than Berezinsky one. When the population samples were kept under laboratory conditions without irradiation for 8 generations it was revealed that the mutation level in both populations increased at keeping under such conditions. Adaptation of Vetka population to irradiation remained, besides, the control population also became more resistant to ionizing radiation. It means that keeping of natural drosophila populations under laboratory conditions is a strong stress (limited space, overpopulation, other temperature and light conditions), which increases a mutation process and induces non-specific adaptation. In order to study the process of insect adaptation in detail we investigated experimental drosophila populations of 4 kinds: control, supplied with melanin, irradiated in each generation and irradiated with melanin. The samples of these populations were exposed to 30 Gy x-rays in the 55(th) generation. Dominant and recessive lethal mutation frequencies, induced by additional radiation exposure, were the lowest in the irradiated population - this population was best adapted to ionizing radiation impact. The population irradiated with melanin was less resistant. This may be explained by a radioprotective action of melanin - more radiosensitive genotypes were not eliminated by natural selection and remained in the population preventing its adaptation. Thus melanin which is an effective radioprotector against chronic irradiation is able to prevent adaptation process.

AB  - To date, very few studies have assessed the impact of summer droughts on forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Decreased ecosystem productivity and increased mortality are general consequences of drought on biodiversity. Competitive species, species adapted to cold and wet conditions as well as species with low reproduction rates and/or limited mobility seem the more affected. However, species-specific effects are regulated by mechanisms allowing for resistance to drought. The short-term consequences of drought on biodiversity depend on species abilities to resist, and to recover after, drought, and on competitive interactions between species. Although the abundance of many species generally decreases during drought, some taxa may increase in number during drought or shortly after. The effects of recurrent droughts must be evaluated in the wider context of global climate and habitat change. Considering the predicted increase in drought frequency and intensity, interdisciplinary research initiatives on this issue are needed urgently.

AB  - The carbon (C) dynamics of a bioenergy system are key to correctly defining its viability as a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuel energy sources. Recent studies have quantified the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of these bioenergy crops, often concluding that C sequestration in soils plays a primary role in offsetting emissions through energy generation. Miscanthus is a particularly promising bioenergy crop and research has shown that soil C stocks can increase by more than 2 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). In this study, we use a stable isotope (C-13) technique to trace the inputs and outputs from soils below a commercial Miscanthus plantation in Lincolnshire, UK, over the first 7 years of growth after conversion from a conventional arable crop. Results suggest that an unchanging total topsoil (0-30 cm) C stock is caused by Miscanthus additions displacing older soil organic matter. Further, using a comparison between bare soil plots (no new Miscanthus inputs) and undisturbed Miscanthus controls, soil respiration was seen to be unaffected through priming by fresh inputs or rhizosphere. The temperature sensitivity of old soil C was also seen to be very similar with and without the presence of live root biomass. Total soil respiration from control plots was dominated by Miscanthus-derived emissions with autotrophic respiration alone accounting for similar to 50 % of CO2. Although total soil C stocks did not change significantly over time, the Miscanthus-derived soil C accumulated at a rate of 860 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) over the top 30 cm. Ultimately, the results from this study indicate that soil C stocks below Miscanthus plantations do not necessarily increase during the first 7 years.

AB  - Recently, the release of antibiotics, such as sulfonamides, into the environment has raised significant concern due to the potential creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Thus, the development of remediation technologies for effluents containing such compounds is of utmost urgency. In this context, this work evaluated the creation of a resorcinol-based carbon xerogel/zinc oxide photocatalyst (XC/ZnO) to efficiently promote the photodegradation of the antibiotic known as sulfamerazine in aqueous media. The employment of this carbonaceous structure as a co-catalyst is justified by its high surface area and electrical conductivity. The methodology used in the synthesis of the composites was a simple one-pot reaction, combining the simultaneous precipitation of zinc oxide and polycondensation of the resorcinol-based carbon gel. Regarding the composites' characterization, X-ray diffractometry confirms that the composites have the Wurtzite structure of the zinc oxide, whereas the carbon xerogel formation is evidenced by the infrared, diffuse reflectance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Morphology-wise, the XC/ZnO is arranged as nodular particle agglomerates, with particles between 500 nm and 50 nm. The photocatalytic tests under simulated solar radiation show that the composites developed are superior to the pure oxide in the photodegradation of sulfamerazine, as all XC/ZnO materials developed achieved higher apparent reaction rate constants (kapp) than pure zinc oxide, with the XC/ZnO 0.5 material obtaining a kapp 75% higher than the one observed for the ZnO sample. Furthermore, the chronoamperometry tests confirmed that the optimized composite (XC/ZnO 0.5) has a greater capacity for photocurrent generation when compared to pure zinc oxide. Therefore, the modification proposed was successful to enhance the photodegradation of sulfamerazine in aqueous media, highlighting the viability of the composites developed for photocatalytic applications.

AB  - The use of agricultural residues for the generation of bioethanol has the potential to substitute fuels such as petrol or first-generation bioethanol and thereby generate environmental benefits. Scientific research in this field typically confines the environmental dimension to global warming, disregarding other environmental impact and damage categories. By multi-criteria mixed-integer linear programming, this work examines environmental benefits and economic viability of optimal second-generation bioethanol production network configurations to substitute petrol and/or first-generation bioethanol in the EU. The results comprise environmentally optimal decisions for 18 impact and 3 damage categories, as well as economically optimal solutions for different excise and carbon tax scenarios. The impact categories global warming potential, particulate matter, and land use are affected the most. Optimal network decisions for different environmental objectives can be clustered into three groups of mutual congruencies, but opportunity costs between the different groups can be very high, indicating conflicting decisions. The decision to substitute petrol or first-generation ethanol has the greatest influence. The results of the multi-dimensional analysis suggest that the damage categories human health and ecosystem quality are suitable to unveil tradeoffs between conflicting environmental impacts, for example, global warming and land use. Taking human health and ecosystem quality as environmental decision criteria, second-generation bioethanol should be used to concurrently substitute first-generation bioethanol and petrol (100% and 18% of today's demand in the EU, respectively). However, economic optimization shows that with current taxation, bioethanol is hardly competitive with petrol, and that excise tax abatement or carbon taxes are needed to achieve these volumes.

AB  - Hydrogen as an energy currency, carrier and storage medium may be a key component of the solution to problems of global warming, poor air quality and dwindling reserves of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrogen is a flexible storage medium and can be generated by the electrolysis of water. It is particularly advantageous if an electrolyser may be simply and efficiently coupled to a source of renewable electrical energy. This paper examines direct coupling of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser to a matched solar photovoltaic (PV) source for hydrogen generation and storage. Such direct coupling with minimum interfacing electronics would lead to substantial cost reduction and thereby enhance the economic viability of solar-hydrogen systems. The electrolyser is designed for fail-safe operation with multiple levels of safety and operational redundancy. A control system in the electrolyser unit provides for disconnection when required and for auto-start in the morning and auto shut-down at night, simultaneously addressing the goals of minimum energy loss and maximum safety. The PV system is a 2.4 kW array (20.4 m(2) total area) comprising 30, 12 V, 80 W, Solarex polycrystalline modules in a series-parallel configuration. The integrated system has been operated for approximately 60 days over a 4-month period from September 2007 to January 2008 with many periods of unattended operation for multiple days, experiencing weather ranging from hot and sunny (above 40 degrees C) to cool and cloudy. The principle and practicality of direct coupling of a suitably matched PV array and PEM electrolyser have been successfully demonstrated. Details of electrolyser operation coupled to a PV array along with modelling work to match current-voltage characteristics of the electrolyser and PV system are described.

AB  - This study explored the potential of carbon emission reduction and financial feasibility of urban rooftop photovoltaic (PV) power applications with a case study in Beijing. Life cycle CO2 emission factors of thermal power and rooftop PV power generation were calculated and compared. Rooftop area suitable for installation of PV in the urban region of Beijing was estimated. Three use patterns were proposed and the potential of CO2 emission reduction of PV for each pattern were estimated. Financial feasibility analysis was conducted for different PV power subsidization and environmental externality internalization scenarios, and sensitivity analysis was applied to test the impacts of initial investment, carbon price, air pollutant tax rates and PV power generation subsidy variation. The life cycle CO2 emission factor of rooftop PV power in Beijing is estimated to be 87.01 g CO2-eq./kWh, and the CO2 emission reduction factor in Beijing of rooftop PV power substitution for coal-fired thermal power generation amounts to 919.34 g CO2-eq./kWh. The potential of rooftop PV power generation in Beijing varies from 3298.48 to 6734.32 M kWh/y, with the annual CO2 emission reduction estimated to be 3.03-6.19 Mt. Initial investment is among the main barriers for rooftop PV to become financially feasible. Govern [rental subsidies to initial investment and PV power generation are necessary for their significant role in improving financial viability of urban rooftop PV application. However, ongoing subsidies might have been too high. Even when such subsidies are reduced by 50-70%, the PV applications are still financially feasible. Environmental tax and carbon trading are also recommended to internalize environmental benefit of PV application. It is estimated that when carbon price is 4-8 times higher than the current price level for the three patterns can the projects pass the financial feasibility test. To reach the same goal, SO2 and NOx tax rates should also be much higher than their current level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The global population growth of the bed bug, Cimex lectularius (L.), is attributed to their cryptic behavior, diverse insecticide resistance mechanisms, and lack of public awareness. Bed bug control can be challenging and typically requires chemical and non-chemical treatments. One common non-chemical method for bed bug management is thermal remediation. However, in certain instances, bed bugs are known to survive heat treatments. Bed bugs may be present after a heat treatment due to (i) abiotic factors associated with the inability to achieve lethal temperatures in harborage areas for a sufficient time period, (ii) re-infestation from insects that escaped to cooler areas during a heat treatment or (iii) development of physiological resistance that allows them to survive heat exposure. Previous research has investigated the optimal temperature and exposure time required for either achieving complete mortality or sublethally affecting their growth and development. However, no research has examined bed bug populations for their ability to develop resistance to heat exposure and variation in thermo-tolerance between different bed bug strains. The goals of this study were: i) to determine if bed bugs could be selected for heat resistance under a laboratory selection regime, and ii) to determine if bed bug populations with various heat exposure histories, insecticide resistance profiles, and geographic origins have differential temperature tolerances using two heat exposure techniques (step-function and rampfunction). Selection experiments found an initial increase in bed bug survivorship; however, survivorship did not increase past the fourth generation. Sublethal exposure to heat significantly reduced bed bug feeding and, in some cases, inhibited development. The step-function exposure technique revealed non-significant variation in heat tolerance between populations and the ramp-function exposure technique provided similar results. Based on these study outcomes, the ability of bed bugs to develop heat resistance appears to be limited.

AB  - situ coal gasification is a method of extracting a high proportion of the energy value from coal without the need for mining. In situ conversion of coal to combustible gases is achieved by drilling wells into the seam, injecting gasification agents and initiating combustion. The product gases are then extracted to surface using production wells. These gases are clean energy sources for power generation, heating or synthetic fuel production. In situ coal gasification is of particular interest with respect to its lower environmental impact, potential application to otherwise inaccessible energy resources (ie offshore, deep deposits or beneath protected lands) and low capital intensity. Practical application of this clean technology is restricted primarily by lack of satisfactory quantitative descriptions of the processes involved, in particular the hydromechanical processes.
   In this study, three characteristic physical zones of an in situ gasifier are identified as the rubble zone, combustion front and virgin coal zone. Coupled mechanical processes of coal consumption and overburden collapse are used to describe the permeability profile in the rubble zone. Additionally, the redistribution of overburden load associated with coal consumption is accounted for with the formulation of a stress (compressive) dependent permeability profile, which is applied to the virgin coal zone. The model was implemented into and solved by FEMLAB, an advanced computer simulation tool. The flow process, according to Darcy's Law, is subsequently described in terms of permeability dependent injectivity. Injectivity is an indicator of flow velocity, which has been identified as a crucial factor in determining the commercial value of product gases from in situ coal gasification. The stress alteration to coal permeability was found to have a dominating influence on the flow process. This finding implies that a greater understanding of the in situ coal burning induced deformation of surrounding rocks would be of significant value in assessing the economic viability of applying this clean technology to potential sites.

AB  - This study examines economic viability of combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems when applied to the Department of Energy (DOE) reference large office building in three locales in the U.S.: San Francisco, Boston, and Miami. For realistic power generation unit (PGU) sizes, annual, monthly, and hourly operation costs are estimated using local utility tariffs and compared to those of conventional separate heat and power systems. The results show that compared to conventional systems, CCHP systems reduce operation cost by 0.11-0.42 million $/y in San Francisco and Boston, whereas they increase the cost by 0.16-0.29 million $/y in Miami. The cost savings are mainly attributed to electricity savings; therefore, be maintained unless electricity costs drastically decrease. Considerable cost savings are attributed to both energy and demand charges if tariff structures estimate demand charges as much as energy charges (e.g., San Francisco). Under time-of-use rates, the largest cost saving occurs during peak periods because of high utilization of PGUs that significantly reduces energy and demand charges. Although a larger PGU capacity yields a greater cost saving, an over-sized PGU decrease profitability. The results suggest that for regions with relatively expensive natural gas and low electricity cost, CCHP systems would not be profitable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Pan-Okhotsk region, which is part of the western North Pacific Ocean, is famous for its active volcanoes, which are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and that enrich the surrounding waters with essential chemicals. Therefore, this region, including the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, is characterized by rich biota. Bacterioplankton plays a significant part in biological communities and is an indicator of ecosystem function. Analyzing the adaptability of three representatives of the microbiota of the Pan-Okhotsk region was the goal of our investigation. Marinomonas primoryensis KMM3633(T) (MP), Yersinia ruckeri KMM821 (YR), and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis 598 (YP) from the G.B. Elyakov Pacific Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry were studied by means of genomic and bioinformatic methods. The list of membrane translocator proteins, metabolism pathways, and cold shock and antifreeze proteins that were revealed in the genome of MP characterized this bacterium as being adaptable to free living in marine conditions, even at winter temperatures. The genomic potential of YR and YP makes not only survival in the environment of the Pan-Okhotsk region but also pathogenesis in eukaryotic organisms possible. The data obtained will serve as a basis for further ecosystem monitoring with the help of microbiota research.

AB  - The development of conservation genomics will be greatly aided by the use of neutral as well as adaptive molecular markers. Identifying novel adaptive molecular markers that have general application across diverse taxa is challenging, especially in Arthropods where few if any examples of balanced polymorphisms exist that are shared across species. A review of literature on the Pgi gene provides strong evidence for population level fitness consequences of genetic variation in this gene, across very diverse lineages of Arthropods. While these observations demonstrate the potential of using Pgi as an adaptive molecular marker, this gene is fundamentally different from the adaptive markers MHC and SI. Rather than providing insights into individual genetic health, Pgi appears to have a role in conservation genetics by providing insights into gene by environment interactions, local adaptation and evolutionary significant units, and potentially even morphologically cryptic dispersal phenotypes. These findings argue for studying Pgi variation in more species, as it appears central to the goals of conservation genomics.

AB  - Changes in environmental temperature can pose considerable challenges to animals and shifts in thermal habitat have been shown to be a major force driving species' adaptation. These adaptations have been the focus of major research efforts to determine the physiological or metabolic constraints related to temperature and to reveal the phenotypic characters that can or should adjust. Considering the current consensus on climate change, the focus of research will likely shift to questioning whether ectothermic organisms will be able to survive future modifications of their thermal niches. Organisms can adjust to temperature changes through physiological plasticity (e. g., acclimation), genetic adaptation, or via dispersal to more suitable thermal habitats. Thus, it is important to understand what genetic and phenotypic attributes-at the individual, population, and species levels-could improve survival success. These issues are particularly important for ectotherms, which are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding environment. To start addressing these queries, we should consider what physiological or metabolic functions are responsible for the impact of temperature on organisms. Some recent developments indicate that mitochondria are key metabolic structures determining the thermal range that an organism can tolerate. The catalytic capacity of mitochondria is highly sensitive to thermal variation and therefore should partly dictate the temperature dependence of biological functions. Mitochondria contain a complex network of different enzymatic reaction pathways that interact synergistically. The precise regulation of both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production depends on the integration of different enzymes and pathways. Here, we examine the temperature dependence of different parts of mitochondrial pathways and evaluate the evolutionary challenges that need to be overcome to ensure mitochondrial adaptations to new thermal environments.

AB  - The climate is currently warming fast, threatening biodiversity all over the globe. Populations often adapt rapidly to environmental change, but for climate warming very little evidence is available. Here, we investigate the pattern of adaptation to an extreme +10 degrees C climate change in the wild, following the introduction of brine shrimp Artemia franciscana from San Francisco Bay, USA, to Vinh Chau saltern in Vietnam. We use a resurrection ecology approach, hatching diapause eggs from the ancestral population and the introduced population after 13 and 24 years (similar to 54 and similar to 100 generations, respectively). In a series of coordinated experiments, we determined whether the introduced Artemia show increased tolerance to higher temperatures, and the extent to which genetic adaptation, developmental plasticity, transgenerational effects, and local microbiome differences contributed to this tolerance. We find that introduced brine shrimp do show increased phenotypic tolerance to warming. Yet strikingly, these changes do not have a detectable additive genetic component, are not caused by mitochondrial genetic variation, and do not seem to be caused by epigenetic marks set by adult parents exposed to warming. Further, we do not find any developmental plasticity that would help cope with warming, nor any protective effect of heat-tolerant local microbiota. The evolved thermal tolerance might therefore be entirely due to transgenerational (great)grandparental effects, possibly epigenetic marks set by parents who were exposed to high temperatures as juveniles. This study is a striking example of "missing heritability," where a large adaptive phenotypic change is not accompanied by additive genetic effects.

AB  - We studied the variation of thermal parameters of Odontophrynus occidentalis between season (wet and dry) in the Monte desert (Argentina). We measured body temperatures, microhabitat temperatures, and operative temperatures; while in the laboratory, we measured the selected body temperatures. Our results show a change in the thermal parameters of O. occidentalis that is related to environmental constraints of their thermal niche. Environmental thermal constraints are present in both seasons (dry and wet), showing variations in thermal parameters studied. Apparently imposed environmental restrictions, the toads in nature always show body temperatures below the set point. Acclimatization is an advantage for toads because it allows them to bring more frequent body temperatures to the set point. The selected body temperature has seasonal intraindividual variability. These variations can be due to thermo-sensitivity of toads and life histories of individuals that limits their allocation and acquisition of resources. Possibly the range of variation found in selected body temperature is a consequence of the thermal environmental variation along the year. These variations of thermal parameters are commonly found in deserts and thermal bodies of nocturnal ectotherms. The plasticity of selected body temperature allows O. occidentales to have longer periods of activity for foraging and reproduction, while maintaining reasonable high performance at different temperatures. The plasticity in seasonal variation of the thermal parameters has been poorly studied, and is greatly advantageous to desert species during changes in both seasonal and daily temperature, as these environments are known for their high environmental variability.

AB  - This paper compares the results of a techno-economic performance analysis of three combustion plants for the recovery of energy from three types of biomass: solid recovered fuel (SRF), forestry waste wood chips (FWWC), and crude rape seed oil (RSO). Small and medium scale plants have been investigated, 50 kilo tonnes per annum (ktpa) and 160 ktpa combustion plants utilising FWWC, 50 ktpa and 100 ktpa plants treating SRF, and an internal combustion engine plant at 27 ktpa and 40 ktpa utilising RSO. The technical assessment includes calculations for electricity generation, heat produced and overall system efficiency. The economic viability of the different processes is investigated through a discounted cash flow analysis. The levelised cost is used to calculate the cost of production of one unit of electricity. The effect of changing model input parameters on the economic performance is evaluated. Seven different system variables have been chosen and the effect of a +/- 10% change on the levelised cost has been examined. The results showed that the levelised cost of the SRF plant is mainly affected by calorific value, turbine efficiency, capital and operating costs. The parameters which affect the FWWC biomass plant are the calorific value, steam turbine efficiency, capital and operating costs. Whereas, parameters affecting the RSO biomass plant are the calorific value, engine efficiency, capital and operating costs. A techno-economic analysis of the plants indicates the SRF plant is economical at both scales. The RSO plant and the FWWC plant are only economical at the medium scales investigated. The 40 ktpa RSO plant is found to be the most efficient one at 52% compared with 28% efficiency for the SRF plant, it is also the most economically viable option with a 25% IRR compared to 17% IRR for the FWWC plant, and 10% IRR for the SRF plant.

AB  - Mass- and laboratory-rearing of insects is a key component of several integrated pest management strategies. However, mass- or laboratory-rearing can have dramatic effects on insect performance via laboratory adaptation, inbreeding depression, inadvertent selection or through direct rearing effects (e.g. crowding and artificial diets). Thus, when rearing insects intended for field release, or when research is intended to reflect wild population performance, there is a need to establish quality under these conditions. In reality, however, much of the focus on quality control of mass- or laboratory-reared insects concerns maintenance of facility output (i.e. numbers) and, to a much lesser extent, individual trait effects (e.g. mating competitiveness or field flight performance). This is due to both practical issues (time or budget constraints), but also to limited understanding of the relationship between laboratory and field assays and the basic biology of the species. Regardless, trait performance is widely acknowledged as an essential factor in integrated pest management success. Recent studies on basic insect biology have made significant progress in understanding several aspects of field performance, such as the ability for thermal treatments to mitigate poor performance via phenotypic plasticity or the effects of artificial selection, and have lessons which may transfer to applied quality control for pest management. Here, we review the key challenges faced in insect rearing when focussing on quality control for field performance, some major recent advances in understanding field performance of insects in relation to environmental factors (e.g. thermal adaptation), and the potential synergies between basic biology and quality control research foci.

AB  - Selective laser melting (SLM) technique requires remelting of adjacent tracks to avoid cavities and other imperfections. Usually, very conservative process parameters are chosen to avoid imperfections, resulting in a low building rate. The process efficiency relates the energy required for the generation of a new track to the laser beam power. For SLM, this efficiency is determined by the process parameters, specifically hatch distance, layer depth, and scanning speed, independent of the resulting process mechanisms. For SLM, the process efficiency is often very low, typically 2%-20%. Apart from beam reflection losses of normally 50%-60%, significant energy losses result from the remelting of surrounding layers. Some areas can even experience multiple remelting cycles. Further losses originate inevitably from substrate heating. A simplified mathematical model of the track cross section and the corresponding layer overlap geometry has been developed to analyze the different loss contributions from remelting with respect to the process parameters. The model explains why increasing the hatch distance or the layer depth proportionally increases the process efficiency. However, these increases are limited by cavity formation. The cross section of the overlapping tracks generated by SLM can be regarded as an experimental fingerprint linked to the process conditions. The track cross section geometries can significantly fluctuate in terms of area and coordinate position. The fluctuations require additional reduction of the hatch distance or layer depth to ensure robust, cavity-free processing. Examples are presented for stainless steel where a 180 W laser beam has led to a process efficiency of 5%-11%, proportional to a hatch distance that was increased from 50 to 110 mu m, for 40 mu m powder layer depth, at a speed of 50 m/min.

AB  - Temperature is a crucial environmental factor affecting the survival and growth of aquatic organisms. However, the global warming caused by the growth of greenhouse gas emission has severely affected the sustainable development of global nature ecosystem. The change in water temperature has caused a disorder in the aquatic ecosystems. Lota lota lota is a unique member of cold-freshwater codfish; it has an important economic value like its marine relatives. It is also a good model for studying the molecular mechanisms of temperature adaptability of fish. In this study, RNA sequencing based on the Illumina HiSeq(TM) 2500 platform was used to reveal gene expression at the transcriptome level. Transcriptome profiles were generated from liver and brain samples from fish exposed to (0 degrees C, 17 degrees C and 28 degrees C). A total of 30,958 annotated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in all comparisons, with more DEGs in high-temperature groups (1668) than in low-temperature groups (1110). GO analysis was divided into three extensive categories and 55 subcategories. A series of candidate genes and pathways associated with temperature responsiveness was detected, mainly including heatshock protein (HSP) family, fatty acid desaturase (FAD) and antigen processing and presentation. The expression levels of HSP70 were highest amongst those of the HSP family members in the high-temperature groups, implying that HSP70 was an efficient biomarker of high temperature challenge in L. lota lota. An obvious upward trend in the expression of FAD was conducive to regulating fatty acid composition and maintaining membrane fluidity under low-temperature stress. In addition, evidence indicated that elevated temperature had a large influence on immune function and heat stress could upregulate the immune-related pathways in L. lota lota.

AB  - We study the time evolution of the survival probability and the spin polarization of a dissipative nondegenerate two-level system in the presence of a magnetic field in the Faraday configuration. We apply the Extended Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble approach to model the stochastic system-environment interaction and calculate the survival and spin polarization to first and second order of the interaction picture. We present also the time evolution of the thermal average of these quantities as functions of the temperature, the magnetic field, and the energy-levels density, for (E)Es, in the subohmic, ohmic, and superohmic dissipation forms. We show that the behavior of the spin polarization calculated here agrees rather well with the time evolution of spin polarization observed and calculated, recently, for the electron-nucleus dynamics of Ga centers in dilute (Ga,N)As semiconductors.

AB  - Understanding the factors influencing habitat selection is critical to improving management and conservation plans for large whales. Many studies have linked the distribution of cetaceans to basic environmental features such as underwater topography and sea surface temperature (SST), but the mechanisms underlying these relationships are poorly understood. Dynamic mesoscale processes like thermal fronts are prime candidates to link physiographic factors to whale distribution because they increase biological productivity and aggregate prey. However, previous studies of large whales have found little evidence of such associations, possibly because they were not at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. We quantified the relationship between SST fronts and the distribution of blue Balaenoptera musculus, finback B. physalus, humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke B. acutorostrata whales in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We compared the distribution of 1094 whale sightings collected from boat surveys conducted in 1996 to 2000 to the locations of frontal areas determined from 61 satellite maps. The distributions of whales and thermal fronts were highly correlated (random resampling and Mantel tests of matrix similarity). Spatial distributions differed among species, probably reflecting differences in feeding strategies. Identification of surface fronts from satellite imagery thus effectively complemented field observations of whales. These findings significantly increase our understanding of habitat quality in rorqual whales, and encourage a greater use of dynamic environmental variables in future studies of whale habitat use.

AB  - The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) is a foundation species inhabiting estuaries along the North American west coast. In California estuaries, O. lurida is adapted to local salinity regimes and populations differ in low salinity tolerance. In this study, oysters from three California populations were reared for two generations in a laboratory common garden and subsequently exposed to low salinity seawater. Comparative transcriptomics was then used to understand species-level responses to hyposmotic stress and population-level mechanisms underlying divergent salinity tolerances. Gene expression patterns indicate Olympia oysters are sensitive to hyposmotic stress: All populations respond to low salinity by up-regulating transcripts indicative of protein unfolding, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest after sub-lethal exposure. Among O. lurida populations, transcriptomic profiles differed constitutively and in response to low salinity. Despite two generations in common-garden conditions, transcripts encoding apoptosis modulators were constitutively expressed at significantly different levels in the most tolerant population. Expression of cell death regulators may facilitate cell fate decisions when salinity declines. Following low salinity exposure, oysters from the more tolerant population expressed a small number of mRNAs at significantly higher levels than less tolerant populations. Proteins encoded by these transcripts regulate ciliary activity within the mantle cavity and may function to prolong valve closure and reduce mortality in low salinity seawater. Collectively, gene expression patterns suggest sub-lethal impacts of hyposmotic stress in Olympia oysters are considerable and that even oysters with greater low salinity tolerance may be vulnerable to future freshwater flooding events.

AB  - The development of energy generation by solar thermal has been rigorously highlighted worldwide, but efforts to extend this energy resource have yet to be made by ASEAN countries. This paper discusses the emergence of solar thermal applications in the ASEAN region and their challenges. The heat demand profile by temperature range in major industrial sectors in Malaysia to represent the region is also presented. Furthermore, this paper provides an industrial viewpoint regarding awareness and technical know-how required to implement solar thermal in the sector successfully. The results indicated that solar thermal offers vast opportunities for its integration with the existing industry, which operates in the low-temperature range of below 150 degrees C to the medium-temperature range of 150-400 degrees C for diverse applications, such as drying, cooking, cleaning, oleochemicals, and fertiliser manufacturing. The results showed that 26% of the respondents are strongly aware of solar thermal technologies. However, most respondents reported some barriers, such as costly solar collectors and lack of knowledge of solar thermal technology selection. Meanwhile, nearly 38% of the respondents believed that the technology could provide energy-saving and environmental benefits (25%), whereas 18% believed that incentives might increase the share of solar renewable energy in the energy mix.

AB  - Refuges provide shelter from predators, and protection from exposure to the elements, as well as other fitness benefits to animals that use them. In ectotherms, thermal benefits may be a critical aspect of refuges. We investigated microhabitat characteristics of refuges selected by a heliothermic scincid lizard, Carlia rubrigularis, which uses rainforest edges as habitat. We approached lizards in the field, simulating a predator attack, and quantified the refuge type used, and effect of environmental temperatures (air temperature, substrate temperature and refuge substrate temperature) on the amount of time skinks remained in refuges after hiding (emergence time). In respone to our approach, lizards were most likely to flee into leaf litter, rather than into rocks or woody debris, and emergence time was dependent on refuge substrate temperature, and on refuge substrate temperature relative to substrate temperature outside the refuge. Lizards remained for longer periods in warmer refuges, and in refuges that were similar in temperature to outside. We examined lizard refuge choice in response to temperature and substrate type in large, semi-natural outdoor enclosures. We experimentally manipulated refuge habitat temperature available to lizards, and offered them equal areas of leaf litter, woody debris and rocks. When refuge habitat temperature was unmanipulated, lizards (85%) preferred leaf litter, as they did in the field. However, when we experimentally manipulated the temperature of the leaf litter by shading, most skinks (75%) changed their preferred refuge habitat from leaf litter to woody debris or rocks. These results suggest that temperature is a critical determinant of refuge habitat choice for these diurnal ectotherms, both when fleeing from predators and when selecting daytime retreats.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal biology of the Mexican lizards Sceloporus aeneus and Sceloporus bicanthalis (Phrynosomatidae). Sceloporus aeneus is oviparous, and has an elevation range of approximately 2400-3000 m. It is replaced at elevations above 3000 m by its viviparous sister species, S, bicanthalis, whose elevational range extends to at least 4250 m. Selected body temperatures (T-sel) were measured on a laboratory thermal gradient. Mean selected body temperatures of S. aeneus and S. bicanthalis were 35.5 and 34.9 C, respectively. T-sel's for these two high elevation species were thus similar to T-sel of low elevation Sceloporus, an observation that supports the static view of the thermal physiology of Sceloporus lizards. For neither species did selected body temperature vary as a function of sex or reproductive status of females. Body temperatures during activity in the field were not related to the time of year or the reproductive status of females, although male S, bicanthalis at one site had higher body temperatures than females. The mean daily maximum air temperature declined from 22 C at the S, aeneus site at 2800 m, to 19 C at the S, bicanthalis site at 3200 m, and to 8 C at the S. bicanthalis site at 4100 m. Mean body temperatures at these sites were 32, 32, and 29 C, respectively. These species were thus active at body temperatures lower than their "preferred" body temperatures, presumably because of increasingly limited thermal opportunities at high elevations.

AB  - A reduced graphene oxide-V2O5 nanocomposite was synthesized by a low temperature surfactant free hydrothermal method and its MFC performance was assessed. The structural properties of the synthesized nanocomposite were studied by X-ray diffraction. Field emission scanning electron microscopy of the nanocomposite revealed a wrinkled paper-like structure of rGO and a nanobelt-like structure of V2O5. This study estimated the viability of the graphene-based nanocomposite rGO-V2O5 as a novel cathode catalyst in single chamber air-cathode MFCs. A series of MFCs with different catalyst loadings were produced. The electrochemical behavior of the MFCs was calculated by cyclic voltammetry. The MFCs with the rGO-V2O5 nanocomposite cathode exhibited superior maximum power densities (83%) to those with the pure V2O5 cathodes. The rGO-V2O5 with a double-loaded nanocomposite catalyst achieved an enhanced power density of 1668 +/- 11 mW m(-2) and an OCP of 698 +/- 4 mV, which was 83% of that estimated for the Pt/C 2004 +/- 15 mW m(-2) nanocomposite cathode. The significant increase in power density suggests that the reduced graphene oxide-V2O5 nanocomposite is a promising material for MFC applications. The CV result showed good agreement with the MFC result. The prepared rGO-V2O5 nanocomposite cathode, particularly with a double loading catalyst, is promising as a sustainable low-cost green material for stable power generation and long-term operation of MFCs.

AB  - The precision and the extent of behavioral thermoregulation are likely to provide fitness benefits to ectotherms. Yet the factors driving variation in selected or preferred body temperature (T-set) and its usefulness as a proxy for optimal physiological temperature (T-opt) are still debated. Although T-set is often conserved among closely related species, substantial variation at the individual, population and species level has also been reported. However, the repeatability (calculated as the intra-class correlation coefficient) of T-set is generally low. One factor that influences T-set is feeding status, with fed reptiles typically showing higher T-set, a process thought to aid meal digestion. Here, using experiments simulating realistic feeding and fasting regimes in Agama atra, a heliothermic lizard from southern Africa, we test if T-set and its repeatability under these 2 states significantly differ. Daily T-set ranged from 33.7 to 38.4 degrees C, with a mean (+/- SE) of 36.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C for fed and 36.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C for unfed individuals. Comparisons of repeatability showed that females tend to be more consistent in the selection of body temperature than males, but not significantly so regardless of feeding status. We report some of the highest repeatability estimates of T-set to date (full range: 0.229-0.642), and that the weak positive effects of feeding status on T-set did not increase its repeatability. In conclusion, one of the major prerequisites for natural selection, consistent among-individual variation, is present, making the adaptive significance of T-set considerably more plausible.

AB  - Rising mortality due to cancer has led to the development and identification of newer targets and molecules to cure the disease. Telomerase is one of the attractive targets for design of many chemotherapeutic drugs. This research highlights the designing of novel telomerase inhibitors using ligand-based (3D-QSAR) and structure-based (molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation) approaches. For the development of the 3D-QSAR model, 37 synthetic molecules reported earlier as telomerase inhibitors were selected from diversified literature. Three different alignment methods were explored; among them, distill alignment was found to be the best method with good statistical results and was used for the generation of QSAR model. Statistically significant CoMSIA model with a correlation coefficient (r(ncv)(2)) value of 0.974, leave one out (q(2)) value of 0.662 and predicted correlation coefficient (r(pred)(2)) value of 0.560 was used for the analysis of QSAR. For the MDS study, A-chain of telomerase was stabilised for 50 ns with respect to 1-atm pressure, with an average temperature of 299.98 k and with potential energy of 1,145,336 kJ/m converged in 997 steps. Furthermore, the behaviour study of variants towards the target revealed that active variable gave better affinity without affecting amino acid sequences and dimensions of protein which was accomplished through RMSD, RMSF and Rg analysis. Results of molecular docking study supported the outcomes of QSAR contour maps as ligand showed similar interactions with surrounded amino acids which were identified in contour map analysis. The results of the comprehensive study might be proved valuable for the development of potent telomerase inhibitors.

AB  - Hyadaphis foeniculi (Passerini) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a cosmopolitan species and the main pest of fennel in northeastern Brazil. Understanding the relationship between temperature variations and the population growth rates of H. foeniculi is essential to predict the population dynamics of this aphid in the fennel crop. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of constant temperature on the adult prereproductive period and the life table fertility parameters (infinitesimal increase ratio (r(m)), gross reproduction rate (GRR), net reproduction rate (R-0), finite increase ratio (lambda), generation time (GT), the time required for the population to double in the number of individuals (DT), and the reproduction value (RVx)) of the fennel pest H. foeniculi. The values of lx (survival of nymphs at age x) increased as the temperature rose from 15 to 28 degrees C and fell at 30 degrees C, whereas mx (number of nymphs produced by each nymph of age x) increased from 15 to 25 degrees C and fell at 28 and 30 degrees C. The net reproduction rates (R-0) of populations of H. foeniculi increased with temperature and ranged from 1.9 at 15 degrees C to 12.23 at 28 degrees C for each generation. The highest population increase occurred with the apterous aphids at 28 degrees C. The rate of population increase per unit time (r(m)) (day) ranged from 0.0033 (15 degrees C) to 0.1995 (28 degrees C). The highest values of r(m) were recorded at temperatures of 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The rm values were a good fit to the models tested, with R-2 > 0.91 and R-adj(2) > 0.88. The models tested (Davidson, Sharpe and DeMichele modified by Schoolfield et al., Logan et al., Lamb, and Briere et al.) were very good fits for the rm values observed, with R-2 > 0.91 and R-adj(2) > 0.88. The only exception was the Davidson model. Of the parameters studied, the reproductive capacity was higher in the apterous aphids, with the unique exception of daily fecundity at 28 degrees C, which was higher in the alate aphids of H. foeniculi. Parameters relating to the age-specific fertility table for H. foeniculi were heavily influenced by temperature, with the highest biotic potential and population growth capacity found at 34 degrees C. Therefore, the results obtained in this study could be of practical significance for predicting outbreaks of fennel aphids and improving the management of this aphid in fennel crops.

AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization of peptides was investigated using alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. In each experiment, a set of mass spectra was collected by repetitive irradiation of a spot on a sample. Even though shot-to-shot variation in spectral pattern was significant, it was reproducible for different spots and samples. Each spectrum was tagged with the temperature in the early plume (T-early) estimated through kinetic analysis of the peptide ion survival probability. T-early decreased as the shot continued because the thermal conduction got more efficient as the sample got thinner. From each spectral set collected under various experimental conditions, a spectrum tagged with a particular T-early was selected. Then, patterns of the spectra thus selected were the same. The reaction quotient for the matrix-to-peptide proton transfer determined at a specified T-early was independent of the sample composition, indicating quasi-thermal equilibrium for this reaction. Furthermore, the van't Hoff plots were linear, also indicating quasi-thermal equilibrium. This, together with the thermal kinetics for the fragmentation of peptide and matrix ions, is responsible for the reproducibility of the mass spectral pattern at a specified T-early.

AB  - This study provides a descriptive analysis of the North Male, Maldives seven years after the 1998 bleaching disturbance to determine the state of the coral community composition, the recruitment community, evidence for recovery, and adaptation to thermal stress. Overall, hard coral cover recovered at a rate commonly reported in the literature but with high spatial variability and shifts in taxonomic composition. Massive Porites, Pavona, Synarea, and Goniopora were unusually common in both the recruit and adult communities. Coral recruitment was low and some coral taxa, namely Tubipora, Seriatopora, and Stylophora, were rarer than expected. A study of the bleaching response to a thermal anomaly in 2005 indicated that some taxa, including Leptoria, Platygyra, Favites, Fungia, Hydnophora, and Galaxea astreata, bleached as predicted while others, including Acropora, Pocillopora, branching Porites, Montipora, Stylophora, and Alveopora, bleached less than predicted. This indicates variable-adaptation potentials among the taxa and considerable potential for ecological reorganization of the coral community. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Determining the adaptive potential of foundation species, such as reef-building corals, is urgent as the oceans warm and coral populations decline. Theory predicts that corals may adapt to climate change via selection on standing genetic variation. Yet, corals face not only rising temperatures but also novel diseases. We studied the interaction between two major stressors affecting colonies of the threatened coral, Acropora cervicornis: white-band disease and high water temperature. We determined that 27% of A. cervicornis were disease resistant prior to a thermal anomaly. However, disease resistance was largely lost during a bleaching event because of more compromised coral hosts or increased pathogenic dose/virulence. There was no tradeoff between disease resistance and temperature tolerance; disease susceptibility was independent of Symbiodinium strain. The present study shows that susceptibility to temperature stress creates an increased risk in disease-associated mortality, and only rare genets may maintain or gain infectious disease resistance under high temperature. We conclude that A. cervicornis populations in the lower Florida Keys harbor few existing genotypes that are resistant to both warming and disease.

AB  - Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) have the potential to revolutionize near infrared spectroscopy of crowded fields in astronomy. These devices, however, are not designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures as necessary for the infrared bandpass. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the viability of DMDs for use in infrared applications by testing the devices at cryogenic temperatures. In total, eleven DMDs were tested, each being cooled in a cryo-vacuum chamber to cryogenic temperature; approximately 90 K. Each device endured three cooldown and warmup cycles on average. Units tested include six stock, unaltered, DMDs from Texas Instruments (TM), as well as five re-windowed devices. Results indicate that stock devices function reliably at cryogenic temperature, however window-replaced devices had a high failure rate; likely due to contamination in the window-replacement process. Based on these results, it appears that stock devices perform reliably enough at cryogenic temperatures for reliable use in an instrument, but more research is needed into the re-windowing process before re-windowed devices are used within spectrographs.

AB  - The most widely accepted hypothesis invokes cold climates as the selective force responsible for the evolution of viviparity in reptiles. The ''cold climate'' hypothesis proposes that viviparity is adaptive in cold climates because developing embryos experience warmer temperatures in utero (through maternal thermoregulation) than they would in a nest. Most authors have assumed that these warmer incubation temperatures provide an advantage by protecting embryos from lethally low temperatures or by allowing them to hatch before the onset of winter. Thus, the ''cold climate'' hypothesis (at least in its traditional form) purports that viviparity evolves in cold climates because females that retain their developing offspring in utero will have greater reproductive success than females that lay their eggs in a nest. To test this hypothesis, I conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment using the reproductively bimodal Australian lizard, Lerista bougainvillii. Gravid oviparous and viviparous females were transplanted into field enclosures in both a ''hot'' and a ''cold'' climate, to monitor the effects of climate on their reproductive success. The live-bearers had higher reproductive success than the egg-layers in both climates, but reproductive success did not differ between the hot and cold climates within either reproductive mode. The viviparous lizards were more successful at producing offspring, regardless of climatic conditions. Thus, viviparity provided an advantage (in terms of embryo and/or neonate survival) under the conditions of the experiment, but this advantage was not restricted to cold environments.

AB  - Soybean is a most promising sustainable protein source for feed and food to help meet the protein demand of the rapidly rising global population. To enrich soy protein, the environment-friendly enzymatic processing requires multiple carbohydrases including cellulase, xylanase, pectinase, alpha-galactosidase and sucrase. Besides enriched protein, the processing adds value by generating monosaccharides that are ready feedstock for biofuel/bioproducts. Aspergillus could produce the required carbohydrases, but with deficient pectinase and alpha-galactosidase. Here we address this critical technological gap by focused evaluation of the suboptimal productivity of pectinase and alpha-galactosidase. A carbohydrases-productive strain A. niger (NRRL 322) was used with soybean hull as inducing substrate. Temperatures at 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C were found to affect cell growth on sucrose with an Arrhenius-law activation energy of 28.7 kcal/mol. The 30 degrees C promoted the fastest cell growth (doubling time = 2.1 h) and earliest enzyme production, but it gave lower final enzyme yield due to earlier carbon-source exhaustion. The 25 degrees C gave the highest enzyme yield. pH conditions also strongly affected enzyme production. Fermentations made with initial pH of 6 or 7 were most productive, e.g., giving 1.9- to 2.3-fold higher pectinase and 2.2- to 2.3-fold higher alpha-galactosidase after 72 h, compared to the fermentation with a constant pH 4. Further, pH must be kept above 2.6 to avoid limitation in pectinase production and, in the later substrate-limiting stage, kept below 5.5 to avoid pectinase degradation. alpha-Galactosidase production always followed the pectinase production with a 16-24 h lag; presumably, the former relied on pectin hydrolysis for inducers generation. Optimal enzyme production requires controlling the transient availability of inducers.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe the benefits of sugar cane ethanol in Brazil, appointing the productivity of this type of fuel based on hectares of plantation, its carbon dioxide cycle and the contribution to reduce the greenhouse effect. In the following step the uses of ethanol for hydrogen production by steam reforming is analyzed and some comparison with natural gas steam reforming is performed. The sugar cane industry in Brazil, in a near future, in the hydrogen era, could be modified according to our purpose, since besides the production of sugar, and ethylic and anhydric alcohol, Brazilian sugar cane industry will also be able to produce biohydrogen.
   Fuel cells appear like a promising technology for energy generation. Among several technologies in the present, the PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is the most appropriate for vehicles application, because it combines durability, high power density, high efficiency, good response and it works at relatively low temperatures. Besides that it is easy to turn it on and off and it is able to support present vibration in vehicles. A PEMFC's problem is the need of noble catalysts like platinum. Another problem is that CO needs to be in low concentration, requiring a more clean hydrogen to avoid fuel cell deterioration.
   One part of this paper was developed in Stockholm, where there are some buses within the CUTE (clean urban transport for Europe) project that has been in operation with FC since January 2004. Another part was developed in Guaratingueta, Brazil. Brazil intends to start up a program of FC buses. As conclusion, this paper shows the economical analysis comparing buses moved by fuel cells using hydrogen by different kinds of production.

AB  - In 2003, experiments on rootstock breeding and grafting for melon, pepper, tomato and cowpea were started in Chhattisgarh, a state in Central India. Muskmelon cultivation in India is challenged by Fusarium wilt. Landraces of 220 melons were collected in 2009. Snap melon (SM), acid melon (AM) and wild melon (WM) were self-crossed for eight generations, grown on wilt infected soil and 20 hybrid combinations made from the selected lines. Parent lines and crosses were used for grafting melons and tested along-with self-grafted (check) melons, led to selection of an F-1 hybrid rootstock, which is a combination of SMxAM. Other rootstock solutions developed by VNR include eggplant rootstock for grafting tomatoes, hot pepper rootstock for grafting of sweet pepper and hot pepper, interspecific pumpkin and citron (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides) rootstocks for grafting of water melon, and cowpea rootstock for grafting cowpea for resistance against nematodes and Fusarium wilt. Healing of grafted plants was a challenge due to extremely high temperatures and was solved by replacing the polyethylene with thin white muslin cloth on healing tunnels. This improved grafting success to 98% and making production with grafted plants economical. The technology was commercialized in Chhattisgarh and disseminated to nine other states of India by training staff at more than 50 professional nurseries. Grafting has enabled farmers to grow the crop according to market needs and improve profitability.

AB  - Aquatic macrophytes; Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and Azolla, biomass have certain advantages over terrestrial plant biomass to use as non-edible feed for 2nd generation bioenergy production. This is mainly due to the lower lignin content and higher productivity of aquatic macrophytes. These macrophytes do not require arable land. Present study explored on development of factorial approach based optimal pretreatment process for mild acid hydrolysis of Eichhornia crassipes and Azolla microphylla biomass for conversion to fermentable sugars. The simpler structure of aquatic plants translates to higher sugar recovery using milder pretreatment conditions compared to terrestrial plants. H2SO4 & HCl used in mild concentrations for acid hydrolysis experiments. Approximately, 20% of the dry biomass was recovered as fermentable sugar (mainly xylose) upon treatment with dilute sulphuric acid (0.5-1.5% v/v) or hydrochloric acid (2-4% v/v) at 100-120 degrees C for 30-60 min. Within this range of parameters, sugar yield followed a simple additive model, implying that a decrease in sugar yield is due to reduction of one parameter. This provides a choice between high temperature short time (HTST) and low temperature long time (LTLT) treatments. HTST requires sophisticated pressure vessels and correspondingly higher capital investment for the advantage of a higher throughput. LTLT treatments can be performed in cost economy manner using relatively simple equipment. For economic, environmental and technical reasons, acid addition should be kept to a minimum, which is possible by a choice of higher temperature and longer treatment time. Such pretreatment may be employed as the first step of a two-step pretreatment process prior to enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic fraction. The acid pre-treated hydrolysate of water hyacinth and Azolla microphylla explored for hydrogen production through dark fermentation process through employment of C-5 & C-6 sugar utilizing microbe Enterobacter cloacae DT-1 strain.

AB  - Growing concerns over the environmental impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, uncertainty of future fossil fuel prices, geopolitical instability, and consumer preferences are a few factors driving the development and use of biomass as a source of renewable energy. Government mandates and policy frameworks have further built consensus for effective utilization of sustainable resources for energy. As a result, biomass derived densified solid biofuels have experienced a phenomenal growth in the last decade and are expected to grow by 56% during the three decades from 2010 to 2040. Solid biomass represents the largest share of biomass used for heat and electricity generation. Biomass sources range from agricultural, municipal, and commercial wastes, to forest-litter, and energy crops. Because of the varied nature of these sources, harvesting practices and the cost of transportation, several methods have been developed to densify the biomass. The long-term viability and growth of biobased energy products hinges on the technical innovation and wider societal acceptance of these products. This paper reviews multiple biomass feedstock, processing characteristics, product properties, transportation, and storage options. The paper also discusses the economics of densifying biomass, the impacts to regions where biomass utilization is implemented, outstanding challenges, and national and global trends in biomass utilization.

AB  - The degree-day (DD) model is an important tool for forecasting pest phenology and voltinism. Unfortunately, the DD model is inaccurate, as is the case for the Oriental migratory locust. To improve the existing DD model for this pest, we first studied locust development in seven growth chambers, each of which simulated the complete growing-season climate of a specific region in China (Baiquan, Chengde, Tumotezuoqi, Wenan, Rongan, Qiongzhong, or Qiongshan). In these seven treatments, locusts completed 0.95, 1, 1.1, 2.2, 2.95, 3.95, and 4.95 generations, respectively. Hence, in the Baiquan (700), Rongan (2400), Qiongzhong (3200), and Qiongshan (2400) treatments, the final generation were unable to lay eggs. In a second experiment, we reared locusts for a full generation in growth chambers, at different constant temperatures. This experiment provided two important findings. First, temperatures between 32 and 42 degrees C did not influence locust development rate. Hence, the additional heat provided by temperatures above 32 degrees C did not add to the total heat units acquired by the insects, according to the traditional DD model. Instead, temperatures above 32 degrees C represent overflow heat, and can not be included when calculating total heat acquired during development. We also noted that females raised at constant 21 degrees C failed to oviposit. Hence, temperatures lower than 21 degrees C should be deducted when calculating total heat acquired during adult development. Using our experimental findings, we next micmiked 24-h temperature curve and constructed a new DD model based on a 24-h temperature integral calculation. We then compared our new model with the traditional DD model, results showed the DD deviation was 166 heat units in Langfang during 2011. At last we recalculated the heat by our new DD model, which better predicted the results from our first growth chamber experiment.

AB  - The concept of thermal dose is widely adopted in the simulation of thermal therapies to estimate the formation of ablation lesions. However, such approaches typically use empirical assumptions, and treat the formation of a lesion as an end result from heating and not as a factor that could influence the temperature profile. In this study, the forming of lesions during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy is interpreted as a denaturation process involving an irreversible phase transformation, and is a critical factor influencing the evolution of the temperature profile. Based on this notion and HIFU experiments performed on the pork tenderloin and egg white-based gel phantom, an important but often neglected phenomenon during the formation of the HIFU ablation lesion - referred to as the thermal confinement - was revealed. The thermal confinement, resulted from latent heat effects, exhibits features such as a substantial time delay in reaching maximum temperature around the ultrasound focal spot after turning off HIFU, and a lower-than-expected peak temperature attained during the ablation. A theoretical model capable of predicting the thermal confinement phenomenon and the changes in the temperature profile associated with it was successfully constructed. In addition, a modified bioheat transfer equation with the effect of latent heat from denaturation was proposed. The simulated temperature profiles further revealed the extent of the influence of the thermal confinement is strongly dependent on the position relative to the ultrasound focal spot.

AB  - In this work, the optimal operating temperature for the enzymatic isomerization of glucose to fructose using a continuous immobilized glucose isomerase packed bed reactor is studied. This optimization problem describing the performance of such reactor is based on reversible pseudo linear kinetics and is expressed in terms of a recycle ratio. The thermal deactivation of the enzyme as well as the substrate protection during the reactor operation is considered. The formulation of the problem is expressed in terms of maximization of the productivity of fructose. This constrained nonlinear optimization problem is solved using the disjoint policy of the calculus of variations. Accordingly, this method of solution transforms the nonlinear optimization problem into a system of two coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the initial value type, one equation for the operating temperature profile and the other one for the enzyme activity. The ODE for the operating temperature profile is dependent on the recycle ratio, operating time period, and the reactor residence time as well as the kinetics of the reaction and enzyme deactivation. The optimal initial operating temperature is selected by solving the ODEs system by maximizing the fructose productivity. This results into an unconstrained one-dimensional optimization problem with simple bounds on the operating temperature. Depending on the limits of the recycle ratio, which represents either a plug flow or a mixed flow reactor, it is found that the optimal temperature of operation is characterized by an increasing temperature profile. For higher residence time and low operating periods the residual enzyme activity in the mixed flow reactor is higher than that for the plug flow reactor, which in turn allows the mixed flow reactor to operate at lower temperature than that of the plug flow reactor. At long operating times and short residence time, the operating temperature profiles are almost the same for both reactors. This could be attributed to the effect of substrate protection on the enzyme stability, which is almost the same for both reactors. Improvement in the fructose productivity for both types of reactors is achieved when compared to the constant optimum temperature of operation. The improvement in the fructose productivity for the plug flow reactor is significant in comparison with the mixed flow reactor.

AB  - Purpose The Respiratory Health in Northern Europe, Spain and Australia (RHINESSA) cohort was established to (1) investigate how exposures before conception and in previous generations influence health and disease, particularly allergies and respiratory health, (2) identify susceptible time windows and (3) explore underlying mechanisms. The ultimate aim is to facilitate efficient intervention strategies targeting multiple generations. Participants RHINESSA includes study participants of multiple generations from ten study centres in Norway (1), Denmark (1), Sweden (3), Iceland (1), Estonia (1), Spain (2) and Australia (1). The RHINESSA core cohort, adult offspring generation 3 (G3), was first investigated in 2014-17 in a questionnaire study (N=8818, age 18-53 years) and a clinical study (subsample, n=1405). Their G2 parents participated in the population-based cohorts, European Community Respiratory Heath Survey and Respiratory Health In Northern Europe, followed since the early 1990s when they were 20-44 years old, at 8-10 years intervals. Study protocols are harmonised across generations. Findings to date Collected data include spirometry, skin prick tests, exhaled nitric oxide, anthropometrics, bioimpedance, blood pressure; questionnaire/interview data on respiratory/general/reproductive health, indoor/outdoor environment, smoking, occupation, general characteristics and lifestyle; biobanked blood, urine, gingival fluid, skin swabs; measured specific and total IgE, DNA methylation, sex hormones and oral microbiome. Research results suggest that parental environment years before conception, in particular, father's exposures such as smoking and overweight, may be of key importance for asthma and lung function, and that there is an important susceptibility window in male prepuberty. Statistical analyses developed to approach causal inference suggest that these associations may be causal. DNA methylation studies suggest a mechanism for transfer of father's exposures to offspring health and disease through impact on offspring DNA methylation. Future plans Follow-up is planned at 5-8 years intervals, first in 2021-2023. Linkage with health registries contributes to follow-up of the cohort.

AB  - The adaptive potential of the northernmost Pinus sylvestris L. (and other northern tree) populations is considered by examining first the current patterns of quantitative genetic adaptive traits, which show high population differentiation and clines. We then consider the postglacial history of the populations using both paleobiological and genetic data. The current patterns of diversity at nuclear genes suggest that the traces of admixture are mostly visible in mitochondrial DNA variation patterns. There is little evidence of increased diversity due to admixture between an eastern and western colonization lineage, but no signal of reduced diversity (due to sequential bottlenecks) either. Quantitative trait variation in the north is not associated with the colonizing lineages. The current clines arose rapidly and may be based on standing genetic variation. The initial phenotypic response of Scots pine in the north is predicted to be increased survival and growth. The genetic responses are examined based on quantitative genetic predictions of sustained selection response and compared with earlier simulation results that have aimed at more ecological realism. The phenotypic responses of increased growth and survival reduce the opportunity for selection and delay the evolutionary responses. The lengthening of the thermal growing period also causes selection on the critical photoperiod in the different populations. Future studies should aim at including multiple ecological and genetic factors in evaluating potential responses.

AB  - Genetic diversity is a primary component of adaptive evolution, and its loss or reduction can decrease the long-term survival probability of populations. Utilization of cryopreserved semen may be considered a perfect tool to improve genetic diversity, reduce inbreeding, and avoid animal translocation for breeding. The present study aimed at finding a reliable epididymal sperm freezing protocol for the critically endangered onager (Equus hemionus onager). Six testicles from three animals were processed postmortem. The effects of two transportation temperatures (22 degrees C and 4 degrees C; testicles submerged in saline), two cryopreservation techniques (conventional liquid nitrogen vapor freezing in straws and directional freezing in 8-ml HollowTubes (TM)), and two postthaw incubation temperatures (22 degrees C and 37 degrees C; evaluated after 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hr) were tested in a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design. Sperm samples were evaluated for motility, viability, acrosome integrity, and sperm morphology. The resulting optimal freezing protocol includes transportation of testicles at 4 degrees C, cryopreservation by directional freezing, and, if needed, postthaw incubation at 22 degrees C. With this combination of transportation temperature and cryopreservation technique, the authors obtained the following postthaw values normalized to prefreezing values: 60.3 +/- 8.8% motility, 60.7 +/- 13.3% viability, 75.3 +/- 9.5% acrosome integrity, and 94.7 +/- 2.9% normal morphology (excluding defects due to the epididymal origin of the sperm). After incubation at 22 degrees C, motility values for the above combination were 40 +/- 5.7%, 30.3 +/- 5.2%, 28.3 +/- 4.4%, and 16.7 +/- 4.4% for 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hr, respectively. In conclusion, with this protocol, good quality semen can be stored for future use in artificial inseminations when and where needed.

AB  - Adaptation to increasing temperatures may enable species to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change. Sea turtles have temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) and variation in the thermal reaction norm, which influences offspring sex ratio, has been suggested as a potential adaptive mechanism to rising global temperatures. Here, we investigate the sex ratio of green turtle Chelonia mydas offspring from nests on beaches with notable differences in their thermal properties, to look for evidence of localised adaptation. We compared pivotal temperatures and hatch success in both the laboratory and in situ using eggs laid on two nesting beaches (dark vs. pale sand) at Ascension Island that represent the extremes of the range of incubation temperatures experienced by this population. We found no effect of beach of origin on pivotal temperatures, hatch success, or hatchling size in the laboratory or the wild. This suggests that turtles from the same rookery are not locally adapted to different thermal conditions experienced during incubation. Under predicted climate change scenarios, this will result in reduced hatch success and an increased proportion of female offspring unless temporal or spatial range shifts occur.

AB  - The old, stable cores of continents - cratons - are underlain by thick and cold mantle keels, composed of melt-depleted and low density peridotite residues. The origins of these thick keels are debated. Were these thick keels formed in situ, by orogenic thickening, or by underplating of buoyant residual mantle? Key to this debate is determining the temperature and pressure at which the protoliths of cratonic peridotites melted (igneous protolith conditions) and comparing to their metamorphic (subsolidus) temperatures and pressures within the keel. This paper presents a method for explicit calculation of the temperatures and pressures at which the peridotite protoliths melted. The approach relies only on the bulk FeO and MgO of residual peridotites. A system of equations consisting of mass balance and new calibrations of Mg peridotite/melt partitioning and melt productivity is then solved simultaneously. The igneous protoliths of abyssal peridotites are found to have melted at effective pressures of 1-2 GPa and temperatures of 1300-1400 degrees C, within error of the magmatic temperatures and pressures of melt extraction inferred independently from the SiO2 and MgO contents of mid-ocean ridge basalts. Archean cratonic peridotites, after filtering for the secondary effects of refertilization and orthopyroxene-metasomatism, give igneous protolith pressures and temperatures of 1-5 GPa (30-150 km) and 1400-1750 degrees C, similar to magmatic temperatures and pressures determined for Archean basalts thought to be representative of the thermal state of the Archean ambient mantle. Most importantly, cratonic peridotite protolith pressures and temperatures are shallower and hotter than their subsolidus equilibration pressures (3-7.5 GPa; 90-200 km) and temperatures (900-1300 degrees C), which reflects the recent thermal state of the cratonic lithosphere. Specifically, for individual samples with both melting and subsolidus thermobarometric constraints, we find that subsolidus pressures are 1-2 GPa (30-60 km) higher than their igneous protolith pressures although some of the deepest samples experienced minor increases in pressure. Collectively, these results support the suggestion that the building blocks of cratons were generated by hot shallow melting with a mantle potential temperature 200-300 degrees C warmer than the present. This shallowly generated mantle was subsequently thickened during orogenic episodes, culminating in the formation of a thick, stable craton. Whether such thickening has any modern analogs cannot be answered from this work alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Amelioration of biofuel feedstock of microalgae using sustainable means through synthetic ecology is a promising strategy. The co-cultivation model (Tetraselmis striata and Pelagibaca bermudensis) was evaluated for the robust biofuel production under varying stressors as well as with the selected two-stage cultivation modes. In addition, the role of metabolic exudates including the quorum-sensing precursors was assessed.
   Results: The co-cultivation model innovated in this study supported the biomass production of T. striata in a saline/marine medium at a broad range of pH, salinity, and temperature/light conditions, as well as nutrient limitation with a growth promotion of 1.2-3.6-fold. Hence, this developed model could contribute to abiotic stress mitigation of T. striata. The quorum-sensing precursor dynamics of the growth promoting bacteria P. bermudensis exhibited unique pattern under varying stressors as revealed through targeted metabolomics (using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, LC-MS). P. bermudensis and its metabolic exudates mutually promoted the growth of T. striata, which elevated the lipid productivity. Interestingly, hydroxy alkyl quinolones independently showed growth inhibition of T. striata on elevated concentration. Among two-stage cultivation modes (low pH, elevated salinity, and nitrate limitation), specifically, nitrate limitation induced a 1.5 times higher lipid content (30-31%) than control in both axenic and co-cultivated conditions.
   Conclusion: Pelagibaca bermudensis is established as a potential growth promoting native phycospheric bacteria for robust biomass generation of T. striata in varying environment, and two-stage cultivation using nitrate limitation strategically maximized the biofuel precursors for both axenic and co-cultivation conditions (T and T-PB, respectively). Optimum metabolic exudate of P. bermudensis which act as a growth substrate to T. striata surpasses the antagonistic effect of excessive hydroxy alkyl quinolones [HHQ, 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines and PQS (pseudomonas quorum signal), 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone].

AB  - The brain requires constant oxygen supply to perform its biological functions essential for survival. Because of low oxygen capacity and poor oxygen diffusibility of water, many fish species have evolved various adaptive mechanisms to cope with depleted oxygen. Endothelial cells (EC) are the primary components responsible for controlled environment of brain. Brain homeostasis largely depends on integrity of the EC. To elucidate their adaptive strategy, EC were isolated from the fish brain of Kovalam-control site and Ennore estuary-test/field hypoxic site and were subjected to low oxygen tension in laboratory. Cell viability, 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were analyzed to ascertain stress. Hypoxic insult, cytoprotective role of HSPs and apoptotic effect were analyzed by assessing hypoxia-inducible-factor-alpha (HIF1 alpha), heat-shock-protein-70 (HSP70), heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK1). This study evidenced that HSP70 and HO-1 are the key stress proteins, confer high tolerance to decreased oxygen tension mediated stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The thermoregulation behaviour of the adult codling moth, Cydia pomonella, is investigated in the laboratory using temperature gradient experiments. Unmated males and females are tested at dawn when moths typically move to resting sites. Mated females are tested during oviposition over a complete diurnal cycle. Temperature strongly affects microhabitat selection in adult moths. Unmated males and females prefer to rest at the low-temperature ends of temperature gradients between 15 and 32 degrees C. Relative humidity does not influence the thermal response in unmated females, whereas males show a less distinct temperature selection under high humidity. By contrast to unmated moths, ovipositing females prove to be highly thermophilous (i.e. they deposit the highest proportions of their eggs in the zones of highest temperatures of gradients between 15 and 36 degrees C). This striking discrepancy in thermal response of females between their premating and oviposition period is likely to reflect an adaptation to different selection pressures from the thermal environment. Unmated moths may benefit from low temperatures by a longer lifespan and crypsis within the tree canopy, whereas the choice of warmer oviposition sites by mated females will favour a faster development of eggs.

AB  - The viabilities of five strains of Vibrio vulnificus were evaluated during the storage of the organisms in sterile seawater at 5 degrees C. The number of CFU was measured by plate count methods on rich media. The total cell numbers were determined by direct microscopic count methods. The titer of CPU declined logarithmically to undetectable levels over a period of 2 to 3 weeks, while the total cell numbers were unchanged. Midway through each study, higher culturable cell counts began to be observed on plates containing catalase or sodium pyruvate; during the latter stages of the study, the plate counts on such media were up to 1,000-fold higher than those on unsupplemented plates. Because autoclaving is known to generate hydrogen peroxide in rich media, and because catalase and sodium pyruvate are known to eliminate hydrogen peroxide, it appears that the conditions of the experiments led to the selection of a hydrogen peroxide-sensitive culturable cell subpopulation, at the time of the final stage of the decline in viability of each culture, hydrogen peroxide-sensitive cells were the only culturable cells present. Warming samples of the cultures to room temperature led to the growth of these residual culturable cells, utilizing nutrients provided by the nonculturable cells. The cells that grew recovered hydrogen peroxide resistance. When mixtures of culturable and nonculturable cells mere diluted to the point where only nonculturable cells were present, or when the hydrogen peroxide-sensitive culturable cells had declined to undetectable levels, warming had no effect; no culturable cells were recovered. Warming has been reported to "resuscitate" nonculturable cells. Recognition of the existence of hydrogen peroxide-sensitive culturable cell populations, as well as their ability to grow to high levels in the warmed sea,vater microcosms, leads instead to the conclusion that while warming permits culturable cells to grow, it has no effect on nonculturable cells.

AB  - Samples of electrolytic tough pitch copper were deformed in equal channel angular pressing with enhanced productivity to quickly refine its initial coarse-grained microstructure at room temperature. The evolution in microstructure and changes in a broad range of properties were compared to a sample in the undeformed state. The microstructure evolution was evaluated using electron backscatter diffraction for both states and transmission electron microscopy for a detailed microstructure characterization of the deformed sample. The microstructure observations were correlated with the results of tensile tests, electrochemical tests in 3.5 wt% NaCl, electrical conductivity measurements and thermal stability up to 200 A degrees C. The ECAP process employed in this study caused a grain refinement from about 16 A mu m to about 600 nm. The microstructure refinement caused a 50% increase in both the YS and UTS. The elongation to failure, due to the high amount of LAGBs, maintained a high value of 13.3%. The corrosion and pitting potentials were higher for the deformed sample. Furthermore, the grain refinement caused a decrease in electrical conductivity from 100.2% IACS to 93.1% IACS, a drop of 7% IACS. The deformed sample displayed thermal stability up to a temperature of 175 A degrees C, where there was a drop in micro-hardness of more than 10%.

AB  - Using several approaches, we studied the acid stress response of different strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus. We showed that after an acid shock, the cell survival varied considerably between strains and that all the studied strains were able to develop an acid adaptive response. For one of these strains, we characterized, using two-dimensional electrophoresis, the modifications in the protein pattern induced by acid adaptation. Out of the 50 proteins up-regulated under the adaptive conditions, 21 were identified after N-terminal sequencing. They belong to different functional categories including stress response and general metabolism. To allow a larger genetic exploration of L. bulgaricus, the genome of the type strain ATCC 11842 was sequenced in collaboration with the Genoscope. All together, these genomic and post-genomic data should lead to a better understanding of L. bulgaricus physiology and its environmental adaptability.

AB  - Most aphids develop a cyclic parthenogenesis life-cycle. After several generations of viviparously produced parthenogenetic females, follows a single annual generation of sexual individuals, usually in autumn, that mate and lay the sexual eggs. Shortening of photoperiod at the end of the summer (together with temperature) is a key factor inducing the sexual response. Currently no genes involved in the cascade of events that lead to the appearance of sexual forms have been reported. After a Differential Display RT-PCR survey performed on Acyrthosiphon pisum aphids, we identified a gene that is overexpressed in aphids reared under short photoperiod conditions that induce sexuality in this species. This cDNA (called ApSDI-1) shows similarities with a protein involved in amino acid transport in GABAergic neurons. Since several studies implicate GABAergic transmission in the generation and modulation of circadian rhythmicity, we propose that ApSDI-1 could be involved in the transduction of the photoperiodic message and therefore be a candidate to participate at some point in processes that trigger the sexual response in aphids. This is the first gene identified in aphids whose expression is governed by the photoperiod. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a stable in vitro culture system for keratinocytes obtained from oral lichen planus (OLP) lesions and evaluate cultured keratinocyte characteristics including cell morphology, ultrastructure, and expression of biomarkers.
   OLP mucosa (histopathologically confirmed) was collected and cells isolated using the cold enzyme digestion method. Primary culture and serial passage were performed on serum-free keratinocyte medium. Morphological changes of cells were evaluated via inverted phase contrast microscopy, and cellular ultrastructure was observed by electron microscopy. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to detect expression of keratin and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B).
   OLP type I keratinocytes was successfully cultured in vitro in serum-free medium. Cellular morphology was typically polygonal during the growth phase. Cells could be passaged continuously for five to six generations without losing viability. Transmission electron microscopy showed large nuclei and multiple vacuoles in the cultured cells consistent with histopathological features of OLP keratinocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was positive for keratin and NF-kappa B.
   This study established that human OLP kera-tinocytes can be successfully cultured cells with histopathologic features and biomarker expression consistent with OLP type I keratinocytes.
   This culture system lays a foundation for the establishment of human OLP cell model in vitro.

AB  - This study assessed the biogas and methane production potential of wastewater sludge generated from the beverage industry. The optimization of the biogas production potential of a single fed-batch anaerobic digester was operated at different temperatures (25, 35, and 45 celcius), pH (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5), and organic feeding ratio (1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:6) with a hydraulic retention time of 30 days. The methane and biogas productivity of beverage wastewater sludge in terms of volatile solid (VS) and volume was determined. The maximum production of biogas (15.4 m(3)/g VS, 9.3 m(3)) and methane content (6.3 m(3)/g VS, 3.8 m(3)) were obtained in terms of VS and volume at 8.5, 35 celcius, 1:3 of optimal pH, temperature, and organic loading ratio, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum methane content (7.4 m(3)/g VS, 4.4 m(3)) and biogas production potential (17.9 m(3)/g VS, 10.8 m(3)) were achieved per day at room temperature. The total biogas and methane at 35 celcius (30 days) are 44.3 and 10.8 m(3)/g VS, respectively, while at 25 celcius (48 days) increased to 67.3 and 16.1 m(3)/g VS, respectively. Furthermore, the electricity-generating potential of biogas produced at room temperature (22.1 kWh at 24 days) and optimum temperature (18.9 kWh) at 40 days was estimated. The model simulated optimal HRT (25 days) in terms of biogas and methane production at optimum temperature was in good agreement with the experimental results. Thus, we can conclude that the beverage industrial wastewater sludge has a huge potential for biogas production and electrification.

AB  - Through basic studies of various resins, the most suitable resin was selected to improve the reflectivity and productivity in making white opaque polyethylene terephthalate film. Accordingly, oriented films were investigated through conventional blending experiments based on selected resin. First, the results showed that cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) and polyolefin elastomer (POE) were better than other materials (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polylactic acid (PLA), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF)) in improving properties through optical, thermal, and surface investigations. To observe the compatibilizing effect, high density polyethylene grafted maleic anhydride (HDPE-g-MAH) blended with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and each selected resin as a compatibilizer. For the compatibilizing effect to reduce the size of the dispersed phase, 5 phr of HDPE-g-MAH was found as the most effective contents through mechanical and morphological studies. COC and POE were blended with PET at a ratio of 70:30, and the process of stretching was performed to identify the shape of the void that contributes to the improvement of the reflectance. Although POE showed better compatibilizing effect than COC through morphological, it was inferior to COC in the reflectance. Because POE was melted at PET film's stretching temperature, the void contributing reflectance was not formed.

AB  - The characteristics of submerged macrophytes communities, water environment factors and substrate environmental factors of Lake Qionghai wetland were investigated in April 2018 by laying out 21 sample points. A total of 8 submerged macrophytes species were recorded in the 21 sample points. Myriophyllum spicatum, Vallisneria natans, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Potamogeton malaianus were the main submerged macrophytes species in Lake Qionghai wetland. The depth of submerged macrophytes was less than 2m, and submerged plants were found in most areas of lakeside zone. Submerged macrophytes had a strong adaptability to substrate, it could grow in artificial stacked group rocks, natural lakeside stone sand, natural alluvial river sand, loess and silt, etc, but the substrate with high nutrition was more favorable to the growth of submerged macrophytes than the substrate with low nutrition. Water nutrients, bottom nutrients and water depth are the decisive factors affecting the growth of submerged macrophytes, while transparency, chemical oxygen demand, light, temperature, water flow and pH are the decisive factors affecting the survival of submerged macrophytes.

AB  - Customized electrode materials with good temperature adaptability and high-rate capability are critical to the development of wide-temperature power sources. Herein, high-quality TiC nanowires are uniformly grown on flexible carbon cloth as free-standing electric-double-layer supercapacitor electrode. The TiC nanowires, 20-40 nm wide and 3-6 mu m long, are single-crystalline and highly conductive that is close to typical metal. Symmetric supercapacitors are constructed with ionic liquid electrolyte and TiC nanowires electrodes as wide-temperature and long-cycle stable power source. Ultrastable high-rate cycling life of TiC nanowire arrays electrodes is demonstrated with capacitance retention of 96.8% at 60 degrees C (approximate to 440 F g(-1)), 99% at 25 degrees C (approximate to 400 F g(-1)), and 98% at -25 degrees C (approximate to 240 F g(-1)) after 50 000 cycles at 10 A g(-1). Moreover, due to high electrical conductivity, the TiC nanowire arrays show ultrafast energy release with a fast response time constant of approximate to 0.7 ms. The results demonstrate the viability of metal carbide nanostructures as wide-temperature, robust electrode materials for high-rate and ultrastable supercapacitors.

AB  - Temperature, perhaps more than any other environmental factor, is likely to influence the evolution of all organisms. It is also a very interesting factor to understand how genomes are shaped by selection over evolutionary timescales, as it potentially affects the whole genome. Among thermophilic prokaryotes, temperature affects both codon usage and protein composition to increase the stability of the transcriptional/translational machinery, and the resulting proteins need to be functional at high temperatures. Among eukaryotes less is known about genome evolution, and the tube-dwelling worms of the family Alvinellidae represent an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses about the emergence of thermophily in ectothermic metazoans. The Alvinellidae are a group of worms that experience varying thermal regimes, presumably having evolved into these niches over evolutionary times. Here we analyzed 423 putative orthologous loci derived from 6 alvinellid species including the thermophilic Alvinella pompejana and Paralvinella sulfincola. This comparative approach allowed us to assess amino acid composition, codon usage, divergence, direction of residue changes and the strength of selection along the alvinellid phylogeny, and to design a new eukaryotic thermophilic criterion based on significant differences in the residue composition of proteins. Contrary to expectations, the alvinellid ancestor of all present-day species seems to have been thermophilic, a trait subsequently maintained by purifying selection in lineages that still inhabit higher temperature environments. In contrast, lineages currently living in colder habitats likely evolved under selective relaxation, with some degree of positive selection for low-temperature adaptation at the protein level.

AB  - Animals infected by parasites or pathogens can exhibit altered behaviors that may reduce the costs of infection to the host or represent manipulations that benefit the parasite. Given that temperature affects many critical physiological processes, changes in thermoregulatory behaviors are an important consideration for infected hosts, especially ectotherms. Here we examined the temperature choices of freshwater snails (Helisoma trivolvis) that were or were not infected by a trematode (flatworm) parasite (Echinostoma trivolvis). Active snails that explored the experimental temperature gradient differed in their thermal preference based on their infection status, as parasitized snails chose to position themselves at a significantly higher temperature (mean: 25.4 degrees C) compared to those that were uninfected (mean: 23.3 degrees C). Given that snails rarely eliminate established trematode infections, we suggest that this altered thermal preference shown by infected hosts likely benefits the parasite by increasing the odds of successful transmission, either through enhanced production and emergence of infectious stages or by increasing spatial overlap with the next hosts of the complex life cycle. Further studies that employ experimental infections to examine temperature selection at different time points will be needed to understand the extent of altered host thermal preferences, as well as the possible benefits to both host and parasite.

AB  - Global warming, as many other threats, requires more activity from the government, and people inquire about this, rightfully so. However, the public and private sectors nowadays have a joint responsibility with society. Global warming has come out of the scientific community and shows that climate change is an important social, economic, and political issue. Currently the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by transportation sector are the main polluter of the planet. For this reason, in this paper we propose a reflection on transport, which is an important sector of the economy, responsible for the generation of many jobs and wealth but, at the same time, it has negative impacts on people, companies, and the environment. Recent investigations demonstrate that mobility problems affects the life quality of the people, business productivity and gross domestic product (GDP) performance. In the face of the changes that we are experiencing, it is important to find alternatives that assistance governments in the decision making to solve the problem of traffic in large and medium-size cities and bring well-being to the population. The goal is to provide accurate tool to help take the best decisions in situations that most of the time has a lack of economic resources and transparency. Another motivation is to increase the productivity of companies and achieve sustainable development by reducing mobility problems and CO2 emissions. As outcomes of the paper, an in-depth study is presented on the subject that indicates a gap in the literature with fuzzy logic applied to sustainability. We indicate a sustainable option for the transport sector using algorithms for decision-making, and broaden the discussion on climate change and solutions to reduce the impacts caused by humanity. When the models were applied through a conceptual study, it was possible to provide an instrument generated on the use of algorithms that can aid decision making by getting qualitative data from a discussion with stakeholders on a topic. Finally, the document identifies the importance of the participation of stakeholder, reinforces legitimacy and transparency in decision-making processes and above all present a tool that can help governments to solve this problem. In short, this work proposes an original and valuable tool to be applied in the decision-making process for the sustainable transport sector based on the stakeholder engagement.

AB  - High water temperatures can increase the energetic cost for salmon to migrate and spawn, which can be important for Snake River fall-run Chinook salmon because they migrate great distances (>500km) at a time when river temperatures (18-24 degrees C) can be above their optimum temperatures (16.5 degrees C). Average river temperatures and random combinations of migration and spawning dates were used to simulate fish travel times and determine the energetic consequences of different thermal experiences during migration. An energy threshold criterion (4kJ/g) was also imposed on survival and spawning success, which was used to determine how prevailing temperatures might select against certain migration dates and thermal experiences, and in turn, explain the selection for the current spawning phenology of the population. Scenarios of tributary use for thermal refugia under increasing water temperatures (1, 2, and 3 degrees C) were also run to determine which combinations of migration dates, travel rates, and resulting thermal experiences might be most affected by energy exhaustion. As expected, when compared to observations, the model under existing conditions and energy use could explain the onset, but not the end of the observed spawning migration. Simulations of early migrants had greater energy loss than late migrants regardless of the river temperature scenario, but higher temperatures disproportionately selected against a larger fraction of early-migrating fish, although using cold-water tributaries during migration provided a buffer against higher energy use at higher temperatures. The fraction of simulated fish that exceeded the threshold for migration success increased from 58% to 72% as average seasonal river temperatures over baseline temperatures increased. The model supports the conclusion that increases in average seasonal river temperatures as little as 1 degrees C could impose greater thermal constraints on the fish, select against early migrants, and in turn, truncate the onset of the current spawning migration.

AB  - Surface temperatures are generally higher in cities than in rural surroundings. This phenomenon, known as Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), increases the risk of heat-related human illnesses and mortality. Past global studies analysed this phenomenon aggregated at city scale or over seasonal and annual time periods, while human impacts strongly depend on shorter term heat stress experienced locally. Here we develop a global longterm high-resolution dataset of daytime SUHI, offering an insight into the space-time variability of the urban-rural temperature differences which is unprecedented at global scale. Our results show that across urban areas worldwide over the period 2003-2020, 3-day SUHI extremes are on average more than twice as high as the warm-season median SUHI, with local exceedances up to 10 K. Over this period, SUHI extremes have increased more rapidly than warm-season medians, and averaged worldwide are now 1.04 K or 31% higher compared to 2003. This can be linked with increasing urbanisation, more frequent heatwaves, and greening of the earth, processes that are all expected to continue in the coming decades. Within many cities there are hotspots where extreme SUHI intensity is 10-15 K higher compared to relatively cooler city parts. Given the limited human adaptability to heat stress, our results advocate for mitigation strategies targeted at reducing SUHI extremes in the most vulnerable and exposed city neighbourhoods.

AB  - Sharp environmental gradients encountered within the intertidal zone have driven the evolution of physiological adaptations that allow its inhabitants to maintain cellular function in the presence of fluctuating abiotic factors. These adaptations are mediated by gene-regulatory networks that, despite their inherent complexity, must remain evolvable and capable of responding to different selection pressures associated with specific ecological niches. Phosphorylation events catalyzed by cell-signaling enzymes represent a parsimonious mechanism to integrate new functional or regulatory properties into these gene-regulatory networks. In this study, proteins phosphorylated on consensus sequences for protein kinases A, B, and C; cyclin-dependent kinases; and mitogen-activated protein kinases, as well as the abundance of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase (phospho-SAPK/JNK), were quantified in order to ascertain whether phosphorylation events are divergent among native (Mytilus californianus and Mytilus trossulus) and invasive (Mytilus galloprovincialis) species of mussels that differ in their tolerance toward environmental stress. Abundances of phosphorylated substrate proteins for each of the major signaling proteins that were investigated, as well as the abundance of phospho-SAPK/JNK, differed both within and between species during thermal and osmotic stress. These data suggest that modulating protein function via phosphorylation may be an important mechanism to integrate novel properties into stress-regulatory networks. In turn, differential phosphorylation during environmental stress may contribute to species-specific tolerances toward abiotic stress, interspecies dynamics, and biogeographic patterns in Mytilus congeners.

AB  - Bivalves are newly discovered models of natural aging. This invertebrate group includes species with the longest metazoan lifespan approaching 400 y, as well as species of swimming and sessile lifestyles that live just for 1 y. Bivalves from natural populations can be aged by shell growth bands formed at regular intervals of time. This enables the study of abiotic and biotic environment factors (temperature, salinity, predator and physical disturbance) on senescence and fitness in natural populations, and distinguishes the impact of extrinsic effectors from intrinsic (genetic) determinants of animal aging. Extreme longevity of some bivalve models may help to analyze general metabolic strategies thought to be life prolonging, like the transient depression of metabolism, which forms part of natural behaviour in these species. Thus, seasonal food shortage experienced by benthic filter feeding bivalves in polar and temperate seas may mimic caloric restriction in vertebrates. Incidence of malignant neoplasms in bivalves needs to be investigated, to determine the implication of late acting mutations for bivalve longevity. Finally, bivalves are applicable models for testing the implication of heterozygosity of multiple genes for physiological tolerance, adaptability (heterozygote superiority), and life expectancy.

AB  - A few experimental studies on thermal tactile perception have shown the influence of the thermal contact resistance which relates to contact surface roughness and pressure. In this paper, the theoretical influence of the skin thickness and the thermal contact resistance is studied on the thermal model describing the temperature evolution in skin and materials when they come in contact. The thermal theoretical profile for reproducing a thermal cue for given contact thermal resistance is also presented. Compared to existing models of thermal simulation, the method proposed here has the advantage that the parameters of skin structure and thermal contact resistance in target temperature profiles can be adjusted in thermal perception simulation according to different skin features or surface roughness if necessary. The experimental results of surface roughness recognition were also presented.

AB  - We characterize, in both the laboratory and the field, the preferential thermal microenvironments of Paraphysa parvula (Pocock 1903) (Araneae: Theraphosidae), a mygalomorph spider that successfully inhabits the high elevation environments of the Chilean Andes. We studied 116 spiders. Their average body temperature in the field was 31.02 +/- 2.74 degrees C, similar to the laboratory preferred temperature of 31.7 +/- 2.31 degrees C, and higher than the ideal temperature of reproductive females, 29.34 +/- 2.81 degrees C. In non-reproductive spiders, we found significant associations between body temperature and the temperatures of the air, substrate and rocks; however, the strongest association was between body and rock temperatures. Similar results were obtained in reproductive females, but there the best predictor of the body temperature was air temperature in the shelter. In both cases, the air temperature remained below body temperature and well below the temperature of the rocks and stones. Both situations show the importance of behavioral thermoregulation and the mechanisms of heat transfer into the microenvironment in the body temperature regulation of spiders. Conduction from the environment, heat transfer by small convection currents, and radiation from the hot stones constitute small environmental cues that allow these spiders to maintain an optimal temperature. The selection of shelters meeting specific temperature regimes appears to be a key condition for the optimization of female reproductive success and survival of females and juveniles in a high elevation environment.

AB  - Objectives: To transcutaneously deliver intense ultrasound (IUS) energy to target the facial superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS), to produce discrete thermal injury zones (TIZs) in the SMAS, and to demonstrate the relative sparing of adjacent nontargeted layers superficial and deep to the SMAS layer.
   Methods: In 6 unfixed human cadaveric specimens, the SMAS layer was visualized and targeted using the ultrasound imaging component of the IUS device. Using 2 IUS handpieces, 202 exposure lines were delivered bilaterally in multiple facial regions by varying combinations of power and exposure time (0.5-8.0 J). Tissue was then excised and examined grossly and histologically for evidence of thermal injury using nitroblue tetrazolium chloride viability stain.
   Results: Reproducible TIZs were produced selectively in the SMAS at depths of up to 7.8 mm, and sparing of surrounding tissue including the epidermis. Higher energy settings and high-density exposure line pattern produced a greater degree of tissue shrinkage.
   Conclusions: In human cadaveric facial tissue, IUS can noninvasively target and selectively produce TIZs of reproducible location, size, and geometry in the SMAS layer. The ability to produce focused thermal collagen denaturation in the SMAS to induce shrinkage and tissue tightening has not been previously reported and has significant implications for aesthetic facial rejuvenation.

AB  - The selection of breeding habitat is crucial for many ectotherms inhabiting aquatic environments. Giant water bugs offer an excellent model for analysis of how temperature affects breeding habitat selection and reproductive success. This work focuses on whether wetland temperature influences habitat selection and offspring success in the giant water bug Belostoma bifoveolatum Spinola, 1852. To determine breeding habitat characteristics of B. bifoveolatum, 21 wetlands lying on the environmental gradients of canopy cover and altitude were sampled in spring; water temperature was monitored and the presence or absence of adult belostomatids, incubating males, and nymphs were recorded. Several environmental variables were measured in sites where males incubated eggs and were compared with those from control sites. Field experiments were also conducted to evaluate the effect of site choice on hatching success. Belostoma bifoveolatum was found up to 1545 m above sea level, but reproduction was observed only in the warmest temporary wetlands, with low forest cover, from 300 to 1000 m above sea level. Incubating males were found in the shallowest and warmest sites within the wetlands where egg incubation time was shortest and hatching success highest. The selection of breeding habitat and incubation site, along with parental care, constitute important adaptations in B. bifoveolatum and could explain its success in this cold region.

AB  - Earlier experiments with young Eucalyptus short-rotation coppice (SRC) in tropical environment have not evaluated the quality of whole-tree biomass fractions, and as such their total energy potential is still unknown. As this system is managed with a higher planting density and fertilization level compared to conventional plantations, the quality of forest biomass needs to be assessed. Hence, the goal of this study was to analyze how the short-rotation coppice affected the quality of stem, branches, and leaves used for power generation. Samples were collected from high-density plantation of Eucalyptus at two years old, and the thermochemical properties were evaluated. Carbon and ash content were lower for the stem fraction in higher density of planting, although the higher heating value was not significantly different from each treatment. Overall, the fuel quality of whole-forest biomass was not influenced by management practices. Statistically significant differences were found only between the whole-tree fractions. Eucalyptus SRC provided biomass qualitatively close to that from conventional forest systems and has potential to be quickly and feasible energy option. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A novel WSC (wheat straw cellulose) based hydrogel was prepared by solution polymerization and then applied as a template for in situ preparation of Ni and Cu nanoparticles for further utilization as catalyst in hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of NaBH4. SEM with EDS, XRD, TGA, XPS and BET surface area analyses were employed to characterize the structure of WSC based hydrogel-nanometal (Ni or Cu) composites. The effects of several parameters such as the mesh size of catalyst, the amount of catalyst, the initial concentration of NaBH4 and the reaction temperature were studied. Based on the analysis of kinetics of the hydrolysis reaction of NaBH4 at different temperatures, the activation energy was 32.66 (34.83) kJ mol(-1) for WSC based hydrogel-Ni (Cu) composites. The WSC based hydrogel-Ni (Cu) composites can be used up to 5 times with 100% conversion and 77.5% (70%) activity. When the catalyst was stored for 30 days, the catalyst was remained 70% activity for hydrogel-Ni composites and 65% activity for hydrogel-Cu composites, respectively.

AB  - Biogeographical and ecological theory suggests that species distributions should be driven to higher altitudes and latitudes as global temperatures rise. Such changes occur as growth improves at the poleward edge of a species distribution and declines at the range edge in the opposite or equatorial direction, mirrored by changes in the establishment of new individuals. A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that such processes are underway for a wide variety of species. Case studies from populations at the equatorial range edge of a variety of woody species have led us to understand that widespread growth decline and distributional shifts are underway. However, in apparent contrast, other studies report high productivity and reproduction in some range edge populations. We sought to assess temporal trends in the growth of the widespread European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) across its latitudinal range. We explored the stability of populations to major drought events and the implications for predicted widespread growth decline at its equatorial range edge. In contrast to expectations, we found greatest sensitivity and low resistance to drought in the core of the species range, whilst dry range edge populations showed particularly high resistance to drought and little evidence of drought-linked growth decline. We hypothesize that this high range edge resistance to drought is driven primarily by local environmental factors that allow relict populations to persist despite regionally unfavourable climate. The persistence of such populations demonstrates that range-edge decline is not ubiquitous and is likely to be driven by declining population density at the landscape scale rather than sudden and widespread range retraction.

AB  - When female fecundity is relatively independent of male abundance, while male reproduction is proportional to female abundance, females have a larger effect on population dynamics than males (i.e. female demographic dominance). This population dynamic phenomenon might not appear to influence evolution, because male and female genomes still contribute equally much to the next generation. However, here we examine two evolutionary scenarios to provide a proof of principle that spatial structure can make female demographic dominance matter. Our two simulation models combine dispersal evolution with local adaptation subjected to intralocus sexual conflict and environmentally driven sex ratio biases, respectively. Both models have equilibria where one environment (without being intrinsically poorer) has so few reproductive females that trait evolution becomes disproportionately determined by those environments where females survive better (intralocus sexual conflict model), or where daughters are overproduced (environmental sex determination model). Surprisingly, however, the two facts that selection favours alleles that benefit females, and population growth is improved when female fitness is high, together do not imply that all measures of population performance are improved. The sex-specificity of the source-sink dynamics predicts that populations can evolve to fail to persist in habitats where alleles do poorly when expressed in females.

AB  - Ammonium nitrate (AN) is considered to be a very hazardous and difficult to handle component of mineral fertilizers. Differential thermal analysis coupled with thermogravimetry and mass spectrometry was used to determine the possible inhibiting effect of selected magnesium compounds on thermal decomposition of AN. Each additive was mixed with AN to create samples with AN:magnesium compound mass ratios of 4:1, 9:1 and 49:1. Most of analyzed compounds enhanced thermal stability of ammonium nitrate, increasing the temperature of the beginning of exothermic decomposition and decreasing the amount of generated heat. Magnesium chloride hexahydrate was determined to accelerate the decomposition of AN while magnesium sulphate, sulphate heptahydrate, nitrate hexahydrate together with magnesite and dolomite minerals were defined as inhibiting agents.

AB  - Pathogens can manipulate the phenotypic traits of their hosts and vectors, maximizing their own fitness. Among the phenotypic traits that can be modified, manipulating vector behavior represents one of the most fascinating facets. How pathogens infection affects behavioral traits of key insect vectors has been extensively investigated. Major examples includePlasmodium,LeishmaniaandTrypanosomaspp. manipulating the behavior of mosquitoes, sand flies and kissing bugs, respectively. However, research on how pathogens can modify tick behavior is patchy. This review focuses on current knowledge about the behavioral changes triggered byAnaplasma,Borrelia,Babesia,Bartonella,Rickettsiaand tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection in tick vectors, analyzing their potential adaptive significance. As a general trend, being infected byBorreliaand TBEV boosts tick mobility (both questing and walking activity).BorreliaandAnaplasmainfection magnifiesIxodesdesiccation resistance, triggering physiological changes (Borrelia: higher fat reserves;Anaplasma: synthesis of heat shock proteins).Anaplasmainfection also improves cold resistance in infected ticks through synthesis of an antifreeze glycoprotein. Being infected byAnaplasma,BorreliaandBabesialeads to increased tick survival.Borrelia,BabesiaandBartonellainfection facilitates blood engorgement. In the last section, current challenges for future studies are outlined.

AB  - Solar activity (SA) dynamics increases mankind's evolutionary adaptability to pandemics. Flu pandemics from 1880 to 2020 took place during maximum or minimum of solar cycles. The article discusses several factors that modulated the development of the COVID-19 pandemic: SA dynamic, genetic population features, environment temperature, the effect of lockdowns, and vaccination in various countries. The population genetic composition turned out to be the most significant factor for coronavirus mortalities during a SA global minimum 2019-2020. COVID-19 pandemic is most severe in countries with a dominant haplogroup R1b (the relative number of deaths per million is more than 12-25). Local COVID-19 epidemics were more easily in countries with a dominant haplogroup N (relative number of deaths less than 3). The incidence per million people in haplogroups R1b: R1a: N has a ratio of about 7: 2: 1. This ratio does not depend on the pandemic waves and the population vaccinated rate. Vaccination effectiveness may depend on the population's genetic characteristics too. It is expected to maintain extremely low solar activity during the 30 years. Under these conditions, a twofold increase in the number of pandemics (every 5-6 years instead of 10-11 years) can be expected with pronounced genogeographic differences.

AB  - The ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions is critical for any species to survive. Many environmental changes occur too rapidly for an organism's genome to adapt in time. Accordingly, being able to modify either its own phenotype, or the phenotype of its offspring to better suit future anticipated environmental conditions could afford an organism a significant advantage. However, a range of animal models and human epidemiological data sets are now showing that environmental factors such as changes in the quality or quantity of an individual's diet, temperature, stress or exposure to pollutants can all adversely affect the quality of parental gametes, the development of the preimplantation embryo and the health and wellbeing of offspring over multiple generations. This chapter will examine transgenerational effects of both maternal and paternal environmental factors on offspring development and wellbeing in both human and animal model studies. Changes in the epigenetic status of either parental or grand-parental gametes provide one candidate mechanism through which the impacts of environmental experience can be passed from one generation to another. This chapter will therefore also focus on the impact of parental and grand-parental diet on epigenetic transgenerational inheritance and offspring phenotype.

AB  - Extreme climatic events can substantially affect organismal performance and Darwinian fitness. In April 2011, a strong heat wave struck extensive geographical areas of the world, including Western Europe. At that time, we happened to resume and extend a long-term time series of seasonal genetic data in the widespread fly Drosophila subobscura, which provided a unique opportunity to quantify the intensity of the genetic perturbation caused by the heat wave. We show that the spring 2011 genetic constitution of the populations transiently shifted to summer-like frequencies, and that the magnitude of the genetic anomaly quantitatively matched the temperature anomaly. The results provide compelling evidence that direct effects of rising temperature are driving adaptive evolutionary shifts, and also suggest a strong genetic resilience in this species.

AB  - The combustion of fossil fuels continues to raise the atmosphere's CO, concentration at an alarming pace. Using fuel derived from biomass instead would have a neutral effect on world CO2 balance. In Germany alone, 40 million t of biomass could be produced on land not needed for food or forage production, the energy generated through biomass combustion replacing 10% of fossil fuel energy. An ecologically sound system of biomass production with cereals, sunflower, hemp or grasses uses little or no fertiliser input, no pesticides, and tolerates a certain weed population, thereby increasing the diversity of agro-ecosystems. Furthermore, double-cropping with minimum tillage provides an almost year-round plant or plant residue cover protecting the soil from both erosion and nutrient leaching. Under these conditions, biomass dry matter yields of 18-25 t ha(-1) can be obtained. Silage making and subsequent mechanical pressing increases biomass dry matter content and allows to recover nutrient-rich effluents, reducing the fuel's emission of noxious compounds during burning. Up to 50% of N contained in plant material and 40 80% of mineral elements can be eliminated from biomass fuel and the effluent can be mixed with liquid fertiliser for recycling of these nutrients. Valuable components such as oil or fibre may also be recovered from harvested biomass before burning improving the economic balance of the process. Naturally grown biomass harvested from parks, protected areas or public greens may also be used for fuel production if effective processing procedures are adopted to eliminate components generating unwanted emissions. At current low fossil fuel prices, government support to create an infrastructure of small thermal power plants may be needed and low cost biomass is required to render the concept of generating energy from biofuel economically viable.

AB  - Continuous rise in the atmospheric CO(2)concentration upshots the genesis of cataclysmic planetary problems such as global warming and climate change. Another critical issue which is environmentally challenging is land degradation. When productive land is poorly managed, it turns to marginal land. And further degradation of marginal land ends up to being unproductive land. On the Contrary, considerable part of depleted soil C pool can be restored through the adoption of conservation agricultural practices, unproductive land could be converted to marginal land and by its further restoration, into productive land. Aromatic plants can sustain various adverse conditions prevailing on the marginal lands. Aromatic plants require low input but the output is quite high due to the production of highvalue essential oil. The pivotal perspective of utilization of marginal lands of India for the production of aromatic plants would explore factors such as land availability, aromatic plants adaptability, C sequestration potential and economic feasibility. India is the largest exporter of essential oils and produces huge amount of aromatic spent residues, which could be converted into several valueadded products. Proficient recycle of distillation waste of aromatic plants in marginal lands will aid to sequester C in soil and enhance the biomass yield. Improvement in the livelihood of farmers especially in developing nations through rise in production and income diversification would encourage farmers to reclaim their marginal lands and accelerate their transition to aromatically cultivable lands.

AB  - Selection is expected to maintain primary sex ratios at an evolutionary equilibrium. In organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), targets of sex-ratio selection include the thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway (hereafter, sex determination threshold) and nest-site choice. However, offspring sex may be canalized for nests located in thermally extreme environments; thus, genetic variance for the sex determination threshold is not expressed and is invisible to direct selection. The concept of 'effective heritability' accounts for this dependence and provides a more realistic prediction of the expected evolutionary response to selection in the wild. Past estimates of effective heritability of the sex determination threshold, which were derived from laboratory data, suggested that the potential for the sex determination threshold to evolve in the wild was extremely low. We re-evaluated original estimates of this parameter by analysing field-collected measures of nest temperatures, vegetation cover and clutch sex ratios from nests in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We coupled these data with measurements of broad-sense heritability of the sex determination threshold in C. picta, using an experiment that splits clutches of eggs between a constant temperature (i.e. typical laboratory incubation) and a daily fluctuating temperature (i.e. similar to natural nests) with the same mean. We found that (i) the effective heritability of the sex determination threshold appears to have been historically underestimated and the effective heritability of nest-site choice has been overestimated and (ii) significant family-by-incubation treatment interaction exists for sex for C. picta between constant- and fluctuating-temperature regimes. Our results suggest that the thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway may play a larger, more complex role in the microevolution of TSD than traditionally thought.

AB  - It has long been known that thorium-232 is a fertile radioactive material that can produce energy in nuclear reactors for conversion to electricity. Thorium-232 is well suited to a variety of reactor types including molten fluoride salt designs, heavy water CANDU configurations, and helium-cooled TRISO-fueled systems.
   Among contentious commercial nuclear power issues are the questions of what to do with long-lived radioactive waste and how to minimize weapon proliferation dangers. The substitution of thorium for uranium as fuel in nuclear reactors has significant potential for minimizing both problems.
   Thorium is three times more abundant in nature than uranium. Whereas uranium has to be imported, there is enough thorium in the United States alone to provide adequate grid power for many centuries. A well-designed thorium reactor could produce electricity less expensively than a next-generation coal-fired plant or a current-generation uranium-fueled nuclear reactor. Importantly, thorium reactors produce substantially less long-lived radioactive waste than uranium reactors.
   Thorium-fueled reactors with molten salt configurations and very high temperature thorium-based TRISO-fueled reactors are both recommended for priority Generation IV funding in the 2030 time frame. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Preferred body temperatures (T-sel) of ectotherms are important for ecological and evolutionary studies. In lizards, the measurement of T (sel) is controversial for several reasons, generally related to hypotheses addressing how T-sel may evolve in the wild. Although seldom explicitly tested, evolutionary hypotheses of adaptation to local climate require that T-sel meets the conditions of natural selection, which include repeatability, heritability and a link to fitness. Here, we investigated repeatability (tau, intra-class correlation coefficient) of T-sel at several time-scales using four Cordylid species from heterogeneous thermal habitats. Although there was significant inter-individual variation within days (P < 0.005 in most cases), there was no significant inter-individual variation when calculated across several days (P > 0.05). Repeatability was low in all species investigated (from 0 to 0.482) when compared against other estimates of repeatability of T-sel in the literature. Irrespective of how T-sel was calculated, it showed inconsistent and variable temporal effects across species. Furthermore, repeatability of T-sel did not change with acclimation to laboratory conditions. These data have implications for understanding the evolution of thermoregulation in these and other ectotherms.

AB  - Species richness is greatest in the tropics, and much of this diversity is concentrated in mountains. Janzen proposed that reduced seasonal temperature variation selects for narrower thermal tolerances and limited dispersal along tropical elevation gradients [Janzen DH (1967) Am Nat 101: 233-249]. These locally adapted traits should, in turn, promote reproductive isolation and higher speciation rates in tropical mountains compared with temperate ones. Here, we show that tropical and temperate montane stream insects have diverged in thermal tolerance and dispersal capacity, two key traits that are drivers of isolation in montane populations. Tropical species in each of three insect clades have markedly narrower thermal tolerances and lower dispersal than temperate species, resulting in significantly greater population divergence, higher cryptic diversity, higher tropical speciation rates, and greater accumulation of species over time. Our study also indicates that tropical montane species, with narrower thermal tolerance and reduced dispersal ability, will be especially vulnerable to rapid climate change.

AB  - Insect neuropeptides play an important role in regulating physiological functions such as growth, development, behavior and reproduction. We identified temperature-sensitive neuropeptides and receptor genes of the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. We identified 38 neuropeptide precursor genes and 35 neuropeptide receptors and constructed a phylogenetic tree using additional data from other insects. As temperature adaptability enables B. tabaci to colonize a diversity of habitats, we performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction with two temperature stresses (low = 4 degrees C and high = 40 degrees C) to screen for temperature-sensitive neuropeptides. We found many neuropeptides and receptors that may be involved in the temperature adaptability of B. tabaci. This study is the first to identify B. tabaci neuropeptides and their receptors, and it will help to reveal the roles of neuropeptides in temperature adaptation of B. tabaci.

AB  - Production of organically grown onions depending on the use of mulch and castor bean cake
   Onion is a highly consumed vegetable whose production is based on smallholder agriculture. The onion production is responsible for the generation of jobs and income for many farmers who have this as the only source of income. There is a growing demand for onion production technologies suitable for smallholders, with emphasis on agroecology. In this respect, we highlight the use of mulches and organic fertilizers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different mulches, associated to increasing doses of castor bean cake applied in side dressing on total production and diameter of onion bulbs grown in organic system. There was a significant effect of the mulch over the total yield and the yield obtained of different diameter classes of bulbs. There were no significant effects of side dressing with the castor bean cake, neither of the interaction between the mulch and the fertilization with castor bean cake. The beneficial effect of mulch which probably had more influence on the increasing of onion yield was the maintenance of moisture and reduction of soil temperature range.

AB  - Temperature selection by white crappie Pomoxis annularis over 24 h was determined in two Missouri impoundments, Little Dixie Lake and Rocky Fork Lake, on six and five dates, respectively, during June-August 2001 using temperature-sensitive radio transmitters. Temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles showed that the habitable portions of the upper water columns associated with fish locations varied by as much as 6 degrees C in temperature. The habitable portions of water columns were subdivided into three strata (warm, moderate, and cool) such that each stratum covered an equivalent temperature range (<= 2 degrees C). Discrete choice models (DCMs) were developed for each impoundment to predict the relative probabilities of white crappies selecting the different strata in response to stratum height, DO concentration, average temperature throughout the habitable water column (AVG), and fish weight. For each impoundment, a distinct DCM containing AVG as the sole predictor variable was most supported by the data. Cross-verification indicated that the DCMs accurately predicted white crappie thermal strata selection within the impoundments for which they were developed but that they were inaccurate when applied across the impoundments. The DCM for Little Dixie Lake predicted that white crappies mostly select warm strata at AVGs less than 27 degrees C and mostly select cool strata at AVGs of 27 degrees C or more. In contrast, the DCM for Rocky Fork Lake predicted that white crappies continue to select warm strata until AVGs reach 30 degrees C, select moderate strata at AVGs of 30-32 degrees C, and select cool strata only when AVGs exceed 32 degrees C. The predicted mean daily thermal experiences of the white crappies in each impoundment, obtained by multiplying the relative selection probabilities for the different strata by the average temperatures in those strata, remained within 0.5 degrees C of the mean of observed temperatures experienced by white crappies. These findings indicate that discrete choice modeling provides a novel and effective approach for predicting the daily thermal experiences of fish.

AB  - Large outpourings of basaltic lava have punctuated geological time, but the mechanisms responsible for the generation of such extraordinary volumes of melt are not well known(1). Recent geochemical evidence suggests that an early-formed reservoir may have survived in the Earth's mantle for about 4.5 billion years (ref. 2), and melts of this reservoir contributed to the flood basalt emplaced on Baffin Island about 60 million years ago(3-5). However, the volume of this ancient mantle domain and whether it has contributed to other flood basalts is not known. Here we show that basalts from the largest volcanic event in geologic history-the Ontong Java plateau(1,6,7)-also exhibit the isotopic and trace element signatures proposed for the early-Earth reservoir2. Together with the Ontong Java plateau, we suggest that six of the largest volcanic events that erupted in the past 250 million years derive from the oldest terrestrial mantle reservoir. The association of these large volcanic events with an ancient primitive mantle source suggests that its unique geochemical characteristics-it is both hotter (it has greater abundances of the radioactive heat-producing elements) and more fertile than depleted mantle reservoirs-may strongly affect the generation of flood basalts.

AB  - In recent years there have been numerous reports of an association between daily increases in particle air pollution (PM10) and daily increases in mortality and morbidity. Despite these reports, there continue to be unresolved issues with these studies, including the issue of a plausible biological mechanism by which small increases in daily particle levels could cause adverse human health effects. Chemical characterization of particles is a critical step in testing any biological mechanism. We have characterized gas-phase material associated with particles from various sources and found that measurable amounts of nitric oxide (NO) can be thermally released from these particles. NO is well-known to be an effective vasodilating agent at very low concentrations. In this work, release of NO from four NIST reference materials, two ambient air particulate samples, and two diesel particulate samples was quantified after heating the samples for 1 h. The amount of NO originating from particles depends on the temperature used to evolve this gas. NO levels ranged from 0.005 ng of NO/mg of sample at 37 degrees C to 1900 ng of NO/mg of sample at 140 degrees C. These experiments demonstrate that nitric oxide can be released from some particles at physiological temperatures (37 degrees C).

KW  - PARTHENOGENESIS
AB  - Conifers rarely undergo asexual reproduction by parthenogenesis (haploid or diploid). When cells of Finnish Norway spruce genotypes are grown in a bioreactor under environmental conditions more typical of the Mesozoic (high temperatures, carbon dioxide, and humidity, abundant food supply, etc.), the barriers to asexual reproduction are removed. Gene(s) for apomixis are now expressed in cell suspensions of the rescued early embryo. A new population of diploid embryos is reconstituted from these cells by an apomeiotic and parthenogenetic process. This signifies that asexual gene expression is latent and suppressed under climatic conditions at the current seed sources. Moreover, cells are reverting to conservative ontogenetic strategies for adapting to atmosphere-biosphere variables that have seen conifers survive through ''bottle-neck'' selective regimes in the deep past.
   The control of culture parameters with bioreactors enables the experimental testing of genotypes in today's forests for their adaptive reproductive responses to critical parameters in models for atmosphere-biosphere change. Environmental preconditions for reproductive fitness and survival from one generation to the next apomictic population can now be explored under controlled conditions. This enables a new study of experimental phylogenetics as a function of changes in atmosphere-biosphere models. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - The thermal environment of embryos differs significantly along a latitudinal cline, and the mechanism by which embryos respond to this geographic temperature variation has attracted increasing attention recently. Here, we carried out a common-garden experiment of egg incubation at two fluctuating temperature regimes to elucidate the latitudinal pattern and thermal dependence of the embryonic development rate and offspring performance in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis). Our results demonstrated significant temperature-by-population interactions on variations in the incubation period and hatchling righting response. The incubation period was shorter and the daily number of heart beats was higher in the medium- and high-latitude populations than in the low-latitude population at low incubation temperatures but not at high temperatures. Offspring from the medium- and high-latitude populations showed a faster righting response than those from the low-latitude population when incubated at low temperatures, whereas offspring from the high-latitude population showed a faster righting response than those from the medium-latitude population when incubated at high temperatures. This indicates that turtle embryos from different latitudinal locations may have evolved divergent thermal sensitivities of embryonic development in response to their respective nest environments.

AB  - During recent years, water production from atmospheric air has been widely introduced as one of the most promising solutions for providing remote regions with potable water. An experimental investigation was conducted here on a newly designed solar still-assisted thermoelectric cooling atmospheric water generation (TEC-AWG) system in order to evaluate the influence of various operating factors such as solar radiation intensity, ambient and TEC channel outlet temperatures, relative humidity, as well as the effect of insulating the TEC channel, and utilizing photovoltaic power (PV) on water production and system performance. In order to increase the moisture content of the TEC channel inlet air; the incoming air was directed via a solar still prior to its entrance through the TEC channel. Tests were performed under realistic climate conditions of Babol, Iran (36.53 degrees N, 52.67 degrees E), over nine typical summer days. Three sets of comparative experiments were carried out between a backup powered-TEC channel without insulation (Model A as the reference model), a backup powered-TEC channel with insulation (Model B), and a PV-powered TEC channel with insulation (Model C). The obtained results demonstrated average annual production of 845, 2064, and 1315 L/m(2) for models A, B, and C, respectively. These data correlate to 144.3% (for Model B) and 55.6% (for Model C) increase in average annual production. Maximum average annual production of 2064 L/m(2) which was acquired during Model B experiments, is higher than that of reported for a simple solar still (i.e., similar to 1511 L/m(2)). Additionally, system performance (i.e., the ratio between the generated water and consumed power); of 0.07, 0.20 and 0.30 mL/Wh was obtained for models A, B, and C, respectively. These data imply the superiority of Model B in terms of water production and Model C in terms of system performance. Comparing the system preperformance results of the models B and C with some previous studies, demonstrates the viability of the current design and therefore, the present newly designed setup can be effectively utilized as a reliable AWG device.

AB  - As part of efforts to address the root causes of climate change and non-renewable resource depletion, many regions in the world are considering sustainable biomass feedstocks for renewable energy production. Prior to making such large-scale shifts in primary energy feedstocks, location-specific research is still needed to understand the environmental impacts and benefits of biomass associated with its many potential applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate environmental and energy impacts associated with generating 1 MJ of thermal energy from direct combustion of short rotation willow (SRW) pellets for 2 purposes: to determine where improvements could be made in the life cycle of SRW bioenergy to reduce impacts, and to compare SRW bioenergy to fossil fuel (light fuel oil and natural gas) for thermal energy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted using primary data on SRW biomass production collected from field trials at the Guelph Agroforestry site in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, as well as carbon sequestration rates modeled based on local conditions. Results showed that direct combustion of SRW pellets reduced global warming potential (GWP) by almost 85% relative to the fossil fuels. However, relative to fossil fuels, SRW energy had higher impacts in certain categories (e.g. eutrophiEation and respiratory effects), due to biomass combustion and N inputs (inorganic fertilizer and SRW leaf inputs) for biomass production. Soil nitrous oxide emissions, from the N inputs, dominated the GWP, but a sensitivity analysis showed that soil carbon sequestered by SRW biomass during growth could reduce the GWP by 23%. Pelletizing the SRW biomass prior to combustion affected the energy ratio and accounted for almost 85% of non-renewable energy use in the life cycle of bioenergy. Location specific factors that affected environmental performance of the bioenergy system included agro-climatic conditions, management practices, and conversion technologies. Nevertheless, most of the impacts associated with SRW thermal energy generation can be minimized through better fertilizer management, by using alternate sources of fertilizer, by improving yields, and by the use of cleaner wood combustion technologies with emissions controls.

AB  - High-temperature short-time (HTST) treatments have been used to destroy the bioburden of paprika. With this in mind, we have designed a device to treat samples of paprika with a gas whose temperature, pressure, and composition can be selected. Temperatures and treatment times ranged from 130 to 170 degreesC and 4 to 6 s, respectively. The survival of the most commonly found microorganisms in paprika and any alteration in extractable and superficial color were examined. Data showed that the optimum HTST conditions were 145 degreesC, 1.5 kg/cm(2) of overpressure, 6 s operation time, and a thermal fluid of saturated steam. No microbial growth was detected during storage after thermal treatment. To minimize the color losses, treated (HTST) paprika samples should be kept under refrigeration.

AB  - Large-area, low-cost substrates are envisioned for next-generation HgCdTe infrared focal-plane arrays (IRFPA). Si, GaAs, Ge, and InSb have been previously examined as potential candidates. Fabrication of IRFPAs based on these substrates is limited by fundamental materials properties that potentially lead to lower detector performance and operability. Lattice and thermal mismatch between the substrate and epilayer are just two of several material factors that must be considered. We have reviewed these factors in the context of more recent data, and determined it worthwhile to revisit the use of GaAs substrates for epitaxial growth of HgCdTe. Our study starts with an evaluation of the surface quality (epireadiness) of commercially available (211) B-oriented GaAs substrates. Molecular beam epitaxial growth of CdTe buffer layers and subsequent HgCdTe absorber layers are performed in separate vacuum-interconnected chambers. The importance of optimization of the CdTe buffer layer growth for high-quality HgCdTe is detailed through surface morphology and x-ray studies. x-Ray diffraction rocking-curve full-width at half-maximum values as low as 52 arcsec have been obtained. Long-wave infrared Hg1-x Cd (x) Te (x = 0.23) has been grown on these buffer layers, producing cross-hatch-dominated surface morphologies, with dislocation densities as low as similar to 3 x 10(6) cm(-2). We have also obtained (for optimized layers), 80-K Hall-effect n-type carrier concentration and electron mobility of approximately similar to 1.5 x 10(15) cm(-3) and 1 x 10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), respectively. Finally, we briefly compare GaAs and Si in light of our preliminary investigation.

AB  - In the Netherlands, municipalities and other sub-national governments have to conduct climate stress tests to examine the societal impact of heat load by citizens. So far, these parties have been hindered by the abundance of contrasting urban heat maps produced with different metrics and methods by different agencies. To unify the stress tests, we present a methodology for a standardized urban heat map at 1-m spatial resolution by selecting the Physical Equivalent Temperature (PET) as metric for heat stress.
   First we present an empirical regression model for PET, based on a variety of weather data and street configurations in the human thermal energy balance model Rayman. Thereafter, this empirical PET-model is evaluated for the midsized town Wageningen (the Netherlands). Meteorological observations taken at a nearby reference site and straightforward geographical data have been used as model input. Also, established methods were applied and elaborated to account for the urban heat island effect and wind speed reduction in the city. The presented method is validated against bike traverse observations of PET. Wind speed is the most challenging feature to map, due to its unsteady and local behaviour in cities.
   As a result, an afternoon averaged PET heat map is demonstrated as standard for an extreme heat day (1:1000 summer half year days), and a cumulative exceedance PET heat map for a representative year. Furthermore, a heat map is projected for 2050 according a warm climate change scenario.

AB  - Turbine airfoils have complex geometries and, during service operation, are subjected to complex loadings. In most publications, results are typically reported for either uniaxial, isothermal tensile creep or for thermal cyclic tests. The former generally provides data for creep of the superalloy and the overall performance, and the later provide data for thermal barrier coating (TBC) spallation as a function of thermally grown oxide thickness, surface roughness, temperature, and thermal mismatch between the layers. Both tests provide valuable data but little is known about the effect of compressive creep strain on the performance of the superalloy/protective system at elevated temperatures. In conjunction with computational model development, laboratory-scale experimental validation was undertaken to verify the viability of the underlying damage mechanics concepts for the evolution of TBC damage. Nickel-based single crystal Rene N5 coupons that were coated with a similar to 150-200 mu m MCrAlY bond coat and a similar to 200-240 mu m 7-YSZ APS top coat were used in this effort. The coupons were exposed to 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees C, and 1100 degrees C, for periods of 100 h, 300 h, 1000 h, and 3000 h in slotted silicon carbide fixtures. The difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the Rene N5 substrate and the test fixture introduces thermally induced compressive stress in the coupon samples. Exposed samples were cross sectioned and evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Performance data were collected based on image analysis. Energy-dispersive X-ray was employed to study the elemental distribution in the TBC system after exposure. To better understand the loading and failure mechanisms of the coating system under loading conditions, nanoindentation was used to study the mechanical properties (Young's modulus and hardness) of the components in the TBC system and their evolution with temperature and time. The effect of uniaxial in-plane compressive creep strain on the rate of growth of the thermally grown oxide layer, the time to coating failure in TBC systems, and the evolution in the mechanical properties are presented.

AB  - Background: Although the recent past has witnessed a surge in the study of forgiveness, little is known about unforgiveness. This study aims to understand the nature and attributes of unforgiveness. Methods: We used a qualitative design. The sample consisted of 14 participants (22-32 years). We collected data using a semistructured interview protocol. The interview content was tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the thematic analysis method. Results: We identified five themes: a complex process, multiple causes, benefits, negative consequences, and strategies to reduce unforgiveness. Challenges to trust, unforgiveness-generated behaviors, and mixed emotionality of transgressions made it a complex process. Transgressors' misconduct, challenges to regard and relationship, and negative feelings associated with transgressions were identified as the main causes. Unforgiveness benefits victims by increasing their adaptability, self-worth, productivity, well-being, and relationship outcomes. Some negative consequences of relationships, emotionality, self-worth, etc., have also been described. Positive changes in transgressors' behaviors and poor conditions and the likelihood of revictimization were described as mechanisms to reduce unforgiveness. Discussion: Contrary to previous views, which assumed unforgiveness represents only cold emotion and rumination, our findings reveal that unforgiveness is a complex process. Aside from certain negative consequences, it also serves some adaptive functions.

AB  - Turbine airfoils have complex geometries and during service operation are subjected to complex loadings. In most publications, results are typically reported for either uniaxial, isothermal tensile creep or for thermal cyclic tests. The former generally provide data for creep of the superalloy and the overall performance, and the later provide data for thermal barrier coating (TBC) spallation as a function of thermally-grown oxide (TGO) thickness, surface roughness, temperature, and thermal mismatch between the layers. Both tests provide valuable data, but little is known about the effect of compressive creep strain on the performance of the superalloy/protective system at elevated temperatures.
   In conjunction with computational model development, laboratory-scale experimental validation was undertaken to verify the viability of the underlying damage mechanics concepts for the evolution of TBC damage. Nickel-based single-crystal Rend N5 coupons that were coated with a similar to 150-200 mu m MCrA-IY bond coat and a similar to 200-240 mu M 7-YSZ APS topcoat were used in this effort. The coupons were exposed to 900, 1000, and 1100 C, for periods of 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 hours in slotted silicon carbide fixtures. The difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the Rene N5 substrate and the test fixture introduces thermally induced compressive stress in the coupon samples.
   Exposed samples were cross-sectioned and evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Performance data was collected based on image analysis. Energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) was employed to study the elemental distribution in the TBC system after exposure. To better understand the loading and failure mechanisms of the coating system under loading conditions, nanoindentation was used to study the mechanical properties (Young's modulus and hardness) of the components in the TBC system and their evolution with temperature and time. The effect of uniaxial in-plane compressive creep strain on the rate of growth of the thermally grown oxide layer, the time to coating failure in TBC systems, and the evolution in the mechanical properties are presented.

AB  - Climate is closely related to human longevity. In China, there are many climate types. According to national population censuses from 1982 to 2000, most provinces with a high ratio of centenarians are located in western and northwestern China far from the sea; these areas are characterized by a dry, cold climate, very high altitude, very high daily temperature range, strong winds, and partial hypoxia. Meanwhile, provinces with a high ratio of nonagenarians from 1982 to 2000 are located in southern China near the sea. Previous studies have attributed the high ratio of centenarians in western and northwestern China to the extreme local climate. However, centenarians in these areas decreased greatly in 2010, whereas residents in southern China frequently reached 90 to 100 years old in 2010. This study aims to explain this strange phenomenon and find whether extreme climate in Tibetan plateau and northwestern China or moderate climate in southern China is more conducive to longevity. The study found that mortality rate in Tibetan plateau is much higher than southern China, then a population evolution experiment was proposed to compare longevity indicators between low mortality rate and high mortality rate and shows that longevity indicators will decrease in the near future and increase above their original levels after several decades when the mortality rate is decreased. Results of this study show individuals in northwestern China do not live as long as those in eastern and southern China. A moderate climate is more conducive to longevity than extreme climate in China. The longevity of a region should be judged by long-term longevity indicators.

AB  - Thermal preferences of well-fed and food-limited fire ant colonies (Solenopsis invicta) were studied in relation to colony growth and metabolic costs. The growth curve for well-fed colonies was strongly skewed toward warmer temperatures with maximal growth occurring near 32-degrees-C (Fig. 2 A). The growth curve for food-limited colonies was skewed toward cooler temperatures with maximal colony size occurring around 25-degrees-C (Fig. 2 B). Food-limited colonies apparently grew larger at cooler temperatures because metabolic costs of workers were reduced. A series of binary choice tests confirmed three predictions concerning fire ant thermal preferences (Figs. 3-4). First, well-fed colonies preferred brood temperatures very near the optimum for colony growth (31-degrees-C versus 32-degrees-C). Colonies were also able to select appropriate suboptimal growth temperatures when the optimal range was unavailable. Secondly, as predicted, a large percentage of colony workers (approximately 30% in well-fed colonies) consistently chose cooler temperatures than those selected for the brood. This strategy probably increases longevity of workers not directly associated with brood care. Thirdly, food-limited colonies preferred cooler temperatures than well-fed colonies. Metabolic costs of food-limited colonies were reduced by approximately 7% because of (1) slightly cooler brood temperatures (30-degrees-C versus 31-degrees-C) and because (2) an additional 20-30% of the workers selected cooler temperatures. The addition of excess food reversed food-limited thermal preferences within 12 h for the brood (Fig. 5) and several days for the workers. Contrary to expectations, thermal preferences for brood in food-limited colonies did not match the food-limited growth curve, perhaps because fire ant colonies can choose to rear brood at warm temperatures while maintaining accumulated colony biomass at cooler temperatures.

AB  - Many drivers tend to foster the development of renewable energy production in wastewater treatment plants as many expectations rely upon energy recovery from sewage sludge, for example through biogas use. This paper is focused on the assessment of grease waste (GW) as an adequate substrate for co-digestion with municipal sludge, as it has a methane potential of 479-710 LCH4/kg VS, as well as the evaluation of disintegration technologies as a method to optimize the co-digestion process. With this objective three different pre-treatments have been selected for evaluation: thermal hydrolysis, ultrasound and enzymatic treatment. Results have shown that co-digestion processes without pre-treatment had a maximum increment of 128% of the volumetric methane productivity when GW addition was 23% inlet (at 20 days of HRT and with an OLR of 3.0 kg COD/m(3)d), compared with conventional digestion of sewage sludge alone. Concerning the application of the selected disintegration technologies, all pre-treatments showed improvements in terms of methane yield (51.8, 89.5 and 57.6% more for thermal hydrolysis, ultrasound and enzymatic treatment, respectively, compared with non-pretreated wastes), thermal hydrolysis of GW and secondary sludge being the best configuration as it improved the solubilization of the organic matter and the hydrodynamic characteristics of digestates.

CP  - 7th European Commission Conference on Euratom Research and Training in Reactor Systems (FISA) on Nuclear Engineering and Design
AB  - This paper is an introduction to the research and training activities carried out under the Euratom 7th Framework Programme (FP7, 2007-2011) in the field of nuclear fission science and technology, covering in particular nuclear systems and safety, and including innovative reactor systems and partitioning and transmutation. It is based on the more than 40 invited lectures that were delivered by Euratom project coordinators and keynote speakers at the FISA-2009 Conference (FISA, 2009), organised by the European Commission DG Research, 22-24 June 2009, Prague, Czech Republic.
   The Euratom programme must be considered in the context of current and future nuclear technology and the respective research effort:
   Generation-II (i.e. yesterday, NPP construction 1970-2000): safety and reliability of nuclear facilities and energy independence in order to ensure security of supply worldwide;
   Generation-III (i.e. today, construction 2000-2040+): continuous improvement of safety and reliability, and increased industrial competitiveness in a growing energy market;
   Generation-IV (i.e. tomorrow, construction from 2040) for increased sustainability though optimal utilisation of natural resources and waste minimisation, and increased proliferation resistance.
   Consequently, the focus of the lectures devoted to Generation-II and -III is on the major scientific challenges and technological developments needed to guarantee safety and reliability, in particular issues associated with plant lifetime extension and operation.
   The focus of the lectures devoted to Generation-IV is on the design objectives and associated research issues that have been agreed upon internationally, in particular the ambitious criteria and technology goals established at the international level by the Generation-IV International Forum (GIF). In the future, electricity must continue to be produced competitively, and in addition high temperature process heat may also be required, while exploiting a maximum of fissile and fertile material and recycling all actinides, both safely and reliably. Scientific viability studies and technological performance tests for each Generation-IV system are now being carried out in many European Union (EU) Member States, in collaboration with other laboratories worldwide as part of the inter-governmental GIF agreement. The ultimate phase of commercial deployment will be from 2040, but no one can predict accurately when industry and investors will make firm, often difficult decisions regarding the construction of these very innovative Generation-IV systems. However, to be deployed commercially, it must first be demonstrated that Generation-IV technology can be a beneficial, responsible and sustainable response to the long-term challenges faced by society to establish a low-carbon economy.

AB  - The efficiency of water use and transport are among the main factors affecting competitiveness, growth, and distribution of trees under warming climate. The phenotypical and genetic plasticity of tree populations is considered as an indicator of their adaptive capacity under changing environment. Climatic changes are expected to affect growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and selection of reproductive material among the populations suitable for future climates has been advised for sustaining productivity of stands. In this regard, provenance trials can serve as source of comprehensive information about growth plasticity and climate-growth interactions of diverse populations. Quantitative wood anatomy can provide detailed information about xylogenesis and factors affecting it, which are crucial for long-term predictions. Wood anatomy of two top- (Gustrow and Rytel), two low-performing (Eibenstock and Dippoldiswalde), and one local (Kalsnava) provenances of Scots pine from the eastern Baltic region growing in three provenance trials in Latvia was studied using mixed models, accounting for the experimental design, as well as using the time-series approach. Provenance had a significant effect on the studied wood anatomical proxies, indicating genetic adaptation of xylogenesis. The top-performing provenances, which originated from warmer and drier conditions, had tracheids with larger lumens and thinner walls, thus indicating adaptation to water deficit. The top-performing Rytel provenance showed the highest phenotypical plasticity of lumen cross-section area and cell wall thickness of stemwood tracheids. The studied low-performing provenances, which originated from the Orr Mountains, had tracheids with thicker wall and smaller lumens, likely to ensure mechanical durability. The local provenance showed intermediate values of the studied wood anatomical proxies. The effect of provenance on wood anatomical proxies showed some variations among the trials, which differed by continentality, likely due to ecological transfer distance. The studied anatomical proxies were affected by weather conditions prior and during formation of a tree ring, yet these relationships differed by trial and provenance. In general, wood anatomy of earlywood was affected by temperature in the dormant period and beginning of summer, as well as precipitation in the end of the previous vegetation period. Proxies of latewood showed correlation with temperature (negative) and precipitation (positive) in summer, suggesting response to the availability of water. Considering the observed relationships, the top-performing provenances, particularly Rytel, have a high potential to sustain productivity of stands within the region in the future.

AB  - Eighteen species of cutworm moths were collected as larvae feeding at night on grapevines, Vitis sp L (Vitaceae), in south-central British Columbia, Canada, during April and May from 2004 to 2008. Ten species belonged to two genera, Abagrotis Smith and Euxoa Hubner. Abagrotis orbis (Grote), A nefascia (Smith), and A. reedi Buckett accounted for over 85% of cutworms reared to adulthood. Abagrotis orb's and A reedi were found in all locations, the former accounted for nearly 90% of larvae collected from vineyards on warm sandy soils Abagrotis nefascia was largely restricted to cooler sites with heavier soils For laboratory-reared A. orbis, pupal mass was highest and sex ratios were approximately equal when larvae were reared either on a pinto bean-based diet prepared with the recommended amount of water or on a commercial black cutworm diet and 50% of the recommended water Survival to adult eclosion was significantly higher on the black cutworm diet, but because this was thicker than the pinto bean-based diet it was impractical to use. To date, A orbis, A nefascia, and A. reed, have been laboratory-reared continuously on artificial diet for more than six generations.

Several by-products are generated during wet and the dry processing, and also by soluble coffee industries. Such by-products can be a source of raw materials for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics, and are often used in power generation in boilers for mechanical dryers and fertilizer. Therefore, this review aims to show the diversity of chemical compounds that can be used from by-products generated in the coffee process.

AB  - EUROCROP was a concerted action to develop a research strategy for European arable farming. Research institutes and various stake-holders drew Lip the main research priorities for individual arable crops and for six transversal elements: "farming systems", "farm economics", "outlets and markets", "quality of agricultural products", "environmental impacts" and "socio-economic issues". The social relevance and priority of research goals were assessed on the basis of four future scenarios: "trade liberalisation", "Europe of regions", "green Europe" and "global warming". Agroscope Reckenholz-Tanikon ART Research Station chaired the work group on environmental impacts.
   It was shown that the importance of conservation and the efficient use of the production resources energy, water, nutrients and soil will increase in future, with optimisation of the sustainability of cultivation systems and the nitrogen cycle being particularly important. Other issues relevant to the competitiveness of arable crops were prices, production costs as well as yield increase and stability. Adaptability to changing production conditions was deemed essential for the future, particularly in the case of plant protection. From the environmental point of view mention should also be made of issues like biodiversity, landscape ecology and protection of the aquatic environment, which have no direct relationship to productivity. Research priorities can turn out to be very different in different regions.

AB  - Insect cold tolerance is both phenotypically-plastic and evolutionarily labile, but the mechanisms underlying this variation are uncertain. Chill-susceptible insects lose ion and water homeostasis in the cold, which contributes to the development of injuries and eventually death. We thus hypothesized that more cold-tolerant insects will better maintain ion and water balance at low temperatures. We used rapid cold-hardening (RCH) and cold acclimation to improve cold tolerance of male Gryllus pennsylvanicus, and also compared this species to its cold-tolerant relative (Glyllus veletis). Cold acclimation and RCH decreased the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and chill coma recovery time (CCR) in G. pennsylvanicus, but while cold acclimation improved survival of 0 0 degrees C, RCH did not; G. veletis was consistently more cold-tolerant (and had lower CCR and CTmin) than G. pennsylvanicus. During cold exposure, hemolymph water and Ne migrated to the gut of warm-acclimated G. pennsylvanicus, which increased hemolymph [K+] and decreased muscle K+ equilibrium potentials. By contrast, cold-acclimated G. pennsylvanicus suffered a smaller loss of ion and water homeostasis during cold exposure, and this redistribution did not occur at all in cold-exposed G. veletis. The loss of ion and water balance was similar between RCH and warm-acclimated G. pennsylvanicus, suggesting that different mechanisms underlie decreased CCR and CTmin compared to increased survival at 0 degrees C. We conclude that increased tolerance of chilling is associated with improved maintenance of ion and water homeostasis in the cold, and that this is consistent for both phenotypic plasticity and evolved cold tolerance.

AB  - Extreme drought events exert both immediate and prolonged influences on terrestrial ecosystems, yet the patterns and mechanisms of the delayed effects of extreme drought on alpine ecosystems remain largely unknown. In this study, we use satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to examine the legacy effect of severe drought events on vegetation greenness across the Tibetan Plateau (TP). A pervasive, negative drought legacy effect, lasting about one year, is detected for all plant functional types including forests, shrubs and grasslands on the TP. The magnitude of the identified legacy effect, namely, the reduced growing-season NDVI in the first year post-drought, is spatially heterogeneous and exhibits a clear altitude dependence, while divergent relationships between elevation and the legacy effect are observed between alpine meadow and steppe. For alpine meadow, more pronounced legacy effects occur at higher altitudes with lower precipitation and temperature, suggesting a weaker drought resilience of alpine meadow under dryer and colder conditions. Whereas for alpine steppe, the magnitude of the negative legacies reduces as precipitation decreases along the elevation, which might be due to a greater adaptability to drought under more arid conditions that enables plant communities to recover to their normal state faster in these very dry regions. Our results advance the understanding of drought legacy effects on TP alpine ecosystems and highlight future avenues for research into how different alpine ecosystem types will respond to drought stress.

AB  - The small brooding ascidian Molgula citrina Alder and Hancock, 1848 has long been known as a common inhabitant of shallow waters on both sides of the north Atlantic on subtidal natural hard substrates and also as a fouler of floating docks. There arc published records from the White Sea (NW Russia), but none from the north Pacific. In May and August 2008, a number of adult brooding Molgula sp. specimens were collected from floating docks at the small fishing village of Seldovia on the Kenai Peninsula at Kachemak Bay, Alaska. Morphologically these individuals exactly match Atlantic specimens of Molgula citrina in all characters that were examined. The unique constellation of characters for this species differentiates it from all other Molgula species, as noted by Van Name (1945). In addition, the full-length 18S and 28S rDNA sequences are identical for both the Alaska specimens and New England M. citrina. Is this a new invasion, or is M. citrina a northern circumpolar species that was somehow overlooked? If this new record indicates a natural distribution, why has it not been collected before? If it is a recent introduction, it is unlikely that M. citrina, an inhabitant of cold waters, could survive in sea chests of ships from the N. Atlantic arriving in Alaska via the Panama Canal, but the intriguing idea exists of transport from Atlantic to Pacific through the Northwest or Northeast Passages. As global warming diminishes the ice cover in this region, more and more ships arc traversing the Northwest Passage across northern Canada as well as the NE Passage across northern Russia, representing significant new routes for anthropogenic transport of marine species. The tadpoles of this small brooder arc retained for some time after hatching, resulting in an extremely short free larval life, but could survive as metamorphosed juveniles attached in sea chests or free-floating in ballast water. They have a wide temperature tolerance and once they metamorphose can live free-floating in sea water for some time. They become very sticky and will ultimately stick to whatever they contact. Thus they could conceivably live for many generations in sea chests and sustain a viable population from which to invade new habitats.

AB  - A well-known problem when using Physical Unclonable Functions for secret key generation and storage, is the instability of PUF responses due to environmental conditions like temperature variations. Using Ring Oscillator PUFs (RO-PUFs), a response bit is usually derived based on the comparison of a RO frequency with either a threshold or another RO frequency. Especially for multi-valued PUFs it is of importance to decrease RO frequency errors before digitization. Otherwise, these errors can result in a huge amount of bit-flips. To counteract environmental influence in the reproduction phase, we propose to map a frequency, which might be remeasured under a temperature condition different from initialization, closer to the initial frequency by using a method based on polynomial interpolation. This paper presents how such an approach can decrease errors in multi-valued responses and evaluates the error based on the used polynomial order and thus complexity.

AB  - Although animals use habitats non-randomly in the wild, complex correlations among environmental features mean that proximate influences on habitat selection can be identified only by experimental manipulation of potential cues. Thick-tailed geckos Nephrurus milii are large lizards that are widely distributed through southern Australia. These nocturnally active animals typically spend daylight hours under surface rocks. We presented captive geckos with alternative retreat-sites (rock crevices) differing in attributes potentially relevant to habitat selection. The lizards showed strong preference for shelter-sites that enhanced thermoregulation (warm rather than cool) and that reduced the animal's vulnerability to predators (narrow crevices with small openings and not containing the scent of a predatory snake). Horizontal rather than sloping crevices were also preferred. Overall crevice size and thickness of the overlying rock did not influence retreat-site selection in the laboratory, but could be important in the field because of their influence on thermal regimes under rocks. The present study supports the idea that nocturnal reptiles base their selection of diurnal shelters on multiple aspects related to the fitness consequences of occupancy of alternative available retreat-sites.

AB  - Population dynamics on a rugged landscape is studied analytically and numerically. The dynamics of the population is described in terms of Langevin diffusion of a single particle in a specific random environment. The randomness in the mutation rate leads to population pinning and to a logarithmic slowdown of the evolution, resembling aging phenomenon in spin glass systems. Individual realizations of evolutionary behavior exhibit so-called punctuated equilibria, or long periods of stasis interrupted by rapid changes of fitness. In contrast, the randomness in the replication rate turns out to be irrelevant for evolution in the long-time limit as it is smoothed out by increasing ''evolution temperature.''

AB  - The majority of cases of salmonellosis reported in the journals are related with food. Nevertheless, a number of studies have investigated the incidence and survival of salmonella in rivers, coastal water and lakes. Salmonella is frequently isolated from water sources, which serve as bacterial reservoirs and may possibly aid transmission between hosts. Salmonella is constantly released into the environment from infected humans, farm animals, pets, and wildlife. Compared to other microorganisms, Salmonella sp. has high survival ratio in aquatic environments it outlives Staphylococcus aureus and even the waterborne Vibrio cholerae in surface waters and in heavily eutro-phied river water. Nutrient lack, osmotic stress, visible light and temperature appear to be the abiotic factors that most negatively influence survival. The presence of Salmonella sp. in aquatic environments does not vary seasonally and is independent of water temperature. Due to its common accessibility, water is an environment which plays an essential role in spread of diseases. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of selected temperatures on the survival rate of bacilli of the genus Salmonella, and the dynamics of quantitative changes of the bacteria in time in bathing waters used for recreation, tested under laboratory conditions. The samples for the study were collected from Borowno lake in the commune of Dobrez, county Bydgoszcz. In the experiment it was stated that Salmonella bacilli survived longer in water at 4 degrees C (20 weeks), as compared with 20 degrees C (12 weeks). According to regression analysis, reduction rate of bacterial population in the present study at 4 degrees C was 0.54 log, while at 20 degrees C it was higher and amounted to 0.62 log. Therefore, it can be concluded that a lower temperature has a stabilizing effect on bacilli of the genus Salmonella.

AB  - Background Sea urchin embryos have been used for more than a century in the study of fertilization and early development. However, several of the species used, such asStrongylocentrotus purpuratus, have long generation times making them suboptimal for transgenerational studies. Results Here, we present an overview of the development of a rapidly developing echinoderm species,Lytechinus pictus, from fertilization through sexual maturation. When grown at room temperature (20 degrees C) embryos complete the first cell cycle in 90 minutes, followed by subsequent cleavages every 45 minutes, leading to hatching at 9 hours postfertilization (hpf). The swimming embryos gastrulate from 12 to 36 hpf and produce the cells which subsequently give rise to the larval skeleton and immunocytes. Larvae begin to feed at 2 days and metamorphose by 3 weeks. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at 4 to 6 months of age, depending on individual growth rate. Conclusions This staging scheme lays a foundation for future studies inL. pictus, which share many of the attractive features of other urchins but have the key advantage of rapid development to sexual maturation. This is significant for multigenerational and genetic studies newly enabled by CRISPR-CAS mediated gene editing.

AB  - Here the fabrication and characterization of a novel microelectrode array for electrophysiology applications is described, termed a micro sieve electrode array (mu SEA). This silicon based mu SEA device allows for hydrodynamic parallel positioning of single cells on 3D electrodes realized on the walls of inverted pyramidal shaped pores. To realize the mu SEA, a previously realized silicon sieving structure is provided with a patterned boron doped poly-silicon, connecting the contact electrodes with the 3D sensing electrodes in the pores. A LPCVD silicon-rich silicon nitride layer was used as insulation. The selective opening of this insulation layer at the ends of the wiring lines allows to generate well-defined contact and sensing electrodes according to the layout used in commercial microelectrode array readers. The main challenge lays in the simultaneously selective etching of material at both the planar surface (contact electrode) as well as in the sieving structure containing the (3D) pores (sensing electrodes). For the generation of 3D electrodes in the pores a self-aligning technique was developed using the pore geometry to our advantage. This technique, based on sacrificial layer etching, allows for the fine tuning of the sensing electrode surface area and thus supports the positioning and coupling of single cells on the electrode surface in relation to the cell size. Furthermore, a self-aligning silicide is formed on the sensing electrodes to favour the electrical properties.
   Experiments were performed to demonstrate the working principle of the mu SEA using different types of neuronal cells. Capture efficiency in the pores was >70% with a 70% survival rate of the cell maintained for up to 14 DIV.
   The TiSi2-boron-doped-poly-silicon sensing electrodes of the mu SEA were characterized, which indicated noise levels of < 15 mu V and impedance values of 360 k Omega. These findings potentially allow for future electrophysiological measurements using the mu SEA.

AB  - Many species of Dytiscus diving beetles exhibit intrasexual dimorphism, e. g., the elytra is smooth in some females and grooved in others. However, the expression of the grooves and whether they are a product of heredity or the environment remain unknown. One Japanese species, Dytiscus sharpi sharpi Wehncke, 1875, also shows female dimorphism, with grooved and smooth morphs, while D. sharpi validus Regimbart, 1899, only has a single morph (the grooved type). A hybrid of the two species should therefore provide a means of sorting out how the grooves are inherited. We found two independent wetlands of D. sharpi sharpi in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. One was a place where a high proportion of grooved females lived, and the others had high proportions of smooth females. After five to eight generations of beetles from two populations with different proportions of grooved females were reared under aquarium conditions constituting a common garden design, i.e., water temperature, water depth, and presence of a plant for oviposition, the differences remained. We mated smooth virgin females of D. sharpi sharpi with males of D. sharpi validus to obtain hybrid offspring. The elytral traits of the hybrid females produced only grooved forms. These results suggested that the female dimorphism is determined by genetics, and that the grooved morph was dominant over the smooth one, independent of environmental factors. In addition, the hybrid insects did not differ from the two subspecies insects in larval survivorship, pupation success, or sex ratio. They also showed neither morphological abnormality nor reduced survival.

AB  - The greatest known global response of lakes to climate change has been an increase in water temperatures. The responses of many lake fishes to warming water temperatures are projected to be inadequate to counter the speed and magnitude of climate change. We experimentally evaluated the responses of embryos from a group of cold, stenothermic fishes (Salmonidae Coregoninae) to increased incubation temperatures. Study groups included cisco (Coregonus artedi) from lakes Superior and Ontario (USA), and vendace (C. albula) and European whitefish (C. lavaretus) from Lake Southern Konnevesi (Finland). Embryos from artificial crossings were incubated at water temperatures of 2.0, 4.5, 7.0, and 9.0 degrees C, and their responses were quantified for developmental and morphological traits. Embryo survival, incubation period, and length-at-hatch were inversely related to incubation temperature whereas yolk-sac volume increased with incubation temperature within study groups. However, varying magnitudes of responses among study groups suggested differential levels of developmental plasticity to climate change. Differential levels of parental effects indicate genetic diversity may enable all study groups to adapt to cope with some degree of changing environmental conditions. Our results suggest that the coregonines sampled within and among systems may have a wide range of embryo responses to warming incubation conditions.

AB  - Egg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma (Hym. Trichogrammatidae) have been successfully utilized for biocontrol of several Lepidopteran pests worldwide. Because of their low host specificity Trichogramma can be mass reared more easily in large numbers and on different natural and factitious hosts. Life table parameters were assessed for Trichogramma cacoeciae Marchall, T. evanescens Westwood and T. brassicae Bezdenko on Ephestia kuehniella Zeller and Cadra cautella Walker at three temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) as the potential factitious hosts for mass rearing. Female longevity ranged between 9.77 and 2.56 days in our experiments. Fecundity ranged from 73 to 91 parasitized eggs in C. cautella and 76-109 parasitized eggs in E. kuehniella. T. brassicae exhibit similar values of the intrinsic rate of increase ratio (r(m)) 0.5407 and 0.5478; the finite rates of increase (lambda) were 1.717 and 1.7295 and the doubling times 1.28 and 1.26 at 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively, in C. cautella. The mean duration of one generation (T) varied between 8.25 and 13.37 days for T. cacoeciae, 8.14 and 13.47 days for T. brassicae and 8.23 and 13.18 days for T. evanescens in C. cautella. Generation times for T. cacoeciae varied between 8.23 and 14.68 days, 8.28 and 14.37 days for T. brassicae, and 7.74 and 14.58 days for T. evanescens in E. kuehniella eggs. Both species (T. cacoeciae, T. brassicae) had the same intrinsic rate of increase (r(m); 0.5700 and 0.5704), finite rate of increase (lambda; 1.7682, 1.7691) and doubling time (Dt, 1.21) at 30 degrees C in E. kuehniella, respectively.

AB  - Persistent thermohaline pollution at a site along the northern coast of Israel, due to power and desalination plants, is used as a natural laboratory to evaluate the effects of rising temperature and salinity levels on benthic foraminifera living in shallow hard-bottom habitats. Biomonitoring of the disturbed area and a control station shows that elevated temperature is a more significant stressor compared to salinity, thus causing a decrease in abundance and richness.
   Critical temperature thresholds were observed at 30 and 35 degrees C, the latter representing the most thermally tolerant species in the studied area Pararotalia calcariformata, which is the only symbiont-bearing species observed within the core of the heated area.
   Common species of the shallow hard-bottom habitats including several Lessepsian invaders are almost absent in the most exposed site indicating that excess warming will likely impede the survival of these species that currently benefit from the ongoing warming of the Eastern Mediterranean.

AB  - Background Although studies have provided estimates of premature deaths attributable to either heat or cold in selected countries, none has so far offered a systematic assessment across the whole temperature range in populations exposed to different climates. We aimed to quantify the total mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature, and the relative contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and extreme temperatures.
   Methods We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling for trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature-mortality associations with a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate and extreme temperatures, defined using cutoffs at the 2.5th and 97.5th temperature percentiles.
   Findings We analysed 74 225 200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012. In total, 7.71% (95% empirical CI 7.43-7.91) of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study period, with substantial differences between countries, ranging from 3.37% (3.06 to 3.63) in Thailand to 11.00% (9.29 to 12.47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to about the 80-90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths were caused by cold (7.29%, 7.02-7.49) than by heat (0.42%, 0.39-0.44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for 0.86% (0.84-0.87) of total mortality.
   Interpretation Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to the contribution of cold. The effect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to milder but non-optimum weather. This evidence has important implications for the planning of public-health interventions to minimise the health consequences of adverse temperatures, and for predictions of future effect in climate-change scenarios.

AB  - Ammonia synthesis is a topic of high interest in the industry as the market continues to expand and demand increases. The current ammonia production route is very energy and carbon-intensive, relying greatly on natural gas both as feedstock as well as for heat and power generation within the plant. In the present work, a cradle-togate environmental assessment of conventional and greener hydrogen production routes integrated with ammonia synthesis is carried out according to ReCIPe impact assessment method. Hydrogen production through conventional steam methane reforming coupled with gas-liquid carbon dioxide absorption by amines and chilled ammonia, electrolysis, and iron-based chemical looping are analysed and compared. Mass and energy balances from process flow modelling are used as inputs for the environmental evaluation using Life Cycle Assessment. The system boundaries considered in this work include: i) main processes: ammonia production, hydrogen production, carbon dioxide separation; ii) upstream processes: nitrogen, natural gas, ilmenite, Methyl-DiEthanolAmine, chilled ammonia and catalysts supply chains, iii) downstream processes: carbon dioxide compression, transport and storage, degradation/disposal of solvents/oxygen carrier. The results show that natural gas-based ammonia synthesis integrated with chemical looping hydrogen production gives the highest reduction in Global Warming Potential while six out of the nine investigated impact indicators (excluding Global Warming Potential) suffer an increase between 30% and 60%. In the case of hydrogen produced from electrolysis, unless the electricity necessary for electrolysis is obtained from non-fossil sources, it results in the highest overall emissions to air, water and soil.

AB  - Simple Summary While shifts in temperature may promote the spread of insects, exacerbating the intensity of vector-borne diseases like malaria, very high temperatures exert deleterious effects in insect vectors, forcing them to evolve/adapt genetically. These genetic adaptations may facilitate insecticide resistance through common genes involved in both processes. Here, the impact of thermal tolerance on pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae s.l. from four localities spanning the savanna and sub-Sahel of northern Nigeria was investigated. In all four localities, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were the only malaria vectors found. The populations were highly thermotolerant, with similar to 50% of mosquitoes in two sites surviving 44 degrees C. Thermotolerant larvae and adult mosquitoes (survivors of 44 degrees C) were significantly more resistant to permethrin, suggesting that prior heat-hardening facilitates insecticide resistance. Thermal tolerance and permethrin resistance were found to be associated with the 2La rearrangement (a form of chromosomal inversion). Transcriptional analysis revealed six major genes commonly overexpressed in the highly thermotolerant mosquitoes and those resistant to permethrin, suggesting common mechanisms involved in thermotolerance and insecticide resistance. These findings highlight challenges associated with insecticide-based malaria vector control, stressing the need to take environmental variables and other pleiotropic mechanisms into account for the choice of control measures.
   Changes in global temperature are impacting the spread/intensity of vector-borne diseases, including malaria, and accelerating evolutionary/adaptive changes in vector species. These changes, including chromosomal inversions and overexpression and/or changes in allele frequencies of thermotolerance-associated genes, may facilitate insecticide resistance through pleiotropy. This study investigated the impact of thermotolerance on pyrethroid resistance in four populations of the malaria vector An. gambiae s.l., from the savanna/sub-Sahel of northern Nigeria. Anopheles coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were the only malaria vectors found, sympatric in all the sites, with the former species predominant. High thermotolerance was observed, with no mortality at 38 degrees C, and LT50 of similar to 44 degrees C. Significantly high permethrin resistance was observed (mortality < 50%) in 44 degrees C heat-hardened (exposure to an intermediately high temperature provides protection to a more severe temperature or insecticide) larvae from two sites, BUK and Pantami, compared with the control, and heat-hardened adult females from Auyo (mortality = 3.00% +/- 1.20, chi(2) = 5.83, p < 0.01) compared with the control (12.00% +/- 4.65). The 2La chromosomal inversion was detected at similar to 50% in subset of larvae and 58% in subset of adult females genotyped. A significant association was observed (OR = 7.2, p < 0.03) between permethrin resistance and the 2La/+(a) rearrangement compared with 2L+(a)/+(a), in BUK larvae. For all sites, permethrin resistance correlated with 2La/a homozygosity in adult females (R = 5.02, p = 0.01). qRT-PCR identified six genes commonly induced/overexpressed, including the heat shock protein 70 (AGAP004581) which was 2468x and 5x overexpressed in heat-hardened and permethrin-resistant females, respectively; trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (AGAP008227); and the ionotropic glutamate receptor genes, IR25a (AGAP010272) and IR21a (AGAP008511). This study highlights challenges associated with insecticide-based malaria vector control, and the epidemiological significance of taking climate variables into account for the design/choice of control measures.

AB  - The current legal framework for the development of renewable energies in Chile offers very favorable conditions for small scale electric generation systems. Incentives range from tariff exemptions on distribution and up to a 5% guaranteed supply rights to regulated customers. Such conditions allow for a viable and fast growing environment for the developments of those generation systems based on the CSP which incorporate optimized storage systems. These systems are likely to play a vital role in meeting the increasing demand for energy from the copper mining sector in the north of Chile as well as that of the smaller electricity networks and local communities.
   In this direction, the University of Antofagasta. Chile, has developed the implementation and construction of a modular solar storage system, using new ternary and quaternary- nitrate mixtures, where in addition to collecting the heat of industrial/mining processes and store them for later use, proposes its implementation in isolated rural systems in the Chilean Norte Grande. The new ternary and quaternary Heat Transfer Fluid (HTE), designed with the addition of Ca(NO3)(2) and LiNO3 to solar salt, shows a work temperature range of 130 to 600 degrees C. This temperature range, together with the adequate heat capacity of salt and the potential for storage approximately 175 kWh per day to this system, making it suitable to meet the demands of evaluated areas. The economic viability of these new salts has been analyzed taking into 'account the sources of nitrates in the country, as well as the cost for storage density offered by these new fluids.

AB  - Diplopods are very susceptible to various degrees of environmental disturbance, particularly climate, altitude and diet. In order to increase our understanding of millipede ecological plasticity, we used fertility tables to access and to compare the fertility and survival of two populations of the parthenogenetic species Poratia salvator from two areas with distinct characteristics. Collecting was conducted in two localities within the state of Mato Grosso, in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, municipality of Nossa Senhora do Livramento, and in the municipality of Varzea Grande. The specimens were maintained at room temperature. In the first generation, individuals from the Pantanal of Mato Grosso population reproduced early and also died earlier when compared with individuals from the Varzea Grande population. Furthermore, the population from the Pantanal had a lower net reproduction rate and a higher intrinsic growth rate than the population from the Varzea Grande. The generation time was lower for the Pantanal population than for the Varzea Grande population. In the second generation, the net reproduction rate observed for both populations was higher than that observed in the first generation, suggesting an increase in the reproductive potential of the females throughout their lives. The intrinsic growth rate of both populations decreased as a function of an increase in generation time observed in the second generation. As a result, the population growth rate in the second generation was slower when compared with the first generation, probably a result of the longer life expectancy of the second generation, which may have become adapted to the artificial conditions of the experiment.

AB  - The extremely large number of leaves produced by terrestrial and aquatic plants pl ovine habitats for colonization by a diversity of microorganisms. This review focuses on the bacterial component of leaf microbial communities, with emphasis on Pseudomonas syringae-a species that participates in leaf ecosystems as a pathogen, ice nucleus, and epiphyte. Among the diversity of bacteria that colonize leaves, none has received wide, attention than P. syringae, as it gained notoriety for being the first recombinant organism (Ice(-) P. syringae) to be deliberately introduced into the environment. We focus on P. syringae to illustrate the attractiveness and somewhat unique opportunities provided by leaf ecosystems for addressing fundamental questions of microbial population dynamics and mechanisms of plant-bacterium interactions. Leaf ecosystems are dynamic and ephemeral. The physical environment surrounding phyllosphere microbes changes continuously with daily cycles in temperature, radiation relative humidity, wind velocity, and leaf wetness. Slightly longer-term changes occur as weather systems pass. Seasonal climatic changes impose still a longer cycle. The physical and physiological characteristics of leaves change as they expand, mature, and senesce and as host phenology changes. Many of these factors influence the development of populations of P. syringae upon populations of leaves. P. syringae was first studied for its ability to cause disease on plants. However, disease causation is but one aspect of its life strategy. The bacterium can be found in association with healthy leaves, growing and surviving for many generations on the surfaces of leaves as an epiphyte. A number of genes and traits have been identified that contribute to the fitness of P. syringae in the phyllosphere. While still in their infancy, such research efforts demonstrate that the P. syringae-leaf ecosystem is a particularly attractive system with which to bridge the gap between what is known about the molecular, biology of genes linked to pathogenicity and the ecology and epidemiology of associated diseases as they occur in natural settings, the field.

AB  - Anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) migrate back to fresh water in late summer to spawn and (or) overwinter. Upon freshwater entry, feeding is reduced or absent, and movement activity is restricted. While the physiological responses to low temperatures (e.g., growth, metabolism) are understood, specifics of the use of thermal habitat for overwintering remains poorly characterized. This study used acoustic and archival telemetry data from two lakes in southern Labrador, Canada, to study thermal habitat use during the ice-covered period. Results showed that lake-dwelling anadromous Arctic char predominantly occupied a narrow range of temperatures (0.5-2 degrees C) and used cooler temperatures available within the middle and upper water column. Use of the selected temperatures is likely a strategy that lowers metabolic costs and minimizes energy expenditure, preserving stored lipids for overwinter survival and the energetic costs of preparation for seaward migration. As Arctic char are visual feeders, use of the upper water column is also thought to aid foraging efficiency by increasing the likelihood of prey capture.

AB  - Steady state occurs mainly under less pronounced abiotic variation, leading to low diversity and nonsuccessional change, opposite from the nonequilibrium concept. Permanent circulation of a waterbody creates a low disturbance status but does not represent a disturbance because it does not change the diversity and dominance of species. Phytoplankton composition was analyzed in a shallow Brazilian coastal lagoon, Peri (Santa Catarina State, Brazil), in the cold-dry and hot-rainy periods during 2009-2010. Uninterrupted steady state conditions occurred along with the monodominance of the cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, which dominated under a nonstratification regime and low availability of dissolved nutrients. Primary production measured as resource-use efficiency indicated a capacity for this species to convert phosphorus into biomass as well as its ability to effective exploit resources. Differences in temperature and nitrogen availability seemed to be the driving parameters for interseasonal changes in the phytoplankton community in Peri Lagoon. Models of competition that predict greater diversity, which lead to greater levels of primary productivity and more complete utilization of limiting resources, were not confirmed in this study. The presence of the dinoflagellate Peridinium umbonatum and C. raciborskii together is suggested to represent shallow, mixed, turbid, and nutrient-deficient ecosystems. Although competitive exclusion would be the primary mechanism that selects for species equilibrium, higher adaptability by a few species under selective conditions seems to be the most important factor in the occurrence of steady states.

AB  - Females of several lizard species modify their body temperature during pregnancy, probably in connection with the optimisation of hatchling phenotypes. We studied variations in the temperature selected by gravid females compared with those selected by males and non-gravid females in an oviparous population of Zootoca vivipara (Jacquin, 1797) (Squamata: Lacertidae) of Northern Spain and examined the effects of incubation temperature on the phenotypic variation of hatchlings. Cloacal temperatures of gravid females active in the field were lower than those of males and non-gravid females, as well as the temperatures selected in a thermal gradient created in the laboratory (mean s.d.: 32.33 +/- 1.27 degrees C for gravid females; 34.05 +/- 1.07 degrees C for males and non-gravid females). Effects of temperature were assessed by incubating eggs at five constant temperatures (21, 25, 29, 32 and 34 degrees C). Incubation time decreased as temperature increased, following a negative exponential function. Incubation temperatures also affected the hatchlings' morphology: hatchlings incubated at 34 degrees C had shorter heads than those from other temperatures. Survival at 34 degrees C (58%) was significantly lower than at the other temperatures (mean 93%). Pregnant females select lower body temperature, approaching the temperatures that optimise hatchling phenotypes, according to predictions of the maternal manipulation hypothesis on the evolution of viviparity. The shift in preferred temperature by pregnant females would result in only a very short delay, if any, of hatching time and, because the temperature selected by pregnant females is much higher than average temperatures recorded in natural nests of Z. vivipara, egg retention considerably shortens incubation time, according to predictions of the cold-climate hypothesis. Our experimental results indicate that the two main hypotheses on the evolution of viviparity are compatible in our study model. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated homogeneity of growth and development as indices of developmental stability in sibling tadpoles from two sampling regions of the common frog, Rana temporaria. One region is characterized by relatively warm breeding ponds with a short activity season ('north'), and one by relatively cool breeding ponds and a long activity season ('south'). Tadpoles from the two regions were raised in three different temperatures selected to mimic the natural variation throughout the range. The results show that (1) north tadpoles respond with a relatively greater increase in growth with increased temperature than south tadpoles, (2) mean growth rate and its coefficient of variation were negatively correlated in the temperature regime in which a population was primarily under selection in the wild, whereas no such correlation was found at temperatures more seldom encountered in the natural populations, (3) phenotypic and genetic correlations between morphological traits within individuals were positive and were relatively higher in north than south tadpoles in the warm treatment, but higher for south tadpoles in the cold treatment and (4) across thermal environments, south tadpoles showed significant genetic correlations, whereas the correlations for north tadpoles were not significantly different from zero. South tadpoles showed only positive genetic correlations (n = 30), whereas 14 of 30 correlation coefficients were negative in north tadpoles. In conclusion, developmental stability for growth and morphometry was higher at `optimal' conditions and decreased at the tail ends of the reaction norms within regions, with marked differences reflecting selection history between regions.

AB  - Solar radiation, which influences temperature and hydroperiod, should strongly influence colonization, development rate, development strategies and survival in temporary pools. We assessed these hypotheses at two spatial microscales with varying microclimate. One scale, ca. 200 m, was opposing slopes of a canyon on MT Carmel, Israel, referred to as 'Evolution Canyon' (Nevo, 1995). Due primarily to differential solar radiation, the warmer and drier South-facing slope (SFS) supports a savanna-like open park forest while the cooler, moister North-facing slope (NFS) is heavily forested, primarily with live oak. Using artificial pools, we assessed how these close but contrasting environments may influence developmental plasticity in the frog, Hyla savignyi, and colonization of insects. As expected, hydroperiod was considerably longer on the NFS. Hyla tadpole development was significantly faster on the SFS, while size at metamorphosis was greater on the NFS. Insect species richness was higher in NFS pools. The most common species, Culex pipiens, oviposited significantly more in NFS pools than in SFS pools. In the second scale, we placed pools only meters apart, but varying in shade and thus maximum temperature at Haifa University Campus, MT Carmel. Species richness and maximum temperature among pools were not correlated during winter and early spring (cool to mild temperatures), but were strongly and negatively correlated during early summer (hot temperatures). Thermal tolerance in the laboratory of selected species matched their thermal spatial distribution in the field. These results indicate that temperature can play a strong role in affecting developmental strategies, species' distributions and community structure in temporary pools over a very small spatial scale.

AB  - Although the thermal evolution of the mantle before c. 3.0 Ga remains undear, since c. 3.0 Ga secular cooling has dominated over heat production-this is time's arrow. By contrast, the thermal history of the crust, which is preserved in the record of metamorphism, is more complex. Heat to drive metamorphism is generated by radioactive decay and viscous dissipation, and is augmented by the influx of heat from the mantle. Notwithstanding that reliable data are sparse before the Neoarchean, we use a dataset of temperature (7), pressure (P) and thermobaric ratio (T/P at the metamorphic 'peak), and age of metamorphism (t, the timing of the metamorphic 'peak') for rocks from 564 localities ranging in age from the Cenozoic to the Eoarchean eras to interrogate the crustal record of metamorphism as a proxy for the heat budget of the crust through time. On the basis of TIP, metamorphic rocks are classified into three natural groups: high T/P type (T/P >775 degrees C/GPa, mean T/P similar to 1105 degrees C/GPa), including common and ultrahigh-temperature granulites, intermediate T/P type (T/P between 775 and 375 degrees C/GPa, mean T/P similar to 575 degrees C/GPa), including high-pressure granulites and medium- and high-temperature eclogites, and low T/P type (T/P <375 degrees C/GPa, mean T/P , similar to 255 degrees C/GPa), including blueschists, low-temperature eclogites and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic rocks. A monotonic increase in the P of intermediate T/P metamorphism from the Neoarchean to the Neoproterozoic reflects strengthening of the lithosphere during secular cooling of the mantle-this is also time's arrow. However, temporal variation in the P of intermediate T/P metamorphism and in the moving means of T and TIP of high T/P metamorphism, combined with the clustered age distribution, demonstrate the cyclicity of collisional orogenesis and cyclic variations in the heat budget of the crust superimposed on secular cooling since c. 3.0 Ga-this is time's cycle. A first cycle began with the widespread appearance/survival of intermediate T/P and high T/P metamorphism in the Neoarchean rock record coeval with amalgamation of dispersed blocks of lithosphere to form protocontinents. This cycle was terminated by the fragmentation of the protocontinents into cratons in the early Paleoproterozoic, which signalled the start of a new cycle. The second cycle continued with the progressive amalgamation of the cratons into the supercontinent Columbia and extended until the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic. This cycle represented a period of relative tectonic and environmental stability, and perhaps reduced subduction during at least part of the cycle. During most of the Proterozoic the moving means for both T and T/P of high T/P metamorphism exceeded the arithmetic means, reflecting insulation of the mantle beneath the quasi-integrated lithosphere of Columbia and, after a limited reorganisation, Rodinia. The third cycle began with the steep decline in thermobaric ratios of high T/P metamorphism to their lowest value, synchronous with the breakup of Rodinia and the formation of Pannotia, and the widespread appearance/preservation of low T/P metamorphism in the rock record. The thermobaric ratios for high T/P metamorphism rise to another peak associated with the Pan-African event, again reflecting insulation of the mantle. The subsequent steep decline in thermobaric ratios of high T/P metamorphism associated with the breakup of Pangea at c. 0.175 Ga may indicate the start of a fourth cycle.
   The limited occurrence of high and intermediate T/P metamorphism before the Neoarchean suggests either that suitable tectonic environments to generate these types of metamorphism were not widely available before then or that the rate of survival was low. We interpret the first cycle to record stabilisation of subduction and the emergence of a network of plate boundaries in a plate tectonics regime once the balance between heat production and heat loss changed in favour of secular cooling, possibly as early as c. 3.0 Ga in some areas. This is inferred to have been a globally linked system by the early Paleoproterozoic, but whether it remained continuous to the present is unclear. The second cycle was characterised by stability from the formation of Columbia to the breakup of Rodinia, generating higher than average T and TIP of high T/P metamorphism. The third cycle reflects colder collisional orogenesis and deep subduction of the continental crust, features that are characteristic of modern plate tectonics, which became possible once the average temperature of the asthenospheric mantle had declined to <100 degrees C warmer than the present day after c. 1.0 Ga.

AB  - In a previous study we had shown that 55 generations of selection for faster egg-to-adult development in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster results in shortening of pre-adult duration by similar to 29-h (similar to 12.5%) and speeding-up of circadian clock period (tau) by similar to 0.5-h, implying a positive correlation between development time and tau. In Drosophila, change in ambient temperature is known to alter the rate of pre-adult development but not the speed of circadian clocks whereas 12:12-h warm/cold (WC) cycles are likely to alter both pre-adult development rate and tau (via entrainment). To study the effect of overall speeding-up/slowing-down of pre-adult development and circadian clocks on the selection-mediated difference in pre-adult development time, we subjected developing flies to the following conditions: (i) different ambient temperatures (18, 25 and 29 degrees C) under constant darkness (DD) to alter the rate of pre-adult development, or (ii) cyclic WC conditions (WC1-25:18 or WC2-29:25 degrees C) to alter rate of development and tau. The results revealed that the selected (FD) stocks develop faster than controls (BD) by similar to 52, 28 and 21-h, at 18,25 and 29 degrees C, respectively, and by 28 and 26-h under WC1 and WC2, respectively. The tau of activity/rest rhythm decreased considerably at 18 degrees C but it did not differ between the FD and BD flies, which suggests a break-down of correlation between development time and tau, seen under their normal rearing conditions (constant darkness - DD at 25 degrees C). While the absolute difference in development time between FD and BD stocks increased or decreased under cooler or warmer conditions, the relative difference in their pre-adult development time remained largely unaltered. These results suggest that manipulations in ambient conditions independently changes development time and tau, resulting in a breakdown of the genetic correlation between them. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of extended autumn daylength and winter fasting on growth and smolting were studied in one-year-old Saimaa landlocked salmon. Underyearling juveniles were either exposed to extended light LD 20:4 regime (LD group) during August-October or reared under routine fish-farm illumination (ND croup). After the photoperiod manipulation, LID fish were larger and a greater number of them belonged to upper size classes in comparison with ND fish. Upper size class fish from both photoperiod groups were selected for further experiments in which the fish were either fed or fasted during winter. Contrary to the LD fish, the ND fish increased their length and weight during January-March by which they achieved the size of the LID fish. There was a clear size difference between the ND fed and fasted groups during March-April, but the fasted fish compensated for their growth Suppression soon after the feeding was started again. The activity of gill Na+,K+-ATPase was lower in the ND fasted group during January-March as compared with that of the ND fed group suggesting that smolting may be switched off by poor nutritional conditions. The different gill Na+,K+-ATPase profiles between the ND and the LD fish may indicate disturbed endogenous smolting cycle of the LD fish. However, despite these differences, all groups, independently of the treatment, completed their smolting at the same time in June as indicated by elevated gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, enhanced salinity tolerance, and hypoosmoregulatory ability. Lower levels of plasma sodium, chloride and magnesium in freshwater observed in all Groups during spring-early summer coincident with other changes typical for smolting indicate gradually increasing maladaptation of the fish to freshwater. These results as well as an observed increase in potassium concentration in freshwater during spring-summer suggest that downstream migration is more like a passive than active process.

AB  - Water temperature of aquatic bodies is gradually getting warmer and may pose threat for survival, health and production of fish in future. The critical temperature maximum (CTmax) is the tool to estimate the upper limit of thermal tolerance of fish but information on biochemical events occurring at CTmax are limited for our selected fish, Labeo rohita. In the present study, biochemical alteration of table sized Labeo rohita (Rahu) was examined at CTmax (42.67 +/- 0.53 degrees C) against fish kept at acclimation temperature (30.5 +/- 1.0 degrees C) by increasing water temperature continuously at the rate of 0.28 degrees C minute(-1). Significant alteration was observed for all studied biomolecules with increased glucose and triglycerides and declined protein and cholesterol in serum at CTmax. Hormones also altered with increased value for thyroid hormones and decreased value for cortisol, however the alteration was significant only for T4. In liver glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol level was higher but protein was less at CTmax. Increased transaminase enzymes activities (GPT and GOT) in liver may have increased the production of the glucose from tissue protein. At CTmax, alteration in metabolic activities (higher amount of glucose and triglycerides in serum) for energy production and onset of heat shock responses (higher expression of hsp70 gene in liver) were occurred in Rahu. In this study, CTmax was 42.67 +/- 0.53 degrees C and warming tolerance was 12 degrees C indicating that Rahu can tolerate sudden increment of water temperature of a few degrees beyond present habitat temperature, although for few moments.

AB  - Sessile organisms with thermally sensitive developmental trajectories are at high risk from climate change. For example, oviparous reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) may experience strong (potentially disastrous) shifts in offspring sex ratio if reproducing females are unable to predict incubation conditions at the time of oviposition. How then have TSD reptile taxa persisted over previous periods of extreme climatic conditions? An ability of embryos to move within the egg to select optimal thermal regimes could buffer ambient extremes, but the feasibility of behavioral thermoregulation by embryos has come under strong challenge. To test this idea, we measured thermal gradients within eggs in semi-natural nests of a freshwater turtle species with TSD, manipulated embryonic thermoregulatory ability, and modeled the effects of embryonic thermoregulation on offspring sex ratios. Behavioral thermoregulation by embryos accelerated development and influenced offspring sex ratio, expanding the range of ambient conditions under which nests produce equal numbers of male and female offspring. Model projections suggest that sex ratio shifts induced by global warming will be buffered by the ability of embryos to influence their sexual destiny via behavioral thermoregulation.

AB  - Ecological theory suggests that demographic responses by populations to environmental change vary depending on whether individuals inhabit central or peripheral regions within the species' geographic range. Here, we tested this prediction by comparing a population of ringed sealsPusa hispidalocated at high latitudes as part of their core range (core) with a population located at the southern extremity of their range (peripheral). First, we compared the two regions' environmental trends in timing of sea-ice breakup and freeze-up, open-water duration and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We found that the core region shifted to progressively warmer conditions in the early 1990s; whereas, in the peripheral region, the warming trend shifted in 1999 to one with no warming trend but high inter-annual variability. Next, we examined how body condition, inferred from blubber depth, responded to temporal changes in sea-ice and climatic variables - variables that have been shown to influence ringed seal demography. Core seals displayed minimal seasonal changes in body condition; whereas peripheral seals displayed a 20-60% amplitude seasonal change in body condition with a phase shift to earlier initiation of fat accumulation and loss. Finally, we tested for interannual differences and found that both core and peripheral seals responded similarly with decreased body condition following more positive NAO. Environmental variables influenced body condition in opposite directions between the two regions with core seals declining in body condition with later spring breakup and shorter open-water duration, whereas peripheral seals showed opposite relationships. Seals living at the core likely benefit from an evolved match between adaptation and environmental variation resulting in dampened seasonal and interannual fluctuations in body condition. Knowledge of how different populations respond to environmental change depending on geographic location within a species range can assist in anticipating population specific responses to climate warming.

AB  - Rapid urbanization significantly affects the productivity of the terrestrial ecosystem and the foundation of regional ecosystem services, thereby detrimentally influencing the ecological environment and urban ecological security. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also require accurate and timely assessments of where people live in order to develop, implement and monitor sustainable development policies. Sustainable development also emphasizes the process of protecting the ecological environment for future generations while maintaining the current needs of mankind. We propose a comprehensive evaluation method for urban ecological quality (UEQ) using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI/TIRS images to extract remote sensing information representing four ecological elements, namely humidity, greenness, heat and dryness. An improved comprehensive remote sensing ecological index (IRSEI) evaluation model is constructed by combining the entropy weight method and principal component analysis. This modeling is applied to the city of Wuhan, China, from 1995 to 2020. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted on the geographic clusters of the IRSEI. The results show that (1) from 1995 to 2015, the mean IRSEI of Wuhan city decreased from 0.60 to 0.47, indicating that environmental deterioration overwhelmed improvements; (2) the global Moran's I for IRSEI ranged from 0.535 to 0.592 from 1995 to 2020, indicating significant heterogeneity in its spatial distribution, highlighting that high and low clusters gradually developed at the edge of the city and at the city center, respectively; (3) the high clusters are mainly distributed in the Huangpi and Jiangxia districts, and the low clusters at the city center, which exhibits a dense population and intense human activity. This paper uses remote sensing index methods to evaluate UEQ as a scientific theoretical basis for the improvement of UEQ, the control of UEQ and the formulation of urban sustainable development strategies in the future. Our results show that the UEQ method is a low-cost, feasible and simple technique that can be used for territorial spatial control and spatiotemporal urban sustainable development.

AB  - The farm household responsibility system (FHRS) was adopted in Chinese rural areas during the economic reform in the early 1980s. Since then, many farm households have increased cropping intensity by using large quantities of nitrogen (N) fertilizers in their responsible fields to increase agricultural income. However, intensive cropping systems with low N input are still common in remote places of the southwestern region of China. Maintenance and improvement of soil quality in intensive cropping systems is critical for sustaining agricultural productivity and environmental quality for future generations. The effects of intensive cropping of vegetables on paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield using small quantities of N fertilizers through N mineralization of paddy soil in irrigated rice-based multiple cropping systems were studied in 15 paddy fields in Sichuan Province, China for 3 years. Intensification of vegetable cropping with negative N balance and removal of vegetable crop residues has greatly decreased total N (TN) contents in paddy soil leading to low levels of effective cumulated soil temperature and thickness of plow layer. As a result, the N mineralization in paddy field during paddy rice growing period was decreased. In addition to the low levels of chemical fertilizer N input and residual mineral N input, the lower level of N mineralization in paddy fields and low N recovery efficiency decreased the amount of N accumulated in above-ground biomass of paddy rice at maturity, resulting in limited rice yields. The amount of mineralized N only correlated with TN (partial correlation analysis). Therefore, in paddy fields with very low N input, the N mineralization in paddy soil during the paddy rice-growing period was the major limiting factor affecting the total yield increases. In addition, a decline in soil fertility can be determined using TN as an indicator. To improve paddy rice yield and avoid soil deterioration, the development and adoption of rational soil management programs are needed. These include input of plant residues, conscientious soil tillage for the maintenance of soil temperature and thickness of the plow layer, and the split application of fertilizer for the improvement of N recovery efficiency.

AB  - Climate change may force organisms to adapt genetically or plastically to new environmental conditions. Invasive species show remarkable potential for rapid adaptation. The ovoviviparous New Zealand mud snail (NZMS), Potamopyrgus antipodarum, has successfully established across Europe with two clonally reproducing mitochondrial lineages since its arrival in the first half of the 19th century. Its remarkable variation in shell morphology was shown to be fitness relevant. We investigated the effects of temperature on shell morphology across 11 populations from Germany and the Iberian Peninsula in a common garden across three temperatures. We analyzed size and shape using geometric morphometrics. For both, we compared reaction norms and estimated heritabilities. For size, the interaction of temperature and haplotype explained about 50% of the total variance. We also observed more genotype by environment interactions indicating a higher degree of population differentiation than in shape. Across the three temperatures, size followed the expectations of the temperature-size rule, with individuals growing larger in cold environments. Changes in shape may have compensated for changes in size affecting space for brooding embryos. Heritability estimates were relatively high. As indicated by the very low coefficients of variation for clonal repeatability (CVA), they can probably not be compared in absolute terms. However, they showed some sensitivity to temperature, in haplotype t more so than in z, which was only found in Portugal. The low CVA values indicate that genetic variation among European populations is still restricted with a low potential to react to selection. A considerable fraction of the genetic variation was due to differences between the clonal lineages. The NZMS has apparently not been long enough in Europe to accumulate significant genetic variation relevant for morphological adaptation. As temperature is obviously not the sole factor influencing shell morphology, their interaction will probably not be a factor limiting population persistence under a warming climate in Europe.

AB  - A bioremedial approach was investigated on the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution using a novel chromium reducing bacteria isolated from coalmine wastewater. Cr(VI) removal efficacy of the bacterium was determined in a series of batch studies under the influence of various parameters viz., pH (1-7), temperature (20-40 degrees C), initial metal concentration (1-150 mg/L), agitation speed (80-150 rpm) and substrate concentration (1-5 mg/L). Oxygen involvement in the removal process was determined by different incubation conditions. Substrate consumption and its resultant biomass generation were considered for determining the viability of the microbe under varied metal concentration. The microbial isolate survived in Cr(VI) tainted solution with initial concentration of 1-140 mg/L, among which maximum remediation was found in 60 mg/L Cr(VI) loaded solution. The bacterial species also survived in other metal solution viz., Fe(II), As(V), Cu(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), Mg(II), Mn(II) apart from Cr(VI). Multiple approaches were tested to facilitate understanding of the bacterial Cr(VI) removal mechanism. The bacteria accumulated metal ions in the exponential growth phase both on and within the cell. Underlying latent factors which governed the bacterial growth and its removal activity was determined with the classical Monod equation. The isolated bacterium also survived in the bimetallic solutions with significant removal of Cr(VI). The microbial species isolated from mining area was identified as Pseudomonas brenneri by 16s rRNA molecular characterization. Hence, the isolated novel bacterium illustrated promising involvement towards bio-treatment of Cr(VI) laden wastewater.

AB  - The developement of parthenogenetic or sexual female forms (virginoparae and oviparae, respectively) in the aphid Megoura viciae is determined by the photoperiodic conditions perceived by the mother at any stage in her development from late embryo to young adult. A sensitive period for this response was selected using standard long (16 h light-8 h dark) and short days (12 h light-12 h dark) such that the form of the first ten progeny born was affected. At 12-degrees-C this sensitive period covered the first 11 days of maternal postnatal development, at 15-degrees-C it was 10 days while at higher temperatures (17 and 20-degrees-C) the short-day response (ovipara production) was attenuated. The required day number for a 50% response at 15-degrees-C was 3 days for along days but 7-8 days for short days indicating that long days are photoperiodically more potent. Experiments at 12 and 15-degrees-C showed that the accumulation of long-day information was more temperature sensitive than the accumulation of short-day information.
   The photoperiodic response of M. viciae depends primarily on the length of the dark period (scotophase). Novel experimental protocols and non-24 h light-dark cycles revealed that the photoperiodic counter accumulated long nights (short days) irrespective of photophase length. Short nights (long days), on the other hand, were not summated; moreover their effect depended on the length of the photophase. It appears that, although short nights are photoperiodically stronger, they serve only to modify the counter's accumulation of long nights.
   The quantitative effects (i.e. photoperiodic strength) of different 24-h light-dark cycles was investigated over experimental periods close to the required day number. As expected, photoperiodic strength decreased when scotophase lengths were close to critical (9.5 h). Long nights 12-20 h were equally but short nights were maximally effective at 8 h. The four stages of dark-period measurement in the hour-glass clock were also reflected in these experiments.

AB  - Background and Aims Both environmental and genetic effects contribute to phenotypic variation within and among populations. Genetic differentiation of quantitative traits among populations has been shown in many species, yet it can also be accompanied by other genetic changes, such as divergence in phenotypic plasticity and in genetic variance. Sideroxylonal (a formylated phloroglucinol compound or FPC) is an important chemical defence in eucalypts. The effect of environmental variation on its production is a critical gap in our understanding of its genetics and evolution.
   Methods The stability of genetic variation in sideroxylonal was assessed within and among populations of Eucalyptus tricarpa in three replicated provenance/progeny trials. The covariance structure of the data was also modelled to test whether genetic variances were consistent among populations and Fain's test was applied for major gene effects.
   Key Results A significant genotype x environment interaction occurred at the level of population, and was related to temperature range and seasonality in source populations. Within-population genetic variation was not affected by genotype x environment effects or different sampling years. However, within-population genetic variance for sideroxylonal concentration differed significantly among source populations. Regression of family variance on family mean suggested that this trait is subject to major gene effects, which could explain the observed differences in genetic variances among populations.
   Conclusions These results highlight the importance of replicated common-garden experiments for understanding the genetic basis of population differences. Genotype x environment interactions are unlikely to impede evolution or responses to artificial selection on sideroxylonal, but the lack of genetic variation in some populations may be a constraint. The results are broadly consistent with localized selection on foliar defence and illustrate that differentiation in population means, whether due to selection or to drift, can be accompanied by changes in other characteristics, such as plasticity and genetic variance.

AB  - 1. Understanding how non-native plants respond to environmental variation, and the limits to these responses, is important for predicting plant invasiveness. Until now, the extent to which species climatic limits differ on introduction to a new range has not been experimentally tested. Here, we investigate fitness responses to temperature and low-temperature limits to reproduction of native and introduced populations of the widespread forb Plantago lanceolata.
   2. We recorded fitness parameters of P. lanceolata accessions collected from nearly complete latitudinal gradients in the species' native and introduced ranges and grown in five common gardens arranged along an elevational gradient in the native range (European Alps). The highest garden was located outside the low-temperature limit of the species.
   3. Native populations exhibited clear clinal genetic differentiation along temperature gradients, while any differentiation in introduced populations was much weaker; however, the introduced populations displayed higher average fitness and broad climatic tolerance. Despite these differences, both native and introduced plants failed to set seed beyond the elevational range margin and so shared a similar low-temperature limit to reproduction.
   4. Synthesis. Our experimental data support observational studies of niche-limit conservatism in non-native plants, which has important implications for their management. Specifically, it suggests that efforts to predict the extent of an invasion based on knowledge of the native niche are likely to be accurate at the level of the species, even if populations undergo genetic changes or respond differently to climatic gradients in the new range.

AB  - Anthropogenic introduction of steroidal estrogens and synthetic estrogenic compounds to aquatic environments has increased interest in assessment of the endocrine-disrupting effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms, including mollusks. For gonochoristic freshwater snails in the family Pleuroceridae, little is known about the spatial and temporal variation in population sex ratios or potential relationships between sex ratios and exposure to estrogenic compounds. Population sex ratios of Leptoxis (Rafinesque, 1819) spp., were evaluated within the Shenandoah River watershed (Virginia, U.S.A.), where agricultural operations are a source of estrogenic compounds to streams, and in four other river basins in Virginia. Proportions of females varied among streams within the Shenandoah River watershed, with overall mean proportions from four sampling periods ranging from 0.46-0.87. Sex ratios were consistently female-biased at nine of fifteen stream sampling sites. There was little within-site variation across generations of snails or when the same generation was examined in two different seasons. Proportions of females were not directly related to in-stream concentrations of estrogenic compounds or watershed densities of agricultural operations, but were negatively related to mean summer temperature at the sampling sites. Population sex ratios of Leptoxis spp. were female-biased at two of six sites in the Shenandoah River and one of five sites outside the basin. At the river sampling sites, proportions of females were only related to summer-specific conductivity. Overall, results suggest that site-specific factors can affect population sex ratios of Leptoxis spp. However, until more is known regarding mechanisms of sex determination and sexual differentiation in gastropods, population sex ratios should not be used as indicators of potential biological effects of estrogenic compounds.

AB  - Oreochromis aureus exposed juring the first 28 days of exogenous feeding to constant 35 degrees C, or fluctuating temperatures (day at 35 degrees C, night at 27 degrees C, and vice versa) showed significantly (P<0.05) faster growth, least size heterogeneity and better survival rates than siblings under constant 27 degrees C. Constant high temperatures had a strong masculinizing effect (M : F sex ratios of 7.33-19.00 : 1.00 v. 0.75-0.82 : 1.00 in controls reared at 27 degrees C). Fluctuating temperatures had less masculinizing potential but still produced sex ratios significantly skewed to the detriment of females (M : F sex ratios of 2.33-11.50 : 1.00). This suggests that ambient temperature may have represented a sufficient environmental pressure for the selection of thermolabile sex-determinism in this species, and presumably in other Oreochromis spp. The evolutionary advantage of thermosensitivity in Oreochromis spp. is discussed. considering a framework where individual advantages oppose, to some degree, to the population or species interest.

AB  - A new approach for minimizing both cutting path and heat accumulation in laser cutting process is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm was based on a memetic algorithm combining a powerful genetic algorithm with an adaptive large neighborhood search. The cutting path problem was modeled and solved in accordance with generalized traveling salesman problem. A heat conduction model was incorporated into the cutting path optimization by assigning a critical radius of heat-affected zone as a constraint. A penalty was given to the cutting paths overlapping the heat-affected zone to minimize the heat accumulation in workpiece. A heat map indicating thermal gradient around the laser piercing points was also presented together with the optimum cutting path to visualize the level of heat accumulation. By comparing to the approach without the heat constraint, the algorithm incorporating with the heat effect was capable of determining the laser cutting path with minimum travel distance and heat accumulation in workpiece. The presented method could further be applied for other thermal-related processes such as surface hardening, welding, and additive manufacturing, whose processing distance and heat issue need to be optimized for gaining their productivity and final product quality.

AB  - Objective
   We aimed to examine the temporal trends of the association between extreme temperature and schizophrenia (SCZ) hospitalisations in Hefei, China.
   Methods
   We collected time-series data on SCZ hospitalisations for 10 years (2005-2014), with a total of 36 607 cases registered. We used quasi-Poisson regression and distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to assess the association between extreme temperature (cold and heat) and SCZ hospitalisations. A time-varying DLNM was then used to explore the temporal trends of the association between extreme temperature and SCZ hospitalisations in different periods. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age (0-39 and 40+ years) and gender, respectively.
   Results
   We found that extreme cold and heat significantly increased the risk of SCZ hospitalisations (cold: 1st percentile of temperature 1.19 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.37) and 2.5th percentile of temperature 1.16 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.31); heat: 97.5th percentile of temperature 1.37 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.66) and 99th percentile of temperature 1.38 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.69)). We found a slightly decreasing trend in heat-related SCZ hospitalisations and a sharp increasing trend in cold effects from 2005 to 2014. However, the risk of heat-related hospitalisation has been rising since 2008. Stratified analyses showed that age and gender had different modification effects on temporal trends.
   Conclusions
   The findings highlight that as temperatures rise the body's adaptability to high temperatures may be accompanied by more threats from extreme cold. The burden of cold-related SCZ hospitalisations may increase in the future.

AB  - Members of the family Amphisteginidae have been nearly ubiquitous contributors to shelf carbonate facies through most of the Cenozoic. The most prolific carbonate producer of modern representatives is Amphistegina lobifera Larsen, which is the largest and shallowest dwelling of the Indo-Pacific taxa. This epiphytic, symbiont-bearing foraminifer is also a remarkably successful invasive species in coastal ecosystems of the eastern Mediterranean, where its shell production is altering the composition of shoreline sediment.
   This paper reports a temporal study of an A. lobifera population collected monthly between June 2008 May 2009 in the Vravron/Attica coastal ecosystem of the south Evoikos Gulf (Aegean Sea), where winter temperatures can drop below previously reported minima for the species. Monthly variations in size, frequency distribution, and abundance indicate that this population reproduced primarily during the summer (July September), when both asexual and sexual reproduction occurred simultaneously, suggesting a predominantly coeval, one-year life span for each generation. However, a modest increase in juveniles in January indicates some winter reproduction.
   Comparison of these findings with previous studies shows that a) tolerance of low winter temperatures, b) adaptation of the life cycle to strong seasonality, and c) the mixotrophic feeding strategy have allowed A. lobifera to proliferate in the exceptionally clear, low nutrient, coastal waters of the Mediterranean Sea. These attributes elucidate how previous Cenozoic populations of Amphistegina were able to rapidly expand their latitudinal ranges and invade shallow epeiric seas during episodes of climatic warming.

AB  - In cold-exposed adult humans, significant or lethal decreases in body temperature are delayed by reducing heat loss via peripheral vasoconstriction and by increasing rates of heat production via shivering thermogenesis. This brief review focuses on the mechanisms of fuel selection responsible for sustaining long-term shivering thermogenesis. It provides evidence to explain large discrepancies in fuel selection measurements among shivering studies, and it proposes links between choices in fuel selection mechanism and human survival in the cold. Over the last decades, a number of studies have quantified the contributions of carbohydrate (CHO) and lipid to total heat generation. However, the exact contributions of these fuels still remain unclear because of large differences in fuel selection measurements even at the same metabolic rate. Recent advances on the mechanisms of fuel selection during shivering provide some plausible explanations for these discrepancies between shivering studies. This new evidence indicates that muscles can sustain shivering over several hours using a variety of fuel mixtures achieved by modifying diet ( changing the size of CHO reserves) or by changing muscle fiber recruitment ( increasing or decreasing the recruitment of type II fibers). From a practical perspective, how does the choice of fuel selection mechanism affect human survival in the cold? Based on a glycogen-depletion model, estimates of shivering endurance show that, whereas the oxidation of widely different fuel mixtures does not improve survival time, the selective recruitment of fuel-specific muscle fibers provides a substantial advantage for cold survival. By combining fundamental research on fuel metabolism and applied strategies to improve shivering endurance, future research in this area promises to yield important new information on what limits human survival in the cold.

AB  - Knowledge on correlations between environmental factors and genome divergence between populations of marine species is crucial for sustainable management of fisheries and wild populations. The edible cockle (Cerastoderma edule) is a marine bivalve distributed along the Northeast Atlantic coast of Europe and is an important resource from both commercial and ecological perspectives. We performed a population genomics screening using 2b-RAD genotyping on 9309 SNPs localized in the cockle's genome on a sample of 536 specimens pertaining to 14 beds in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean to analyse the genetic structure with regard to environmental variables. Larval dispersal modelling considering species behaviour and interannual/interseasonal variation in ocean conditions was carried out as an essential background to which compare genetic information. Cockle populations in the Northeast Atlantic displayed low but significant geographical differentiation between populations (F-ST = 0.0240; p < 0.001), albeit not across generations. We identified 742 and 36 outlier SNPs related to divergent and balancing selection in all the geographical scenarios inspected, and sea temperature and salinity were the main environmental correlates suggested. Highly significant linkage disequilibrium was detected at specific genomic regions against the very low values observed across the whole genome. Two main genetic groups were identified, northwards and southwards of French Brittany. Larval dispersal modelling suggested a barrier for larval dispersal linked to the Ushant front that could explain these two genetic clusters. Further genetic subdivision was observed using outlier loci and considering larval advection. The northern group was divided into the Irish/Celtic Seas and the English Channel/North Sea, while the southern group was divided into three subgroups. This information represents the baseline for the management of cockles, designing conservation strategies, founding broodstock for depleted beds and producing suitable seed for aquaculture production.

AB  - This study explores the possibility of producing low grade crude palm oil (LGCPO)-based biodiesel using a two-stage process in which a phosphonium-based deep eutectic solvent (P-DES) and an alkali are used as catalysts. The pre-treatment of LGCPO was conducted using a P-DES composed of a hydrogen bond donor (i.e. p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate) and a salt (i.e. allyltriphenylphosphonium bromide) as a novel recyclable catalyst. The P-DES was used in different dosages in the presence of methanol to reduce the level of free fatty acids (FFA) to the acceptable limit for alkaline transesterification reaction. Batch pre-treatment of LGCPO was carried out to study the influence of P-DES dosage (from 0.25 to 3.5% wt/wt). The effects of other operating parameters such as molar ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time on FFA content reduction, yield of treated LGCPO and FFA to FAME conversion were studied. The P-DES showed high catalytic activity in the pre-treatment of LGCPO. The lab scale investigation proved the viability of esterification and transesterification of oil using P-DES and alkaline catalysts. The biodiesel produced from LGCPO meets the international standards (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214). Three to four times recycling runs of P-DES were achieved without losing its activity. This study introduces a new generation of catalysts for possible batch esterification reaction using P-DES followed by an alkaline transesterification reaction. This study will open a new field for utilizing this strong acid-based DES catalyst for many chemical reactions and industrial applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, thermo-mechanical simulation was conducted to predict thermal and stress behavior in Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Temperature-dependent material properties for processed material 304L stainless steel were incorporated into the model in order to capture the change from powder to fully dense solid stainless steel. Temperature and thermal stress history were tracked under conditions of different parameter sets which were designed to reduce defect formation. The thermal model predicted the temperature history for multi-track scans under different process parameters, such as laser power, effective scanning speed and hatch spacing. Subsequently, the corresponding melt-pool size, solidification rate and temperature gradients could be calculated from simulated temperature data. These three parameters from the simulation were compared with experimental melt pool size, grain structure and cell spacing data obtained from a Renishaw AM250. The experimental data were also used to determine unknown simulation parameters required by the continuum model, e.g., the optical penetration depth and thermal conductivity multiplier for the molten region. This allowed the simulation model to accurately predict melt pool size and solidification structure of SLM 304L stainless steel. Simulated stress showed that the subsequent thermal cyclic melting in successive scanned tracks resulted in alternating compressive and tensile thermal stresses. This work will provide insight for studying microstructure morphology, residual stress and deformations in the SLM process of 304L stainless steel.

AB  - In the era of circular economies, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are viewed as resource recovery facilities. At the very minimum, the targeted resources are water, biogas, and phosphorus. However, municipal wastewater streams (sludge and effl uent) need to be adequately treated to eliminate the potential for the transmission of microbial pathogens including protozoa, bacteria, and viruses. This paper presents the results from a study demonstrating the use of electron beam technology for sludge hygenization and enhanced methane (biogas) production using municipal wastewater samples. Cogeneration of heat for fertilizer drying and granulation and electricity for powering the electron beam system are also demonstrated.

AB  - The fire-damaged pressure vessel reactor, evaluated in this study, was a cylindrical vessel with design conditions of 460 psig (3.17 MPa) at 413 degrees C. The fitness for service (FFS) of the fire damaged pressure vessel was assessed according to API 579-1/ASME FFS-1. First, the maximum temperature during the fire accident was determined based on deterioration of outer protective layer. Then, the possible damage was examined by hardness test, in-situ field metallography and metallographic replicas. Grain growth and spheroidized pearlite were observed in the base metal at the inner surface of the vessel. Outer surface of the vessel showed ferritic microstructure with smaller grain size as compared to the inner surface. Decarburizing and carbide formation were also visible at the outer surface. The lower hardness of the base metal at both sides of the vessel was compared to the standard value and related to the microstructure evolution during high temperature/fire exposure condition. The results of the FFS evaluation indicated that the vessel is not suitable for the current design conditions, and therefore a new maximum allowable working pressure was determined.

AB  - Selection of molecules with desired properties from random pools of biopolymers has become a powerful tool in biotechnology. On designing an evolution experiment, a certain knowledge of the concomitant fitness landscape is clearly helpful to set up the optimal experimental conditions. The correlation function is a useful means of characterizing a given landscape, since it can be efficiently measured if one has a method of separating a pool of random sequences according to their Hamming distance from a moderately small number of test sequences. In this paper we describe a special type of hybridization chromatography, where a mixture of oligomers (partially) complementary to a given test-sequence is hybridized to the test sequence, covalently bound to a matrix. DNA oligomers are eluted in an 'effective temperature gradient' using conditions that minimize the differences of effects of GC versus AT pairs on the melting temperatures. This method should be a means to quickly separate error classes and thus be the crucial step in characterizing fitness landscapes of biopolymers through an experimental approach, It would also be a useful tool to design sequence pools with a bias towards desired mutant spectra.

AB  - Energy use has increased steadily over the last century due to population and industry increase. With the growing of GHG, biomass becomes an essential contributor to the world energy need. Indonesia is the third rice producer in the world. Rice straw has been converted to solid fuel by Hydrothermal Treatment (HT) for electricity generation. HT is a boiling solid organic or inorganic substance in water at high pressure and temperature within a holding time. HT converts high moisture content biomass into dried, uniform, pulverized, and higher energy density solid fuels. HT can effectively transport nutrient components in biomass into a liquid product known as fertilizer. This paper deals with an evaluation of hydrothermal treatment of rice straw for solid fuel and liquid fertilizer. An investigation of rice straw characteristics were completed for Bandung rice straw with various condition of temperature, biomass-water ratio, and holding time in the purpose to find the changes of calorific value for solid product and (N, P, K, and pH) for liquid product. The results showed that solid product at 225 degrees C and 90 min consists in a heating value 13.8 MJ/kg equal to lignite B. Liquid product at 225 degrees C and 90 min had the NPK content similar to that of micronutrients compound liquid fertilizer. The dried solid product should be useful for Coal Fire Power Plant, and the liquid product is suitable for plants. This research proves that hydrothermal process can be applied to rice straw to produce solid fuel and liquid fertilizer with adequate quality.

AB  - It has been predicted that in the coming decades the global climate will get warmer and in some regions dryer. Global warming may influence the genetic structure of forest tree populations. This paper presents a simulation study on possible effects of an increasing annual mean temperature and decreasing precipitation during the growing season on the genetic structure characterised by inventories of six isozyme gene loci in provenance trials of Norway spruce (Pirea abies (L.) Karst.). The data for parameterising the model were taken from a trial on 25-year-old Norway spruce. From the data a virtual stand was generated to simulate growth over a period of 75 years at seven sites with varying environmental conditions. The tree growth simulator SILVA 2.2 was run with two scenarios (I. natural mortality only; II. natural mortality and thinning from above). The results of the simulation runs were linked with the isozyme data of the trees as investigated in the trees that were selected for generating the virtual population. In the simulated populations at the age of 100 allele and genotype frequencies were determined. Based on the isozyme data calculations of various measures of genetic multiplicity, heterozygosity, genetic diversity, and genetic differentiation were performed for each simulation run.
   At the age of 100 years three growth parameters,how large differentiation between sites. Such a separation cannot be found for the genetic parameters as assessed by isozyme gene markers. However, most of the eight genetic parameters differ between sites. Significant differences arc calculated for four genetic parameters in scenario I and for six genetic parameters in scenario II. This result obtained by a new approach, calls for additional studies where more initial populations with different characteristics are tested in various scenarios and with different types of markers.

AB  - Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) has become increasingly popular in industry in recent decades because it enables exceptional degrees of freedom regarding the structural design of lightweight components compared to subtractive manufacturing techniques. Laser metal deposition (LMD) of wire-fed material shows in particular the advantages such as high process velocity and efficient use of material compared to other LAM processes. During wire-based LMD, the material is deposited onto a substrate and supplemented by successive layers allowing a layer-wise production of complex three-dimensional structures. Despite the increased productivity of LMD, regarding the ability to process aluminium alloys, there is still a lack in quality and reproducibility due to the inhomogeneous temperature distribution during the process, leading to undesired residual stresses, distortions and inconsistent layer geometries and poor microstructures. In this study, the aluminium alloy AA5087 as wire and AA5754 as substrate material were utilized for LMD. In order to obtain information about the temperature field during LMD, thermocouple and thermography measurements were performed during the process. The temperature measurements were used to validate a finite element model regarding the heat distribution, which will be further used to investigate the temperature field evolution over time. To consider the continuous addition of material within the FE-model, an inactive/active element approach was chosen, where initially deactivated elements are activated corresponding to the deposition of material. The first results of the simulation and the experiments show good agreement. Therefore, the model can be used in the future for LMD process optimization, e.g., in terms of minimizing local variations of the thermal load for each layer.

AB  - Several aspects of the biology of Phymaturus lizards including their herbivorous diet, specialized microhabitat use, and viviparous reproductive mode are highly conserved within the group. Here, we explore two aspects of Phymaturus thermal biology and test for the co-evolution among aspects of the thermal biology in these lizards, such as thermal preferenda and critical temperatures. Secondly, we explore correlations among variation in thermal biology with elevation and latitude. To do so, we used phylogenetically based comparative analyses (PCM) together with conventional statistics. Our results show that thermal biology for Phymaturus is conservative and our data do not suggest the co-evolution of thermal variables. Moreover, we detected low levels of variation in the thermal parameters studied, and no clear relationships between climatic and thermal variables. As a significant association between climatic and thermal variables could be demonstrated for a set of syntopic Liolaemus lizards, we suggest that thermal biology in Phymaturus lizards may be evolutionarily or ecologically constrained.

AB  - The evolutive cycle of Grapholita molesta (Busck, 1916) was studied on an artificial diet, at constant temperature (20, 23, 26 and 30-degrees-C), relative humidity of 75+ 10% and photofase of 14 hours, with the objective to determine thermal requirements to different phases of development and to predict number of generations per and on peach trees in Pelotas, RS, Brazil. Low threshold temperature and the value of thermal constant in degree-days (DD) were done by using the hyperbole method. Lowest threshold temperatures were 6,47-degrees-C (egg), 9,04-degrees-C (larva), 12,780 (pre-pupa), 6,61-degrees-C (pupa) and 8,99-degrees-C (evolutive cycle). Thermal constants were 64,79 DD (egg), 223,63 DD (larva), 50,16 DD (pre-pupa), 155,46 DD (pupa) and 482,00 DD (evolutive cycle). Based on threshold temperature for the evolutive cycle it was estimated in the above locality that oriental fruit moth should have six to seven generations per year and four to five on peach trees.

AB  - An experimental design was applied to improve the reaction conditions for enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin from phenylglycine methyl ester (PGME) and 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), catalyzed by penicillin G acylase from E. coli immobilized on an agarose-glyoxyl derivative. The presence and magnitude of interactions between reaction variables were estimated using a 25 factorial design. A batch reactor was employed to assess the influence of the following variables: pH, temperature, initial 6-APA concentration, buffer concentration, and the presence of methadol. Response variables were productivity, selectivity, and yield (based on initial 6-APA concentration). The best synthesis yield (56.9%) was at T = 4degreesC and pH 6.5. The highest productivity (49.3 x 10(-3)mM of antibiotic/min) was achieved at T = 25degreesC and pH 6.5. Our results indicate that it is possible to achieve high productivity for this system while maintaining a high selectivity and yield.

AB  - Vertical temperature profiles were recorded from June 1999 to October 2002 (at least once a month) at two Mediterranean sites, in the eastern basin (Batroun, Lebanon; 0-100 m) and in the northwestern basin (Marseilles, France; 0-55 m). At the two sites, the thermal seasonal evolution and the thermocline time dynamics are quite identical. But in the Lebanese waters, at comparable water depths, temperatures are currently 4 to 5 degreesC higher than in the French waters, the thermocline is longer (more than 6 months), permanent and deeper (40-50 m) than in Marseilles (20-30 m). The latter frequently disappears in summer due to northwest winds inducing cold waters. This is principally due to differences in prevailing wind regimes at each site. Such evaluation, coupled with long-term observations of temporal evolution of coastal water at the regional level of the Mediterranean basins, will shed light on temperature regime fluctuations and their consequences in the context of global warming of the Mediterranean.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if survivor curves for heat-inactivated Escherichia coli O157:H7 were affected by the physiological state of the cells relative to growth conditions and pH of the heating menstruum. A comparison was made between the log-linear model and non-log-linear Weibull approach. Cells were grown statically in aerobic culture tubes or in an aerobic chemostat in tryptic soy broth (pH 7.2). The heating menstruum was unbuffered peptone or phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Thermal inactivation was carried out at 58, 59, 60, and 61 C, and recovery was on a nonselective medium. Longer inactivation times for statically grown cells indicated potential stress adaptation. This was more prevalent at 58 C. Shape response was also significantly different, with statically grown cells exhibiting decreasing thermal resistance over time and chemostat cells showing the opposite effect. Buffering the heating menstruum to ca. pH 7 resulted in inactivation curves that showed less variability or scatter of data points. Time to specific log reduction values (t(d)) for the Weibull model were conservative relative to the log-linear model depending upon the stage of reduction. The Weibull model offered the most accurate fit of the data in all cases, especially considering the log-linear model is equivalent to the Weibull model with a fixed shape factor of 1. The determination of z-value for the log-linear model showed a strong correlation between log D-value and process temperature. Correlations for the Weibull model parameters (log delta and log p) versus process temperature were not statistically significant.

AB  - Bacteria exhibit an optimal growth rate in culture media with sufficient nutrients at an optimal temperature and pH. In addition, the concentration of solutes plays a critical role in bacterial growth and survival. Glutamate is known to be a major anionic solute involved in osmoregulation and the bacterial cell's response to changes in solute concentration. To determine how glutamate uptake is involved in osmoregulation in the rice bacterial pathogen Burkholderia glumae BGR1, we mutated the gltl gene encoding a periplasmic substrate binding protein of a glutamate transport system to abolish glutamate uptake, and monitored the growth of the gill null mutant in Luria-Bertani medium. We found that the gill null mutant showed a slower growth rate than the wild-type strain and experienced hyperosmotic stress resulting in water loss from the cytoplasm in stationary phase. When the incubation time was extended, the mutant population collapsed due to the hyperosmotic stress. The gill null mutant exhibited loss of adaptability under both hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic stresses. The growth rate of the gltl null mutant was restored to the level of wild-type growth by exogenous addition of glycine betaine to the culture medium, indicating that glycine betaine is a compatible solute in B. glumae. These results indicate that glutamate uptake from the environment plays a key role in osmoregulation in B. glumae.

AB  - Recoding viral genomes by introducing numerous synonymous nucleotide substitutions that create suboptimal codon pairs provides new live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Because recoding typically involves a large number of nucleotide substitutions, the risk of de-attenuation is presumed to be low. However, this has not been thoroughly studied. We previously generated human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in which the NS1, NS2, N, P, M and SH ORFs were codon-pair deoptimized (CPD) by 695 synonymous nucleotide changes (Min A virus). Min A exhibited a global reduction in transcription and protein synthesis, was restricted for replication in vitro and in vivo, and exhibited moderate temperature sensitivity. Here, we show that under selective pressure by serial passage at progressively increasing temperatures, Min A regained replication fitness and lost its temperature sensitivity. Whole-genome deep sequencing identified numerous missense mutations in several genes, in particular ones accumulating between codons 25 and 34 of the phosphoprotein (P), a polymerase cofactor and chaperone. When re-introduced into Min A, these P mutations restored viral transcription to wt level, resulting in increased protein expression and RNA replication. Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that these P mutations increased the flexibility of the N-terminal domain of P, which might facilitate its interaction with the nucleoprotein N, and increase the functional efficiency of the RSV transcription/replication complex. Finally, we evaluated the effect of the P mutations on Min A replication and immunogenicity in hamsters. Mutation P[F28V] paradoxically reduced Min A replication but not its immunogenicity. The further addition of one missense mutation each in M and L generated a version of Min A with increased genetic stability. Thus, this study provides further insight into the adaptability of large-scale recoded RNA viruses under selective pressure and identified an improved CPD RSV vaccine candidate.
   Author summarySynonymous recoding of viral genomes by codon-pair deoptimization (CPD) generates live-attenuated vaccines presumed to be genetically stable due to the high number of nucleotide substitutions. However, their actual genetic stability under selective pressure was largely unknown. In a recoded human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mutant called Min A, six of 11 ORFs were CPD, reducing protein expression and inducing moderate temperature sensitivity and attenuation. When passaged in vitro under selective pressure, Min A lost its temperature-sensitive phenotype and regained fitness by the acquisition of numerous mutations, in particular missense mutations in the viral phosphoprotein (P), a polymerase cofactor and a chaperone for soluble nucleoprotein. These P mutations increased RSV gene transcription globally, thereby increasing RSV protein expression, RNA replication, and virus particle production. Thus, the P mutations increased the efficiency of the RSV transcription/replication complex, compensating for the reduced protein expression due to CPD. In addition, introduction of the P mutations into Min A generated a live-attenuated vaccine candidate with increased genetic stability. Surprisingly, this vaccine candidate exhibited increased attenuation and, paradoxically, exhibited increased immunogenicity per plaque-forming unit in hamsters. This study provides insights into the adaptability of large-scale recoded RNA viruses and identified an improved CPD RSV vaccine candidate.

AB  - Bacterial survival requires adaptation to different environmental perturbations such as exposure to antibiotics, changes in temperature or oxygen levels, DNA damage, and alternative nutrient sources. During adaptation, bacteria often develop beneficial mutations that confer increased fitness in the new environment. Adaptation to the loss of a major non-essential gene product that cripples growth, however, has not been studied at the whole-genome level. We investigated the ability of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 to overcome the loss of phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi) by adaptively evolving ten replicates of E. coli lacking pgi for 50 days in glucose M9 minimal medium and by characterizing endpoint clones through whole-genome re-sequencing and phenotype profiling. We found that 1) the growth rates for all ten endpoint clones increased approximately 3-fold over the 50-day period; 2) two to five mutations arose during adaptation, most frequently in the NADH/NADPH transhydrogenases udhA and pntAB and in the stress-associated sigma factor rpoS; and 3) despite similar growth rates, at least three distinct endpoint phenotypes developed as defined by different rates of acetate and formate secretion. These results demonstrate that E. coli can adapt to the loss of a major metabolic gene product with only a handful of mutations and that adaptation can result in multiple, alternative phenotypes.

AB  - The effect of additives, such as an inorganic alkali and a nickel catalyst, on the hydrothermal process was examined to generate hydrogen from biomass with high selectivity at relatively low temperatures around 400 degrees C. At first, a cellulose sample as model biomass was subjected to the hydrothermal process at 400 degrees C under 25 MPa in the presence of an alkali (Na(2)CO(3)) and a nickel catalyst (Ni/SiO(2)). The combination of these two additives led not only to highly efficient generation of hydrogen but also to effective dissolution of CO(2) into an alkaline liquid layer. Here the molar yields of gas products from the cellulose sample were compared with the equilibrium quantities obtained using a thermodynamics calculation software. Furthermore, the hydrothermal process of real biomass, such as wood chips, organic fertilizer and food waste, in the presence of both the two additives resulted in highly selective production of hydrogen even at 400 degrees C.

AB  - Methods A generalized linear Poisson regression model was used to regress a time-series of daily mortality for all-cause and selected causes against temperature, controlling for seasonal and interannual variations, day of week and public holidays. A total of 13 270 all-cause deaths excluding external causes for residents under demographic surveillance in Matlab, Bangladesh were available between January 1994 and December 2002.
   Results There was a marked increase in all-cause deaths and deaths due to cardiovascular, respiratory and perinatal causes at low temperatures over a lag of 013 days. Every 1C decrease in mean temperature was associated with a 3.2 (95 CI 0.95.5) increase in all-cause mortality. However, there was no clear heat effect on all-cause mortality for any of the lags examined.
   Conclusions This study found that daily mortality increased with low temperatures in the preceding weeks, while there was no association found between high temperatures and daily mortality in rural Bangladesh. Preventive measures during low temperatures should be considered especially for young infants.

AB  - Background: Changes in environmental conditions require temporal effectuation of different metabolic pathways in order to maintain the organisms' viability but also to enable the settling into newly arising conditions. While analyses of robustness in biological systems have resulted in the characterization of reactions that facilitate homeostasis, temporal adaptation-related processes and the role of cellular pathways in the metabolic response to changing conditions remain elusive.
   Results: Here we develop a flux-based approach that allows the integration of time-resolved transcriptomics data with genome-scale metabolic networks. Our framework uses bilevel optimization to extract temporal minimal operating networks from a given large-scale metabolic model. The minimality of the extracted networks enables the computation of elementary flux modes for each time point, which are in turn used to characterize the transitional behavior of the network as well as of individual reactions. Application of the approach to the metabolic network of Escherichia coli in conjunction with time-series gene expression data from cold and heat stress results in two distinct time-resolved modes for reaction utilization-constantly active and temporally (de) activated reactions. These patterns contrast the processes for the maintenance of basic cellular functioning and those required for adaptation. They also allow the prediction of reactions involved in time- and stress-specific metabolic response and are verified with respect to existing experimental studies.
   Conclusions: Altogether, our findings pinpoint the inherent relation between the systemic properties of robustness and adaptability arising from the interplay of metabolic network structure and changing environment.

AB  - Background: Laribacter hongkongensis is associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea and it can reside in human, fish, frogs and water. In this study, we performed an in-depth annotation of the genes in its genome related to adaptation to the various environmental niches.
   Results: L. hongkongensis possessed genes for DNA repair and recombination, basal transcription, alternative sigma-factors and 109 putative transcription factors, allowing DNA repair and global changes in gene expression in response to different environmental stresses. For acid stress, it possessed a urease gene cassette and two arc gene clusters. For alkaline stress, it possessed six CDSs for transporters of the monovalent cation/proton antiporter-2 and NhaC Na+:H+ antiporter families. For heavy metals acquisition and tolerance, it possessed CDSs for iron and nickel transport and efflux pumps for other metals. For temperature stress, it possessed genes related to chaperones and chaperonins, heat shock proteins and cold shock proteins. For osmotic stress, 25 CDSs were observed, mostly related to regulators for potassium ion, proline and glutamate transport. For oxidative and UV light stress, genes for oxidant-resistant dehydratase, superoxide scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, exclusion and export of redox-cycling antibiotics, redox balancing, DNA repair, reduction of disulfide bonds, limitation of iron availability and reduction of iron-sulfur clusters are present. For starvation, it possessed phosphorus and, despite being asaccharolytic, carbon starvation-related CDSs.
   Conclusions: The L. hongkongensis genome possessed a high variety of genes for adaptation to acid, alkaline, temperature, osmotic, oxidative, UV light and starvation stresses and acquisition of and tolerance to heavy metals.

AB  - Key message Higher temperatures are changing the geographical locations in which Pinus tabulaeformis plantations thrive. Future plantations should be located in the warmer, wetter regions of northern China. The adaptability of fragile plantation ecosystems to environmental change, especially in our currently warming climate, has become an important issue. We studied the growth of Pinus tabulaeformis, a tree species endemic to China and widely used in plantations, along a climate-latitude gradient. We established a regional tree ring data network for P. tabulaeformis based on 1340 cores from 28 plantations at the northern limits of its natural range in China and studied the association between the radial growth of the pines and climate factors in a changing environment. Our results show that increasing temperatures have led to changes in the distribution of P. tabulaeformis, with plantations expanding in the southern sub-regions and shrinking in the northern sub-regions. An increase in temperature and the subsequent effect on the availability of water is the most important factor in the different responses of P. tabulaeformis growth to climate change. Relatively wetter regions, such as the southern part of our study area, may be better locations to develop future P. tabulaeformis plantations.

AB  - Variation in lifespan may be linked to geographic factors. Although latitudinal variation in lifespan has been studied for a number of species, altitude variation has received much less attention, particularly in insects. We measured the lifespan of different populations of the Natal fruit fly, Ceratitis rosa, along an altitudinal cline. For the different populations, we first measured the residual longevity of wild flies by captive cohort approach and compared the F-1 generation from the same populations. We showed an increase in lifespan with higher altitude for a part of the data obtained. For the field-collected flies (F-0) the average remaining lifespan increased monotonically with altitude for males but not for females. For the F-1 generation, the longevity of both males and females of the highest-altitude population was longer than for the two other lower-altitude populations. This relationship between altitude and lifespan may be explained by the effects of temperature on reproduction. Reproductive schedules in insects are linked to temperature: lower temperature, which is characteristic of high-altitude sites, generally slows down reproduction. Because of a strong trade-off between reproduction and longevity, we therefore observed a longer lifespan for the high-altitude populations. Other hypotheses, such as different predation rates in the different sites, are also discussed. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 101, 345-350.

AB  - Environmental temperature and an organism's ability to respond to it are critical determinants of the geographic distribution of species. Nematostella vectensis is a burrowing sea anemone that inhabits estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America from Nova Scotia (45 degrees N) to Georgia (31 degrees N). Like other estuarine species, N. vectensis is exposed to large daily (>20 degrees C) and seasonal (>25 degrees C) fluctuations in temperature, requiring wide temperature tolerances. At the same time, the natural distribution of this species spans a pronounced thermal cline, which may promote the evolution of different temperature optima and tolerances in populations. We tested the thermal tolerance of N. vectensis adult and developmental stages, which showed all life cycle stages had critical temperatures within 1 degrees C (lethal temperature 39.5 to 40.5 degrees C). When temperature tolerance values were compared with recorded field data, N. vectensis is living in environments very close to their physiological limit. We utilized common garden experiments (13, 21, and 29 degrees C) to test for temperature-specific growth and regeneration rates in N. vectensis from different portions of this species' range. Temperature had a significant effect on growth and regeneration rate in all clonal lines, with a significant negative relationship between latitude of origin and growth rate at 29 degrees C. Individuals from higher latitudes did not exhibit higher growth rates at cooler temperatures. Together, our results show a combination of broad thermal tolerances for developmental and adult stages and evidence for local adaptation to higher temperatures in populations living in lower latitude locations that would be physiologically compromised with future warming.

AB  - The effect of extrusion temperature profile in the melt-spinning process of as-spun linear aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester (AAC) fibres upon their mechanical properties and process productivity was modelled by using factorial experimental designs. After the viscoelastic and morphology characteristics of the polymer were considered using Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Melt Flow Index (MFI), the rheological data were used to determine the enhanced melt-spinning temperature of the six heating zones in the process. Tensile strength, elongation at break, modulus and fibre productivity (g/min) of the melt-spinning process have been quantitatively assessed as responses to polymer grades and extrusion zone temperature. The optimisation of mechanical properties and productivity helps in understanding and controlling the most desired properties in the produced fibre. It has been noted that the die head temperature (spinning temperature), the polymer grade and their interaction are the most significant factors affecting the mechanical properties. Analysis of the fibre productivity shows that the polymer grade and its interaction with the die head temperature is significant in terms of influencing the output of the melt-spinning process, which could be related to the polymer molecular weight and polymer structure. There is an interaction between polymer grade and feeding zone temperature which is related to the material supply action in the feeding zone. The friction between the screw and the material is affected by heating action, which affects the moisture content and the molten material rheology. By adjusting the extrusion temperature profile and selecting the more applicable spin-able polymer grade through a statistical forecasting model, the combination of the cost related to material grade and processing cost controls the fibre production cost. The fibre made of low MFI grade has better structure and mechanical properties than that made of the higher MFI grade, and the former will be preferred for future work. With previous work related to the effects of extrusion temperature profile on the fibre structure, the present paper will help in developing the production process of biodegradable linear AAC fibres.

AB  - Nowadays, the unprecedented rates of anthropogenic changes in ecosystems suggest that organisms have to migrate to new distributional ranges or to adapt commensurately quickly to new conditions to avoid becoming extinct. Pollution and global warming are two of the most important threats aquatic organisms will have to face in the near future. If genetic changes in a population in response to natural selection are extensively studied, the role of acclimation through phenotypic plasticity (the property of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to particular environmental conditions) in a species to deal with new environmental conditions remains largely unknown. Proteomics is the extensive study of the protein complement of a genome. It is dynamic and depends on the specific tissue, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. As the final product of gene expression, it is subjected to several regulatory steps from gene transcription to the functional protein. Consequently, there is a discrepancy between the abundance of mRNA and the abundance of the corresponding protein. Moreover, proteomics is closer to physiology and gives a more functional knowledge of the regulation of gene expression than does transcriptomics. The study of protein-expression profiles, however, gives a better portrayal of the cellular phenotype and is considered as a key link between the genotype and the organismal phenotype. Under new environmental conditions, we can observe a shift of the protein-expression pattern defining a new cellular phenotype that can possibly improve the fitness of the organism. It is now necessary to define a proteomic norm of reaction for organisms acclimating to environmental stressors. Its link to fitness will give new insights into how organisms can evolve in a changing environment. The proteomic literature bearing on chronic exposure to pollutants and on acclimation to heat stress in aquatic organisms, as well as potential application of proteomics in evolutionary issues, are outlined. While the transcriptome responses are commonly investigated, proteomics approaches now need to be intensified, with the new perspective of integrating the cellular phenotype with the organismal phenotype and with the mechanisms of the regulation of gene expression, such as epigenetics.

AB  - Desiccation and starvation tolerance were measured along latitudinal transects in three Drosophilid species (Drosophila ananassae, D. melanogaster, and Zaprionus indianus) of the Indian subcontinent. In each case, significant latitudinal dines were observed; desiccation tolerance increased with latitude while starvation tolerance decreased. Such field observations suggest that desiccation and starvation tolerance are fitness related traits that are independently selected in nature and genetically independent. It was, however, difficult to relate these genetic changes with precise climatic variables, except winter temperature. The overall negative correlation between the two traits, which was evidenced in natural populations, contrasts with a positive correlation generally observed in various laboratory selection experiments and that also seems to exist between different species. These observations point to the difficulty of interpreting correlations among fitness-related traits when different evolutionary levels are compared, and also different sets of data, that is, field versus laboratory studies.

AB  - Animal individuality is proposed to describe individual differences in behavior. Individuals may exhibit consistent differences in behavioral traits within a population, and these traits are heritable. It has also been known that animal individuality can be attributed to both genetic and environmental effects. We previously observed the presence of bold individuals (BI) and shy individuals (SI) in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). However, the individuality distribution and the behavioral phenotype of offspring with different individualities remain unclear. In this study, the temperature and acidity challenges of larvae at 25 days-post-hatch (DPH) and juvenile (50 DPH) of bold and shy flounder offspring were investigated at pH = 7.3, 7.7, 8.1 and temperature at 4, 18, 28 degrees C. On 25 DPH, bold offspring (BO) showed higher survival rates with acidity at pH = 7.3 and 4 degrees C challenge. Three behavioral phenotypes (bold, middle and shy individuals, BI, MI and SI) were observed in both juvenile (8 MPH) bold and shy flounder offspring. The percentage of SI offspring from the shy maternal line (SS) was higher than BI offspring from the bold maternal line (BB) (0.75 vs. 0.58). BI from both BO (BB) and SO (SB) were more motivated to feed and active during net confinement than SI (BS and SS). Furthermore, BB and SB exhibited higher metabolic rates and actively responded to predator stressor, while BS and SS showed a divergent tendency. However, the metabolism of the offspring seemed to be partially affected by their maternal line. Taken together, our study indicates that screening of animal individuality in population would improve animal welfare and increase the output efficiency of flounder in aquaculture.

AB  - 1 Infestation by the blackcurrant leaf midge Dasineura tetensi and galling incidence on a susceptible (cv. 'Ojebyn') and a moderately resistant (cv. 'Storklas') blackcurrant genotype was studied in the field for two midge generations in the same growing season. On the resistant genotype gall initiation is delayed.
   2 The relation between infestation and galling incidence showed considerable variation between the two generations. Galling symptoms produced by the second midge generation were weak on the resistant as compared with the susceptible blackcurrant.
   3 Because larval development of that generation coincided with a period of dry and warm weather, it is possible that larvae on the resistant genotype suffered desiccation to a greater extent than larvae on the susceptible genotype where gall development was stronger.
   4 The possible interaction of relative humidity and expression of resistance was investigated in controlled environment experiments. The resistant 'Storklas' and a susceptible ('7801-31') currant genotype were studied at two constant relative humidities, 30 and 70%.
   5 Larvae of D. tetensi suffered from higher mortality and reduced growth rate on both genotypes in the low humidity environment.
   6 There was also a significant plant genotype by humidity interaction on larval performance; no galls were produced and no larvae completed development on the resistant currant at low humidity.
   7 There was a trend for a positive correlation between larval length and larval density on a plant at low humidity but not at high humidity.

AB  - The characteristics of oxygen/hydrogen productivity using 30-mol%-M (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn)-doped CeO2-delta (30-mol%-M-CeO2-delta) were studied for the thermochemical two-step water splitting cycle comprising TR (thermal reduction) at 1500 degrees C and WD (water decomposition) at 1150 degrees C. The reproducibility of oxygen evolution was evaluated using 30-mol%-M-CeO2-delta and the effects of different M dopants were compared in the TR temperature range of 1200-1500 degrees C. Two solid phases detected in the 30-mol%-M- CeO2-delta powders were involved in the redox reaction of the thermochemical two-step water splitting cycle. Among the M-CeO2-delta samples evaluated, Mn-doped CeO2-delta provided the most stable and reproducible results and the highest reactivity for oxygen evolution at all temperatures employed for the TR step of the thermochemical two-step water-splitting cycle.

AB  - Damming the Yangtze River has resulted in a shortened spawning migration distance and time period, created altered and fewer spawning locations, reduced spawning population size, and narrowed the spawning temperature range for the Chinese sturgeon, Acipenser sinensis. No sign of spawning activity was detected in 2013 and 2014, raising concern about the possible extinction of the species. However, the recent discovery of four wild juvenile Chinese sturgeon in the Yangtze Estuary in 2015 suggests that following a short time period when spawning was suspended, a few Chinese sturgeon have resumed spawning at an unknown location in the Yangtze River. This demonstrates that Chinese sturgeon have an extraordinary ability to adapt to environmental changes. However, they appear to have reached their limit in adapting to the drastically changed riverine environment. Innovative conservation efforts are needed to improve the chances for survival of this critically endangered species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - OPTIMAL SEX-RATIO AS A FUNCTION OF EGG INCUBATION-TEMPERATURE IN THE CROCODILIANS
T2  - BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Recently, there has been a growing consensus as to the adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination in the Crocodilia. The observationally and experimentally motivated hypotheses are that male fitness depends more strongly on quality of incubation environment than female fitness, and that there is a strong correlation between a female's egg incubation temperature choice and her own egg incubation temperature. A population genetics model based on these hypotheses is derived. A method for finding the optimal sex ratio as a function of temperature, which is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), is stated and applied under various assumptions. This extends ESS theory to the functional case. Cases where there is no ESS and the population sex ratio oscillates in evolutionary time are discovered. Numerical computation is needed to solve the full problem and the resulting optimal sex ratio is compared to laboratory sex ratio data. The general pattern of TSD in crocodilians (female male-female with female biased overall sex ratio) agrees well with the theory, but details of the pattern are problematic.

A major, and largely unexplored, uncertainty in projecting the impact of climate change on biodiversity is the consequence of altered interspecific interactions, for example between parasitoids and their hosts. The present study investigated parasitism in the Brown Argus butterfly, Aricia agestis; a species that has expanded northward in Britain during the last 30 years in association with climate warming.
   2. Aricia agestis larvae suffered lower mortality from parasitoids in newly colonised areas compared with long-established populations. This result was consistent over four consecutive generations (2 years) when comparing one population of each type, and also when several populations within the historical and recently colonised range of the species were compared within a single year. Thus, A. agestis appears to be partially escaping from parasitism as it expands northwards.
   3. Reduced parasitism occurred despite the fact that several of the parasitoid species associated with A. agestis were already present in the newly colonised areas, supported predominantly by an alternative host species, the Common Blue butterfly, Polyommatus icarus.
   4. As the species expand their distributions into areas of increased climatic suitability, invasion fronts may escape from natural enemies, enhancing rates of range expansion. The results suggest that the decoupling of interspecific interactions may allow some species to exploit a wider range of environments and to do so more rapidly than previously thought possible.

AB  - When two streams of different salinities are mixed, Gibbs free energy of mixing is released. This energy can be harvested and further converted to electric energy through pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) process. Despite several improvements on PRO over the past decades, there still exist several technical issues pertinent to its adequate implementation that remain unresolved. These issues are mainly (i) water transport in the membrane, (ii) membrane material, (iii) fouling, (iv) process efficiency, and (v) techno-economic viability. Different process parameters such as temperature, type of draw solution, feed concentration, and membrane type directly affect the efficiency and power density of PRO. In this review, major trends of PRO (and hybrid plants) are analyzed and the suggested improvements of PRO membranes are discussed. Since potential side-benefits of PRO include electricity production and the treatment of rejected brine from desalination, the process presents a unique path to utilize all these advantages. Therefore, PRO is also coupled with other osmotic, desalination processes to maximize efficiency. The amount of useful energy from PRO would probably be enormous if this was exploited globally. There are several questions remain unanswered about the overall feasibility of PRO as a stand-alone process. This paper offers a comprehensive background and overview on the developments in PRO to enhance its power density and feasibility.

AB  - The technology of the underground coal gasification (UCG) is still under development and provides alternative for conventional underground mining. UCG is the process, which can be attractive from environmental and economic aspect and is able to have a wide utilization in the future. This technology is less expensive than conventional mining. For research and good analyze of this process there was created the physical model of the gasifier, that simulate the conditions of the real coal-bed in geometric similarity. On created physical model was performed a several experiments represent a various underground conditions. In the gasification process the input is the coal (coal-bed) and oxidizer (mixture of the air and oxygen), which suitable combination provides the best conditions for gasification. One of the expected outputs from the coal gasification process is the high temperature in the coal-bed, which enable running of the chemical reaction needed for the syngas generation. The control of this temperature in the single places of the coal-bed would enable to control behavior of the chemical reactions so the burning queue proceeds. The measurement of the temperatures inside the coal-bed is still complicated because there is the high thermocouples mortality in aggressively hot environment. For this reason is needed to use mathematic - physical apparatus for indirect measurement of these temperatures. In this contribution is presented proposal of the indirect temperature measurement structure in the coal-bed that was verified in the laboratory conditions on the experimental gasifier.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP), as an important variable and ecological indicator in grassland ecosystems, can reflect environmental change and the carbon budget level. The Ili River Valley is a wetland nestled in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, which responds sensitively to the global climate change. Understanding carbon budget and their responses to climate change in the ecosystem of Ili River Valley has a significant effect on the adaptability of future climate change and sustainable development. In this study, we calculated the NPP and analyzed its spatio-temporal pattern of the Ili River Valley during the period 2000-2014 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and an improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) model. Results indicate that validation showed a good performance of CASA over the study region, with an overall coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.65 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 20.86 g C/(m(2).a). Temporally, annual NPP of the Ili River Valley was 599.19 g C/(m(2).a) and showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2014, with an annual decrease rate of-3.51 g C/(m(2).a). However, the spatial variation was not consistent, in which 55.69% of the areas showed a decreasing tendency, 12.60% of the areas remained relatively stable and 31.71% appeared an increasing tendency. In addition, the decreasing trends in NPP were not continuous throughout the 15-year period, which was likely being caused by a shift in climate conditions. Precipitation was found to be the dominant climatic factor that controlled the inter-annual variability in NPP. Furthermore, the correlations between NPP and climate factors differed along the vertical zonal. In the medium-high altitudes of the Ili River Valley, the NPP was positively correlated to precipitation and negatively correlated to temperature and net radiation. In the low-altitude valley and high-altitude mountain areas, the NPP showed a negative correlation with precipitation and a weakly positive correlation with temperature and net radiation. The results suggested that the vegetation of the Ili River Valley degraded in recent years, and there was a more complex mechanism of local hydrothermal redistribution that controlled the growth of vegetation in this valley ecosystem.

AB  - The population of Nilaparvata lugens (StAyenl) in Taiwan is believed to belong to the East Asian population of the species, which has low susceptibility to the insecticide imidacloprid. The population in the Philippines belongs to the Southeast Asian population, which has high susceptibility to imidacloprid. In this study, long-winged adults of N. lugens collected in paddy fields in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan, just after a typhoon, were tested for imidacloprid susceptibility after rearing for 4-17 generations. The migration source was also estimated by backward trajectory analysis. Our findings were, first, that its curved dosage-mortality plots for imidacloprid suggested that the Taitung population is heterogeneous in its susceptibility to the insecticide. Source estimation found areas on Luzon Island of the Philippines, mainly, and southern China, partially, as possible sources. Before the typhoon approached, however, light trap monitoring data indicated some local populations might have occurred in the survey area. Therefore, with other pieces of circumstantial evidence, this study suggested that migration of N. lugens to Taiwan from the Philippines, and, simultaneously, possibly southern China occurred because of the typhoon, with the insects partly crossing the boundary of the Asian populations, and that a mixture of individuals with different susceptibility to the insecticide happened to form the Taitung population at the time of collection.

AB  - We retrospectively analysed data from heterospermic and homospermic boar semen for motility and morphology during a 2-year period. Homospermic doses were also evaluated for viability, acrosome integrity, DNA fragmentation, osmolality and pH. Additionally, we investigated the effect of temperature upon arrival and the agreement between viability and motility as evaluating tool. We observed lower (p < .05) total motility (TM) and normal sperm morphology within summer and fall. Conversely, lower (p < .05) progressive motility (PM) was found at the beginning and end of each year. Viability and acrosome integrity were reduced (p < .05) in summer months but not exclusively, suggesting that samples could be compromised by transport temperature. Sperm DNA fragmentation was <6% with a small variation. Medium osmolality and pH slightly changed (p < .05). Sperm count was not source of variation on sperm parameters. Sample temperature upon arrival correlated with PM and VSL (p < .05), while motility was reduced <12 degrees C (p < .05). Homospermic doses were less affected by season and arrival temperature, having better parameters (p < .05) than contemporaneous heterospermic samples but influenced by genetic line (p < .05). We found a high agreement between viable acrosome-intact sperm and TM, especially when TM was >= 80%. Our data verify the improvement of sperm quality during time as sperm count/dose does not affect quality, but season effect persists regardless of ejaculate selection at the stud. Homospermic doses exhibited better parameters than heterospermic doses, seemingly being more resilient to temperature variations, suggesting that selection for sperm quality within boars selected by growth traits can improve the product quality.

AB  - We examined the overwintering ability of a flightless strain of the ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which is used as a biological control agent for aphids. The flightless strain was established via artificial selection for reduced flight ability and with no exposure to cold temperature (winter) during the selection. To examine the overwintering ability of the flightless strain, the survival rates were compared with those of wild strains under low temperature laboratory conditions and field winter conditions. In the laboratory experiment, survival rates of flightless strain individuals directly transferred to 5 degrees C were significantly lower than those with low temperature acclimation. Effects of aggregation on the survival rate at 5 degrees C were not confirmed. No significant differences were detected between the flightless strain and a wild strain originated from Saga, Kyushu, Japan. In the field experiment, winter survival of the flightless strain was significantly lower than the wild strain both in males and females while not significantly different from another wild strain originated from Fukuyama, Honshu (close to the original locality of the flightless strain). These results suggest that the artificial selection for reduced flight ability did not affect the overwintering ability of H. axyridis.

AB  - Increase in temperature extremes is one of the main expected impacts of climate change, as well as one of the first signs of its occurrence. Nevertheless, results emerging from General Circulation Models, while sufficient for large scales, are not enough for forecasting local trends and, hence, the IPCC has called for local studies based on on-site data. Indeed, it is expected that climate extremes will be detected much earlier than changes in climate averages. Heat waves are among the most important and least studied climate extremes, however its occurrence has been only barely studied and even its very definition remains controversial. This paper discusses the observed changes in temperature trends and heat waves in Northwestern Mexico, one of the most vulnerable regions of the country. The climate records in two locations of the region are analyzed, including one of the cities with extreme climate in Mexico, Mexicali City in the state of Baja California and the Yaqui River basin at Sonora State using three different methodologies. Results showed clear trends on temperature increase and occurrence of heat waves in both of the study zones using the three methodologies proposed. As result, some policy making suggestion are included in order to increase the adaptability of the studied regions to climate change, particularly related with heat wave occurrence.

AB  - Power-to-Gas (P2G) is a process that produces a gas from electricity, which is most commonly hydrogen via electrolysis. While some studies have considered hydrogen as a power-to-power storage vector, it could also be used as a fuel across the energy system, for example for transport or heat generation. Here, two energy models are used to explore the potential contribution of P2G as a cost-effective source of hydrogen, particularly for future energy systems with high variable renewable energy (VRE) in which there are occasional periods when electricity supply exceeds demand. A detailed electricity system model is iterated with a multi-vector energy system model using a soft-linking approach. This iterative approach addresses shortcomings in each model to better understand the optimal capacity of P2G and the potential economic capture rate of excess VRE. The modelling method is applied to Great Britain in 2050 as a case study. A substantial proportion of excess VRE in 2050 can be captured by P2G, and it is economically competitive compared with alternative sources. Moreover, the effectiveness and economic viability of P2G for reducing excess renewable is robust at even very high levels of renewable penetration. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - The intensive nse of mineral coal for thermal power generation is known to cause severe damage to the regional environment. The emission of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and fluoride (F) compounds into the atmosphere may lead, under certain conditions, to serious contamination of primary matrices in the biosphere and even of foodstuffs. In the present study, egg samples were collected from nonconfined hens (Gallus domesticus) over a period of 2 yr in the vicinity of two of the major coal power plants (Candiota and Charqueadas) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. The constituent parts of the samples (yolk, albumen, and shell) were solubilized with acid in a tenon-lined pressurized bomb after an appropriate heating step. The Cd and Pb were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry using Pd/Mg nitric solution as chemical modifier. Fluoride was determined by direct ion-selective electrode potentiometry. Cadmium concentration in the samples from both regions ranged from <0.01 (albumen) to 0.10 (yolk) mg kg(-1) whereas Pb and F concentrations ranged from 0.16 (shell) to 3.16 (yolk) and from 0.06 (yolk) to 1.75 (shell) mg kg(-1) respectively. A comparison with the higher obtained mean values for reference samples (Cd < 0.02 mg kg(-1), shell; Pb = 0.11 mg kg(-1), yolk; and F = 0.07 mg kg(-1), shell) indicates a significant environmental contamination with Pb and F in the regions of Candiota and Charqueadas. A relative Cd and Pb enrichment in the yolk was also confirmed, whereas F preferentially concentrated in the shell.

AB  - Fall-planted safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) offers potentially higher yield than spring-sown types. Yet winter survival in relation to fall growth and physiological aspects of acclimation has not been determined. Our objectives were (i) to determine the relationship between fall growth and winter survival in safflower, (ii) to assess if selection improved winter survival, and (iii) to determine if water relations and membrane leakage distinguished safflower varying in winter survival. Fall growth, leaf water relations, and leaf membrane leakage were measured in fall 2004 and 2005 at Pullman and Central Ferry, WA, and winter survival was determined. Average minimum winter temperatures were 1.0 degrees C at Central Ferry and -3.9 degrees C at Pullman, with extremes of -7.2 degrees C at Central Ferry and -19.5 degrees C at Pullman. For the 21 accessions evaluated, low fall plant habit was required for survival, but survival also varied substantially among low-habit types. Two cycles of recurrent mass selection on five low-habit types improved winter survival from 21 to 59% at Central Ferry and from 8 to 18% at Pullman. The highest survival was for BJ-27 after two selection cycles, averaging 90% at Central Ferry and 38% at Pullman. Accession BJ-27 maintained higher leaf pressure potential during fall acclimation in 2004-2005 and in 2005-2006 had higher pressure potential and membrane stability on the 8 January sampling than less-hardy types. The results show that both low habit and physiological acclimation capacity are needed for high winter survival in safflower.

AB  - An invasive freshwater shrimp, Red Cherry Shrimp (Decapoda: Caridea: Atyidae), is naturally distributed in fresh water habitats of Asia. This forage species has an important role in aquatic ecosystems by transferring planktonic production into higher trophic levels mainly including fish and aquatic animals. However, temperature strongly affects sex ratio and in turn offspring quantity. In order to determine the effect of temperature on incubation period, egg yield, offspring sex ratio as well as survival, a comprehensive experiment was conducted at three temperatures (20, 23 and 26 degrees C). Significant differences among temperatures for hatching period were an expected result. Higher survival and more eggs were achieved at 26 degrees C comparing the lower experimental temperatures. The female/male ratio, which was 80% at 20 degrees C and approximately 50% at 23 degrees C, drastically dropped to 18% at 26 degrees C. This ratio may drop to 0% at higher temperatures, which are tolerance limits for Red Cherry Shrimp. Therefore, in sex-dependent selective breeding, the temperature should be taken into consideration. Consequently, as temperature increases the sex ratio of the offspring increases in favour of the male. The continuation of global warming and rising above 26 degrees C may be an important source of stress on the natural sustainability of Red Cherry Shrimp stocks.

AB  - Characterizing the relationships between genotype and phenotype for developmental adaptive traits is essential to understand the evolutionary dynamics underlying biodiversity. In holometabolous insects, the time to reach the reproductive stage and pupation site preference are two such traits. Here we characterize aspects of the genetic architecture for Developmental Time (decomposed in Larval and Pupal components) and Pupation Height using lines derived from three natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster raised at two temperatures. For all traits, phenotypic differences and variation in plasticity between populations suggest adaptation to the original thermal regimes. However, high variability within populations shows that selection does not exhaust genetic variance for these traits. This could be partly explained by local adaptation, environmental heterogeneity and modifications in the genetic architecture of traits according to environment and ontogenetic stage. Indeed, our results show that the genetic factors affecting Developmental Time and Pupation Height are temperature-specific. Varying relationships between Larval and Pupal Developmental Time between and within populations also suggest stage-specific modifications of genetic architecture for this trait. This flexibility would allow for a somewhat independent evolution of adaptive traits at different environments and life stages, favoring the maintenance of genetic variability and thus sustaining the traits' evolvabilities.

AB  - This experimental work focuses on the effect of using an internal cooling coil under a cover glass of basin solar still in order to increase solar productivity. The data collected during the climatic conditions of September and October months in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is used in this work. The average ambient temperature is recorded around 37 degrees C (+/- 2 degrees C) at noon. The passing water through an internal cooling coil is cooled by a radiator heat exchanger, similar to those used in vehicles. The internal cooling coil used as an additional condensation surface with a cover glass. The droplets formed on the internal cooling coil by condensation are collected by a collector pipe in order to run down into a distillation channel. The solar parabolic trough and external film cooling technique is selected in this experimental setup to see its impacts on the internal cooling coil efficiency. Our topic of research on the internal cooling may be regarded as a new experimental technique to improve the productivity of the passive solar still by 25%. The modified solar still using the above techniques combined together increases the efficiency by 20.8% over the conventional solar still.

AB  - An optimised solar still prototype suitable for alcoholic distillation was designed and tested. Its design is different from the single slope conventional solar still. It consists of two compartments which are in communication by a slit. One of the two compartments contains an absorber. In a previous work, the area S of the absorber was 0.29m(2) and the slit's width e was experimentally optimised. As for the prototype studied in the work, it was realised with the optimal width found in the previous work and an absorber area S equal to 0.965m(2). The energy exchanges within the still were studied, mainly the heat transfers by convection, evaporation-condensation and radiation. Then an experimental testing of the solar still was performed, both for water and alcoholic distillation. In the case of the water distillation, two days were selected. The temperature measurements allowed the calculation of the heat exchanges. The experimental productivity of the still was determined, as well as its efficiency. As for the alcoholic distillation, two days were also selected. The productivity was determined for the two compartments. The evolution of the alcohol rate of the distillates was also studied.

AB  - Environmental temperature is an important factor that regulates activity and physiological processes of ectotherms. Because sympatric species are exposed to similar thermal niche conditions, closely related species could present similar thermal requirements. This similarity may generate interspecific competition for optimal thermal space. The thermal ecology of the sympatric viviparous lizards Sceloporus lineolateralis and S. poinsettii (Sceloporus torquatus and Sceloporus poinsettii groups, respectively) were studied in natural populations in Penon Blanco, Durango, Mexico. We found that active body temperatures and selected body temperatures were similar among species. However, S. poinsettii exhibited higher efficiency and accuracy of thermoregulation because the preferred thermal range of this species was wider. Finally their thermal preferences are analogous to those previously reported for the both groups and the genus.

AB  - An evolutionary method is proposed for minimising the operational cost in the scheduling of hydrothermal systems with multiple storage. The method combines the advantages of constructive dynamic programming and evolutionary programming. Instead of evolving the primal variables such as water releases and thermal generator outputs, it evolves the piecewise linear convex cost-to-go functions (i.e. the water value curves). The multistage problem of hydrothermal scheduling is thus decomposed into many smaller one-stage subproblems with evolved cost-to-go functions. For each evolutionary individual, linear programming is used in the forward pass process to solve the dispatch subproblems and the total system operational cost over the scheduling period is assigned to its fitness. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and efficient for large complex hydrothermal system with cascaded and pumped storages.

AB  - Tetraploid fish are an important source of diploid gametes for polyploid production, and they can be induced by inhibition of the first mitotic cell division. Dispite its potential, very few protocols regarding tetraploidization and subsequent application to mass production of triploid fish for aquaculture exist. In the yellowtail tetra Astyanax altiparanae, triploids present sterility and increased carcass yield, suggesting the generation of tetraploid for large-scale production of such triploids. In this study, the efficacy of heat shock treatments (40 degrees for 2 min) at 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, and 26 min post-fertilization (mpf) at an incubation temperature of 22 degrees C were compared on tetraploid induction of A. altiparanae. Ploidy status was confirmed by flow cytometry, karyotyping, and nuclear diameter of erythrocytes. Afterwards, sperm parameters and fertility capacity of tetraploid males were evaluated. The results showed that heat shock decreased the hatching rate, especially at 22 (19.1 +/- 9.6%), 24 (16.0 +/- 9.1%), and 26 mpf (10.3 +/- 6.2%) in comparison with the control group (62.2 +/- 7.7%). The flow cytometric analysis showed that the control group and the treatments with heat shock at 16 and 18 mpf presented only diploid individuals. However, from 20 mpf onwards, tetraploid individuals were observed, and the highest percentage arose at 26 mpf (94.55%). When mature, tetraploid males are capable of producing diploid spermatozoa with fertilization capacity, generating a 100% triploid offspring. The results indicate that the heat shock treatment at 26 mpf (40 degrees C for 2 min) is optimum for tetraploid induction in the A. altiparanae. Additionally, tetraploid mature males generated diploid spermatozoa and can be used to mass production of triploid fish. The current data are the first report of tetraploids in family Characidae, presenting an application in basic and applied sciences.

TI  - Development and Application of Efficient Oil Displacement System for Middle-Low Permeability and High Pour-Point Heavy Oil Reservoirs
T2  - COMPLEXITY
LA  - English
AB  - In view of the problems of low permeability, high oil viscosity and freezing point, and low productivity of single well in Luo 321 and Luo 36 blocks of Luojia Oilfield, the chemical viscosity-reducing cold production technology was studied. By analyzing the properties of crude oil, it is concluded that the reason for high viscosity and high freezing point is the high content of asphaltene, pectin, and wax. The viscosity is mainly affected by asphaltene; the wax precipitation point and pour point are mainly affected by the wax; and the solidification point is affected by the wax and asphaltene. The treatment idea of reducing viscosity and inhibiting wax is determined. By compounding the synthetic pour point depressant POA-VA and the viscosity reducer DBD-DOPAMA, the effect of reducing the viscosity and freezing point of crude oil was evaluated. PD-7 (POA-VA 40%, DBD-DOPAMA 50%, and P-10C 10%) system was selected as the optimal formula. When the concentration of the system is 10%, the viscosity reduction rate reaches 95.2%; the freezing point can reduce by 10.2 degrees C; it has good oil sample adaptability, salinity resistance, and temperature resistance; and the oil washing rate can reach more than 60%. The oil displacement system was injected into the formation by means of multiconcentration and multislug and was applied in the field of Luo 321-2 Well. A total of 500t of the oil displacement system was injected, and the effect of measures lasted for 400 days, with a cumulative oil increase of 883t. It has been applied in different blocks 30 times and achieved a good field application effect.

AB  - Coloration of animals is important for camouflage, for social behavior, or for physiological fitness. This study investigates the color variation in adults of Aglais urticae obtained on subjecting some pre-imaginal stages to different temperature conditions and their thermobiological consequences. To investigate the evolutionary-ecological interactions of temperature and pigmentation in butterflies, caterpillars, and pupae of the small tortoiseshell, Aglais urticae (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae), larvae from Central Europe and Scandinavia were reared at temperatures between 7 and 34 degrees C in the laboratory or in the field. After emergence, the intensity of pigmentation of the imagines and their increase in body temperature under defined full-spectrum light irradiation were quantified by image analysis and thermal imaging. At constant conditions, ambient rearing temperature and pigmentation intensity of imagines were negatively and linearly correlated in Central European butterflies, regardless of whether the pupal stage alone or, additionally, the last period of the larval stage was exposed to these conditions: low temperatures induced darker coloration and high temperatures led to lighter individuals. A thermal pulse of a few days alone at the beginning of pupal dormancy led to a similar, albeit weakened, effect. Caterpillars of the Scandinavian subspecies A. urticae polaris, whose pupal dormancy took place under Central European field conditions, developed into strongly pigmented imagines. The thermobiological relevance of more intense pigmentation was shown by significantly higher absorption of light, and thus stronger increased body temperature after 5 min of defined illumination, but this difference ceased after 15 min. Our results show that phenotypic plasticity in wing coloration is adaptive since temperature-induced developmental changes provide thermobiological benefit in adult butterflies. We propose that, in subpolar latitudes, darker coloration likely has a selection advantage favoring individuals with reaction norms gradually shifted to stronger pigmented phenotypes, possibly leading to the establishment of a pigmentation cline.

AB  - Commonly. the secondary cooling provided by air-mist nozzles is regulated by varying the water flow rate while maintaining constant air nozzle pressure. However, these cooling elements are more flexible since, as demonstrated in laboratory experiments, an increase in the air pressure, particularly from a typical value of 200 kPa to 250-400 kPa, causes a considerable increase in the boiling heat flux for a given impact water flux. Based on this finding, previous empirical correlations for the heat flux generated by air-mist nozzles impinging on hot surfaces were extended to include the effect of the air pressure. The correlations were then implemented into a transient 2-D heat conduction model to investigate the influence of new cooling conditions on the surface temperature and metallurgical length of the strand and ultimately on the possibility of increasing the casting speed, i.e., productivity. The model highlighted the potential of the new conditions and this was confirmed by plant results. Additional support to the usefulness of the correlations emerged from the accurate predictions that the model can achieve regarding the temperature evolution of the strand during transient operating conditions, such as during changes in casting speed, slab width, casting temperature and/or steel grade. The fact that the correlations did not need calibration emphasizes the importance of the appropriate characterization of spray and air-mist cooling to develop robust, flexible and accurate virtual casting machines for exploring and controlling the operation of real ones.

AB  - BACKGROUND The whitefly Bemisia tabaci causes severe damage to cultivated tomato plants, but actively avoids the wild tomato Solanum habrochaites. Moreover, the mortality of whitefly increases significantly after feeding with the wild tomato. However, additional experiments are warranted to more carefully elucidate the specific molecular elements underlying the interaction between whitefly and wild tomato. RESULTS Our results showed that S. habrochaites significantly increases the mortality of whitefly adults and decreases both their fertility and fecundity. In addition, the expression of stress-response genes in whitefly after exposure to S. habrochaites was analyzed using RNA sequencing. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify the hub genes to determine their potential associations with the mortality of whitefly. These results suggested that the expression of heat-shock protein (HSP), multicopper oxidase, and 2-Oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) decarboxylase genes were induced in whitefly. To validate the gene associations with whitefly mortality, a high-throughput in vivo model system and RNAi-based gene silencing were used. The results revealed that the RNAi-mediated depletion of the HSP gene, which belongs to the HSP70 subfamily, increased the mortality of whitefly. Furthermore, the selection pressure analysis showed that a total of five amino acid sites of positive selection were identified, three of which were located in the nucleotide-binding domain and the other two in the substrate-binding domain. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on the potential implication of HSPs in whitefly-wild plant interactions. This study could more precisely identify the molecular mechanisms of whitefly in response to wild tomatoes. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Effect of oxygen saturation and thermal regimes on growth and selected physiological indicators of juvenile Salvelinus fontinalis x Salvelinus alpinus hybrids were investigated in separate experiments. Hybrid status of tested fish, with S. fontinalis as the maternal species, was confirmed by sequence analysis. During both experiments fish doubled their initial weight in most tested groups. In experiment 1, fish (n = 516, 70.6 +/- 1.5 g) were exposed to one of four oxygen regimes (normal, hyperoxic, 12 h alternating normal/hyperoxic, and 24 h alternating normal/hyperoxic) in triplicate (12 rearing tanks of four separate RAS) for 63 days. More favourable growth parameters were observed under normoxic conditions (85-95%) in comparison with hyperoxia (120-130%). Oxygen saturation was not associated with final feed conversion ratio, size variation, condition factor, selected somatic indices, or overall mortality rate. Oxygen saturation was significantly positively associated with leukocyte count and negatively associated with mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. Gills showed slight to moderate atypia in groups exposed to hyperoxia compared to the normoxia group. In experiment 2, fish (n. = 560, 21.7 +/- 0.3 g) were held in 7, 10, 13, or 16 degrees C water in four repetitions (16 rearing tanks of four separate RAS) for an 84-day period. Selected growth parameters were significantly higher at 13 degrees C than at 7, 10, and 16 degrees C. Feed conversion ratio was the lowest at 13 and 16 degrees C. Size variation and somatic indices exhibited no differences among treatments, while condition factor was significantly higher at 10 and 13 degrees C. Mortality rate increased from 1.4% to 30.5% with rise in temperature, with highest mortality recorded at 16 degrees C. Hyperoxia showed no advantage on growth of tested hybrids, while 13 degrees C was optimal water temperature for their culture.

AB  - Tetrastichus giffardianus is a gregarious koinobiont endoparasitoid of tephritids, including Ceratitis capitata, which is one of the most important fruit pests worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of constant temperatures on the biology and development of the egg-adult period of T. giffardianus in larvae/pupae of C. capitata to construct a fertility life table. The study was carried out in climatic chambers at constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 +/- 1 degrees C, 70 +/- 10% relative humidity and a photophase of 12 h. Complete egg and larval development occurred only at temperatures of 20, 25, and 30 degrees C. The mean longevity of males and females was inversely proportional to temperature. The time of development of the pre-imaginal period was influenced by temperature and ranged from 41 days at 20 degrees C to 11 days at 25 degrees C. The best T. giffardianus performance occurred at 25 degrees C when the intrinsic rate of increase was 0.21, the mean generation time was 20.43 days, the time required to double the population was 3.33 days, and the finite rate of population increase (lambda) was 1.23. The results of this study provided information for the establishment of mass rearing and an evaluation of the adaptability of T. giffardianus to different environments, which is necessary for the use of this parasitoid in the biological control of tephritid pests, particularly C. capitata.

AB  - 1. Climate change is affecting species distributions and will increasingly do so. However, current understanding of which individuals and species are most likely to survive and why is poor. Knowledge of assemblage or community level effects is limited and the balance of mechanisms that are important over different time-scales is poorly described. Laboratory experiments on marine animals predominantly employ rates of change 10-100 000 times faster than climate induced oceanic warming. To address this failure we investigated differences in individual and species abilities to tolerate warming, and also how rate of warming affected survival.
   2. This study identifies community level effects of thermal biology by applying a multi-species, multi-trophic level approach to the analysis of temperature limits.
   3. Within species analyses of 14 species from 6 phyla showed smaller individuals survived to higher temperatures than large animals when temperatures were raised acutely. If this trend continues at slower warming rates, the early loss of larger individuals has marked consequences at the population level as larger individuals form the major reproductive component.
   4. Between species comparisons showed active species survived to higher temperatures than sessile or low activity groups. Thus active groups (e.g. predators) and juvenile or immature individuals should fare better in rapid warming scenarios. This would be expected to produce short-term ecological imbalances in warming events.
   5. The rate of warming markedly affected temperature limits in a wide range of Antarctic marine species. Different species survived to temperatures of 8.3-17.6 degrees C when temperatures were raised by around 1 degrees C day(-1). However they only survived to temperatures between 4.0 degrees C and 12.3 degrees C when temperatures were raised by around 1-2 degrees C week(-1), and temperatures of only 1.0-6.0 degrees C were tolerated for acclimations over periods of months.
   6. Current models predicting range changes of species in response to climate change are either correlative or mechanistic. Mechanistic models offer the potential to incorporate the ecophysiological adaptation and evolutionary processes which determine future responses and go beyond simple correlative approaches. These models depend on the incorporation of data on species capacities to resist and adapt to change. This study is an important step in the provision of such data from experimental manipulations.

AB  - Lunar surface temperature (LST) is important for both uncovering the thermal environment and evolution and planning lunar robotic and human exploration such as exploring water/ice. Therefore, an LST calculation method is proposed in this letter for the preparation of the LST database, with an improved effective solar irradiance model, including the topographic effect. As an example, the global LST map with the spatial resolution of 1. is shown, based on the topography and albedo data and retrieved parameters from in situ experiments. The topographic signatures can be identified in the map, including the boundaries between mare and highlands and the contours of craters. The good agreements of the global moon between the simulated temperature and the bolometric brightness temperature by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE) demonstrate the validity of our model and the credibility of the simulated global LST map. The better fitness with the DLRE data produced by our physical model than that by the analytic model proves the advantage of our method.

AB  - This paper studies the properties of the sex ratio in two-period models of threshold (e.g., polygenic or temperature-dependent) sex determination under heavy-tailedness in the framework of possibly skewed stable distributions and their convolutions. We show that if the initial distribution of the sex determining trait in Such settings is moderately heavy-tailed and has a finite first moment, then an excess of males (females) in the first period leads to the same pattern in the second period. Thus, the excess of one sex over the other one accumulates over two generations and the sex ratio ill the total alive population ill the second period cannot stabilize at the balanced sex ratio value of 1/2. These properties are reversed for extremely heavy-tailed initial distributions of sex determining traits with infinite first moments. Ill Such settings, the sex ratio of the offspring oscillates around the balanced sex ratio value and an excess of males (females) in the first period leads to an excess of females (males) in the second period. In addition, the sex ratio in the total living population in the second period can stabilize at 1/2 for some extremely heavy-tailed initial distributions of the sex determining trait. The results in the paper are shown to also hold for bounded sex determining phenotypes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate. the positive effects of compost application in agriculture and the benefit of the composting process for solid-waste treatment in the Mekong Delta region in southern Vietnam (comprised of 12 provinces and 1 centrally city). A simple prediction model for waste generation based on population and employing time-series analysis was constructed to assess and forecast waste generation to identify the potential of waste for composting and discharging. The greenhouse gas baseline emission from biodegradable components and the greenhouse gas reduction emission for alternative composting options were also calculated in g(CO2 eq.) per capita per day. Scenarios regarding different composting applications for the Mekong Delta region were defined. The estimations focused on such matters as environmental impacts, greenhouse-gas emission and reduction, resource consumption, economic benefits, and the application potential of the composting process. The principal result was that organic-waste composting was beneficial not only for mitigating the waste burden in landfill sites but also for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions compared to baseline emission and the attendant costs. In addition, the compost product was identified as having strong potential to displace chemical fertilizers in agriculture. It was shown that the composting process was a sound alternative for moving toward sustainable development in waste treatment and agriculture.

AB  - Local climatic adaptation can influence species response to climate change. If populations within a species are adapted to local climate, directional change away from mean climatic conditions may negatively affect fitness of populations throughout the species range.
   Adaptive differentiation to temperature was tested for in American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) by reciprocally transplanting individuals from two populations, originating at different elevations, among temperature treatments in a controlled growth chamber environment. Fitness-related traits were measured in order to test for a population temperature treatment interaction, and key physiological and phenological traits were measured to explain population differences in response to temperature.
   Response to temperature treatments differed between populations, suggesting genetic differentiation of populations. However, the pattern of response of fitness-related variables generally did not suggest ohome temperature' advantage, as would be expected if populations were locally adapted to temperature alone.
   Failure consistently to detect a ohome temperature' advantage response suggests that adaptation to temperature is complex, and environmental and biotic factors that naturally covary with temperature in the field may be critical to understanding the nature of adaptation to temperature.

AB  - Adaptive of trees and its correlation with the climatic are causing changes in tree species performance and distribution, which will change breeding programs and influence forest productivity. To further evaluate the joint influence of climatic factors and provenance on the ring width (RW) and ring density (RD) of Masson pine. We selected 18 provenances at Chun'an (CA) and Taizi Mountain (TZS) test site, which representing four different breeding regions, including the south, west, north and east-central regions. The results showed that the provenance effects were significantly for the RW and RD. The provenances from high temperature and low latitude regions had greater mean RW compared to species from local and cold sources. The geographical genetic variation in wood traits is generally weak. The correlation between RW of Masson pine and precipitation was stronger in the relatively arid TZS site compared with that in relatively wet CA site, as well as the effect of temperature and precipitation on RD was earlier than that in CA test site. The response relationship between establishing the width of tree rings and the environmental variables of provenance indicated that during the transition from the northern and western breeding regions to the eastern and southern breeding regions, the response of RW to climate factors changed from being temperature-based to being precipitation-based. In addition, the response of provenance to the climate of seed sources origin showed their own variation characteristics in each breeding area. Therefore, genetic improvement of big diameter wood and wood density can be gain through selection of provenance and analysis of adaptability.

AB  - Key message Maize Outer cell layer 4 (ocl4) encodes an HD-ZIP IV transcription factor required for robust male fertility and 21-nt phasiRNA biogenesis. ocl4 fertility is favored in warm conditions, and phasiRNAs are partially restored. Environment-sensitive male-sterile plants have been described before and can result from different molecular mechanisms and biological processes, but putative environment-conditioned, transgenerational rescue of their male fertility is a rather new mystery. Here, we report a derivative line of the male-sterile outer cell layer 4 (ocl4) mutant of maize, in which fertility was restored and perpetuated over several generations. Conditioned fertile ocl4 anthers exhibit the anatomical abnormality of a partially duplicated endothecial layer, just like their sterile counterparts. We profiled the dynamics of phased, small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) during pre-meiotic development in fully sterile and various grades of semi-fertile ocl4 anthers. The conditioned fertile anthers accumulated significantly higher 21-nt phasiRNAs compared to ocl4 sterile samples, suggesting a partial restoration of phasiRNAs in conditioned fertility. We found that the biogenesis of 21-nt phasiRNAs is largely dependent on Ocl4 at three key steps: (1) production of PHAS precursor transcripts, (2) expression of miR2118 that modulates precursor processing, and (3) accumulation of 21-nt phasiRNAs.

AB  - Earth mites are pests of crops and pastures in southeastern Australia. Recent studies show differences between earth mite species in their mode of reproduction, preferred hosts and pesticide tolerance. This paper examines the distribution and pest status of each species. The southeastern Australian distribution for each species is mapped, incorporating new data from eastern New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. A new population of an undescribed species previously identified from northwestern Victoria was found in northern New South Wales. CLIMEX was used to identify climatic factors limiting the distribution of P. major and P. falcatus, the most broadly distributed species. This analysis suggests tolerance to heat and desiccation limits the inland distribution of these two species. A three-year survey of agricultural outbreaks indicates that all Penthaleus species are major agricultural pests although their pest status on crop types appears to differ. All species contributed to chemical control failures. However P. falcatus, previously identified in laboratory tests as having increased tolerance to pesticides, was the most common species associated with control failures. A laboratory experiment indicated that mites are sometimes pests on crops on which they cannot persist for a generation. Results are discussed with respect to management of these agricultural pests.

AB  - This is a conceptual study, for MW to GW scale, comparing production, transmission, and storage costs for gaseous hydrogen (GH2) and anhydrous ammonia (NH3) fuels made from wind-generated electricity, with and without the low-cost, annual-scale, firming storage which would add great market and strategic value. Both fuels are suitable for vehicles and for distributed generation (DG) in stationary combined-heatand-power (CHP),via fuel cells or internal combustion engines (ICE's). NH3 is also a valuable fertilizer, and this study briefly examines the economics of renewable-source versus fossil-source production of NH3 fertilizer. No pilot plant exists for confirming the system capital costs and conversion efficiencies we estimate in this study, although both GH2 and NH3 have been proposed for wind energy transmission and storage [1-6]. Hydrogen is promising as a clean-burning energy carrier, and modern electrolyzers can produce large volumes of high-pressure hydrogen, ready for direct pipeline transmission and/or for ammonia synthesis, from renewable energy sources. Renewable-source hydrogen can alternatively be stored and transported as NH3, which can be readily synthesized, following electrolysis, using atmospheric nitrogen, and be used at the delivery end-point as a fertilizer or a fuel. Both GH2 and NH3 transmission and firming storage will accelerate our conversion from fossil to diverse renewable resources, via major new markets including, and beyond, the electricity sector.

CP  - ASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition
AB  - Industrial steam turbines are applied for power generation as well as drive for turbo-compressors. They combine a high level of operational flexibility with highest reliability. Especially in the field of process technology they provide process heat on a certain enthalpy level for other industrial applications. Modular design concepts are used to meet these various requirements like admission or extraction of large steam quantities. Extraction modules use valves to control the amount of steam extracted from the turbine expansion path at constant steam parameters.
   While extraction steam is taken from the turbine through an outlet flange, the remaining steam passes valves and downstream diffusers, flows into an annular inner casing and finally escapes through the subsequent stages. Depending on the valve lift, different flow separations can occur around the valves, resulting in unsteady transonic jets. Due to the compact and asymmetric design of the inner casing the flow into the subsequent stages is strongly disturbed. Hence, strong unsteady mechanical blade loading can occur in addition to efficiency loss.
   The current work focusses on the improvement of the flow conditions in the subsequent stage. Experimental results are applied to quantify the viability of the used 3D RANS CFD-solver (ANSYS CFX 14) for these numerical investigations. Compared with the experiment, the distribution of pressure, velocity and incidence angle are well predicted by the numerical code. It is evident that the unsteady transonic jets emerging around the valves have a major influence on the distribution of the parameters considered. Thus, to quantify the impact of a modified inlet chamber design, it is sufficient to simulate the domain starting from the valves.
   The influence of different design modifications on the flow parameters in comparison with the base design is discussed in detail in an extensive study. The results clarify that horizontal and vertical valve positions, as well as thorough contouring of the radial-axial deflection have a strong influence on the distribution of pressure, mass flux and incidence angle. Hence, in this contribution combinations of the most beneficial modifications are investigated numerically and compared with the base design.

AB  - Age attitudes and age stereotypes in the workplace can lead to discrimination and impaired productivity. Previous studies have predominantly assessed age stereotypes with explicit measures. However, sole explicit measurement is insufficient because of social desirability and potential inaccessibility of stereotypical age evaluations to introspection. We aimed to advance the implicit and explicit assessment of work-related evaluations of age groups and age stereotypes and report data collected in three samples: students (n= 50), older adults (n= 53), and workers (n= 93). Evaluative age attitudes were measured implicitly with an Implicit Association Test. Regardless of group, age, and condition (neutral or semantically biased stimuli), the results confirm a stable, moderate implicitly measurable preference for younger over older workers. Whereas explicit measures of general age preferences showed no clear age preference, differentiated explicit measures of work-related age stereotypes also revealed stable preferences in all three samples: Younger workers were rated higher on performance and adaptability and older workers were rated higher on competence, reliability, and warmth. The explicit-implicit correlations were relatively low. Although explicit work-related age stereotypes are differentiated, the stable implicitly measured age bias raises concern. We suggest to apply implicit and explicit measures in the field of ageism in the workplace.

AB  - The effects of climate change are becoming apparent in the biosphere. In the 20th century, South Korea experienced a 1.5 degrees C temperature increase due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. If the changes continue, it is predicted that approximately 15-37% of animal and plant species will be endangered after 2050. Because butterflies act as a good indicator for changes in the temperature, the distribution of butterflies can be used to determine their adaptability to climate patterns. Local meteorological data for the period 1938-2011 were used from the National Forest Research Institute of Korea. Local temperature data were additionally considered among the basic information, and the distribution patterns of butterflies were analyzed for both the southern and northern regions. Southern butterflies (with northern limit) tend to increase in number with significant correlation between the temperature and number of habitats (p < 0.000), while northern butterflies (with southern limit) show no statistical significance between the temperature and number of habitats, indicating their sensitivity to temperature change. This finding is in accordance with the conclusion that southern butterflies are more susceptible to climate change when adapting to local environments and expanding their original temperature range for survival, which leads to an increase in the numbers of their habitats.

AB  - Effect of radiofrequency (RF)-assisted thermal processing on quality and functional properties of high-foaming standard egg white powder (std. EWP, pH approximately 7.0) was investigated and compared with traditional processing (heat treatment in a hot room at 58 degrees C for at least 14 d). The RF-assisted thermal treatments were selected to meet the pasteurization requirements and to improve the functional properties of the std. EWP. The treatment conditions were: RF heating to 60, 70, 80, and 90 degrees C followed by holding in a hot air oven at those temperatures for different periods ranging from 4 h at 90 degrees C to 72 h at 60 degrees C. The quality (color and solubility) and functional properties (foaming properties: foaming capacity and foam stability; and gelling properties: water holding capacity and gel-firmness) of the std. EWP were investigated. RF-assisted thermal processing did not affect the color and solubility of std. EWP at any of the treatment conditions. In general, the foaming and gelling properties of RF-assisted thermally processed std. EWP increased with an increase in temperature and treatment duration. The optimal RF-assisted treatment conditions to produce std. EWP with similar functional properties as the traditionally processed (hot room processed) std. EWP were 90 degrees C for >= 8 h. These optimal conditions were similar to those for high gel egg white powder (HG-EWP, pH approximately 9.5). The RF-assisted thermal pasteurization improved the gelling properties of std. EWP to the levels of HG-EWP, leading to newer applications of this functionally improved safe product. The RF-assisted thermal processing allows the processor to produce a HG-EWP from std. EWP subsequent to processing while simultaneously pasteurizing the product, thus assuring the product safety.

AB  - Secondary batteries based on lithium (Li) metal anodes are a potential candidate for next-generation energy storage devices, but their practical commercialization has so far been greatly limited by safety issues and cycle-life limitations associated with the formation of Li dendrites. This study therefore looks at the morphology of Li that is electrodeposited in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) with a view to determining the most suitable electrolyte properties. Particular focus is given to how the distribution of nucleation points changes in relation to the charge transfer resistance of the RTIL, which is varied by changing the viscosity of the electrolyte. Through this, it is found that a more viscous electrolyte with a higher charge transfer resistance produces Li deposits that are more evenly distributed and smaller in size. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Background: Excessive summer heat is a serious environmental health problem in Skopje, the capital and largest city of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This paper attempts to forecast the impact of heat on mortality in Skopje in two future periods under climate change and compare it with a historical baseline period.
   Methods: After ascertaining the relationship between daily mean ambient air temperature and daily mortality in Skopje, we modelled the evolution of ambient temperatures in the city under a Representative Concentration Pathway scenario (RCP8.5) and the evolution of the city population in two future time periods: 2026-2045 and 2081-2100, and in a past time period (1986-2005) to serve as baseline for comparison. We then calculated the projected average annual mortality attributable to heat in the absence of adaptation or acclimatization during those time windows, and evaluated the contribution of each source of uncertainty on the final impact.
   Results: Our estimates suggest that, compared to the baseline period (1986-2005), heat-related mortality in Skopje would more than double in 2026-2045, and more than quadruple in 2081-2100. When considering the impact in 2081-2100, sampling variability around the heat-mortality relationship and climate model explained 40.3 and 46.6% of total variability.
   Conclusion: These results highlight the importance of a long-term perspective in the public health prevention of heat exposure, particularly in the context of a changing climate.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to highlight the positive characteristics of the corelation between productivity and adaptability of some of the apricot donors and F1 and F2 hybrids descendants and finally to contribute to the selection progress.
   The research protocol is aimed at establishing the apricot ideotype, the links between the parental and hybrid descendants characteristics and the differences between every donor, descendant and the apricot ideotype and at determining by electrophoreses the izosymes bands.
   Biological material concerned 6 apricot donors, 55 Fl descendants.
   For this analysis the characteristics of the apricot ideotype were expressed by a score of 125 points/grades: 5 for tree height, 5 winter frost resistance, 5 resistance to the low spring temperature, 20 for resistance to Monilinia laxa Lev. (Aderh), Cytospora cincta Sacc., Stigmina carpophila (Lev.) M. B. Ellis and Plum pox virus, and 90 for the fruit traits quality. From among the donors, Dacia had the 119 points, closest to the ideotype, but none of Dacia descendants scored the same. Even positive transgressions detected in F1 descendants of some donors were not cumulated in the some phenotype.
   On the first stage the MDH- Malatedehydrogenase isozyme patterns revealed different zones of activity in the eight: apricot donors: Favorit, Manitoba, NJA 48, Stella, Dacia, Early Orange, Sony, Kinred.

AB  - The possibility of Miscanthusxgiganteus cultivation as an energy crop on the different types of mining rocks was studied. It was revealed that a loess-like loam and red-brown clay with the added black soil were the most suitable for plant growing. The yield of dry above-ground biomass ranged from 4.3 to 6.8tDMha(-1) after the first year of cultivation and from 8.9 to 9.7tDMha(-1) after the second year while using these substrates. The application of amendments stimulated the growth and development of plants and increased productivity from 50 to 140%. M.xgiganteus showed sufficient tolerance and good enough growth on the geochemically active dark-gray schist clay with yield from 2 to 3tDMha(-1) after the first year of cultivation already. For plants grown on the different strata of dark-gray schist clay, the thermal decomposition of the biomass took place in four stages in the temperature range from 30 to 640 degrees C. The samples grown on stratum 0-20cm showed the highest reactivity with a peak 30.6%/min at 290 degrees C. There were differences in the concentrations of determined heavy metals: iron, zinc, copper, and lead in the plant tissues depending on the layer depth of dark-gray schist clay from 0 to 20cm to 40-60cm. The relatively limited content of heavy metals in the above-ground biomass was due to the preferential accumulation in the roots.

AB  - Fuel cells are considered as clean and efficient devices for the generation of electric power. The commercial viability of proton exchange membrane fuel cell largely depends on membrane properties. Thus, this paper emphasizes on the preparation of crosslinked sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) membranes and their evaluation for fuel cell application. Initially, the copolymer was synthesized using phenolphthalein monomer, potassium 2,5-dihydroxybenzenesulfonate and 4,4'-diflorobenzophenone. To improve the fuel cell performance, the copolymer was crosslinked with different mass% of polystyrene sulfonic acid-co-maleic acid sodium salt (PSSA-MA) and sulphothalic acid (SPTA). The physico-chemical properties of the resulting membranes were studied using various techniques. The microstructure of the membranes was examined by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The oxidative stability was performed in Fenton's solution at 80 degrees C and indicated that more than 92% of the membrane residue remained with a minimum loss of ion exchange capacity (IEC). The proton conductivity was investigated in fully hydrated state, which revealed that the proton conductivity of both the series of crosslinked membranes was increased with increasing the content of PSSA-MA and SPTA up to 20 mass%. Among the series, 20 mass% of PSSA-MA and SPTA incorporated crosslinked membranes exhibited the highest IEC values of 2.569 and 2.342 meq g(-1), respectively. Similarly, the proton conductivity of PSSA-MA and SPTA crosslinked membrane was found to be 0.134 and 0.117 S cm(-1) M 80 degrees C with 100% relative humidity. The performance of fuel cell study revealed that 20 mass% of PSSA-MA and SPTA crosslinked membranes demonstrated an excellent power density of 0.45 W cm(-2) at 0.82 A cm(-2) and 0.42 W cm(-2) at 0.71 A cm(-2), respectively. Thus, these two crosslinked membranes developed here could be used as promising candidates for fuel cell applications.

AB  - Heatwaves are divided between moderate, more common heatwaves and rare "high-mortality" heatwaves that have extremely large health effects per day, which we define as heatwaves with a 20 % or higher increase in mortality risk. Better projections of the expected frequency of and exposure to these separate types of heatwaves could help communities optimize heat mitigation and response plans and gauge the potential benefits of limiting climate change. Whether a heatwave is high-mortality or moderate could depend on multiple heatwave characteristics, including intensity, length, and timing. We created heatwave classification models using a heatwave training dataset created using recent (1987-2005) health and weather data from 82 large US urban communities. We built twenty potential classification models and used Monte Carlo cross-validations to evaluate these models. We ultimately identified several models that can adequately classify high-mortality heatwaves. These models can be used to project future trends in high-mortality heatwaves under different scenarios of a changing future (e.g., climate change, population change). Further, these models are novel in the way they allow exploration of different scenarios of adaptation to heat, as they include, as predictive variables, heatwave characteristics that are measured relative to a community's temperature distribution, allowing different adaptation scenarios to be explored by selecting alternative community temperature distributions. The three selected models have been placed on GitHub for use by other researchers, and we use them in a companion paper to project trends in high-mortality heatwaves under different climate, population, and adaptation scenarios.

AB  - The mean selected temperature (MST), determined from 27, 7 mo old snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in an aquatic thermal gradient, was 29.8 +/- 0.4 C.  We investigated the effects of nutritional status and the location of initial placement in the thermal gradient on the selection of MST.  The effects of nutritional status were determined by assigning hatchlings to three different feeding treatments (satiated, 5 d, and 10 d without food), whereas the effect of initial position in the thermal gradient was investigated by placing the turtles at either end or in the middle of the gradient.  Analysis of variance combined with the method of orthogonal polynomials showed a significant interaction between nutritional status and initial position.  Subsequent simple effects analysis indicated that satiated hatchlings places in the coldest compartment of the gradient were the only group to demonstrate significant differences:  they occupied a cooler MST (26.5 +/- 0.9 C) than did any other groups.  We conclude, therefore, that hatchling snapping turtles do not exhibit a thermophilic response associated with feeding, and that nutritional status affects MST only because satiated animals tend to be more sedentary.

AB  - Tumor relapse and cancerometastasis frequently occur post tumor treatments, leading to poor prognosis with high mortality. Unfortunately, therapy-exacerbated inflammation is among the chief causes of poor prognosis, especially for photothermal therapy (PTT). To overcome this mismatch between therapy and prognosis, we design a built-in Pt/polydopamine(PDA) nanoconstruction (PNP) that makes the anti-inflammation potency and therapy outcome positively inter-linked by virtue of their temperature dependency. PDA not only works as the PTT agent but also provides a self-reductive nano-substrate (-150 nm) for the in-situ generation of ultrasmall Pt nanodots (-4 nm). The embedding of Pt nanodots affects insignificantly the PTT potency of PDA while importing the enzyme-like ROS-scavenging function to defend inflammation in a therapy-enhanced manner. Specifically, PNP exhibits the increasing anti-inflammation effect with the elevated temperature caused by PTT, which enables the anti-inflammation pathway to match perfectly PTT modality. In vivo results indicate that PNP leads to better antitumor performance and effective inhibition of tumor relapse and cancerometastasis. This study provides new ideas for systematical tumor treatments with improved prognosis by coordinating anti-inflammation and antitumor actions harmoniously.

AB  - Temperature coupling exists when changes in male signal production with temperature are paralleled by changes in female response. Such thermal effects have been observed in various ectothermic animals producing acoustic, visual, and electric signals in which the signal rate may be subject to stabilizing selection imposed by female preference. Often, coupling was considered as an adaptive function wherein male and female thermal effects coevolved under selection pressure favoring species recognition, although this assumption has not been tested definitively. We investigated thermal effects on pulse-pair rate in male song and female acceptance threshold for male song rate in an acoustic moth, Achroia grisella, in which male song rate is subject to directional selection. Male song rate and female acceptance threshold do exhibit parallel increases as temperature rises from 18 degrees C to 30 degrees C, but female thresholds are much lower than male song rates and the thermal effect on female response cannot augment species recognition. In further investigations using inbred lines of A. grisella we found that the male and female thermal effects are genetically correlated, and we discuss the likely sources of this covariance. We consider several explanations for the occurrence of temperature coupling in this species and suggest that it represents an emergent property arising from the neuromuscular responses to temperature that are common to several physiological systems.

AB  - In the period 1996-1999 field trial was performed in Obory near Kwidzyn on heavy textured Fluvisols. The experiment was aimed to determine yield, chemical composition, heat value of wood of six genotypes of willow coppice in relation to cutting frequency and on determining the costs and profitability of willow production on arable land for purposes of energy generation. Yield of wood dry matter in one-year cutting cycle amounted to 14.09 t.ha(-1).year(-1) and significantly increased to 16.05 and 21.55 t.ha(-1).year(-1) when harvesting was performed in two and three years cycle, respectively. The highest yield was found for Salix viminalis 082 form cut in three years cycle and it amounted to 26.44 t.ha(-1).year(-1). Stems of Salix sp. cut every three years showed the lowest water content (46.05%), high heat value 19.56 MJ.kg(-1) dry matter and the highest content of cellulose (55.94%), lignins (13.79%) and hemicelluloses (13.96%). High yielding potential of Salix sp. and high content of cellulose and lignin in wood make this crop very prosperous as a feedstock for bioenergy production. The highest profit from the willow plantation was obtained in case of harvest every three years at 578.76 EUR.ha(-1).year(-1).

AB  - Epibacterium mobile BBCC367 is a marine bacterium that is common in coastal areas. It belongs to the Roseobacter Glade, a widespread group in pelagic marine ecosystems. Species of the Roseobacter Glade are regularly used as models to understand the evolution and physiological adaptability of generalist bacteria. E. mobile BBCC367 comprises two chromosomes and two plasmids. We used gel-free shotgun proteomics to assess its protein expression under 16 different conditions, including stress factors such as elevated temperature, nutrient limitation, high metal concentration, and UVB exposure. Comparison of the different conditions allowed us not only to retrieve almost 70% of the predicted proteins, but also to define three main protein assemblages: 584 essential core proteins, 2,144 facultative accessory proteins and 355 specific unique proteins. While the core proteome mainly exhibited proteins involved in essential functions to sustain life such as DNA, amino acids, carbohydrates, cofactors, vitamins and lipids metabolisms, the accessory and unique proteomes revealed a more specific adaptation with the expression of stress-related proteins, such as DNA repair proteins (accessory proteome), transcription regulators and a significant predominance of transporters (unique proteome). Our study provides insights into how E. mobile BBCC367 adapts to environmental changes and copes with diverse stresses.

AB  - Temperate-zone ectotherms experience varying or very low ambient temperatures and may have difficulty in attaining preferred body temperatures. Thus, adaptations to reduce the thermal dependence of physiological processes may be present. We measured the optimal temperature range for sprint speed and compared it with the selected body temperatures (T (sel)) of two sympatric, cool-temperate lizards: the diurnal skink Oligosoma maccanni and the primarily nocturnal gecko Woodworthia (previously Hoplodactylus) "Otago/Southland". We also investigated whether time-of-day influenced sprint speed. Contrary to results for other reptiles, we found that time-of-day did not influence speed in either species. For each species, the optimal temperature range for sprinting and T (sel) overlapped, supporting the 'thermal coadaptation' hypothesis. However, the optimal range of temperatures for speed is not always attainable during activity by either species, which have limited opportunities to attain T (sel) in the field. The thermal sensitivity of sprint speed in these two species does not appear to have evolved to fully match their current thermal environment. More data on cold-adapted species are needed to fully understand physiological adaptation in ectotherms.

AB  - In recent decades, rising trend in the number of heat waves (HWs) has exacerbated the risk of heat-related mortality and morbidity. The frequent deadly HWs precipitated a multitude of national and sub-national heathealth prevention and research efforts. In 2008, the WHO Regional Office for Europe developed and published guidance on heat-health action plans (HHAPs). This provided a blueprint for countries to design heat-related prevention efforts. Since then, a large corpus of new evidences and implementation experiences has emerged around adaptive measures, alert systems and urban planning interventions. The present study conducts a systematic review to critically assess the advent and development of HHAPs with a special focus on its integration with urban planning policies. It reviews the concept of threshold, indicators for heat event determination and measurement of HWs to understand trigger setting mechanisms. The results show that implementation of core elements of HHAPs varies significantly in the areas of long-term urban planning, real-time surveillance, monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, low levels of inclusion of HHAPs with national policies hinder the overall potential of adaptation measures. The growing impacts of HWs emphasize the urgent need to address spatial heat vulnerability and build urban heat resilience into implementable action plans.

AB  - Aims: In previous studies the microbial kinetics of Escherichia coli K12 have been evaluated under static and dynamic conditions (Valdramidis et al. 2005, 2006). An acquired microbial thermotolerance following heating rates lower than 0.82 degrees C min(-1) for the studied micro-organism was observed. Quantification of this induced physiological phenomenon and incorporation, as a model building block, in a general microbial inactivation model is the main outcome of this work.
   Methods and Results: The microbial inactivation rate observed (k(obs)) under time-varying temperature conditions is studied and expressed as a function of the heating rate (dT/ dt). Hereto, a model building block related to the microbial physiology (k(phys)) under stress conditions is developed. Evaluation of the performance of the developed mathematical approach depicts that physiological adaptation is an essential issue to be considered when modelling microbial inactivation.
   Conclusions: Consideration, at a mathematical level, of microbial responses resulting in physiological adaptations contribute to the reliable quantification of the safety risks during food processing.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyBy taking into account the physiological adaptation, the microbiological evolution during heat processing can be accurately assessed, and overly conservative or fail dangerous food processing designs can be avoided.

AB  - Self-sustaining green roofs can considerably reduce the building cooling demand in summer. In recent decades, extreme weather events including heatwaves and drought have increased, while there is a lack of knowledge of the dynamic thermal performance of green roofs during a severe drought. The present study is based on in-situ measurements of a room with a self-sustaining green roof and a reference room with a bare roof. The temporal evolution of the thermal performance of the green roof during a severe drought is investigated. Long-term observations for several years showed that Sedum lineare on the green roof survived in summers, except for a period during the severe drought. Although extreme drought weather led to extensive mortality, plants revived in the next year. The status of the green roof during the drought period could be divided into three phases: (I) normal, (II) substrates dried, and (III) plants withered and substrate dried. The respective contributions of live plants and substrates are quantified based on the results from these phases. In phase I, the average heat transfer into the indoor space through the green roof was 81% less than that of the reference bare roof. In phase II, the plants and the substrate dried out gradually, and the average heat transfer through the green roof was 69% less. In phase III, the dry substrate without live plants acts as a normal thermal insulation layer, and the average heat transfer through the green roof was still 40% less than that of the reference bare roof. In those three phases, the equivalent overall heat transfer coefficient of the green roof was 0.26, 0.49, and 0.88 W/(m2K), respectively. It suggests that the use of drought-tolerant plant species and substrate with a low thermal conductivity could improve the thermal performance of green roofs during a severe drought.

AB  - The multi-laser powder bed fusion (MLPBF) has attracted more and more attention due to high productivity and large area. However, thus far the distribution and evolution of the thermal stress with different laser beams are rarely investigated. A block-by-block numerical model considering the laser scanning strategy and part-scale was developed to study the residual stress in MLPBF. As the laser beam number increased from 1 to 4, the residual stress at the top surface of the part decreased but the internal residual stress at the bottom center of the part significantly increased. The average and maximum stresses increased with the laser beam number, indicating that the cracks were more likely to occur with an increase of the laser beam number. The residual stress in the multi-laser overlap area was reduced, resulting in an important influence on the residual stress distribution. More frequent tension-compression stress transitions occurred during MLPBF, and the compressive stress along the deposition direction had a more important influence when the laser beam number increased. The simulated results agreed well with the experimental data. The results of the study provide a significant understanding of the residual stress and are helpful to the process optimization in MLPBF.

AB  - We have calculated evaporation rates for a range of organic compounds that may be cold-trapped at the poles of the Moon and Mercury. Organics vary widely in their volatilities and thus can be stable to evaporation at higher and lower temperatures than water. The detection of cold-trapped organics would point to volatile delivery by impacts, as comets and asteroids are the only plausible sources for organic molecules. The characterization of cold-trapped organics on both bodies may provide constraints on the thermal evolution of cold traps over time and the history of volatiles in the inner solar system.

AB  - Low-moisture foods (LMF with water activity, a(w) < 0.85) including pet foods and black pepper powder have consistently been associated with foodborne disease caused by Salmonella enterica. Increased heat resistance and prolonged survival at low-moisture conditions, however, remain major challenges to achieve effective inactivation of Salmonella in low-moisture foods. M low water activity (a(w)) conditions, heat resistance of Salmonella is greatly enhanced when compared to high a(w) conditions. This study aimed to quantify the effect of a(w) on the heat resistance of Salmonella enterica in pet food pellets and black pepper powder. Pa food pellets were inoculated with two strains of heat resistant S. enterica and black pepper powder was inoculated with a 5-strain cocktail of Salmonella. Both inoculated food samples were equilibrated at 0.33, 0.54, and 0.75 a(w) in controlled humidity chambers. Inoculated pet food pellets and black pepper powder in closed aluminum cells were heat treated at specific temperatures for selected times. The results showed that the Weibull model fitted well the inactivation data. At a specific temperature, the rate of inactivation increased with the increase in the a(w) from 0.33 to 0.75, and the 3-log reduction times decreased for Salmonella in both food samples with the increase in a(w). Water adsorption isotherms of pet food pellets and black pepper powder at initial and treatment temperatures were developed to understand the change in a(w) during heat treatments. The change in a(w) during heat treatment was dependent on the type of food matrix, which possibly influenced the thermal inactivation of Salmonella in pet food pellets and black pepper powder.

AB  - Microfiltration is widely used to ensure the a thermal stabilization, clarification and concentration of various fruit-based suspensions (e.g. fruit juices, food by-products, wine). However, the performances of membrane filtration remain highly challenged by membrane fouling. To prevent membrane fouling, cross-flow filtration is generally performed. Nevertheless, this intensive working mode is considered as highly energy consuming due to the intensive pumping required to circulate the suspension at high velocities. In the light of this, immersed membranes configurations have been developed in many fields, as they allow working in energy-friendly operating conditions. Thus, this work investigated for the first time the performances of an immersed membranes configuration for fruit-based suspensions microfiltration, in terms of productivity (membrane fouling, permeate flux) and selectivity (clarification, concentration of bioactive compounds). This study focused on three fruit-based suspensions: a grapefruit juice and two winery by-products. Concerning the process selectivity, pilot-scale experiments showed that immersed membranes filtration allowed producing retentate and permeate of quality as least as good as the one related to conventional cross-flow filtration. Concerning the process productivity, cross-flow filtration allowed reaching higher fluxes compared to immersed membranes filtration, in accordance with the conventional order of magnitude specific to each configuration. Immersed membranes configuration could find interesting applications within small production units of fruit juices and/or industries dealing with the valorization of low added-value byproducts thanks to its various advantages (high compactness, easy handling and mobility, low investment and operational costs).

AB  - Cardinal evolutionary problems await resolution and critical testing. "Evolution Canyon" in Mount Carmel, Israel, is an excellent microcosmic model system of sharp physical (microclimatic) and biotic interslope contrasts, enabling critical tests in nature relevant to macrocosm evolution. We genotypically and phenotypically tested two phylogenetically and biologically very distant organisms there, the sessile, predominantly inbreeding plant wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum, and the vagile and outbreeding drosophilid fruit fly, Zaprionus tuberculatus, a very recent colonizer of Israel. The genomes of these extremely different organisms were tested by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) for genetic diversity at 357 and 345 genetic markers (presumed gene loci), respectively. We found in both organisms parallel genetic patterns reflecting the canyon's opposite slopes, with significantly higher genetic polymorphism in subpopulations oil the ecologically more stressful "African" (warmer and drier) south-facing slope. Likewise, both organisms displayed higher viability in parallel in response to severe drought stress on the more arid and climatically fluctuating "African" SFS. Our results Suggest: (i) microclimatic selection is the major evolutionary interslope's fast-acting diverging force upon genotypes and phenotypes, overriding migration and drift, and (ii) ecological stress can generate global-scale adaptive evolutionary genome arid phenome strategies, at both micro and macroscales, reinforcing homeostasis arid fitness and suggesting continuity between micro and macroevolution.

AB  - In this work, oil palm fibers (OFF) and clay particles were modified and then incorporated to reinforce high density polyethylene (HDPE). The hybrid composites were prepared and compounded with a compatibilizer by twin-screw extrusion followed by injection molding. The evolution of thermal, mechanical, and dynamic mechanical performances of the hybrid composites as a function of filler content was investigated. The morphological study showed that the alkali treatment of OFF fibers enhanced their surface interaction with the polymer, while the addition of a coupling agent increased the interfacial adhesion between both fillers and the polymer matrix leading to improved filler dispersion/distribution (homogeneity). The tensile properties results showed that the 12.5:12.5 hybrids composite had the best tensile properties with a gain of 49% in Young's modulus and 11% in tensile strength. For the dynamic mechanical characterization, an increase in the complex modulus was observed with filler addition. Finally, the thermal stability of the hybrid composites increased with clay addition which is more thermally stable than OFF. The results obtained confirmed the viability of the combination between fibers and particles, thus opening new perspectives for the use of these natural by-products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Regulation of body temperature in lizards plays a key role in the survival of species. Their physiological condition, in reference to their dependence on the ambient temperature makes them an excellent study model. Also, changes in the reproductive cycle cause changes in thermophysiological parameters. This study is the first to address the relationship of thermoregulation with reproductive activity and sex, for a species of Liolaemus from the Chaco ecoregion. The aim of this work was to determine how the reproductive, recruitment and post-reproductive periods influences, as well as the effect of sex and snout-vent length on the thermoregulation of Liolaemus chacoensis. Individuals were captured by hand in the Southern sector of Valle Fertil, San Juan province, Argentina. A total of 44 individuals were captured during the months of November 2014, February 2015 and March 2015. Body (T-b), substrate (T-s) and air (T-a) temperatures were recorded. Also, biophysical models were used to record operative temperatures. Later selected temperatures (T-sel) were evaluated at the laboratory. Finally, theimoregulatory efficiency index was calculated. Results indicated that L. chacoensis T-b was positively related to T-a, presenting a heliothermic behavior that was maintained during periods and sex. Also, T(b )was higher in reproductive and recruitment periods than in post-reproductive period. In particular, only sex had an effect on T-sel, however for the interquartile range of T-sel, both the period of reproductive cycle and sex had an effect. The thernioregulatory efficiency index indicated that L. chacoensis is an absolute thermoconforntist. However, in the reproductive period both males and females change towards active thermoregulation. These results show that thermophysiological parameters vary in different periods of reproductive cycle and the active microsite selection would be a mechanism in maintenance of body temperature of this species.

AB  - Nest building is a taxonomically widespread and diverse trait that allows animals to alter local environments to create optimal conditions for offspring development. However, there is growing evidence that climate change is adversely affecting nest-building in animals directly, for example via sea-level rises that flood nests, reduced availability of building materials, and suboptimal sex allocation in species exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination. Climate change is also affecting nesting species indirectly, via range shifts into suboptimal nesting areas, reduced quality of nest-building environments, and changes in interactions with nest predators and parasites. The ability of animals to adapt to sustained and rapid environmental change is crucial for the long-term persistence of many species. Many animals are known to be capable of adjusting nesting behaviour adaptively across environmental gradients and in line with seasonal changes, and this existing plasticity potentially facilitates adaptation to anthropogenic climate change. However, whilst alterations in nesting phenology, site selection and design may facilitate short-term adaptations, the ability of nest-building animals to adapt over longer timescales is likely to be influenced by the heritable basis of such behaviour. We urgently need to understand how the behaviour and ecology of nest-building in animals is affected by climate change, and particularly how altered patterns of nesting behaviour affect individual fitness and population persistence. We begin our review by summarising how predictable variation in environmental conditions influences nest-building animals, before highlighting the ecological threats facing nest-building animals experiencing anthropogenic climate change and examining the potential for changes in nest location and/or design to provide adaptive short- and long-term responses to changing environmental conditions. We end by identifying areas that we believe warrant the most urgent attention for further research.

AB  - The parasitic salmon louse constrains growth in the Norwegian salmon farming industry through density dependent host-parasite interaction. Hence, there is a need for insight into how increases in salmon production, varying spatial organisation of the production and pest control strategies affect salmon louse population dynamics. Here we present a new salmon louse model for exploring effects of varying salmon farming conditions on spatio-temporal abundances of the parasite. The salmon louse model is partly stage-structured, comprising of (i) adult female lice and (ii) other mobile stages of lice. The abundance of adult females depend on survival of females from previous weeks and recruitment from the other mobile group of lice. The other mobiles also depend on survival of other mobiles from previous weeks, as well as recruitment from the previous generation of reproducing adult females from the same farm or from farms in the neighbourhood. In addition, expected abundances of the two stage-groups are modelled as functions of biological and physical covariates. The model is fitted to weekly salmon farm data covering all marine farms producing salmonids along the Norwegian cost over the years 2012-2016. Among novel results from fitting the model are estimates of the time-lag structure representing recruitment of other mobile lice from the previous generation adult females for different temperatures. Furthermore, the model estimates how various factors affect the susceptibility of fish on farms to louse infection and effects of treatments to control infection. Finally, the model estimates density dependent effects of increasing the number of fish in farms and of increasing the numbers of farms, on the rate of recruitment of other mobile lice. Analytically, the parameters representing density dependencies suggest that few farms with many fish and large between farm distances is effective in terms of minimising the overall output of salmon lice infection.

AB  - Organic matter is the material basis for shales to generate hydrocarbon, as well as the main reservoir space and seepage channel for shale gas. When the thermal evolution degree is consistent, the organic carbon content in present shales is subject to the abundance of primitive sedimentary organic matter. Deep geofluids significantly influence the sedimentary organic matter's enrichment, but the mechanism remains unclear. This paper is aimed at determining how hydrothermal and volcanic activities affected the enrichment of sedimentary organic matter by studying lower Cambrian shales in the lower Yangtze region and upper Ordovician-lower Silurian shales. Oxidation-reduction and biological productivity are used as indicators in the study. The result shows that hydrothermal or volcanic activities affected the enrichment of sedimentary organic matter by influencing climate changes and the nutrients' sources on the waterbody's surface and reducing water at the bottom. In the lower Cambrian shales of the Wangyinpu Formation in the lower Yangtze region, hydrothermal origin caused excess silicon. During the sedimentary period of the lower and middle-upper Wangyinpu Formation, vigorous hydrothermal activities increased the biological productivity on the waterbody's surface and intensified the reducibility at the bottom of the waterbody, which enabled the rich sedimentary organic matter to be well preserved. During the sedimentary period of the lower upper Ordovician Wufeng Formation and the lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation in the upper Yangtze region, frequent volcanic activities caused high biological productivity on the waterbody surface and strong reducibility at the bottom of the waterbody. As a result, the abundant organic matter deposited from the water surface can be well preserved. During the sedimentary period of the upper Longmaxi Formation, volcanic activities died down gradually then disappeared, causing the biological productivity on the water surface to decrease. Besides, the small amount of organic matter deposited from the water surface was destroyed due to oxidation.

AB  - We present a two-fluid description of the Kondo lattice that is based on an analysis of CeCoIn5 at various levels of dilution with La. We show that thermal and transport measurements provide evidence for the survival of the Kondo impurity component in the lattice as T-->0 K, and that the evolution of the low temperature properties of the Kondo lattice can be viewed as the partial condensation of the lattice of Kondo centers into a heavy fermion fluid. The resulting two-fluid model is shown to be applicable to the general problem of the ground state of the Kondo lattice.

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was added at the levels of 0, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg/kg feed for groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, during 10 weeks of a hot summer in Upper Egypt. The effects of ASA supplementation on feed intake, egg production, egg weight, egg volume, egg specific gravity, egg shell weight, feed conversion efficiency and incidence of mortality were determined.
   ASA supplementation at the levels of 600 and 800 mg/kg significantly (P < 0.01) improved the daily feed intake, egg production, eggshell weight and feed conversion efficiency and, in addition, it reduced the incidence of mortality from 15 % in the control group to 5 % in the two highest supplemented groups. The addition of 200 or 400 mg ASA/kg feed resulted in no significant difference in hen performance, although these levels did markedly reduce the incidence of mortality from 15 % to 10 %. ASA can decrease both the detrimental effect of heat stress on the productive performance of hens and the incidence of mortality, though not until after three weeks of supplementation. The optimal level was 600 mg ASA/kg feed.

AB  - This work focuses on the examination of the physicochemical interactions of magnetic nanoparticles with various cell lines. The applied field maintained a temperature range between 41 degrees C and 45 degrees C at a frequency of 237 kHz and a magnetic field of 2.8 kA/m. Two cell models (Caco-2 and MCF-7) were employed. Magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized by the coprecipitation and thermodescomposition method. They were decorated with carboxymethyl-dextran (CMDX-mag) and Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG-mag) polymers. Nanoparticle uptake was found to be affected by nanoparticles functionalization and cell type. CMDX-mag nanoparticles were selected to perform MFH experiments. Viability analysis when MFH was applied indicated a significant decrease in cell viability for a magnetic field exposure of 120 min and a resting time of 24 hours when compared to hypethermia caused by a hot water bath. MFH appears to have a higher effect than hyperthermia with hot water bath oil cell viability.

AB  - Despite its wide spatial distribution and its high abundance in the Mediterranean Sea, the biology and the ecology of the scyphozoan species Pelagia noctiluca remain poorly understood. This is mainly due to difficulties related to sampling and its maintenance in laboratory conditions. Thus, only a few studies exist on the ecophysiology of this jellyfish species under laboratory conditions. As an example, the maximum sizes of individuals obtained in previous culturing systems were not comparable to the ones found in the environment and the authors could not obtain a second generation. Here we present an improved rearing system for P. noctiluca employing a new enclosed system running with artificial seawater. The monitoring of the jellyfish in this new system highlights the importance of the quality of the food sources provided to the cultures, as well as the volume available for jellyfish growth. We obtain adults similar in size to the ones found in the open ocean (> 11 cm), and we were able to obtain a second generation, 140 days after the first one. Our system is both less time-consuming and less stressful for the jellyfish.

AB  - The frequency of change in the selective pressures is one of the main factors driving evolution. It is generally accepted that constant environments select specialist organisms whereas changing environments favour generalists. The particular outcome achieved in either case also depends on the relative strength of the selective pressures and on the fitness costs of mutations across environments. RNA viruses are characterized by their high genetic diversity, which provides fast adaptation to environmental changes and helps them evade most antiviral treatments. Therefore, the study of the adaptive possibilities of RNA viruses is highly relevant for both basic and applied research. In this study we have evolved an RNA virus, the bacteriophage Q beta, under three different temperatures that either were kept constant or alternated periodically. The populations obtained were analyzed at the phenotypic and the genotypic level to characterize the evolutionary process followed by the virus in each case and the amount of convergent genetic changes attained. Finally, we also investigated the influence of the pre-existent genetic diversity on adaptation to high temperature. The main conclusions that arise from our results are: i) under periodically changing temperature conditions, evolution of bacteriophage Qb is driven by the most stringent selective pressure, ii) there is a high degree of evolutionary convergence between replicated populations and also among populations evolved at different temperatures, iii) there are mutations specific of a particular condition, and iv) adaptation to high temperatures in populations differing in their pre-existent genetic diversity takes place through the selection of a common set of mutations.

AB  - There is concern about how climate change might affect Agassiz's desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii, a threatened species. We studied the effects of climatic variation on clutch phenology of a population at a wind energy generation facility for 7 field seasons between 1997 and 2011. Using X-radiography, we quantified the following phenophases based on the number of calendar days to each event from 1 January: appearance and disappearance of 65 first and 53 second clutches, and inter-clutch intervals between first and second clutches. Although third clutches were rare (n = 8), they were observed in 5 of 7 yr and were produced by 8 different females, all of which produced a third clutch only once during the study. Shelled eggs were visible from as early as 11 April to as late as 28 July, and the overall time span that eggs were visible differed among years. After controlling for maternal effects, we observed statistically significant inter-annual variation in all phenophases except for inter-clutch interval. Clutch appearance was late in cool years relative to warm years and especially late after 2 consecutive cool years. Using degree day (DD) methodology, we calculated DD accumulation during the post-hibernation and nesting season for each year. We then used DD estimates for mean date of first clutch appearance to predict the mean date of first clutch appearance in subsequent years with 1 to 10 d accuracy for all but 1 yr (1998) with El Nino conditions. Clutch phenology appears to be correlated with inter-annual variation in climate and may be influenced by climatic events in previous years.

AB  - Genetic variation may be preserved in populations by several different modes of behaviour. In this paper we examine the consequences of behaviour on genetic variation in traits that are determined by genetic factors and by environmental conditions experienced during ontogeny. The particular trait considered is wing dimorphism in the sand cricket Gryllus firmus. In this species, as is typical of wing dimorphic insects, the adult wing morph (macropterous or micropterous) is determined by both genetic constitution and the temperature experienced during a specific period of nymphal development. Wing morph may thus be controlled, in part, by the thermal preference of nymphs. The effective heritability of wing morphology will be increased if nymphs with a genetic disposition to a particular wing morph select the temperature that causes that morph to be expressed. By contrast, effective heritability will be decreased if nymphs show no preference, or nymphs select temperatures that reduce phenotypic variation among individuals. During the period of ontogeny when future wing morph is sensitive to temperature, nymphal crickets that are genetically disposed to become macropterous select lower temperatures than crickets that have the opposite genetic disposition. Likewise, nymphs that are being raised under conditions promoting macroptery select lower temperatures than nymphs being raised under conditions favouring microptery. The consequence of this behaviour is that genetic variation for wing morph may be masked, and hence preserved.

AB  - With a high surface to volume ratio, small organisms must carefully regulate their internal water status. Spottedwing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is an invasive frugivorous insect distributed across a wide range of geographical regions that can have periods of dry and hot weather, suggesting that this species has strategies to avoid stressful environments and reduce water loss. It also survives winter as an adult fly, indicating that it has adaptations to the low air humidity of this season. To determine the importance of water stress to D. suzukii, we studied their survival in environments of low humidity, which was manipulated using Drierite, and their survival and water loss in response to desiccation. Survival of both sexes was lower in drier conditions, and while female winter morph D. suzukii had higher mortality early on, remaining flies were able to survive longer in the drier conditions than the summer morphs. A bioassay method was adapted from Enjin et al. (2016) using 48-well plates to videotape the location of flies and quantify their behavioral responses to humidity. Male and female D. suzukii avoided dry conditions within the bioassay system, but only when there was at least 26% differential between humidity extremes. This response was observed for both summer and winter morphs of D. suzukii and our results provide guidance for attempts to manipulate crop environments to reduce the economic impact of this pest.

AB  - Infertility is common in nature despite its obvious cost to individual fitness. Rising global temperatures are predicted to decrease fertility, and male sterility is frequently used in attempts to regulate pest or disease vector populations. When males are infertile, females may mate with multiple males to ensure fertilization, and changes in female mating behavior in turn could intensify selection on male fertility. Fertility assurance is a potentially wide-spread explanation for polyandry, but whether and how it actually contributes to the evolution of polyandry is not clear. Moreover, whether a drop in male fertility would lead to a genetic increase in polyandry depends on whether females respond genetically or through behavioral plasticity to male infertility. Here, we experimentally manipulate male fertility through heat-exposure in Drosophila pseudoobscura, and test female discrimination against infertile males before and after mating. Using isogenic lines, we compare the roles of behaviorally plastic versus genetically fixed polyandry. We find that heat-exposed males are less active and attractive, and that females are more likely to remate after mating with these males. Remating rate increases with reduced reproductive output, indicating that females use current sperm storage threshold to make dynamic remating decisions. After remating with fertile males, females restore normal fecundity levels. Our results suggest that male infertility could explain the evolution of adaptively flexible polyandry, but is less likely to cause an increase in genetic polyandry.

AB  - The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) pathway is responsible for most aerobic ATP production and is the only metabolic pathway with proteins encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. In studies examining mitonuclear interactions among distant populations within a species or across species, the interactions between these two genomes can affect metabolism, growth, and fitness, depending on the environment. However, there is little data on whether these interactions impact natural populations within a single species. In an admixed Fundulus heteroclitus population with northern and southern mitochondrial haplotypes, there are significant differences in allele frequencies associated with mitochondrial haplotype. In this study, we investigate how mitochondrial haplotype and any associated nuclear differences affect six OxPhos parameters within a population. The data demonstrate significant OxPhos functional differences between the two mitochondrial genotypes. These differences are most apparent when individuals are acclimated to high temperatures with the southern mitochondrial genotype having a large acute response and the northern mitochondrial genotype having little, if any acute response. Furthermore, acute temperature effects and the relative contribution of Complex I and II depend on acclimation temperature: when individuals are acclimated to 12 degrees C, the relative contribution of Complex I increases with higher acute temperatures, whereas at 28 degrees C acclimation, the relative contribution of Complex I is unaffected by acute temperature change. These data demonstrate a complex gene by environmental interaction affecting the OxPhos pathway.

AB  - The evolution of laser-induced plasma for an aluminum target in a helium ambient gas at different pressures of 100, 300, 500, 700, and 1000 mbar is numerically studied. A thermal model of laser ablation is utilized for calculation of plasma parameters which comprise heat conduction, Euler equations, Saha-Eggert equations, Knudsen layer boundary condition, mass and energy balance relations, and optical shielding effects. In addition, in order to determine the temporal parameters of aluminum's plasma, the hydrodynamic equations are computed for calculation of the plasma absorption due to inverse Bremsstrahlung and photoionization. A CO2 laser pulse at a wavelength of 10.6 mu m with different pulse durations of 50 and 100ns is irradiated on laser induced Al plasma for truncation of the transmitted CO2 laser pulse. The laser intensities irradiated on the Al sample for producing plasma and generation of a shortened pulse are considered as 10(16), 10(17), and 5x10(17) W/m(2). Furthermore, for validation of the theoretical calculations, some experimental results are presented. Results showed that higher helium gas pressures caused the critical density attained at earlier delay times which caused the CO2 laser beam became efficiently truncated. Moreover, it is concluded that pulse duration has an inverse relation with ambient gas pressure and laser intensity which means that the higher gas pressure or laser intensity induces less pulse duration.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to assess the reliability and validity of a submaximal warm-up test (SWT) in professional soccer players. For the reliability study, 12 male players performed an SWT over 3 trials, with 1 week between trials. For the validity study, 14 players of the same team performed an SWT and a 30-15 intermittent fitness test (30-15(IFT)) 7 days apart. Week-to-week reliability in selected heart rate (HR) responses (exercise heart rate [HRex], heart rate recovery [HRR] expressed as the number of beats recovered within 1 minute [HRR60s], and HRR expressed as the mean HR during 1 minute [HRpost1]) was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and typical error of measurement expressed as coefficient of variation (CV). The relationships between HR measures derived from the SWT and the maximal speed reached at the 30-15(IFT) (V-IFT) were used to assess validity. The range for ICC and CV values was 0.83-0.95 and 1.4-7.0% in all HR measures, respectively, with the HRex as the most reliable HR measure of the SWT. Inverse large (r = -0.50 and 90% confidence limits [CLs] [-0.78 to -0.06]) and very large (r = -0.76 and CL, -0.90 to -0.45) relationships were observed between HRex and HRpost1 with V-IFT in relative (expressed as the % of maximal HR) measures, respectively. The SWT is a reliable and valid submaximal test to monitor high-intensity intermittent running fitness in professional soccer players. In addition, the test's short duration (5 minutes) and simplicity mean that it can be used regularly to assess training status in high-level soccer players.

AB  - Climate models predict that the atmospheric CO2 concentration will double and atmospheric temperatures will increase 1.8-4.0 degrees C globally by the end of this century. These changes will influence the growth of both crop plants and herbivores. The effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), feeding on maize, Zea mays L., were examined in environmentally controlled chambers. Elevated CO2 decreased N content and increased total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) content and the TNC: N ratio in maize leaves. Developmental time of larvae, protonymphs, deutonymphs, and the entire immature development of T. urticae was reduced at elevated temperatures, while elevated CO2 slightly mitigated the effects of elevated temperature on developmental time. The fecundity of T. urticae declined under elevated CO2 and temperature. Tetranychus urticae had lower net reproductive rate and shorter generation time at elevated temperatures, regardless of CO2 level. These results indicate that elevated CO2-mediated decrease in nutritional quality of maize leaves extends the development time of T. urticae. Taken together, with the increase of CO2 and temperature, the growth and development was accelerated for T. urticae feeding on maize, but its fecundity declined, which will decrease the T. urticae damage to maize for each generation. However, the number of generations will increase in high accumulative temperature regions, which may exacerbate T. urticae damage to maize. Thus, more integrated studies and realistic experimental designs are needed to predict the maize-T. urticae interaction under future climate change scenarios.

AB  - In this study, an experimental protocol has been developed for comparing survival rates of mutant and wild-type zebrafish larvae under extreme starvation. Zebrafish larvae were placed in 96-well plates at fourth day postfertilization (dpf) and larvae were not fed at all from hatching to cease. Zdf1 zebrafish line was used, a strain carrying the (cancer) pathogenic TP53-M214K amino acid substitution. TP53-M214 corresponds to the human TP53-M246 and both residues are located on the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein. Survival statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in the overall survival rates between homozygous mutant and wild-type larvae. When considering 15 dpf as the endpoint of the experiment (66% of larvae died), a borderline statistical significance was observed for the dominant model of inheritance (p = 0.015; relative hazard = 0.8320). Despite the fact yolk sac of larvae is depleted at 7-8 dpf, 34% of larvae survive until 15 dpf and 1.5% until 17 dpf. Concluding, three main results derive from this study: (1) pathogenic homozygous mutations in TP53 probably do not alter survival rates of zebrafish larvae under starvation; (2) zebrafish larvae can live up to 17 dpf without food, surviving only with their initial nutritional supplies; and (3) an easy and affordable protocol has been developed for estimating survival rates of zebrafish larvae under stressful conditions.

AB  - Ecological speciation is defined as the emergence of reproductive isolation as a direct or indirect consequence of divergent ecological adaptation. Several empirical examples of ecological speciation have been reported in the literature which very often involve adaptation to biotic resources. In this review, we investigate whether adaptation to different thermal habitats could also promote speciation and try to assess the importance of such processes in nature. Our survey of the literature identified 16 animal and plant systems where divergent thermal adaptation may underlie (partial) reproductive isolation between populations or may allow the stable coexistence of sibling taxa. In many of the systems, the differentially adapted populations have a parapatric distribution along an environmental gradient. Isolation often involves extrinsic selection against locally maladapted parental or hybrid genotypes, and additional pre- or postzygotic barriers may be important. Together, the identified examples strongly suggest that divergent selection between thermal environments is often strong enough to maintain a bimodal genotype distribution upon secondary contact. What is less clear from the available data is whether it can also be strong enough to allow ecological speciation in the face of gene flow through reinforcement-like processes. It is possible that intrinsic features of thermal gradients or the genetic basis of thermal adaptation make such reinforcement-like processes unlikely but it is equally possible that pertinent systems are understudied. Overall, our literature survey highlights (once again) the dearth of studies that investigate similar incipient species along the continuum from initial divergence to full reproductive isolation and studies that investigate all possible reproductive barriers in a given system.

AB  - We investigated the thermoregulatory abilities and behaviour of Pseudocordylus melanotus melanotus (Drakensberg crag lizard) in terms of the relationship between the operative temperature (T-e), selected temperature (T-sel), set-point range (T-set) and field active body temperature (field T-sel), exposure to low temperature, body posture and activity. The T, range for P. in. melanotus was about 58 C (-3.20 C in winter to 54.94 C in summer). In a laboratory thermal gradient, in a setting that is independent of ecological costs or thermal constraints, lizards maintained T-set (defined as the interquartile range of T-sel after Hertz et al., 1993) between 29.00 +/- 0.36 C and 31.78 +/- 0.16 C in winter and 29.61 +/- 0.28 C and 32.47 +/- 0.18 C in summer. The mean T-sel was 30.08 +/- 0.14 C in winter and 30.99 +/- 0.11 C in summer. In the field, however, lizards achieved significantly lower T-b, which suggests that the thermal environment limited the T-b that lizards were able to achieve. Lizards were active for significantly longer and selected significantly higher T-b in Summer than in winter. During winter, lizards spent a significant amount of time at T-b below their lower critical limiting temperature (defined by loss of righting). The most frequently assumed body postures in summer were those where the head or body were raised, whereas, in winter, lizards usually lay with head and body flat on the rock substrate. We suggest that these differences reflect the physiological requirements of the lizards: Head-up postures in sit-and-wait foragers are consistent with scanning for prey while head-down postures are likely motivated by thermoregulatory needs. It is clear that P. m. melanotus can thermoregulate efficiently, but the T-b maintained may be constrained by the range of T-e available to the lizards in their natural environment. Pseudocordylus in, melanotus currently appears to be geographically constrained by low environmental temperatures at the edge of its range. Should global warming become a reality in southern Africa, this species could inadvertently benefit by occupying new habitat that was previously unavailable because of thermal constraints.

AB  - The CO2 level in the atmosphere has been increasing since the industrial revolution owing to anthropogenic activities. The increased CO2 level has led to global warming and also has detrimental effects on human beings. Reducing the CO2 level in the atmosphere is urgent for balancing the carbon cycle. In this regard, reduction in CO2 emission and CO2 storage and usage are the main strategies. Among these, CO2 usage has been extensively explored, because it can reduce the CO2 level and simultaneously provide opportunities for the development in catalysts and industries to convert CO2 as a carbon source for preparing valuable products. However, transformation of CO2 to other chemicals is challenging owing to its thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities. Among the CO2 utilization techniques, electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is a promising alternative because it is generally conducted under ambient conditions, and water is used as the economical hydrogen source. Moreover, ECR offers a potential route to store electrical energy from renewable sources in the form of chemical energy, through generation of CO2 reduction products. To improve the energy efficiency and viability of ECR, it is important to decrease the operational overpotential and maintain large current densities and high product selectivities; the development of efficient electrocatalysts is a critical aspect in this regard. To date, many kinds of materials have been designed and studied for application in ECR. Among these materials, metal oxide-based materials exhibit excellent performance as electrocatalysts for ECR and are attracting increasing attention in recent years. Investigation of the mechanism of reactions that involve metallic electrocatalysts has revealed the function of trace amount of oxidized metal species-it has been suggested that the presence of metal oxides and metal-oxygen bonds facilitates the activation of CO2 and the subsequent formation and stabilization of the reaction intermediates, thereby resulting in high efficiency and selectivity of the ECR. Although the stability of metal oxides is a concern as they are prone to reduction under a cathodic potential, the catalytic performance of metal oxide-based catalysts can be maintained through careful designing of the morphology and structure of the materials. In addition, introducing other metal species to metal oxides and fabricating composites of metal oxides and other materials are effective strategies to achieve enhanced performance in ECR. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the use of metal oxide-based materials as electrocatalysts and their application in ECR. The critical role, stability, and structure-performance relationship of the metal oxide-based materials for ECR are highlighted in the discussion. In the final part, we propose the future prospects for the development of metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for ECR.

AB  - Great efforts have been made recently to totally or partially replace calcium aluminate cement (CAC) by alternative materials in refractory castables, in order to attain an enhanced thermomechanical performance of these ceramic linings at intermediate temperatures (600-1200 degrees C). Besides that, using additives that induce earlier sintering/densification of the refractory microstructure may also reduce the energy costs derived from the production of pre-formed pieces. Based on these aspects, this work investigated the viability of replacing CAC by calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)(2)] to ensure a suitable binding action and effective sintering/densification of the designed compositions at intermediate temperatures. Six high-alumina castables containing these alternative additives or their blend were prepared and their green mechanical strength, apparent porosity and Young's modulus evolution with temperature were evaluated within the 30-1400 degrees C range. After that, the most promising compositions were characterized via X ray diffraction and thermomechanical tests, such as cold and hot modulus of rupture, thermal shock resistance, etc. Although the selected binders did not result in specimens with green mechanical strength values as high as the ones for the cement-bonded materials (2-8 MPa versus similar to 18 MPa, respectively), they could be demolded and handled without any problems. CaCO3 and/or Ca(OH)(2)-bonded compositions presented a sintering effect at intermediate temperatures (600-1000 degrees C) due to the so-called "sintering-coarsening-coalescence" phenomenon. These transformations favored the faster sintering/densification of the tested castables, resulting in samples with improved cold and hot mechanical strength at 900 degrees C, reaching values within the range of 28-30 MPa instead of 10-13 MPa for the CAC-bonded one. After firing the evaluated compositions at higher temperatures (up to 1500 degrees C), all compositions presented similar results regarding their modulus of rupture or thermal shock resistance.

AB  - The impacts of carbon-based sources on anaerobic digestion methane generation were investigated in this study. The findings revealed that bio-solids and Hydro-chars may increase accumulative methane output by 16% to 30%. Nevertheless, there is no significant difference (statistically) (p > 0.05) in methane production from Hydro-chars and bio-solids generated at, unlike temperatures. Bio-solids and Hydro-chars augmented microorganisms that may contribute indirect interspecies electron transfer. Microorganisms' DIET in a stable environment created by carbon-based compounds with homogeneous dispersion and electrons were transported via an aromatic functional group on the surface of the material. From the fermented effluent, sludge recapture was 0.09 m(3) sludge / m(3) wastewater. The time required to recoup investment was calculated to be 3.72 years. This research reveals the impact of surface characteristics of carbon-based sources on methane generation in anaerobic fermentation and proposes a novel method for reusing discarded tea grounds.

AB  - The fish gut microbiota contributes to digestion and can affect the nutrition, growth, reproduction, overall population dynamics and vulnerability of the host fish to disease; therefore, this microbial community is highly relevant for aquaculture practice. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatic analysis have allowed us to develop a broader understanding of the complex microbial communities associated with various habitats, including the fish gut microbiota. These recent advances have substantially improved our knowledge of bacterial community profiles in the fish intestinal microbiota in response to a variety of factors affecting the host, including variations in temperature, salinity, developmental stage, digestive physiology and feeding strategy. The goal of this review is to highlight the potential of next-generation sequencing platforms for analysing fish gut microbiota. Recent and promising results in this field are presented along with a focus on new perspectives and future research directions of fish gut microbial ecology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a simplified operational process for lactic acid (LA) production from inedible starchy biomass by open fermentation using thermotolerant Lactobacillus rhamnosus DUT1908. One step simultaneous liquefaction, saccharification and fermentation (SLSF) was proposed to produce LA using aging paddy rice with hull (APRH) as feedstock. First, a robust microbial strain was obtained by adaptive laboratory evolution under high temperature stress. As a result, L. rhamnosus DUT1908 showed high thermotolerance up to 50 degrees C and high efficiency of substrate utilization. Then, the performance of this thermotolerant l-lactic acid producing strain was demonstrated. Finally, various fermentation strategies were compared for LA production from APRH, including simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and SLSF. In one-step open SLSF process, 107.8 g/L lactic acid was obtained with a productivity of 3.4 g/(L.h) and a yield to theoretical glucose of 0.89 g/g. This is the highest yield and productivity of lactic acid reported on starchy residues, and provides an efficient route for the development of high value-added products.

AB  - An optimized spectroscopic method combining quantitative evolved gas analysis via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-EGA) in combination with a qualitative in situ thermal reaction monitoring via diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ(T) DRIFTS) is being proposed to rapidly characterize soil organic matter (SOM) to study its dynamics and stability. A thermal reaction chamber coupled with an infrared gas cell was used to study the pattern of thermal evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) in order to relate evolved gas (i.e., CO2) to different qualities of SOM. Soil samples were taken from three different arable sites in Germany: (i) the Static Fertilization Experiment, Bad Lauchstadt (Chernozem), from treatments of farmyard manure (FYM), mineral fertilizer (NPK), their combination (FYM + NPK) and control without fertilizer inputs; (ii) Kraichgau; and (iii) Swabian Alb (Cambisols) areas, Southwest Germany. The two latter soils were further fractionated into particulate organic matter (POM), sand and stable aggregates (Sa + A), silt and clay (Si + C), and NaOCl oxidized Si + C (rSOC) to gain OM of different inferred stabilities; respiration was measured from fresh soil samples incubated at 20 degrees C and 50% water holding capacity for 490 days. A variable long path length gas cell was used to record the mid-infrared absorbance intensity of CO2 (2400 to 2200 cm(-1)) being evolved during soil heating from 25 to 700 degrees C with a heating rate of 68 degrees C min(-1) and holding time of 10 min at 700 degrees C. Separately, the heating chamber was placed in a diffuse reflectance chamber (DRIFTS) for measuring the mid-infrared absorbance of the soil sample during heating. Thermal stability of the bulk soils and fractions was measured via the temperature of maximum CO2 evolution (CO2max). Results indicated that the FYM + NPK and FYM treatments of the Chernozem soils had a lower CO2max as compared to both NPK and CON treatments. On average, CO2max of the Chernozem was much higher (447 degrees C) as compared to the Cambisol sites (Kraichgau 392 degrees C; Swabian Alb 384 degrees C). The POM fraction had the highest CO2max (477 degrees C), while rSOC had a first peak at 265 degrees C at both sites and a second peak at 392 degrees C for the Swabian Alb and 482 degrees C for the Kraichgau. The CO2max increased after 490 day incubation, while the C lost during incubation was derived from the whole temperature range but a relatively higher proportion from 200 to 350 degrees C. In situT DRIFTS measurements indicated decreases in vibrational intensities in the order of C-H = unknown C vibration < C-H < -COO/C = C< C = C with increasing temperature, but interpretation of vibrational changes was complicated by changes in the spectra (i. e., overall vibrational intensity increased with temperature increase) of the sample during heating. The relative quality changes and corresponding temperatures shown by the in situT DRIFTS measurements enabled the fitting of four components or peaks to the evolved CO2 thermogram from the FTIR-EGA measurements. This gave a semi-quantitative measure of the quality of evolved C during the heating experiment, lending more evidence that different qualities of SOM are being evolved at different temperatures from 200 to 700 degrees C.
   The CO2max was influenced by long-term FYM input and also after 490 days of laboratory incubation, indicating that this measurement is an indicator for the relative overall SOM stability. The combination of FTIR-EGA and in situ(T) DRIFTS allows for a quantitative and qualitative monitoring of thermal reactions of SOM, revealing its relative stability, and provides a sound basis for a peak fitting procedure for assigning proportions of evolved CO2 to different thermal stability components.

AB  - Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection leads to substantial economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. However, no effective countermeasures exist to combat this virus infection so far. The most common antiviral strategy relies on directly inhibiting viral proteins. However, this strategy invariably leads to the emergence of drug resistance due to the error-prone nature of viral ploymerase. Targeting cellular proteins required for viral infection for developing new generation of antivirals is gaining concern. Recently, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) was found to be an important host factor for the replication of multiple viruses and the inhibition of HSP90 showed significant antiviral effects. It is thought that the inhibition of HSP90 could be a promising broad-range antiviral approach. However, the effects of HSP90 inhibition on PRRSV infection have not been evaluated. In the current research, we tried to inhibit HSP90 and test whether the inhibition affect PRRSV infection.
   Methods: We inhibit the function of HSP90 with two inhibitors, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamono-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), and down-regulated the expression of endogenous HSP90 with specific small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cell viability was measured with alamarBlue. The protein level of viral N was determined by western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). Besides, IFA was employed to examine the level of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The viral RNA copy number and the level of IFN-beta mRNA were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT PCR).
   Results: Our results indicated that both HSP90 inhibitors showed strong anti-PRRSV activity. They could reduce viral production by preventing the viral RNA synthesis. These inhibitory effects were not due to the activation of innate interferon response. In addition, we observed that individual knockdown targeting HSP90 alpha or HSP90 beta did not show dramatic inhibitory effect. Combined knockdown of these two isoforms was required to reduce viral infection.
   Conclusions: Our results shed light on the possibility of developing potential therapeutics targeting HSP90 against PRRSV infection.

AB  - Evolutionary thermal adaptation is increasingly being elucidated in a variety of systems. However, one of the most striking examples, temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in reptiles, has proven stubbornly difficult to decipher. Theoretical models suggest that selection on and heritable variation in thermal sensitivity of embryonic sex determination and maternal behavioural choice of thermal qualities of nest sites control the microevolutionary potential of TSD. To begin addressing this important issue, we conducted a multiyear field study of nesting behaviour in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), which display TSD. We detected a significant field repeatability for overstory vegetation cover around nests at oviposition, a trait that is correlated inversely with nest temperature during embryonic sex determination and positively with offspring sex ratio (percentage of male). Neither clustered nesting nor individual spatial repeatability in nest site choice caused this striking pattern. Instead, females consistently preferred nest environments with particular quantities of overstory vegetation cover. These findings confirm a crucial assumption of models concerning the microevolution and adaptive significance of TSD in reptiles. The results also indicate that this system may be able to evolve via long-term maternal nesting behaviour in response to skewed sex ratios caused by environmental perturbations, such as gradual long-term climate change.

KW  - GENERATION

AB  - The thermal utilization of solar energy is usually confined to domestic hot water systems and somewhat to space heating at temperatures up to 60 degreesC. Industrial process heat has a considerable potential for solar energy utilization. Cyprus has a small isolated energy system, almost totally dependent on imported fuels to meet its energy demand. The abundance of solar radiation together with a good technological base, created favorable conditions for the exploitation of solar energy in the island. The number of units in operation today corresponds to one heater for every 3.7 people in the island, which is a world record. Despite this impressive record no solar industrial process heat system is in operation today. The main problem for this is the big expenditure required for such a system and the uncertainty of the benefits. The objective of this work was to investigate the viability of using parabolic trough collectors for industrial heat generation in Cyprus. The system is analyzed both thermally and economically with TRNSYS and the TMY for Nicosia, Cyprus, in order to show the magnitude of the expected benefits. The load is hot water delivered at 85 degreesC at a flow rate of 2000 kg/h for the first three quarters of each hour from 8:00-16:00 h, 5 days a week. The system consists of an array of parabolic trough collectors, hot water storage tank, piping and controls. The optimum collector area for the present application is 300 m(2), the optimum collector flow rate is 54 kg/m(2) h and the optimum storage tank size is 25 m(2). The system covers 50% of the annual load of the system and gives life cycle savings of about Cpound6200 ((euro)10800). This amount represent the money saved from the use of the system against paying for fuel. The savings however refer to a non-subsidized fuel price, which will be in effect from 2003. The optimum system can deliver a total of 896 GJ per year and avoids 208 tons Of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The effect of various design changes on the system performance was investigated. The E-W tracking system (collector axis aligned in N-S direction) was found to be superior to the N-S one. The required load temperature affects the performance of the system as for higher temperatures the auxiliary energy required is bigger. Also a number of variations in the load use pattern have been investigated and presented in this paper. It was found that the bigger the load (double shift, full hour use pattern) the bigger the collector area required, the greater the first year fuel savings and the greater the life cycle savings of the installation. This means that it is more viable to apply solar industrial process heat to higher energy consumption industries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Being invoked as one of the candidate mechanisms for the latitudinal patterns in biodiversity, Janzen's hypothesis states that the limited seasonal temperature variation in the tropics generates greater temperature stratification across elevations, which makes tropical species adapted to narrower ranges of temperatures and have lower effective dispersal across elevations than species in temperate regions. Numerous empirical studies have documented latitudinal patterns in species elevational ranges and thermal niche breadths that are consistent with the hypothesis, but the theoretical underpinnings remain unclear. This study presents the first mathematical model to examine the evolutionary processes that could back up Janzen's hypothesis and assess the effectiveness of limited seasonal temperature variation to promote speciation along elevation in the tropics. Results suggest that trade-offs in thermal tolerances provide a mechanism for Janzen's hypothesis. Limited seasonal temperature variation promotes gradient speciation not due to the reduction in gene flow that is associated with narrow thermal niche, but due to the pleiotropic effects of more stable divergent selection of thermal tolerance on the evolution of reproductive incompatibility. The proposed modelling approach also provides a potential way to test a speciation model against genetic data.

AB  - Windbreaks or shelterbelts are a management tool to protect crops from damaging horizontal wind flow, and may provide a useful buffer between farmland and urbanized areas by reducing pesticide drift, dust, and noise associated with farming activities. Plant selection for windbreaks in the Intermountain West can be difficult as high elevation coupled with extreme temperatures, high pH soils, and limited access to water are common. This study assessed eight tree species for suitability as a windbreak in the Intermountain West, with a particular focus on initial establishment and use at the urban-agriculture interface. Species were assessed for mortality, size, canopy density, insect and disease issues, and initial cost. Measurements of shadow characteristics were used as a novel approach to compare canopy density and porosity. Standard poplar (Populus x canadensis) and 'Theves' columnar poplar (Populus nigra 'Afghanica') were the most effective at rapid establishment, but species with more moderate growth rates, such as aspen, juniper, and hackberry, may provide lower long-term maintenance costs for the environmental conditions found in the Intermountain West.

In the first generation, females laid 50 eggs each on average, and spawned higher numbers of eggs for the first 5 days but then fewer after this. However, all of the 2(nd)-generation females that were produced through the successive rearing of eggs from the 1(st) generation did not spawn. When test insects (TI) were raised at 32 degrees C, their mean +/- SE pupal period and emergence rate were 28.4 +/- 1.9 days and 87%, respectively. However, most individuals raised in cold treatments (5 degrees C and - 5 degrees C) without a pre-cooling period did not survive. Individuals exposed to a pre-cooling period, however, had a 7-10 days longer pupal period than those raised at 32 degrees C, and their emergence rate (90%) was slightly higher. Different cold treatment temperatures (0 degrees C, 3 degrees C, or 5 degrees C) and periods (30 or 60 days) were tested in further experiments. The experimental group kept for 30 days at 0 degrees C and 3 degrees C had the shortest pupal period of all, and emergence rates exceeded 90% in most groups. With respect to the number of eggs spawned by the second generation females after cold treatments, the experimental groups held in cold treatments at 5 degrees C for 30 and 60 days were found to spawn the most eggs. Consequently, the experimental group kept at 5 degrees C for 30 days was the most effective set of conditions tested during the entire breeding period.

AB  - Order Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) is an ancient lineage of osteichthyan fishes (>200 million years old) with most extant species at conservation risk. A relatively basal species, the pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus, is a federally endangered species native to the Mississippi and Missouri River basins. Hybridization with sympatric shovelnose sturgeon, S. platorynchus, is one of several threats to pallid sturgeon. Current molecular markers cannot reliably distinguish among pure species and multigenerational backcrosses. This information is critical for implementation of management strategies to increase populations through natural reproduction and artificial propagation. Genotypes from a large panel of unlinked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may provide greater resolution of the two species; however, paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) within individuals resulting from an ancient whole genome duplication event confound SNP development. The aim of this study was to produce pallid sturgeon gynogens that contain 100% homozygous DNA contributed by only the maternal parent and have enough DNA for future SNP marker development. When homozygous gynogens are sequenced, heterozygosity at a locus within an individual indicates the presence of incorrectly aligned sequences that contain PSVs; accurate identification of these multi-locus contigs can facilitate their exclusion when developing disomic markers. In this study, we attempted to produce two types of pallid sturgeon gynogens: a) haploid gynogens produced from the activation of pallid sturgeon eggs with ultravioletirradiated sperm from the distantly related paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), and b) doubled haploids produced from the activation of pallid sturgeon eggs with irradiated paddlefish milt followed by thermal shock to suppress the first mitotic division. Production of doubled haploids, gynogens with 100% homozygous DNA and double the genome content of haploid gynogens, was pursued because it was originally unknown if haploid gyongens would survive long enough to attain enough genetic material for SNP marker development. We performed flow cytometry and microsatellite genotyping on the specimens in order to confirm haploid and doubled haploid status. Our study was unable to successfully yield doubled haploids; however, we successfully produced haploid gynogens that contained enough nuclear DNA for our future SNP marker development study. Interestingly, this study also produced paddlefish ? pallid sturgeon hybrids in the control groups in two separate years; this is the first study to report viable offspring between the paddlefish and a Scaphirhynchus sturgeon species and reflects on the malleability of the genomes of the species in this order.

AB  - A viviparous lizard, Eremias multiocellata, was used to investigate the possible sexual and ontogenetic effects on selected body temperature, thermal tolerance range and the thermal dependence of locomotor performance. We show that adults are sexually dimorphic and males have larger bodies and heads than females. Adults selected higher body temperatures (34.5 vs. 32.4 degrees C) and could tolerate a broader range of body temperatures (8.1-46.8 vs. 9.1-43.1 degrees C) than juveniles. The sprint speed and maximum sprint distance increased with temperature from 21 degrees C to 33 degrees C, but decreased at 36 degrees C and 39 degrees C in both juveniles and adults. Adults ran faster and longer than juveniles at each tested temperature. Adult locomotor performance was not correlated with snout-vent length (SVL) or sex, and sprint speed was positively correlated with hindlimb length. juvenile locomotor performance was positively correlated with both SVL and hindlimb length. The ontogenetic variation in selected body temperature, thermal tolerance and locomotor performance in E. multiocellata suggests that the effects of morphology on temperature selection and locomotor performance vary at different ontogenetic stages.

AB  - In aquatic ectotherms, muscle metabolic capacities are strongly influenced by exogenous factors, principally temperature and food availability. Seasonal changes in temperature lead many organisms to modify their metabolic machinery so as to maintain capacity even in "slower" cold habitats. Modifications of mitochondrial capacities are central in this response. The increases in protein-specific oxidative capacities of mitochondria during cold acclimation of temperate fishes do not occur during the evolutionary adaptation to cold in Antarctic species. Instead, Antarctic fishes tend to increase the proportion of fibre volume devoted to mitochondria, perhaps to facilitate intracellular distribution of oxygen and metabolites. Variation in energetic status can drastically modify muscle metabolic status, with glycolytic muscle changing more than oxidative muscle. This in turn impacts swimming performance. A decrease in the condition of cod leads endurance at speeds above U-crit to drop by 70%. Sprint swimming is less affected, perhaps as it does not exhaust glycolytic muscle. We used interindividual variation in muscle metabolic capacities to identify correlates of swimming performance in stickleback and cod. Activities of cytochrome c oxidase in glycolytic muscle are a correlate of sprint swimming in stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and cod (Gadus morhua), whereas lactate dehydrogenase activities in glycolytic muscle are a correlate of cod endurance swimming. In scallops, gonadal maturation leads to virtually complete mobilisation of glycogen from muscle. This does not reduce the capacity of the scallops, Chlamys islandica and Euvola ziczac, to mount escape responses, but significantly slows their recuperation from exhaustive exercise. Muscle metabolic capacities fall in parallel with glycogen mobilisation. In the compromise between muscles' dual roles as a motor and a macromolecular reserve, a significant loss in locomotory ability occur, during gametogenesis and spawning. Reproductive fitness takes the upper hand over maintenance of performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Many countries have developed heat-health watch and warning systems (HHWWS) or early-warning systems to mitigate the health consequences of extreme heat events. HHWWS usually focuses on the four hottest months of the year and imposes the same threshold over these months. However, according to climate projections, the warm season is expected to extend and/or shift. Some studies demonstrated that health impacts of heat waves are more severe when the human body is not acclimatized to the heat. In order to adapt those systems to potential heat waves occurring outside the hottest months of the season, this study proposes specific health-based monthly heat indicators and thresholds over an extended season from April to October in the northern hemisphere. Methods The proposed approach, an adoption and extension of the HHWWS methodology currently implemented in Quebec (Canada). The latter is developed and applied to the Greater Montreal area (current population 4.3 million) based on historical health and meteorological data over the years. This approach consists of determining excess mortality episodes and then choosing monthly indicators and thresholds that may involve excess mortality. Results We obtain thresholds for the maximum and minimum temperature couple (in degrees C) that range from (respectively, 23 and 12) in April, to (32 and 21) in July and back to (25 and 13) in October. The resulting HHWWS is flexible, with health-related thresholds taking into account the seasonality and the monthly variability of temperatures over an extended summer season. Conclusions This adaptive and more realistic system has the potential to prevent, by data-driven health alerts, heat-related mortality outside the typical July-August months of heat waves. The proposed methodology is general and can be applied to other regions and situations based on their characteristics.

AB  - Coral mortality due to climate-associated stress is likely to increase as the oceans get warmer and more acidic. Coral bleaching and an increase in infectious disease are linked to above average sea surface temperatures. Despite the uncertain future for corals, recent studies have revealed physiological mechanisms that improve coral resilience to the effects of climate change. Some taxa of bleached corals can increase heterotrophic food intake and exchange symbionts for more thermally tolerant clades; this plasticity can increase the probability of surviving lethal thermal stress. Corals can fight invading pathogens with a suite of innate immune responses that slow and even arrest pathogen growth and reduce further tissue damage. Several of these responses, such as the melanin cascade, circulating amoebocytes and antioxidants, are induced in coral hosts during pathogen invasion or disease. Some components of immunity show thermal resilience and are enhanced during temperature stress and even in bleached corals. These examples suggest some plasticity and resilience to cope with environmental change and even the potential for evolution of resistance to disease. However, there is huge variability in responses among coral species, and the rate of climate change is projected to be so rapid that only extremely hardy taxa are likely to survive the projected changes in climate stressors.

AB  - Streams depend on riparian forests to supply many important functions such as delivery of large woody debris (LWD), organic matter, and nutrients into the aquatic ecosystem and to provide shade to help maintain cool water. Both forests and streams are dynamic, and inputs from the riparian forest are constantly replenished as organic matter and nutrients are processed and transported. Forest stand dynamics have been intensively studied and foresters have developed a good understanding of tree growth and mortality to support commercial forest management. In recent years, the relationships between aquatic functions and adjacent forest stand characteristics have been increasingly quantified by ecologists. Management of riparian forests to protect aquatic functions and water quality has received considerable attention in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere. For scientific knowledge to be useful to decision-makers, the complex set of riparian relationships, increasingly well understood individually, need to be collectively and objectively linked in a form that can be easily used by scientists and non-scientists alike to develop management strategies for riparian forests. In this paper we describe an analytical system that quantitatively links widely used forest growth forecasting systems for coastal Pacific Northwest forest types to the riparian ecological functions of large woody debris recruitment and shade. The riparian aquatic interaction simulator (RAIS), with its user-friendly interface, allows managers to forecast aquatic functions for up to 300 years. RAIS provides these forecasts over a range of critical input variables and produces realistic estimates of riparian functions when compared with published research.

AB  - Many organisms time reproduction with physical and biological cycles that affect offspring survival. In the marine environment, a common pattern is the release of planktonic larvae during large-amplitude nocturnal tides, which may reduce losses due to predation. However, if the duration of embryonic development depends on temperature, changes in temperature can lead to errors in timing. Organisms may reduce such errors either by changing the timing of onset of incubation or by selecting the temperatures to which embryos are exposed. We conducted field and laboratory experiments with 2 species of fiddler crabs to examine the effects of temperature and temperature variation on the timing of larval release and synchrony of release among females. As expected, the duration of incubation increased with decreasing temperature in both species. In the field when temperature was low, Uca terpsichores released larvae earlier than expected, indicating that shifts in timing of mating reduced potential errors in timing of release. However, when temperature changed during incubation, accuracy and precision in the timing of release decreased. U. deichmanni maintained timing and synchrony of release despite variable temperature in the field, but in cold water in the laboratory, they incubated eggs longer than in the field and released larvae late. These differences suggest that U. deichmanni regulates the incubation period in the field. U. terpsichores may be less able than U. deichmanni to adjust to rapid variation in temperature that may accompany climate change, which could result in large-scale interspecific differences in larval survival and recruitment.

AB  - The realization of robust intrinsic ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials in conjunction with the intriguing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has provided a fertile ground for novel physics and for the next-generation spintronic and topological devices. On the basis of density functional theory (DFT), we predict that layered 5d transition-metal heavier halides (TMHs), such as ReX3 (X = Br, I), show intrinsic ferromagnetism with high spin polarization and high Curie temperatures. The outstanding dynamic and thermodynamic stability ensures their experimental feasibility. The strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of Re makes the electronic structure of the ReI3 monolayer topologically nontrivial with a large Chern number (C = -4). DFT+U calculations reveal that the 2D system undergoes a nontrivial to trivial transition with increasing on-site Hubbard Coulomb interaction U through the emergence of a Dirac cone. This transition is corroborated by the emergence of chiral edge states and the anomalous Hall conductivity. These findings not only demonstrate room-temperature ferromagnetism in atomically thin 5d TMHs, but also pave the way for the potential realization of the QAH effect with high Chern numbers in pristine 2D layers.

AB  - Bioenergy crops are well known for their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the soil carbon stock. Although such crops are often held to be in competition with food crops and thus raise the question of current and future food security, at the same time mitigation measures are required to tackle climate change and sustain local farming communities and crop production. However, in some cases the actions envisaged for specific pedo-climatic conditions are not always economically sustainable by farmers. In this frame, energy crops with high environmental adaptability and yields, such as giant reed (Arundo donax L.), may represent an opportunity to improve farm incomes, making marginal areas not suitable for food production once again productive. In so doing, three of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations would be met, namely SDG 2 on food security and sustainable agriculture, SDG 7 on reliable, sustainable and modern energy, and SDG 13 on action to combat climate change and its impacts.
   In this work, the response of giant reed in the marginal areas of an agricultural district of southern Italy (Destra Sele) and expected farm incomes under climate change (2021-2050) are evaluated. The normalized water productivity index of giant reed was determined (WP; 30.1 g m(-2)) by means of a SWAP agro-hydrological model, calibrated and validated on two years of a long-term field experiment. The model was used to estimate giant reed response (biomass yield) in marginal areas under climate change, and economic evaluation was performed to determine expected farmincomes (woodchips and chopped forage). The results show that woodchip production represents the most profitable option for farmers, yielding a gross margin 50% lower than ordinary highinput maize cultivation across the study area.

AB  - The High Himalayan Crystalline Sequence in north-central Nepal is a 15-km-thick pile of metasediments that is bound by the Main Central Thrust to the south and a normal fault to the north. The Langtang section through the metasediments shows an apparent inversion of metamorphic isograds with high-P, kyanite-grade rocks exposed beneath low-P, sillimanite-grade rocks. Textural evidence confirms that the observed inversion is a result of a polyphase metamorphic history and phase equilibria studies indicate that thermal decoupling has occurred within a mechanically coherent section of crust. Rocks now exposed at the base of the High Himalayan thrust sheet underwent Barrovian regional metamorphism (MI) prior to 34Ma in the early stages of the Himalayan orogeny, recording metamorphic conditions of T = 710 +/- 30-degrees-C, P = 9 +/- 1 kbar. After the activation of the Main Central Thrust, which emplaced these metapelites southwards onto the lower grade Lesser Himalayan formations, the upper part of the thrust sheet was overprinted by a second heating event (M2), resulting in sillimanite-grade metamorphism and anatexis of metapelites at T = 760 +/- 30-degrees-C, P = 5.8 +/- 0.4 kbar between 17 and 20 Ma. Crustally derived, leucogranite magmas have been emplaced into low-grade Tethyan sediments on the hangingwall of the normal fault that bounds the northern limit of the metapelitic sequence.
   The cause of the selective heating of the upper section of the metasediments during M2 cannot be reconciled with either post-thrusting thermal relaxation or advection models. The cause of M2 remains problematical but it is suggested that heat focusing has occurred at the top of the High Himalayan Crystalline Sequence as a result of movement on the normal fault blanketing metapelites of high heat productivity with low-grade sediments of low thermal conductivity. This model implies that the normal fault was active before M2, consistent with decompression textures that formed during, or shortly after, sillimanite-grade metamorphism.

AB  - We used high-resolution (500 x 250 m) two-dimensional lithospheric-scale thermo-mechanical numerical modeling to unravel the unexpected topographic and thermal evolutions recorded during the necking phase of several rift systems worldwide. Through a systematic analysis we studied how the lithosphere theology impacts the topographic and thermal evolutions across the entire width of magma-poor and sediment-starved rift systems until their crust is locally thinned to 10 km. We quantified the evolution of topography, uplift and subsidence rates, accommodation and emerged space creation, temperature and surface heat flow for a wide panel of crustal and mantle rheologies to provide an overview of possible rifting behaviors. Extension of a lithosphere for which the crust and mantle are mechanically decoupled by a weak lower crust generates complex morphotectonic evolutions, with the formation of temporarily restricted sub-basins framed by uplifted parts of the future distal margin. Mechanical decoupling between the crust and mantle controls also largely the thermal evolution of rift systems during the necking phase since, for equivalent extension rates and initial geotherms: (i) weak/decoupled lithospheres have a higher geothermal gradient at the end of the necking phase than strong/coupled lithospheres; and (ii) weak/decoupled lithospheres show intense heating of the lower crust at the rift center and intense cooling of the crust on either side of the rift center, unlike strong/coupled lithospheres. These behaviors contrast with the continuous subsidence and cooling predicted by the commonly used depth-uniform thinning model. Accommodation space in the evolving basins is first generated by vertical crustal velocities and subsequently by horizontal velocities causing the widening of the earlier formed basin. Processes such as strain softening and mantle fertilization have a limited impact on the primary morphology and thermal state of rift systems before the crust is thinned to 10 km but may locally amplify relief and thermal heterogeneities.

AB  - Schwenk and colleagues challenged biologists to develop a deeper understanding of the linkages between organisms and environments. These linkages are captured by the concept of the niche, which has guided theoretical and empirical research in ecology for decades. Despite this research, we still cannot explain or predict much of the variation in niches over space and time. This shortcoming hinders efforts to forecast biological responses to environmental change. We believe that progress has been slowed by poor coordination between theoretical and empirical efforts to understand the evolution of niches. Therefore, progress should be sped by research programs that integrate modeling and experiments. Such research programs should focus on the structures of environmental variation, the constraints on phenotypes, and the relationships between phenotypes and fitness.

TI  - EFFECTS OF CRYO-COOLING IN GRINDING STEELS
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The grinding process is inherently characterised by high specific energy and high temperature, which are responsible for high wheel loading, increased grinding forces, reduced metal-removal rate, rapid wheel wear and deterioration in the quality of the ground surface through oxidation, the induction of tensile residual stress and micro-cracks. These problems become more acute when the product is of HSHR material and subjected to dynamic loading while functioning. Therefore, in industry the user should pay special attention to control and optimise all the significant parameters for minimising the afore-said problems, aiming at higher grindability, productivity and overall economy in grinding.
   The basic principles of controlling such high temperature are: (i) proper selection and optimisation of wheel and process parameters; (ii) the removal of heat from the grinding zone by the application of proper grinding fluid. Profuse cooling with conventional grinding fluids, even in the form of mist or jet, is virtually unable to solve the problem. However, cryogenic cooling by agents such as liquid nitrogen is expected to meet this challenge.
   In the present work, specimens of different steels, namely MS, HCS, cold- and hot-die steel and HSS, have been surface ground at different infeeds under dry conditions and with soluble oil and liquid nitrogen. The effects of such cryo-cooling relative to soluble oil and dry grinding have been investigated in respect of chip formation, grinding forces, specific energy, burning and surface characterisation.
   The experimental results indicate that the grinding temperature and burning decreased remarkably under cryo-cooling. Thermal damage of the ground surface has been reduced substantially by cryo-cooling, but to different degree in different steels. Cryo-cooling also enables retention of the wheel sharpness for a longer period and results in less force and specific energy being required.

AB  - Descriptions of the life cycle of the genus Steinernema do not consider the production of infective juveniles (Us) by the first-generation developed within the insect host when more than one generation develops. We demonstrated IJ production by first- and second-generation adults of Steinernema rarum (OLI strain), evaluated their virulence and compared virulence and morphometric characters between the two IJ forms. Our results demonstrated not only the presence of Us in the offspring of first- and second-generation adults but also a greater virulence of first-generation Us. Both types of Us also differed in five morphometric characters. According to our results, a population of Us emerging from a host cadaver has individuals of two generations with different characteristics; hence, they should not be considered the same. These generational differences may be exploited, for example, for biocontrol purposes, by using a specific generation of Us for inoculative release. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates a potential application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a relatively new approach for predicting solar still productivity (SSP). Five variables, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SR), feed flow rate (MF), and total dissolved solids of feed (TDSF) and brine (TDSB), were used as input parameters. The data were collected from an experimental solar still system used to desalinate seawater in an arid climate. The data were distributed randomly into training, testing, and validation datasets. A hybrid learning algorithm and eight different membership functions were applied to generate the ANFIS models. Several statistical criteria were used to assess the model performances. The ANFIS model with a generalized bell membership function provided the best prediction accuracy compared with models with other membership functions. The coefficient of correlation values for this model were 0.999, 0.959, and 0.832 for training, testing, and validation datasets, respectively. Sensitivity analysis (SA) was used to show the effectiveness of the considered input parameters for predicting SSP. The SA results indicated that SSP is the most influential parameter on SSP. Generally, the findings indicate the robustness of the ANFIS approach for estimating SSP.

AB  - Although adaptation of Drosophila to thermal extremes has been investigated for many years, only recently has much progress been made in identifying the genetic and physiological basis of evolutionary shifts in thermoresistance. Here we examine the way the Drosophila research has been used to understand the evolution of plastic responses, tradeoffs and limits to selection, and to develop links between laboratory studies and adaptive shifts leading to population and species differences.
   Several methods have been devised to rapidly measure heat and cold resistance, but the relevance of these-measures to selection pressures in nature remains largely unknown. Plastic responses to thermal extremes are usually. divided into short-term exposures to sub-lethal conditions or into longer-term exposures (often referred to as hardening and acclimation respectively). Hardening responses appear to have costs associated with the expression of a heat shock protein (Hsp70). Costs of acclimation are more difficult to identify because exposing Drosophila to suboptimal conditions for a long time can have deleterious effects unrelated to the acclimation response.
   Quantitative genetic analyses have revealed genetic variation for thermoresistance under laboratory conditions, but variation under natural conditions has rarely been identified. In a few cases selection responses within laboratory populations have been linked to specific candidate genes and physiological mechanisms.
   Population comparisons have provided evidence for clinal variation in thermoresistance traits, although many studies lack power because only a few populations have. been considered. Clinal patterns in candidate genes have also been demonstrated. However evidence for direct selection for thermoresistance and for the involvement of specific genes under natural conditions is mostly lacking. Clinal responses to-c old extremes can involve changes in diapause strategies and altered patterns of reproduction. Inbreeding influences thermoresistance and acclimation responses, but inbreeding effects may be environment-specific.
   Species differences in heat or in cold resistance commonly match the geographical (climatic) distributions of species. Interspecific differences, for heat resistance are usually smaller than for cold resistance. Drosophila species from the same location can differ markedly for stress resistance, and this may-allow-species to occupy different niches.
   Rapid progress is likely in the next few years in identifying genes and fraits-underlying variation in stress resistance among populations and species of Prosophila, and in comparing. these findings to those from other taxa. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Buchnera aphidicola is an obligate endosymbiont that provides aphids with several essential nutrients. Though much is known about aphid-Buchnera interactions, the effect of the host plant on Buchnera population size remains unclear. Here we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques to explore the effects of the host plant on Buchnera densities in the cotton-melon aphid, Aphis gossypii. Buchnera titers were significantly higher in populations that had been reared on cucumber for over 10 years than in populations maintained on cotton for a similar length of time. Aphids collected in the wild from hibiscus and zucchini harbored more Buchnera symbionts than those collected from cucumber and cotton. The effect of aphid genotype on the population size of Buchnera depended on the host plant upon which they fed. When aphids from populations maintained on cucumber or cotton were transferred to novel host plants, host survival and Buchnera population size fluctuated markedly for the first two generations before becoming relatively stable in the third and later generations. Host plant extracts from cucumber, pumpkin, zucchini, and cowpea added to artificial diets led to a significant increase in Buchnera titers in the aphids from the population reared on cotton, while plant extracts from cotton and zucchini led to a decrease in Buchnera titers in the aphids reared on cucumber. Gossypol, a secondary metabolite from cotton, suppressed Buchnera populations in populations from both cotton and cucumber, while cucurbitacin from cucurbit plants led to higher densities. Together, the results suggest that host plants influence Buchnera population processes and that this may provide phenotypic plasticity in host plant use for clonal aphids.

AB  - Understanding the factors that facilitate or constrain establishment of populations in novel environments is crucial for conservation biology and the study of adaptive radiation. Important questions include: (1) Does the timing of colonization relative to stochastic events, such as climatic perturbations, impact the probability of successful establishment? (2) To what extent does community context (e.g., the presence of competitors) change the probability of establishment? (3) How do sources of intrapopulation variance, such as sex differences, affect success at an individual level during the process of establishment? Answers to these questions are rarely pursued in a field-experimental context or on the same time scales (months to years) as the processes of colonization and establishment. We introduced slender anole lizards (Anolis apletophallus) to eight islands in the Panama Canal and tracked them over multiple generations to investigate the factors that mediate establishment success. All islands were warmer than the mainland (ancestral) environment, and some islands had a native competitor. We transplanted half of these populations only 4 months before the onset of a severe regional drought and the other half 2 years (two generations) before the drought. We found that successful establishment depended on both the intensity of interspecific competition and the timing of colonization relative to the drought. The islands that were colonized shortly before the drought went functionally extinct by the second generation, and regardless of time before the drought, the populations on islands with interspecific competition declined continuously over the study period. Furthermore, the effect of the competitor interacted with sex, with males suffering, and females benefitting, from the presence of a native competitor. Our results reveal that community context and the timing of colonization relative to climactic events can combine to determine establishment success and that these factors can generate opposite effects on males and females.

AB  - This work considers a design of a PEM fuel cell (PEMFC) stack that consists of 10 cells and expects to carry out an analysis of performance. In this work, PEMFC performance as affected by different combinations of control factors, such as the cathode and anode operating pressures, the humidification temperatures, and the stoichiometric flow ratio of reaction gas, is studied. On the PEMFC stack performance, the gas supply that is expected to be the minimum and the output power that is hoped to be the maximum are a result of the demand of the multi-objectives characteristics. Due to the Taguchi orthogonal array, the screen experiment is carried out by using a fractional factorial design in order to determine main factors and interaction effects first, and then the robust design is conducted. The intelligent parameter design is developed via an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System combined with the definition of percentage reduction of quality loss (PRQL) in order to supply a fitness function to the genetic algorithms (GA). The best parameter design is proposed after an analysis and comparison is conducted. Finally, the adaptability of prediction for the model created by this approach is confirmed by the confirmation experiment. This work shows that the PEMFC performance is improved by 35.8% via the average PRQL. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Iron meteorites provide a record of the thermal evolution of their parent bodies, with cooling rates inferred from the structures observed in the Widmanstatten pattern. Traditional planetesimal thermal models suggest that meteorite samples derived from the same iron core would have identical cooling rates, possibly providing constraints on the sizes and structures of their parent bodies. However, some meteorite groups exhibit a range of cooling rates or point to uncomfortably small parent bodies whose survival is difficult to reconcile with dynamical models. Together, these suggest that some meteorites are indicating a more complicated origin. To date, thermal models have largely ignored the effects that impacts would have on the thermal evolution of the iron meteorite parent bodies. Here we report numerical simulations investigating the effects that impacts at different times have on cooling rates of cores of differentiated planetesimals. We find that impacts that occur when the core is near or above its solidus, but the mantle has largely crystallized can expose iron near the surface of the body, leading to rapid and nonuniform cooling. The time period when a planetesimal can be affected in this way can range between 20 and 70Myr after formation for a typical 100km radius planetesimal. Collisions during this time would have been common, and thus played an important role in shaping the properties of iron meteorites.

AB  - Response to temperature of Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Aphidimae) from three climatic regions of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The parasitoid Aphidius colemani Viereck, 1912 presents higher mortality at constant temperatures above 25 degrees C, and probably it is the cause of the failure on the biological control of Aphis gossypii Glover, 1877 when this parasitoid is used at higher temperatures in greenhouses. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of different temperatures on individuals of A. colemani from different climatic regions of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Individuals of A. colemani were collected in the localities of Juramento, Lavras and Sao Gotardo, and reared in laboratory (22+/-2 degrees C, 70+/-10% RH and 12h photophase) for three generations in the host A. gossypii, on cucumber plants. One mated female of A. colemani, 24-48 h old, was released for one hour, in a Petri dish (15cm) with 20 nymphs of 2(nd) instar of A. gossypii on a leaf disk of cucumber (4 cm of diameter) laid on a layer of agar-water (1%). The parasitized aphids were kept at 16, 19, 22, 25 and 28+/-1 degrees C, 70+/-10% RH and 12h photophase. The emergence rates of individuals from Juramento (65.9 and 35.4%) and Sao Gotardo (71.4 and 47.6%) were lower compared to those from Lavras (87.1 and 80.9%) at 16 and 28 degrees C. The more suitable temperature for the development of A. colemani from Lavras was higher than those for individuals from Juramento and Sao Gotardo. The individuals from Lavras showed highest emergence at 28 degrees C, and this demonstrated the existence of individuals of A. colemani with tolerance to higher temperatures. These results open news perspectives on the use of different strains of A. colemani on biological control of A. gossypii in protected cultivation.

AB  - As a result of a variety of chemical, environmental, mechanical and physiological difficulties, insects that spend their entire life spans in the marine or intertidal region are relatively rare. The present study assesses whether morphological and physiological adaptations have evolved in a maritime parasitoid wasp species Echthrodesis lamorali Masner, 1968 (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae, Scelioninae), in response to environmental pressures on its respiratory functioning. Scanning electron and light microscopy of whole and sectioned specimens show the presence of structure-retaining taenidia in the tracheal tubes, although there is an absence of other major adaptations associated with the trachea or spiracles. Histological sectioning reveals the presence of unusual sacs in the female metasoma whose role is unknown, although they are hypothesized to most likely be linked to ovipositor control. Respirometry experiments illustrate the formation of a plastron when submerged, with the longevity of the wasps being increased by quiescence. The critical thermal range of E. lamorali is shown to be large: from -1.1 degrees C +/- 0.16 to 45.7 degrees C +/- 0.26 (mean +/- SE). Behavioural and physiological adaptations in E. lamorali appear to have evolved in response to exposure to the heterogeneous environmental conditions experienced within the intertidal zone.

AB  - Longevity, preoviposition period, and fecundity of deutogynes of the pear rust mite, Epitrimerus pyri (Nalepa), were measured at three constant temperatures (10, 15, and 20-degrees-C), and compared between deutogyne and protogyne females at 20-degrees-C. Relationships between temperature (10, 15, 20, and 25-degrees-C) and the rate of development (days-1) of eggs, nymphs, and generations (egg to adult) were described using least-squares linear regression. Mean longevity and preoviposition period of deutogynes decreased with increasing temperature. The average rate of oviposition increased with temperature, but lifetime fecundity did not differ among temperatures. At 20-degrees-C, protogynes began ovipositing sooner than deutogynes and laid more eggs at a faster rate, but average longevity of the two morphs was the same. Significant linear relationships were found between temperature and the developmental rates of eggs, nymphs, and generations. Threshold base temperatures for development of eggs, nymphs, and generations were 2.2, 3.3, and 3.8-degrees-C, respectively. Degree-day (+/-SEM) requirements for median development of eggs, nymphs, and generations were 93.5 +/- 2.5, 78.7 +/- 3.4, and 144.9 +/- 3.6 above their respective threshold temperatures. These results are compared with estimated developmental requirements calculated from Easterbrook (1978).

AB  - Coral reef organisms, including octocorals, are facing the consequences of anthropogenic activities, such as increasing oceanic pH and sea surface temperature, threatening their long-term survival and well-being. Gene expression studies based on quantitative PCR (qPCR) are important tools to provide insight into the molecular basis of octocoral stress responses and their potential resilience mechanisms. Nevertheless, a lack of experimentally validated, stably expressed reference genes for the normalization of gene expression using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qPCR) method limit such investigations among octocorals. Here, assessment of the expression stability of seven candidate reference genes was performed using a palette of statistical tools for valid qPCR-based gene expression studies on the octocoral Sinularia cf. cruciata during thermal (34 degrees C) and low-pH (pH 7.5) stress and the most suitable set of reference genes was determined for such experiments. The reliability of the selected reference genes was confirmed in a qPCR assay that targeted the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene. The HSP70 gene was found to be significantly upregulated during thermal stress, whereas during low-pH stress the expression level of this gene decreased. This study provides experimentally validated stress-specific sets of stably expressed reference genes during climate change-induced stresses, which will benefit future gene expression studies on Sinularia cf. cruciata as well as other octocorals. These results also highlight potentially different acclimation strategies of octocorals to different sources of abiotic stresses, contributing to our understanding of the potential for the adaptation of coral reef organisms to a changing world.

AB  - The aim of paleoclimate studies resolving climate variability from noisy proxy records can in essence be reduced to a statistical problem. The challenge is to extract meaningful information about climate variability from these records by reducing measurement uncertainty through combining measurements for proxies while retaining the temporal resolution needed to assess the timing and duration of variations in climate parameters. In this study, we explore the limits of this compromise by testing different methods for combining proxy data (smoothing, binning, and sample size optimization) on a particularly challenging paleoclimate problem: resolving seasonal variability in stable isotope records. We test and evaluate the effects of changes in the seasonal temperature and the hydrological cycle as well as changes in the accretion rate of the archive and parameters such as sampling resolution and age model uncertainty in the reliability of seasonality reconstructions based on clumped and oxygen isotope analyses in 33 real and virtual datasets. Our results show that strategic combinations of clumped isotope analyses can significantly improve the accuracy of seasonality reconstructions compared to conventional stable oxygen isotope analyses, especially in settings in which the isotopic composition of the water is poorly constrained. Smoothing data using a moving average often leads to an apparent dampening of the seasonal cycle, significantly reducing the accuracy of reconstructions. A statistical sample size optimization protocol yields more precise results than smoothing. However, the most accurate results are obtained through monthly binning of proxy data, especially in cases in which growth rate or water composition cycles obscure the seasonal temperature cycle. Our analysis of a wide range of natural situations reveals that the effect of temperature seasonality on oxygen isotope records almost invariably exceeds that of changes in water composition. Thus, in most cases, oxygen isotope records allow reliable identification of growth seasonality as a basis for age modeling in the absence of independent chronological markers in the record. These specific findings allow us to formulate general recommendations for sampling and combining data in paleoclimate research and have implications beyond the reconstruction of seasonality. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for solving common problems in paleoclimatology and stratigraphy.

AB  - Environmentally induced epigenetic changes may contribute to phenotypic plasticity, increase adaptive potential in changing environments, and play a key role in the establishment and spread of invasive species in new habitats. In this study, we used methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) to assess environmentally induced DNA methylation changes in a globally invasive clonal ascidian, Didemnum vexillum. We tested the effect of increasing temperature (19, 25 and 27 degrees C) and decreasing salinity (34, 32, 30, 28 and 26 practical salinity units (PSU)) on global DNA methylation, growth and survival rates. Exposure to 27 degrees C resulted in significant changes in DNA methylation over time. Growth also decreased in colonies exposed to high temperatures, suggesting they were under thermal stress. In contrast, no differences in growth nor DNA methylation patterns were observed in colonies exposed to a decreasing salinity gradient, potentially due to prior adaptation. The results of this study show that environmental stress can induce significant global DNA methylation changes in an invasive marine invertebrate on very rapid timescales, and that this response varies depending on the type, magnitude, and duration of the stressor. Changes in genomic DNA methylation and the rate of growth may act to 'buy survival time' under stressful conditions, expanding the distribution limits of this globally invasive species.

AB  - In this study, a temperature and ROS-responsive drug delivery system ROSP@MSN based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles has been designed and synthesized by taking advantage of 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) benzyl acrylate modified polymers (ROSP) as "nano-valve", which can respond selectively to cancer exclusive microenvironment and implement targeted drug release. Due to the superior temperature-sensitive properties of ROSP, ROSP@MSN could achieve cargo loading in cold water, and subsequently close the pore by raising temperature to obtain ROSP@MSN@DOX. Upon the stimulus of ROS, ROSP@MSN@DOX shows good release performance at physiological conditions. The cytotoxicity study demonstrates that the cell viability is about 80% after Hela cells are treated with ROSP@MSN at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL for 24 h, exhibiting the good biocompatibility of ROSP@MSN. Furthermore, after treated with ROSP@MSN@DOX at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL for 24 h, the viability of Hela cells is reduced to 40.5%; Control experiments demonstrate that, when Hela cells are pretreated with active oxygen scavenger, cell viability is about 65.3% due to the significant decrease of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the therapeutic nanocarrier with effective encapsulation and release capacity in particular situation is a great candidate for the new drug delivery platform for targeted cancer therapy.

AB  - Great challenges remain concerning the cost-effective manufacture of high-performance metal meshes for transparent glass heaters (TGHs). Here, a high-performance silver mesh fabrication technique is proposed for TGHs using electric-field-driven microscale 3D printing and a UV-assisted microtransfer process. The results show a more optimal trade-off in sheet resistance (R-s = 0.21 omega sq(-1)) and transmittance (T = 93.9%) than for indium tin oxide (ITO) and ITO substitutes. The fabricated representative TGH also exhibits homogeneous and stable heating performance, remarkable environmental adaptability (constant R-s for 90 days), superior mechanical robustness (R-s increase of only 0.04 in harsh conditions-sonication at 100 degrees C), and strong adhesion force with a negligible increase in R-s (2-12%) after 100 peeling tests. The practical viability of this TGH is successfully demonstrated with a deicing test (ice cube: 21 cm(3), melting time: 78 s, voltage and glass thickness: 4 V, 5 mm). All of these advantages of the TGHs are attributed to the successful fabrication of silver meshes with high resolution and high aspect ratio on the glass substrate using the thick film silver paste. The proposed technique is a promising new tool for the inexpensive fabrication of high-performance TGHs.

AB  - Prediction of pollutant emissions is a key aspect of modern combustor design in energy conversion systems. In the presented work, a simple and robust model based on low-order reaction networks is applied to a FLOX(R) laboratory combustor at atmospheric conditions. The applied approach is computationally cheap and therefore highly suited for design studies. Steady-state CFD RANS simulations are carried out, serving as a basis for the network generation algorithm. CFD results are validated with experimental data for flow field and combustion. Different degrees of fidelity of reactor network models are taken into consideration and findings are opposed to measurements, evaluating the quality of the low-fidelity models. Validation of CO and NOx emission results of reactor network modeling provides accurate qualitative and quantitative reproduction of experimental findings, depending on the degree of heat loss applied on the combustion system. The introduced approach is therefore readily applicable to large-scale, industrial, and gas turbine combustion.

AB  - Restoring dryland ecosystems is a global challenge due to synergistic drivers of disturbance coupled with unpredictable environmental conditions. Dryland plant species have evolved complex life-history strategies to cope with fluctuating resources and climatic extremes. Although rarely quantified, local adaptation is likely widespread among these species and potentially influences restoration outcomes. The common practice of reintroducing propagules to restore dryland ecosystems, often across large spatial scales, compels evaluation of adaptive divergence within these species. Such evaluations are critical to understanding the consequences of large-scale manipulation of gene flow and to predicting success of restoration efforts. However, genetic information for species of interest can be difficult and expensive to obtain through traditional common garden experiments. Recent advances in landscape genetics offer marker-based approaches for identifying environmental drivers of adaptive genetic variability in non-model species, but tools are still needed to link these approaches with practical aspects of ecological restoration. Here, we combine spatially explicit landscape genetics models with flexible visualization tools to demonstrate how cost-effective evaluations of adaptive genetic divergence can facilitate implementation of different seed sourcing strategies in ecological restoration. We apply these methods to Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers genotyped in two Mojave Desert shrub species of high restoration importance: the long-lived, wind-pollinated gymnosperm Ephedra nevadensis, and the short-lived, insect-pollinated angiosperm Sphaeralcea ambigua. Mean annual temperature was identified as an important driver of adaptive genetic divergence for both species. Ephedra showed stronger adaptive divergence with respect to precipitation variability, while temperature variability and precipitation averages explained a larger fraction of adaptive divergence in Sphaeralcea. We describe multivariate statistical approaches for interpolating spatial patterns of adaptive divergence while accounting for potential bias due to neutral genetic structure. Through a spatial bootstrapping procedure, we also visualize patterns in the magnitude of model uncertainty. Finally, we introduce an interactive, distance-based mapping approach that explicitly links marker-based models of adaptive divergence with local or admixture seed sourcing strategies, promoting effective native plant restoration.

AB  - Flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) with an embedded metal mesh are considered a promising alternative to traditional indium tin oxide (ITO) due to their excellent photoelectric performance, surface roughness, and mechanical and environmental stability. However, great challenges remain for achieving simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly manufacturing of high-performance FTEs with embedded metal mesh. Herein, a maskless, templateless, and plating-free fabrication technique is proposed for FTEs with embedded silver mesh by combining an electric-field-driven (EFD) microscale 3D printing technique and a newly developed hybrid hot-embossing process. The final fabricated FTE exhibits superior optoelectronic properties with a transmittance of 85.79%, a sheet resistance of 0.75 omega sq(-1), a smooth surface of silver mesh (R-a approximate to 18.8 nm) without any polishing treatment, and remarkable mechanical stability and environmental adaptability with a negligible increase in sheet resistance under diverse cyclic tests and harsh working conditions (1000 bending cycles, 80 adhesion tests, 120 scratch tests, 100 min ultrasonic test, and 72 h chemical attack). The practical viability of this FTE is successfully demonstrated with a flexible transparent heater applied to deicing. The technique proposed offers a promising fabrication strategy with a cost-effective and environmentally friendly process for high-performance FTE.

AB  - Environmental conditions fostering marine communities around Antarctica differ fundamentally from those in the rest of the world's oceans, particularly in terms of pronounced climatic fluctuations and extreme cold. Here, we argue that the rarity of pelagic larval stages in Antarctic marine benthic invertebrate species is a consequence of evolutionary temperature adaptation and that this has greatly contributed to the current structure of the Antarctic benthic community. In arguing this position, we challenge the likelihood of previously suggested survival strategies of benthic communities on the Antarctic continental shelf and slope during Cenozoic glacial periods. By integrating evidence from marine geology and geophysics, we suggest that the Antarctic continental shelf and slope were both unfavourable environments for benthic communities during glacial periods and that community survival was only possible in the deep sea or in shelters on the continental shelf as a result of the diachronism in maximum ice extent.

AB  - Robustness is the invariance of phenotypes in the face of perturbation. The robustness of phenotypes appears at various levels of biological organization, including gene expression, protein folding, metabolic flux, physiological homeostasis, development, and even organismal fitness. The mechanisms underlying robustness are diverse, ranging from thermodynamic stability at the RNA and protein level to behavior at the organismal level. Phenotypes can be robust either against heritable perturbations (e.g., mutations) or nonheritable perturbations (e.g., the weather). Here we primarily focus on the first kind of robustness-genetic robustness-and survey three growing avenues of research: (1) measuring genetic robustness in nature and in the laboratory; (2) understanding the evolution of genetic robustness; and (3) exploring the implications of genetic robustness for future evolution.

AB  - Wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, tolerate the freezing of their body tissues as an overwintering adaptation. Various parasites infect wood frogs of northern populations, but nothing is known about their strategies for surviving within a frozen host. We examined winter-conditioned wood frogs that were experimentally exposed to 0%C (nonfrozen) or -4%C (frozen) to determine whether endoparasites survive the freezing of their host. We found no differences in the prevalence or intensity of adult lungworms Rhabdias ranae (Nematoda) or of larvae of an unidentified species of digenetic trematode between these groups. Live individuals of both species were observed in hosts that recovered from experimental freezing at -4%C. Within the host, R. ranae also tolerated exposure to -5%C, a temperature near the lower limit of survival of the wood frog. Cryostage experiments showed that, like its host, R. ranae was highly susceptible to inoculative freezing and tolerant of the freezing of its tissues. Rhabdias ranae frozen in vitro in the presence or absence of 250 mM glucose, the cryoprotectant used by wood frogs, recovered from a 10-h exposure to -4%C. The mechanism of cold tolerance used by larval trematodes was not investigated; however, we hypothesize that freeze avoidance by supercooling may be important in this species. Freeze-tolerant anurans, such as the wood frog, are useful subjects in the study of coevolution of thermal tolerance in parasites and their host.

AB  - Climate change is expected to pose a significant risk to species that exhibit strong behavioural preferences for specific habitat types, with generalist species assumed to be less vulnerable. In this study, we conducted habitat choice experiments to determine how water temperature influences habitat preference for three common species of coral reef damselfish (Pomacentridae) that differ in their levels of habitat specialisation. The lemon damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis, a habitat specialist, consistently selected complex coral habitat across all temperature treatments (selected based on local average seasonal temperatures naturally experienced insitu: ambient winter 22 degrees C; ambient summer 28 degrees C; and elevated 31 degrees C). Unexpectedly, the neon damselfish Pomacentrus coelestis and scissortail sergeant Abudefduf sexfasciatus, both of which have more generalist habitat associations, developed strong habitat preferences (for complex coral and boulder habitat, respectively) at the elevated temperature treatment (31 degrees C) compared to no single preferred habitat at 22 degrees C or 28 degrees C. The observed shifts in habitat preference with temperature suggest that we may be currently underestimating the vulnerability of some habitat generalists to climate change and highlight that the ongoing loss of complex live coral through coral bleaching could further exacerbate resource overlap and species competition in ways not currently considered in climate change models.

AB  - The clutch is an important element for comfort during frequent maneuvers so-called start-up and speed gear change for a vehicle equipped with a manual transmission. During the phase of sliding or closing the clutch, the clutch torque is generated by the friction of the pad on the flywheel disc and the plate and then transmitted to the input shaft of the box by the friction disc. This friction generates a quantity of heat which leads to a temperature rise of the clutch. During this sliding phase of the clutch, the speed difference between the friction surfaces may be equated with Coulomb friction model. Currently, the clutches are subjected to high thermal stresses due to the engine. It is therefore useful to estimate the parameters influencing the thermal behavior of the clutch disc when starting or amount gearshift.
   In this study, we chose three geometric clutch models designed in 3D using Solid Works software, which are then converted into FEM model. Before beginning the analysis of the transient thermal behavior of each model, we proceed to the evaluation of the heat transfer coefficients using ANSYS CFX code. We also analyzed the effect of parameters such as the time of the slip, the angular speed, the lining material and the pressure exerted by the plate on the thermal behavior of the clutch to arrive at end correlations between the selected parameters and the temperature of the clutch disc.

AB  - Determination of inactivation kinetics, associated with thermal processing of foods and obtained from dynamic temperature experiments, requires carefully designed experiments, the primary element being the selection of the appropriate temperature profile along with a carefully planned sampling schedule. In the present work, a number of different dynamic temperature profiles were investigated in terms of their ability to generate accurate kinetic parameters with low confidence intervals (CIs). Although alternative models have been also tested, our work was concentrated on thermal inactivation kinetics that could be described by the classical D-z values. A pair of D and z values was assumed, and for each temperature profile tested, concentration data at different processing times were generated through the appropriate models. Next, an error (up to +/- 2.5% or +/- 5%) was introduced on these theoretical values to generate pseudo-experimental data, and the back-calculation of the assumed kinetic parameters by non-linear regression was performed. The accuracy and the 95% CIs of the estimated kinetic parameters were evaluated; joint confidence regions were also constructed to investigate parameters correlation. The effect of temperature profile pattern, level of error, number of experimental points, and reference temperature was assessed. A stepwise increasing and a single triangle-pattern temperature profile were the best profiles among those tested. As a general observation, based on different kinetic models investigated, temperature profiles and sampling intervals that result in concentration versus time diagrams having shapes as suggested by the primary model used when isothermally applied are not considered appropriate for parameter estimation.

AB  - Weather based prediction models for leaf rust were developed using disease severity and weather data recorded at four locations viz. Ludhiana, Kanpur, Faizabad and Sabour of the All India Wheat and Barley Improvement Project. Weeks 7-9 of the crop growing season at Ludhiana, Faizabad and Sabour and weeks 10-12 at Kanpur were identified as critical periods for relating weather variables to disease. Highly significant correlation coefficients were found between disease severity and a greater number of weather variables in these critical 3-week periods than at other times. The correlation coefficients were greatest for the Humid Thermal Ratio (HTR), Maximum Temperature (MXT) and Special Humid Thermal Ratio (SHTR), and these three weather variables were selected as predictor variables. Linear regressions with these predictor variables (individually) during the critical periods, and a multiple regression with MXT and relative humidity (RH), serve as four disease prediction models, with sufficient lead-time to take control measures. Validation of these prediction models with independent disease severity data showed that the regression equation with MXT (Model-1) was the best among the prediction models, with four out of six simulations matching observed disease severity classes and also having lowest residual sum of squares (SSE) value of 2727. Models 4 (multiple regression), 2 (HTR) and 3 (SHTR) with SSE values of 2881, 3092 and 3732, respectively are in order of decreasing accuracy of prediction. The model using MXT can be used to predict the disease severity in the Indo-Gangetic Plains and provide the basis for efficient disease control.

AB  - The thermal behavior during the selective laser melting of metal powders is a key issue to the product quality in 3D printing, so it is of benefit to the development of 3D printing industries to explore the heat transfer characteristics during the selective laser melting process. Based on the TiAl6V4 powder system, the energy conservation equation with a moving Gaussian energy source is developed, in which the temperature-dependent thermal physical properties of materials are taken into account. By means of the finite element methods, the temperature distribution and molten pool dimensions are presented, and the related modeling and numerical methods are validated by previous experimental and numerical works. The effects of the linear energy density, volume shrinkage, scanning track length, hatch spacing and time interval between two neighboring tracks on the temperature distribution and molten pool dimensions are obtained and analyzed. The results show that the increased laser power is superior to the reduced scan speed in thermal performance, which can improve the temperature distribution and molten pool dimensions. Shorter track, shorter hatch spacing and less time interval can lower the temperature gradient and increase the temperature of each track. The average temperature and dimensions of the molten pool are influenced by the volume shrinkage, which should be considered during the numerical simulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Genetic variation for thermal plasticity plays an important role in the success or failure of a species with respect to the colonization of different thermal habitats and the ability to deal with climatic change. The aim of this paper is to study the relative contribution of the additive and non-additive components of genetic variation for the slope of the temperature reaction norm for juvenile growth rate in the springtail Orchesella cincta. We present the outcome of an artificial selection experiment for steep and flat temperature reaction norms and the results of a parent-offspring heritability experiment. There was a considerable phenotypic variation for the slope of the reaction norm. The selection experiment and the offspring to parent regression analysis, however, yielded no evidence for significant additive genetic variance. There were also no indications for maternal effects. The full-sib analysis, on the other hand, revealed a significant broad sense heritability of 0.76. An unforeseen result was that the slopes of females were steeper than those of males. This influenced the broad sense heritability of the full-sib analysis, since accidental female or male biased broods inflate the estimate of heritability. A randomization test showed that the probability level of the observed "between group" variance on the basis of the sexual differences alone was less than 10(-5). From this we conclude that autosomal genetic variation played its own separate role. In conclusion, the thermal reaction norm for growth in juvenile O. cincta is not very much determined by the additive effects of a large number of independent genes, but more likely based on a still unknown but mainly non-additive, partially sex-related genetic mechanism, possibly including both dominance and epistatic effects. Hypotheses about the role of phenotypic plasticity in processes of local adaptation and speciation should thus be alert to such a complex genetic architecture.

AB  - Sex differences in selection are ubiquitous in sexually reproducing organisms. When the genetic basis of traits is shared between the sexes, such sexually antagonistic selection (SAS) creates a potential constraint on adaptive evolution. Theory and laboratory experiments suggest that environmental variation and the degree of local adaptation may all affect the frequency and intensity of SAS. Here, we capitalize on a large database of over 700 spatially or temporally replicated estimates of sex-specific phenotypic selection from wild populations, combined with data on microclimates and geographical range information. We performed a meta-analysis to test three predictions from SAS theory, that selection becomes more concordant between males and females: (1) in more stressful environments, (2) in more variable environments and (3) closer to the edge of the species' range. We find partial empirical support for all three predictions. Within-study analyses indicate SAS decreases in extreme environments, as indicated by a relationship with maximum temperature, minimum precipitation and evaporative potential (PET). Across studies, we found that the average level of SAS at high latitudes was lower, where environmental conditions are typically less stable. Finally, we found evidence for reduced SAS in populations that are far from the centre of their geographical range. However, and notably, we also found some evidence of reduced average strength of selection in these populations, which is in contrast to predictions from classical theoretical models on range limit evolution. Our results suggest that environmental lability and species range position predictably influence sex-specific selection and sexual antagonism in the wild.

AB  - Extreme heat is a leading cause of weather-related fatalities worldwide. Emphasis is currently being placed on the development of spatially specific vulnerability models, which are useful for decision support during extreme heat events (EHE). Research results concerning such spatially-explicit models lead efforts in preparation and mitigation of heat-related vulnerability and potential adaptation. The presented research analyzes the 1995 Chicago EHE in the context of a socio-environmental hazards approach, and fosters the development of an extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI). The EHVI is a fused dataset consisting of census data and remotely sensed variables, which are examined in relation to geocoded mortality data. The presented analysis combines 25 well-known indicators of extreme risk into an applied index utilizing a principal components analysis. The developed EHVI presented a trend of higher rates of death in the highest risk zones to lower rates in lower zones of risk. The model explains nearly 80% of the total variance in the heat-health vulnerability variables utilized. This index could be utilized by city officials to assist in the mitigation of extreme heat events and is a further evolution of previously developed efforts. Our findings indicate extreme heat vulnerability models should likely be developed on a local level for a specific location, taking into account local variations in social and environmental vulnerability.

AB  - Empirical data suggest that recombination rates may change in response to stress. To study the evolution of plastic recombination, we develop a modifier model using the same theoretical framework used to study conventional (nonplastic) modifiers, thus allowing direct comparison. We examine the evolution of plastic recombination in both haploid and diploid systems. In haploids, a plastic modifier spreads by forming associations with selectively favored alleles. Relative to nonplastic effects, selection On the plastic effects of a modifier is both much stronger and less sensitive to the specifics of the selection regime (e.g., epistasis). In contrast, the evolution of plastic recombination in diploids is much more restricted. Selection on plasticity requires the ability to detect DNA damage or cis-trans effects as may Occur trough maternal effects on fitness.

The atoms are linearly coupled to the field. Using the dressed-state approach and considering the field modes populated with thermal-distribution, we study the effect of temperature on the time evolution of entangled states of the pair of atoms.

AB  - Facultative diapause a strategy that allows insects to initiate additional generations when conditions are favorable or to enter diapause when they are not has a profound effect on the ecology and evolution of species Most previous studies have concentrated on the role of photoperiod and temperature in inducing facultative diapause in insects In contrast here we studied pupal diapause mediated by larval host plants in the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera and confirmed that pupal weight is a critical factor Two groups of third instar H armigera larvae kept at 25 C with L D = 8 16 and 20 C with photoperiod of L D = 8 16 respectively were fed on six host plants and on artificial diet (as a control) to determine how larval host plants affect diapause incidence and related traits (such as pupal weight and developmental duration) The data showed larval host plants affected diapause incidence significantly and the effects could be masked by low temperature Further analysis showed that pupal size not the length of the sensitive stage affected the decision to enter diapause In a further experiment third-instar to final-stage larvae deprived of artificial diet for 2 days demonstrated a direct relationship between pupal weight and diapause incidence These results suggest that larval host plants by affecting pupal size may influence diapause occurrence in H armigera This has important adaptive significance for both over-wintering survival and the possibility for completing an additional generation (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Eastern brownsnakes (Pseudonaja textilis) from south-eastern Australia are alert, well camouflaged, secretive, fast moving, and dangerously venomous, and they spend much of the time hidden in burrows. Thus, direct observation of this species is difficult. However, distinctive patterns in environmental thermal heterogeneity, coupled with knowledge of the thermal preferenda of the snakes, enabled us to infer their location and activity based on remotely monitored body temperatures (obtained from surgically implanted radio transmitters). We used data on 40 radio-tracked snakes to evaluate patterns of thermoregulation, activity, and habitat use.
   Captive snakes actively selected body temperatures around 31 C, and free-ranging snakes displayed similar body temperature levels while active. Front data on temperatures of the soil, operative models, and shaded air, we could identify activity, schedules of the snakes (especially, times of emergence from and retreat into burrows). Snake activity was bimodal over the year, with the highest incidence of above-ground activity in late spring and late summer. Thermal profiles suggest that inactive snakes in burrows spent most of their time at approximately 20 cm depth, but they moved to shallower depths at some times (e.g., during summer, when they sometimes spent entire nights above ground) and deeper at other times (e.g., greater than or equal to40 cm in winter). Reproductive females remained with their eggs after oviposition in mid-summer, about 30 cm under the soil surface. Burrow temperatures were frequently high, so that the snakes did not need to emerge in order to elevate body temperature. Overall, the telemetered snakes spent an average of 56% of active-season days, 64% of all days, and 93% of all hours below ground. Hence, this species largely depends on in-ground temperature for thermal energy exchange.

AB  - As attempt of elucidating the environmental factors that they control the plasticity floral fenotipic of Catasetum fimbriatum Lindley, climatics studies of the species began, through of the accompaniment of 45 individuals divided in three installed treatments. The first fifteen individuals, they were conditioned at green house where intense brightness prevailed (1300 at 1900 mu mol/m(2)s), high temperatures (38 degrees C) and it lowers relative humidity of the air (35%). Such treatment was entitled treatment 1. The other collected individuals that were put in the pot, and that they constituted the treatment 2, they were submitted the low luminous intensity (400 at 650 mu mol/m(2)s), to a smaller temperature (17 degrees C) and a relative humidity of the highest air (85%). The last fifteen individuals, presented the natural conditions of survival of the species, and they constituted in that way, the treatment 3 (luminous intensity between 500 at 800 mu mol/m(2)s, temperature of 23 degrees C and a relative humidity of the highest air of 65%). At the end of the experiment, the great adaptability could be verified of the species to the differentiated environments, through the ecotipes formation.

AB  - The dominance of a plant species in highly metal-contaminated areas reflects its tolerance or adaptability potential to these scenarios. Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal).
   Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.
   P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The current study implies that P. australis has enough potential to be used for mercury stabilization and restoration of sediments/soils rich in mercury as well.

AB  - This paper is an overview of the latest approaches to achieve equilibrium and above equilibrium electrical activation of the source/drain extensions for the 70 nm CMOS technology node and beyond. Topics include ion implantation (11) + Rapid Thermal Anneal (RTA), Solid Phase Epitaxy (SPE), Laser Thermal Annealing (LTA), and selective silicon recess followed by epitaxial deposition of heavily doped Silicon Germanium (SiGe). Additionally, a novel epitaxial approach incorporating a carbon doped underlayer to mediate,boron outdiffusion will be introduced. For each technology this paper reviews the projected targets, process and integration challenges, and the viability of the approach for drain extension junction depths and sheet resistance targets imposed by National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS). Conclusions will be supported by empirical observations and materials characterization results, as appropriate. The primary focus of this paper is on p-MOS, which has traditionally posed more challenges in achieving the optimum junction depth required to maximize the transistor drive current for a given metallurgical channel length and off-state current. This technology review will also include the significant tradeoffs between short channel effects attributed to deep junctions and the parasitic resistance of shallow junctions.

AB  - A simple meta-model was used to examine how climate warming and stresses due to other human activities might affect the productive capacity of fisheries in all of Canada's lakes. Recent estimates of lake resource characteristics by secondary watershed and area size-class provided the basis for the model. Potential fishery productivity was estimated using a variant of the Schlesinger and Regier (1982) model which had lake mean depth, total dissolved solids concentration, and mean annual air temperature as inputs. A business-as-usual climate change scenario (SRES A2) was used to estimate worst case future temperature increases (4.5-8.3C by the 2080s). The stress index from Chu et al. (2003) was used as a proxy for the impact on fisheries of other human activities. Projected populations for the SRES A2 scenario were used to scale future stress index levels. Potential biotic responses to warming were represented in two ways; the first as potential biotic displacement of currently dominant species when temperature rose beyond their preferred range and the second as potential biotic adaptation of other species, particularly in species rich areas, replacing displaced species. Potential productive capacity of fisheries in all Canadian lakes was 361,000 tonnes for the baseline climate norms period of 1961-1990. Climate warming increased productivity by 80.7% in the 2080s but stress reduced levels by 19.4% in the norms period and held the increase to 10.3% in the 2080s. Biotic displacement alone resulted in large decreases in productivity, by 65.2% in the 2080s and, when stress was added, by 79.5%. Biotic adaptation largely offset displacement. Applying stress and both biotic responses productivity was reduced by 31.4% in the 2080s from the unstressed norms baseline or 12% with stress added. Further investigations are needed to better establish the likely extent of stress impacts and potential biotic responses to climate warming in Canada's lakes.

AB  - Examining variation in fish populations over time is strengthened when climatic variations are understood and incorporated into analyses. We used a 18-year brook trout (Saivelinus fontinalis) data set with samples across a similar to 4800 km(2) spatial area in the Central Appalachian Mountains, combined with PRISM climate data at the HUC-12 subwatershed level to investigate temporal trends of each. We found significant increases in air temperature (p <.01) with no significant trends in precipitation across time, including no trends in changes in variation of temperature and precipitation also. Extreme rainfall events (# of days above 95% percentile for total daily precipitation in a year) and consecutive dry days (cumulative # of consecutive days with <3 mm precipitation in a year) were also examined arid produced no significantly changing trends over time. Using random forests, seasonal climate variables identified as changing over time explained 35.1% of the variability in young-of-the-year brook trout abundance over the 18-year monitoring period. The same procedure explained 25.1% of the variability in juvenile abundance and only 5.1% in adult abundance. Variable selection following random forest generation illustrated significant effects for winter and spring precipitation (both negative on young-of-the-year abundance. Spring degree days and spring precipitation both had significant negative effects on juvenile abundance. Random effects for stream and year explained a maximum of 27.7% and 10.8% of the variation in abundance across all models. A significant, positive interaction between spring degree days and precipitation was also identified, lending support to the important balance between temperature and flow in these systems that is critical to brook trout persistence. This work provides long-term evidence to help understand the dynamics of these sentinel headwater fish populations as they experience a changing climate.

AB  - The long-term evolution of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres of sub-Neptune-like planets is mostly controlled to by two factors: a slow dissipation of the gravitational energy acquired at the formation (known as thermal evolution) and atmospheric mass-loss. Here, we use MESA to self-consistently couple the thermal evolution model of lower atmospheres with a realistic hydrodynamical atmospheric evaporation prescription. To outline the main features of such coupling, we simulate planets with a range of core masses (5-20M.) and initial atmospheric mass fractions (0.5-30 per cent), orbiting a solar-like star at 0.1 au. In addition to our computed evolutionary tracks, we also study the stability of planetary atmospheres, showing that the atmospheres of light planets can be completely removed within 1 Gyr and that compact atmospheres have a better survival rate. From a detailed comparison between our results and the output of the previous-generation models, we show that coupling between thermal evolution and atmospheric evaporation considerably affects the thermal state of atmospheres for low-mass planets and, consequently, changes the relationship between atmospheric mass fraction and planetary parameters. We, therefore, conclude that self-consistent consideration of the thermal evolution and atmospheric evaporation is of crucial importance for evolutionary modelling and a better characterization of planetary atmospheres. From our simulations, we derive an analytical expression between planetary radius and atmospheric mass fraction at different ages. In particular, we find that, for a given observed planetary radius, the predicted atmospheric mass fraction changes as age(0.11).

AB  - Burrows provide burrowing animals with a place to hibernate, reproduce, and avoid predators and harsh weather conditions and thus have a vital impact on their survival. However, the general physical characteristics and ecological functions of Marmota himalayana burrows as well as whether there are differences in burrow traits under different terrains (e.g., sunny slopes, shady slopes, and flat areas) are not well understood. From July to August 2019 (warm season), we used unmanned aerial vehicles to fly at low altitudes and slow speeds to locate 131 M. himalayana burrows (45 on shaded slopes, 51 on sunny slopes, and 35 on flat areas) in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region. We then measured the physical characteristics (burrow density, entrance size, first tunnel length, volume, orientation, and plant characteristics near the burrow entrance) of these burrows on site. We found that terrain had a substantial influence on burrow density, orientation, and entrance size and on the angle of the burrow entrance; species richness had a substantial impact on path density and tunnel volume. The physical parameters of the M. himalayana burrows showed that they function to protect the marmots from natural enemies and bad weather, provide good drainage, and maintain a stable microclimate around the entrance. We discuss the ability of burrowing animals (e.g., M. himalayana) to adapt to the external environment based on their burrow characteristics.

AB  - Energy transfer within an arc is of crucial importance in numerous applications, such as thermal spraying and electric propulsion (arcjet and magnetoplasmadynamic thruster). Its control will frequently determine the viability of a process or a device. However, a lot of numerical works done to model arc discharge using finite volume or finite element method consider the arc core only, while the near-electrode layers are ignored and replaced by a presumed boundary condition. This greatly limits the reliability of the simulation model. The goal of this paper is to make the bulk plasma coupled with electrode regions, where the special space charge layer (sheath) on cathode is taken into account. This is achieved by a simplified 1-D sheath model developed in this paper, which is then applied on a nontransferred dc plasma torch to study the thermodynamic and electromagnetic interaction between plasma and electrodes. The simulated results in electrode and plasma regions are presented, the predicted temporal evolution of electric potential with sheath model is in good agreement with the experimental measurements.

AB  - The climate is undergoing rapid changes with rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, increasing temperatures and changes in the hydrological regimes resulting in more frequent and intense drought periods. These three climate change factors will, separately and in combination, affect the biotic and abiotic components of soil communities. This paper reviews the impact of climate change on field communities of enchytraeids with special emphasis on Cognettia sphagnetorum because most relevant studies have involved this species. C. sphagnetorum prefers cold and wet environments and several studies suggest that reductions of soil moisture may have dramatic consequences for C. sphagnetorum and other enchytraeid species. Effects of changing temperatures are less clear partly because thermal conditions influence soil moisture, which complicate the predictions of the outcome from such changes. The predicted increasing annual mean temperature may be stimulating and expand the season for growth and reproduction of enchytraeids; on the other hand, an increased frequency of extreme weather events, with heat waves during summer and bare soil freezes during autumn and spring, may occasionally cause severe mortality. Stimulating effects of increased atmospheric CO2 have been observed, perhaps due to increased food availability via root and litter production. However, effects of CO2 are also influenced by moisture and temperature. Generally, there is a lack of research looking into the complicated interactions between various climate change factors, and little is known about the potential of enchytraeids to adapt to a changing climate. Existing data suggest that C. sphagnetorum is not capable of adapting to a drier climate, thus, a decline in abundance and distribution of this species is possible. Since enchytraeids are of ecological significance in some types of habitats, a reduction may result in serious disruption in the functioning of these decomposer communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Background: Approximately 2.7 million neonatal deaths occur annually, with highest rates of neonatal mortality in countries that have recently experienced conflict. Constant instability in South Sudan further strains a weakened health system and poses public health challenges during the neonatal period. We aimed to describe the state of newborn facility-level care in displaced person camps across Juba, Malakal, and Maban.
   Methods: We conducted clinical observations of the labor and delivery period, exit interviews with recently delivered mothers, health facility assessments, and direct observations of midwife time-use. Study participants were mother-newborn pairs who sought services and birth attendants who provided delivery services between April and June 2016 in five health facilities.
   Results: Facilities were found to be lacking the recommended medical supplies for essential newborn care. Two of the five facilities had skilled midwives working during all operating hours, with 6.2% of their time spent on postnatal care. Selected components of thermal care (62.5%), infection prevention (74.8%), and feeding support (63.6%) were commonly practiced, but postnatal monitoring (27.7%) was less consistently observed. Differences were found when comparing the primary care level to the hospital (thermal: relative risk [RR] 0.48 [95% CI] 0.40-0.58; infection: RR 1.28 [1.11-1.47]; feeding: RR 0.49 [0.40-0.58]; postnatal: RR 3.17 [2.01-5.00]). In the primary care level, relative to newborns delivered by traditional birth attendants, those delivered by skilled attendants were more likely to receive postnatal monitoring (RR 1.59 [1.09-2. 32]), but other practices were not statistically different. Mothers' knowledge of danger signs was poor, with fever as the highest reported (44.8%) followed by not feeding well (41.0%), difficulty breathing (28.9%), reduced activity (27.7%), feeling cold (18.0%) and convulsions (11.2%).
   Conclusions: Addressing health service delivery in contexts affected by conflict is vital to reducing the global newborn mortality rate and reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. Gaps in intrapartum and postnatal care, particularly skilled care at birth, suggest a critical need to build the capacity of the existing health workforce while increasing access to skilled deliveries.

AB  - Psyttalia lounsburyi (Silvestri) and P. humilis (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were evaluated in California for their potential to control the invasive olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Psyttalia lounsburyi is a specialist on B. oleae while P. humilis also attacks other tephritid species. Field cage trials, conducted from 2006 to 2009, were used to compare P. lounsburyi and two populations of P. humilis (Kenya and Namibia) in California's interior valley and coastal regions. Both parasitoid species reproduced on B. oleae in all trials. Under similar abiotic conditions, offspring production per female was higher in P. humilis than in P. lounsburyi, suggesting that host specificity by P. lounsburyi does not confer a higher efficiency on B. oleae in cultivated olives. Two abiotic factors were shown to impact parasitoid efficiency. First, adult parasitoid survival was poor during periods of high summer temperatures, common to the olive production areas in California's interior valleys. Second, parasitism levels were lower on B. oleae larvae feeding in larger Ascolano cv. fruit than in smaller Manzanillo cv. fruit. Results are discussed relative to biological control of B. oleae in commercial olives and the usefulness of natural enemies specialized to attack fruit flies in wild olives compared with the larger cultivated olive fruit.

AB  - The effect of heat stress on celomocytes (leukocytes) from Eisenia hortensis was investigated by measuring the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). After culturing celomocytes at temperatures ranging from 4 degrees C (control) to 44 degrees C for 3-16 h, ROS levels were measured using a flow cytometric method employing dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123) for ROS detection and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) as a viability stain. Reproducibly we observed significant (p < 0.05) increases in ROS production and decreases in cell viability at temperatures of 28 degrees C and above. We then examined the effect of heat stress on histone phosphorylation employing antibodies specific for gamma H2AX as an indicator of histone modification. Celomocytes were incubated at temperatures ranging between 20 degrees C to 35 degrees C for 16 h and antibodies specific for phosphorylated serines in H2AX histones were employed through flow cytometric analysis. Comparing controls to heat-stressed samples using three separate assays reproducibly confirmed significant H2AX phosphorylation (p < 0.05). Collectively, these results emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate temperatures for rearing invertebrates in laboratory-based habitats and for culturing invertebrate cells when conducting in vitro assays in order to minimize oxidative stress. The possible cellular effects of heat stress in soil ecosystems associated with global warming events is also considered.

AB  - A potentially important physiological response to stress may be alteration in the gross regulation of energy metabolism. Different genotypes may respond differently to environmental stress, and the variation in these norms of reaction may be of key importance to the maintenance of genetic variation in metabolic traits. In the study reported here, a set of genetically defined lines of Drosophila melanogaster were exposed to four stresses (acetic acid, ethanol, starvation and thermal stress) in order to assess the magnitude of environmental effects and genotype x environment interactions. In addition to scoring metabolic traits, distributions of survival times under each stress were also quantified. Although both metabolic traits and survival times exhibited strong differences among genotypes, the correlations between enzyme traits and survival were generally weak. Many of the genetic correlations exhibit significant heterogeneity across environments. The results suggest that transient environmental stress may play an important role in the evolution of this highly intercorrelated set of metabolic traits.

AB  - Tri(ammonium) phosphate is a cheap and commercially available compound and is used as a fertilizer. This substance possesses a considerable amount of hydrogen. Recently, it has been found that the embedded hydrogen could be extracted from tri(ammonium) phosphate using a Ni/C heterocatalytic reaction. In this study, for the first time based on our knowledge, extraction of hydrogen from tri(ammonium) phosphate was performed electrolytically using Ni-incorporated and N-doped reduced graphene oxide. The proposed electrocatalyst was prepared by a simple one-pot synthesis procedure. Typically, a well-mixed nickel acetate tetrahydrate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture has been calcined under a nitrogen atmosphere at 700 degrees C. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed the formation of zero-valent nickel and reduced graphene oxide because of the clear appearance of the corresponding peaks. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses concluded the formation of graphene sheets functionalized by oxygenated groups and doped by pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen; however only pyrrolic nitrogen has been detected in Ni-free samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated the formation of multilayer reduced graphene oxide. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the prepared composite is an effective electrocatalyst for tri(ammonium) phosphate oxidation when the nickel content is optimized. The electrode containing 31.9 wt% Ni shows the maximum generated current density; however, clear oxidation peaks were observed with 40.2 wt% formulation. Overall, the study introduces tri(ammonium) phosphate as a model for a new class of hydrogen-rich, cheap and available substances for hydrogen generation using non-precious electrodes. Besides that, the novel functionalized and N-doped reduced graphene oxide synthesis methodology may attract attention due to its distinct simplicity compared to the reported procedures.

AB  - Improvement of the one-step production of L-ribose from ribitol using a recombinant Escherichia coli is described. The gene encoding the enzyme mannitol-1-dehydrogenase (MDH) from Apium graveolens has previously been codon-optimized, cloned into the constitutive pZuc10 vector, and expressed in E. coli. This MDH catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of mannitol to D-mannose and has the ability to convert several polyols to their L-sugar counterparts, including ribitol to L-ribose. Here, three rounds of directed evolution using libraries generated through error-prone PCR and screened using a dinitrosalicylate reagent. Mutants were selected for improved conversion of L-ribose, and the best mutant was isolated by combining two round 2 mutations. Libraries were also selected for thermal stability and screened at increasingly higher temperatures with each round of mutagenesis. An overall 19.2-fold improvement was observed with a final conversion of 46.6 +/- 1.7% and a productivity of 3.88 +/- 0.14 gL(-1) d(-1) in 50 mL shaken flasks at 34 degrees C. Further characterization of the mutants suggests that increased enzyme thermal stability and expression are responsible for the increase in L-ribose production. The mutant E. coli production strain isolated represents an improved system for large-scale production of L-ribose.

AB  - In the present work, a direct absorption solar humidifier (SH) based closed-air loop open-water loop humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination system is investigated experimentally. The selection of airto-water mass flow ratios for this configuration is unknown. Hence, this work characterizes the impact of feed flowrates and recirculating air flowrates to arrive at an operating state that influences the system efficiency for a determined solar thermal input. Performance curves that directly correlate the system's Gained output ratio (GOR) against humidity-based normalized gain are proposed to enable site selection and performance estimation. Water flowrate has optimal value for the SH-HDH desalination system highlighting a delicate balance between feed water and air flowrates that allows improved heat and mass transfer in the module while minimizing overall thermal losses. A comparison of the performance of the SH-HDH system with a conventional HDH system showed 18.4% improvement. A novel approach by storing the hot water rejected from SH-HDH configuration during onsun hours for the off-sun operation was considered. The estimated cost of water produced was ranging from 0.007 to 0.035 USD/liter, depending on received solar irradiation and rainfall at the location. Finally, a comparison of GORsolar, cost of desalination, and productivity of the present system are compared with the literature.

AB  - Gynogenesis is an effective technique for establishing pure line and validating possible chromosomal mode of sex determination in fish. As one of the major aquaculture fish historically cultured in China, bighead carp (Hypo-phthalmichthys nobilis) is famous for its market value of the head, but slow in its genetic improvement due to a long period of sexual maturation. In this study, females of bighead carp (F0 dams) with fast growth and bigger head were chose to induce first and second generation of meiotic gynogenesis (GF1 and GF2 for short) by using UV-irradiated heterologous sperm of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). On average, diploid gynogens were obtained by cold shock with a survival rate of 7.36% for GF1 and 6.24% for GF2, respectively. Results of morphology comparison and parentage assignment showed that all survival gynogens were genetically derived from the dams. Compared with their F0 parents, heterozygosities of GF1 and GF2 gynogens decreased by 42% and 60% when analyzed using 50 SSRs, and by 35% and 53% when using 1505 SNP markers, respectively. Sexing of the GF1 and GF2 gynogens showed all-female genotypes and phenotypes when examined by male-specific DNA markers, histology section and morphology of gonads. Overall, large number of meiotic gynogens have been successfully induced in two consecutive generations, providing valuable resources for fast domestication and genetic improvement in bighead carp. Our evidence of sex ratios in both GF1 and GF2 gynogens also strongly supports a proposed chromosomal mechanism of sex determination (XX/XY) for this large-size cyprinid fish.

AB  - The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals emphasize the need to better understand and propose solutions for the growing demand for resources and the generation of waste by anthropic systems at any scale and intensity. Although it can be considered as secondary importance problem, hundreds of tons of green coconut shell residues annually generated in the Brazilian coastal cities are transported and dumped in landfills, wasting their energy potential and resulting in economic and environmental problems - this approach is known as take, make, disposal, or "linear" production model. This work proposes a "circular" model by using the biomass from green coconut shells generated by the cities of Baixada Santista region as a raw material for briquettes production. Technicaloperational, environmental, and financial aspects are considered to assess the proposed "circular" model in comparison with the existing "linear" model. Results show that technical-operational aspects of the "circular" model are viable due to already existing technologies in the market that can be easily adapted for the purposes in converting green coconut shells into briquettes. The "circular" model proposed allows a reduction in greenhouse gases emission by similar to 40 thousand tons year(-1) when compared to the "linear" model, besides avoiding leachate generation. Furthermore, the 66% profitability, 195% rentability, and 6 months of investment payback suggest the financial viability of briquettes production. Together, all these indicators claim for public policies incentives and private investments to make the proposed "circular" model a reality, which is aligned with the objectives of 2030 agenda.

AB  - Material selection is a key step in product design and typically aims at identifying the most suitable material that meets product performance goals at minimum cost. In recent years research has been driven for developing sustainable solutions at competitive costs. This work evaluates the sustainability of advanced sandwich-structured composites for novel housing solutions. Five polymer matrix composite sandwich materials have been selected and compared concerning mechanical, thermal, acoustic and fire performance as well as cost and environmental impact, in order to study both the technical viability and the sustainability of lightweight solutions for prefabricated structural wall panels as well as for new housing; this included mechanical and fire testing of the selected materials. Subsequently, the thermal and acoustic properties of the alternatives were obtained. After performing a cost analysis and environmental assessment, the results of the tests and analyses led to a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); PROMETHEE II (preference ranking organizational method for enrichment evaluation) was used to identify the best alternative. Finally the proposed solution was compared with a typical brick house performance. Higher specific strength, better thermal insulation and lower environmental impacts arose as the main advantages of the proposed structures while acoustic properties and fire safety still need to be improved.

AB  - Beam facing elements of the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) Linear Particle Accelerator prototype (LIPAc) must stop 5-40 MeV D+ ions with a peak current of 125 mA. The duty cycle of the beam loading varies from 0.1% to 100% (CW), depending on the device, with the ions being stopped in the first hundreds microns of the beam facing material. For intermediate duty cycles up to CW, the thermal load can be considered a heat flux load on the boundary, but this approximation gets too conservative as the duty cycle is reduced because the thermal diffusion becomes more important. Instant heat flux produced by the beam can reach up to 3 GW/m(2) in elements such as the beam dump and slits during short times of hundredths of microseconds. In these cases, the accuracy of the volumetric heat generation is critical for obtaining realistic results.
   Meshfree Galerkin methods discretize a continuum using scattered nodes. As opposed to FEM, no predefined connectivity is needed between the nodes, so C (infinitely differentiable) locally supported shape functions can be used to approximate both the trial and the test functions. This feature makes these type of methods well suited for those problems where the domain experiences very large deformations or has high gradients of the state variables. Radial basis (RBF) and moving least squares (MLS) functions have been applied to the simulation of complex nonlinear mechanical problems involving large strains and displacements (e.g. flexible multibody dynamics). When compared to Finite Element Method (FEM), they present higher robustness under large strains and a better precision for the same computer calculation time when dealing with rough discretizations. All these results have been previously shown in Pl. The experience gained with those applications and the reproductivity characteristics of the shape functions suggest that the number of degrees of freedom needed for a precise analysis of shallow volumetric heat loads can be drastically reduced from that of the usual FEM approach.
   We describe the development and implementation of a coupled nonlinear thermo-mechanical formulation which takes into account the particularities of the meshfree discretization. Numerical experiments of beam facing elements are presented and compared with FEM results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The importance of ammonia in the fertilizer industry has been widely acknowledged over the past decades. In view of the upcoming increase of world population and, in turn, food demand, its production rate is likely to increase exponentially. However, considering the high dependence on natural resources and the intensive emission profile of the contemporary ammonia synthesis route, as well as the rigid environmental laws being enforced at a global level, the need to develop a sustainable alternative production route becomes quite imperative. A novel approach toward the synthesis of ammonia has been realized by means of non-thermal plasma technology under ambient operating conditions. Because the given technology is still under development, carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) is highly recommended as a means of identifying areas of the chemical process that could be potentially improved for an enhanced environmental performance. For that purpose, in the given research study, a process design for a small-scale plasma-assisted ammonia plant is being proposed and evaluated environmentally for specific design scenarios against the conventional ammonia synthesis employing steam reforming and water electrolysis for hydrogen generation. On the basis of the LCA results, the most contributory factor to the majority of the examined life cycle impact categories for the plasma-assisted process, considering an energy efficiency of 1.9 g NH3/kWh, is the impact of the power consumption of the plasma reactor with its share ranging from 15% to 73%. On a comparative basis, the plasma process powered by hydropower has demonstrated a better overall environmental profile over the two benchmark cases for the scenarios of a 5% and 15% NH3 yield and an energy recovery of 5% applicable to all examined plasma power consumption values.

AB  - Carbon dioxide levels in many estuaries fluctuate and, in several cases, reach extremes much higher than those predicted for oceans by the end of the century. Moreover, estuaries are characterized by natural fluctuations in salinity, and reduced pH, from increased pCO(2), exposes estuarine organisms to multiple stresses. Although the effects of low pH on the reproduction of several marine copepod species have been assessed, studies examining effects of pH in estuarine copepod species are extremely scarce. Here, we aim at understanding the reproductive response of Gladioferens pectinatus to the stress posed by both salinity and pH. G. pectinatus was exposed to salinities 2 and 10, at four different pH levels each. Our results show no impairment in the brood size, embryonic development time and hatching success under low pH levels at either salinities. However, at salinity 2, the percentage of nauplii growing into adults significantly decreased at low pH, whereas at salinity 10, no major effect was observed. We argue that the combination of osmoregulation and acidity induced stress response can affect the development of nauplii and copepodites, as well as adult recruitment, likely due to energy reallocation and molting impairment. We also argue that resilience and phenotypic plasticity highly influence the ability of different copepod species and populations to reproduce and grow under stressful combinations of environmental parameters. This study points out the importance of understanding the effects of multiple stresses or parameters on the adaptability of organisms to water acidification.

AB  - Astrobiology strives to increase our knowledge on the origin, evolution and distribution of life, on Earth and beyond. In the past centuries, life has been found on Earth in environments with extreme conditions that were expected to be uninhabitable. Scientific investigations of the underlying metabolic mechanisms and strategies that lead to the high adaptability of these extremophile organisms increase our understanding of evolution and distribution of life on Earth. Life as we know it depends on the availability of liquid water. Exposure of organisms to defined and complex extreme environmental conditions, in particular those that limit the water availability, allows the investigation of the survival mechanisms as well as an estimation of the possibility of the distribution to and survivability on other celestial bodies of selected organisms. Space missions in low Earth orbit (LEO) provide access for experiments to complex environmental conditions not available on Earth, but studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of adaption to these hostile conditions and on the limits of life cannot be performed exclusively in space experiments. Experimental space is limited and allows only the investigation of selected endpoints. An additional intensive ground based program is required, with easy to access facilities capable to simulate space and planetary environments, in particular with focus on temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition and short wavelength solar ultraviolet radiation (UV). DLR Cologne operates a number of Planetary and Space Simulation facilities (PSI) where microorganisms from extreme terrestrial environments or known for their high adaptability are exposed for mechanistic studies. Space or planetary parameters are simulated individually or in combination in temperature controlled vacuum facilities equipped with a variety of defined and calibrated irradiation sources. The PSI support basic research and were recurrently used for pre-flight test programs for several astrobiological space missions. Parallel experiments on ground provided essential complementary data supporting the scientific interpretation of the data received from the space missions.

AB  - Robotic machining is starting to feature in the industry thanks to its high flexibility, adaptability, large workspace and low cost. In fact, many studies have already confirmed that robotic machining can be a real cost saving and flexible alternative to large scale conventional CNC machines, due to the aforesaid advantages. However, robotic machining operations are usually carried out in open environments in industrial companies, making conventional cooling systems (flood coolants such as neat oils or water-soluble oils) not directly applicable to them. Thus, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the possible implementation of different non-liquid alternative coolants such as gaseous nitrogen (N-2), air, carbon dioxide (CO2) or argon (Ar) into robotic machining with the purpose of improving the current capability of this technology. To that end, different round turning tests were conducted on the 34CrNiMo6 alloyed steel, where several cooling conditions were applied: cryogenic nitrogen gas (2.5 bar), compressed air (2.5, 6.9 and 8 bar), cold compressed air (6.9 bar) and flood cooling (1 L/min). Results were compared against dry machining. Thereby, the study proved the analysed non-liquid alternative coolants to be a great option for robotic machining, since they were able to improve both the machining performance and productivity of dry machining. On the other hand, compressed air showed to be the most cost-effective solution among the alternative coolants, due to the high purchase price of the nitrogen (N-2).

TI  - A New Grade of High Thermal Conductivity Tool Steel for Press Hardening Tools
T2  - HOT SHEET METAL FORMING OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE STEEL CHS2 (4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE)
LA  - English
CP  - 4th International Conference on Hot Sheet Metal Forming of High-Performance Steel (CHS2 2013)
AB  - High thermal conductivity HTCS (R) tool steels were developed by the company ROVALMA, S.A. in the years 2005-2006 in response to the new requirements demanded by tool steels for its use in the press hardening process. The HTCS (R) tool steels are characterized by their very high thermal conductivity values, which can reach up to 60 W/m.K, and their high hardenability, presenting hardness levels up to 60 HRc. Mentioned characteristics make these materials ideal for tools in the press hardening process. They allow increasing the productivity through reduction of the cycle time as well as increasing die durability through a high wear surface resistance, two major requirements the tool materials for this process are subjected to. The HTCS (R) tool steels respond to the requirements demanded by different press hardening processes and parameters, such as direct and indirect process, production of coated or uncoated sheet, tailored components, long or short series production, complex part geometries, etc. They have been successfully introduced to the market and are attracting the press hardening industry to an increasing extent.
   In this contribution, second generation HTCS (R) materials will be introduced presenting further increases of thermal conductivities at higher hardness levels, thereby providing increased wear resistance. These new materials provide furthermore advantages in the manufacturing of the tool considered that they can be supplied in a soft state for machining and that subsequently, only a nitriding treatment is necessary to increase the hardness of the base material to the very core up to 60 HRc and that of the surface to more than 1000 HV. This allows avoiding the hardening process and hard machining, saving time and significantly reducing the tool manufacturing costs, compared to die manufacturing with conventional tool steels.
   Thermal properties, hardness evolution through the nitriding process, and weldability, amongst others, have been evaluated.

AB  - Thermal stability of lysozyme in aqueous buffer solutions was studied at selected temperatures (73-100 degrees C), pH values (4.2-9.0) and levels of sucrose (0%, 5%, 15%) and sodium chloride (0, 0.1M, 1M). The results, fitted to a first-order model and expressed in terms of decimal reduction time (D), inactivation rate constant (k), decimal reduction temperature (z) and Arrhenius activation energy (E(a)) indicated that lysozyme was most stable at pH 5.2, and thermal stability decreased sharply as the pH increased to 9.0. A regression equation for prediction of k as a function of pH and temperature was derived, with the best fit obtained for the model in the pH range of 5.2-7.2 (adjusted multiple r(2)=0.98). At pH 7.2 and 9.0, sodium chloride had a clear stabilizing effect against heat inactivation of lysozyme. Sucrose stabilized lysozyme against heat inactivation at 75 degrees C but not at 91 degrees C.
   Thermal inactivation kinetics of lysozyme and its potential to prevent or delay microbial growth were investigated in beer. Lysozyme at concentrations of 10 and 50ppm appeared to delay growth of the spoilage bacteria L. brevis and P. damnosus in beer, but did not prevent growth of the bacteria.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach of evaluation of the absorption line black body distribution function (ALBDF) for a mixture of gases. Currently published correlations, which are used to reproduce the ALBDF, treat only single gases.
   Design/methodology/approach - A discrete form of the ALBDF is generated using line by line (LBL) calculations. The latest spectroscopic database HITEMP 2010 is used for the generation of the absorption coefficient histogram, which is cumulated later in order to produce a tabulated form of the ALBDF. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) statistical method is employed for the reproduction of the ALBDF. Interpolation property of the POD allows to reproduce the ALBDF for arbitrary gas mixture parameters.
   Findings - POD proved to possess optimal interpolation properties.
   Results obtained by using POD are in very good agreement with LBL integration. Research limitations/implications - One have to be aware that the model generated with the POD method can be used only within the range of parameters used to build the model. The POD does not perform any property extrapolation. The model is limited to a mixture of two gases, namely CO2 and H2O. Expanding the number of gases used in the mixture may lead to a relatively large matrix system, which is difficult to process with the POD approach.
   Practical implications - The presented approach can be used to produce absorption coefficients values and their weights, which can be applied in the gas radiative properties description using the weighted sum of gray gas (WSGG) concept. The proposed model can be used with any radiative transfer equation solver which employs the WSGG approach.
   Originality/value - For the first time, radiative properties of gas mixtures are reproduced using the POD approach.

AB  - Despite the pressing need for accurate forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change, commonly used modeling approaches exhibit mixed performance because they omit many important aspects of how organisms respond to spatially and temporally variable environments. Integrating models based on organismal phenotypes at the physiological, performance, and fitness levels can improve model performance. We summarize current limitations of environmental data and models and discuss potential remedies. The paper reviews emerging techniques for sensing environments at fine spatial and temporal scales, accounting for environmental extremes, and capturing how organisms experience the environment. Intertidal mussel data illustrate biologically important aspects of environmental variability. We then discuss key challenges in translating environmental conditions into organismal performance including accounting for the varied timescales of physiological processes, for responses to environmental fluctuations including the onset of stress and other thresholds, and for how environmental sensitivities vary across lifecycles. We call for the creation of phenotypic databases to parameterize forecasting models and advocate for improved sharing of model code and data for model testing. We conclude with challenges in organismal biology that must be solved to improve forecasts over the next decade.

AB  - Fluid-absent melting experiments on a biotite (20 wt.%) and hornblende (2 wt.%) bearing tonalitic gneiss were conducted at 6 kbar (900-975-degrees-C), 10 kbar (875-1075-degrees-C), and 14 kbar (950-975-degrees-C) to study melt productivity from weakly peraluminous quartzofeldspathic metamorphic rocks. At 6 kbar, biotite dehydration-melting is completed at 975-degrees-C via incongruent melting reactions that produce orthopyroxene, two oxides, and approximately 25 wt.% granitic melt. At 6 kbar, hornblende disappears at 900-degrees-C, probably in reaction with biotite. At 10 kbar, biotite dehydration-melting produces < 10 wt.% melt up to 950-degrees-C via incongruent melting reactions that produce orthopyroxene, garnet, and granitic melt. Hornblende disappears in the same temperature interval either by resorption or by reaction with biotite. Widespread biotite dehydration-melting occurs between 950 and 975-degrees-C and produces orthopyroxene, two oxides, and approximately 20 wt.% fluorine-rich (up to 0.31 wt.%) granitic melt. At 14 kbar only a trace of melt is present at 950-degrees-C, and the amounts of hornblende and biotite are virtually the same as in the starting material. At 975-degrees-C, hornblende is gone and approximately 10 wt.% granitic melt is produced by melting of both biotite and hornblende.
   Our results show that hornblende-bearing assemblages cannot go through dehydration-melting on their own (although they can in combination with biotite) if the Ca content in the source rock is too low to stabilize clinopyroxene. In such rocks, hornblende will either resorb or melt by reaction with biotite. Under fluid-absent conditions, intrusion of hot, mantle-derived magmas into the lower crust is necessary to initiate widespread dehydration-melting in rocks with compositions similar to those discussed here. We argue that the high thermal stability of biotite in our starting material is caused mainly by the incorporation of fluorine. The relatively high F content in biotite in the starting material (0.47 wt.%) suggests that the rock has experienced dehydroxylation in its past. F enrichment by a previous fluid-absent partial melting event is excluded because of the lack of phases such as orthopyroxene and garnet which would have been produced. Our experiments show that the dehydration-melting of such F-enriched biotite produces F-rich granitic liquids, with compositions within the range of A-types granites, and leaves behind a granulitic residue dominated by orthopyroxene, quartz, and plagioclase. This study therefore supports the notion that A-type granites can be generated by H2O-undersaturated melting of rocks of tonalitic composition (Creaser et al., 1991), but does not require that these source rocks should be residual after a previous melting event.

AB  - Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), also known as electrolyzed water (EW), is a sustainable and environment-friendly disinfectant, which can comply with food safety regulations. In this study, HOCl was produced through HCl electrolysis using an acrylic electrolyzing reactor without a diaphragm between iridium oxide electrodes coated with titanium. The Box-Behnken design (BBD) was adopted to study the effects of feed water flow rate (FR), pH, temperature, electric voltage, acid concentration (AC), and acid dosing pump stroke (APS) on HOCl production measured as available chlorine concentration (ACC). Then, optimum parameters were explored using response surface methodology (RSM). The proposed quadratic models defined the relationship between HOCl production and the process variables. The models were statistically significant as shown by analysis of variance. The optimum operating parameters for HOCl production were 6.5 L/min, pH 7.5 at 20 degrees C, 3.8 volts, 6% AC, and APS at 3%. The FR, AC, and APS were significant parameters, and no substantial effect was observed for pH and temperature of feed water or the variation in current-voltage. High FR caused a conspicuous drop, and the high voltage showed a slight increase in ACC. However, an increase in AC and APS significantly enhanced the ACC, although the pH dropped below 5.0-6.5, indicating the presence of other chlorine-based compounds apart from HOCl. RSM model validation through experimental results indicated that the proposed model could effectively provide a relationship between ACC and process variables. Additionally, an artificial neural network model was tested to predict the ACC that showed good fitness to the experimental results.

AB  - Among pathogens, L. monocytogenes has the capability to persist on Food Processing Environment (FPE), first of all posing safety issues, then economic impact on productivity. The aim of this work was to determine the influence of biofilm forming-ability and molecular features on the persistence of 19 Listeria monocytogenes isolates obtained from FPE, raw and processed products of a cold-smoked salmon processing plant. To verify the phenotypic and genomic correlations among the isolates, different analyses were employed: serotyping, Clonal Complex (CC), core genome Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (cgMLST) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) clustering, and evaluation of the presence of virulence- and persistence-associated genes. From our results, the biofilm formation was significantly higher (*P < 0.05) at 37 degrees C, compared to 30 and 12 degrees C, suggesting a temperature-dependent behaviour. Moreover, the biofilm-forming ability showed a strain-specific trend, not correlated with CC or with strains persistence. Instead, the presence of internalin (inL), Stress Survival Islet (SSI) and resistance to erythromycin (ermC) genes was correlated with the ability to produce biofilms. Our data demonstrate that the genetic profile influences the adhesion capacity and persistence of L. monocytogenes in food processing plants and could be the result of environmental adaptation in response to the external selective pressure.

AB  - Replicate lineages of the bacteriophage phi X 174 adapted to growth at high temperature on either of two hosts exhibited high rates of identical, independent substitutions. Typically, a dozen or more substitutions accumulated in the 5.4-kilobase genome during propagation. Across the entire data set of nine lineages, 119 independent substitutions occurred at 68 nucleotide sites. Over half of these substitutions, accounting far one third of the sites, were identical with substitutions in other lineages. Some convergent substitutions were specific to the host used for phage propagation, but others occurred across both hosts. Continued adaptation of an evolved phage at high temperature, but on the other host, led to additional changes that included reversions of previous substitutions. Phylogenetic reconstruction using the complete genome sequence not only failed to recover the correct evolutionary history because of these convergent changes, but the true history was rejected as being a significantly inferior fit to the data. Replicate lineages subjected to similar environmental challenges showed similar rates of substitution and similar rates of fitness improvement across corresponding times of adaptation. Substitution rates and fitness improvements were higher during the initial period of adaptation than during a later period, except when the host was changed.

AB  - In this mini-review, we discuss how biologging technology can be used to detect, understand, and forecast species' responses to climate change. We review studies of phenology, thermal biology, and microhabitat selection as examples to illustrate the utility of a biologging approach in terrestrial and aquatic species. These examples show that biologgers can be used to identify and predict behavioral and physiological responses to climatic variation and directional climate change, as well as to extreme weather events. While there is still considerable debate as to whether phenotypic plasticity is sufficient to facilitate species' responses to climate change or whether responses to short-term climate variability are predictive of climate change response, understanding the scope and nature of plasticity is an important step toward answering these questions. One advantage of the biologging approach is that it can facilitate the measurement of traits at the level of the individual, permitting research that investigates the degree to which physiology and behavior are plastic. As such, combining biologging withmetrics of fitness can provide insight into how plasticity might confer population and species resilience to climate change. Increased use of biologgers in experimental manipulations will also yield important insight into how phenotypic flexibility allows some animals to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Although biologging studies to date have mostly functioned inmeasuring phenotypic responses to short-termclimate variability, we argue that integrating biologging technology into long-term monitoring programs will be instrumental in documenting and understanding ecological responses to climate change.

AB  - The existence of different mantle domains exposed in ocean-continent transition zones provides a framework for understanding the generation of ultramafic seafloor along magma-poor rifted margins. In this study we present detailed petrological and geochemical data on peridotites from the Eastern Central Alps ophiolites in Switzerland and Italy to identify different mantle domains, to estimate the extent of refertilization, and to test whether refertilization is associated with a thermal signature that has important implications for geophysical interpretations of ocean-continent transitions. The compositions of clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and spinel clearly reflect the different mantle domains. Relative to clinopyroxenes from spinel peridotites, clinopyroxenes from plagioclase peridotites have lower Na2O and Sr contents, but higher middle to heavy rare earth element ratios and Zr concentrations, and different Sc-V relationships. Spinels in plagioclase peridotites have higher TiO2 and lower Mg-numbers compared with those in spinel peridotites. Mineral-mineral trace element partitioning suggests that spinel peridotites equilibrated at substantially lower temperatures than plagioclase peridotites. The temperature difference between the spinel and plagioclase peridotites indicates an important thermal boundary between the two. The geochemical data show systematic spatial variations. A heterogeneous, 'subcontinental domain' with no syn-rift melt imprint is separated from a 'refertilized domain' that exhibits a complex history of regional-scale melt infiltration and melt-rock reaction, which has erased most of the ancient history. Simple calculations suggest that up to 12% of mid-ocean ridge basalt-type melt can be stored in plagioclase peridotite, relative to a depleted residue. Such a 'lithospheric sponge' provides an explanation for the fertile compositions of the peridotites and the rare occurrence of volcanic rocks in magma-poor rifted margins. We suggest that magma-poor vs magma-rich margins are largely determined by the efficiency of melt extraction and not so much by melt generation processes, given a similar initial composition of the upwelling mantle. It is proposed that refertilization increases textural diversity and chemical heterogeneity related to shallow crystallization in the mantle lithosphere.

AB  - We study in detail the mechanism of baryon and lepton asymmetry generation in the framework of the MSM (an extension of the Standard Model by three singlet fermions with masses smaller than the electroweak scale). We elucidate the issue of CP-violation in the model and define the phase relevant for baryogenesis. We clarify the question of quantum-mechanical coherence, essential for the lepton asymmetry generation in singlet fermion oscillations and compute the relevant damping rates. The range of masses and couplings of singlet leptons which can lead to successful baryogenesis is determined. The conditions which ensure survival of primordial (existing above the electroweak temperatures) asymmetries in different leptonic numbers are analysed. We address the question whether CP-violating reactions with lepton number non-conservation can produce leptonic asymmetry below the sphaleron freeze-out temperature. This asymmetry, if created, leads to resonant production of dark matter sterile neutrinos. We show that the requirement that a significant lepton asymmetry be produced puts stringent constraints on the properties of a pair of nearly degenerate singlet fermions, which can be tested in accelerator experiments. In this region of parameters the.MSM provides a common mechanism for production of baryonic matter and dark matter in the universe. We analyse different fine-tunings of the model and discuss possible symmetries of the MSM Lagrangian that can lead to them.

AB  - A study is reported in which the possible occurrence of a significant relationship between the experience of parenting, in a large series of parent-offspring pairs from 67 multigenerational families, aged 17-90 yr was investigated. The sample generated 448 parent-offspring pairs. Both parents and offsprings, independently of each other, completed the EMBU (a Swedish acronym for 'early memories of parental rearing'). Consistently with other studies in the literature, in which different approaches were used, several significant correlations were found, especially concerning the experience of emotional warmth in fathers and a similar experience both in sons and daughters. Correlations between the experience of mothers and those of offsprings proved to be weaker and mostly refer to dysfunctional rearing attitudes (overprotection and rejection). Even though, the reported findings add to the body of knowledge as to a possible intergenerational transmission of parenting, they cannot answer the question concerning the extent to which temperamental characteristics contribute to the correlations which were presented. Suggestions for further studies to elucidate this and other relevant issues are therefore, warranted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - When populations experience substantial variation in environmental conditions, they may evolve phenotypic plasticity in response to these varying selection pressures. Evolutionary theory predicts differentiation in the level of phenotypic plasticity among different habitats. We evaluated temperature-induced phenotypic responses in juvenile growth rate in natural populations of the springtail Orchesella cincta, inhabiting forest and heathland. These habitats typically co-occur but differ strongly with respect to, for example, thermal regime, relative humidity, and structure. Offspring of females from the two habitats were reared at different temperatures in climate rooms and the temperature response of juvenile growth rate and egg size was measured. We found a habitat-specific difference in plasticity of juvenile growth rate. The reaction norms of the forest populations were steeper than the reaction norms for heath populations at two replicated sampling sites. Egg weight itself was demonstrated to be a plastic trait with a higher egg weight at low temperatures, but the thermal response did not differ between habitats. We conclude that these populations have diverged due to strong local natural selection. Our results support the argument that the level of phenotypic plasticity itself can be under selection and that differentiation in reaction norms can occur even in neighbouring habitats with no barrier to gene flow.

AB  - Positive parental effects, defined as the strategies displayed by sardine Sardina pilchardus adults to increase the survival of eggs and larvae, were studied off the coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) by monthly sampling of eggs and larvae in Ria de Vigo, over a period of 4 yr. Two different parental strategies were observed over the spawning period: temporal variations in spawning intensity, and variation of egg quality. Sardine spawn outside the upwelling season, to avoid offshore transport of eggs and larvae to where food is less abundant. There is a negative correlation between the duration of embryonic development and egg organic content. Sardine employ a parental strategy that adapts the biochemical composition of eggs to the evolution of the temperature in the area during the spawning season. Eggs of higher organic content are produced in the coldest months, thereby compensating for the delay in embryonic development time due to low temperatures. This also has the effect of enhancing larval survival.

AB  - The thermal and pH resistance of five representative salmonid fish pathogens were tested to examine the efficacy of procedures currently used for processing fish viscera to be incorporated into fish diets. Aeromonas salmonicida, Mycobacterium chelonei, Renibacterium salmoninarum, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) were suspended in buffered medium at pH 7.0 or 4.0, or in fish silage at pH 4.0 and their survival at selected temperatures was determined. When suspended in medium at pH 7.0, A. salmonicida, M. chelonei and IHNV were sensitive to temperatures in a range of 40-60-degrees-C. Renibacterium salmoninarum and IPNV were both more resistant to that temperature range in the neutral pH medium; however, each was inactivated by conditions simulating pasteurization. The combination of heat and low pH currently used for the processing and pasteurization of fish viscera should ensure that the resulting fish food is safe against spreading infectious diseases.

AB  - Nitrogen monoxide (NO), a major air pollutant, can be directly used as a precursor for nitrogen fertilizer production as long as it is collected in a pure form. In this study, an innovative dual fuel cell system was designed for the efficient capture and collection of pure NO (X) from industrial flue gases as well as for electricity generation. The system consisted of a methanol/ferric-EDTA fuel cell for NO (X) capture and a ferrous-EDTA-NO/air fuel cell for captured NO (X) collection. In a separation operation, the maximum power densities, which were obtained at pH 2 and 20 A degrees C, were 785 and 1,840 mW m(-2) in FC1 and FC2, respectively, and increased with temperature. The highest overall outputs from FC1 and FC2 were measured at pH 2, a result that is possibly attributable to the redox potential difference between the anolyte and catholyte in the fuel cells. In the combined operation, ferrous-EDTA-NO prepared in the cathode compartment of FC1 was successfully and efficiently converted to ferric-EDTA and NO in the anode compartment of FC2. The present approach was considered advantageous for advanced NO (X) reuse technology in the respect that valuable products, such as fertilizer, could be produced.

AB  - Successful biological control requires detailed knowledge about host preferences of the released parasitoid, because the presence of alternative hosts may affect the control of the target pest. The objective of this work was therefore to evaluate host preferences of Telenomus podisi Ashmead among the eggs of three stink bug species: Dichelops melacanthus Dallas, Euschistus heros Fabricius, and Podisus nigrispinus Dallas (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). Three independent experiments were carried out to study host preferences among the following: (1) E. heros, D. melacanthus dallas, and P. nigrispinus (bioassay 1); (2) E. heros and D. melacanthus (bioassay 2); and (3) D. melacanthus and P. nigrispinus (bioassay 3). A single bioassay (bioassay 4) was carried out to evaluate the egg size of E. heros, D. melacanthus, and P. nigrispinus. Two more bioassays were carried out: bioassay 5 to study the biological characteristics of T. podisi reared on E. heros, D. melacanthus, and P. nigrispinus eggs, and bioassay 6 to study the morphological characters of T. podisi reared on those different host eggs. Overall, T. podisi consistently preferred eggs of D. melacanthus to those of the other studied hosts, due to probably their better nutritional value; hypothesis that is supported by the fast T. podisi development and bigger parasitoids when reared on D. melacanthus and P. nigrispinus eggs. This allows suggesting that neither pre-imaginal conditioning nor associative learning nor alpha-conditioning are relevant to T. podisi parasitism. Thus, E. heros eggs could be successfully used for mass rearing of this parasitoid for successive generations since it would not affect its parasitism on other species of the Pentatomidae family in the field.

AB  - Emerging from the energy crisis of 2008 in South Africa, climate change concerns and the global desire to reduce high ozone-depleting emissions, renewable energy sources like biogas are gaining wide acceptance in most localities for heating and electricity. The paucity of feedstock varieties is a major challenge plaguing the sustainability of this sector. Biomethane potential, biodegradability and degradation kinetics of organic substrates are essential for assessing the suitability of feedstocks for methane generation and the overall performance of the anaerobic digestion process in biogas plants. Waste from the vegetable okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) is a novel substrate; its biodegradability and degradation dynamics in biomethane production are largely unstudied, and were therefore the aims of this research. The substrate was digested for 25 days at the mesophilic condition and the biomethane potential data were recorded. Measured data of methane yield and the elemental composition of the substrate were used to fit five models (modified Gompertz, Stannard, transference function, logistic and first-order models) to predict degradation parameters and determine biodegradability of the substrate, respectively. Low lag phase (0.143 d), positive kinetic constant (0.2994/d) and the model fitness indicator (<10) showed that transference and first-order kinetic models predicted the methane yield better than did other growth functions. The experimental methane yield was 270.98 mL/gVS, theoretical methane yields were 444.48 mL/gVS and 342.06 mL/gVS and model simulation ranged from 267.5 mL/gVS to 270.89 mL/gVS. With a prediction difference of 0.03-1.28%, all growth functions acceptably predicted the kinetics of A. esculentus waste. The findings of this study offer information on this novel substrate important for its use in large-scale biogas production.
   Significance:
   Growing interest in biogas technology as an alternative energy source for both South African rural dwellers and industries, has mounted enormous pressure on known feedstocks, and instigated the search for novel substrates.
   Our study shows that okra waste is a viable feedstock for biogas production.
   The suitability of the first-order kinetic model over other models in predicting okra waste degradation was highlighted.

AB  - Biogerontology has traditionally focused on demographic senescence by searching for environmental manipulations and genes that extend life span. Relatively little is known about age-specific changes in functional traits and how demographic and functional senescence are genetically (co)regulated. To determine whether functional and demographic senescence have a similar genetic basis, we measured genotypic variation in the age-related change in cold-stress resilience and age-specific mortality using ten inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold-stress resilience was measured as the average time for a population of flies to recover from a chill coma after being placed on melting ice for 6 h. We found genotypic variation in both sexes for chill-coma resilience, for the rate at which it declines with age, for longevity, for the initial mortality rate, and for the rate at which mortality increases with age. However, there was no genotypic correlation between any of these functional and demographic parameters. These results suggest that deterioration of at least some functional traits might be genetically independent of mortality patterns. Models for the genetic basis of senescence may do well to distinguish between quality and quantity of life in terms of their genetic architectures, and the way selection acts upon these two age-related factors.

AB  - To assess the relationship between productivity and office building design and operation, we analyzed the Building Assessment Survey Evaluation (BASE) data, a sample of 4,326 respondents in 100 randomly-selected U.S. office buildings. Associations were tested using proportional odds regression models and generalized estimating equations. Fifty-four percent of the respondents were defined as having high susceptibility (presence of doctor-diagnosed allergy, asthma or migraine), accounting for 71% of the 2,235 total lost days. We found. after adjustment for susceptibility and job dissatisfaction, significant association between lost days and the following workspace variables: crowdedness, any operable windows, more than 10 feet to a window, recent water damage within 15 feet of workstation, temperature above or below 72-73 degrees F. past fire damage, and recent renovations. Daily vacuuming vs. less frequent vacuuming was shown to be protective, as was bright light. Results underscore the importance of keeping an uncrowded, moisture-free, temperate, and clean workspace.

AB  - Subduction drives plate tectonics and builds continental crust, and as such is one of the most important processes for shaping the present-day Earth. Here we review both theory and observations for the viability and style of Archean subduction. High Archean mantle temperature gave low mantle viscosity and affected plate strength and plate buoyancy. This resulted in slower or intermittent subduction, either of which resulted in Earth cooling profiles that fit available data. Some geological observations are interpreted as subduction related, including an "arc" signature in various igneous rocks (suggesting burial of surface material to depths of 50-100 km), structural thrust belts and dipping seismic reflectors, and high-pressure-low-temperature and low-pressure-high-temperature paired metamorphic belts. Combined geo-dynamical and geochemical evidence suggests that subduction operated in the Archean, although not, as often assumed, as shallow flat subduction. Instead, subduction was more episodic in nature, with more intermittent plate motion than in the Phanerozoic.

AB  - Non-technical summary Negative emissions technologies (NETs) have received increasing interest in recent years as a potential part of a portfolio of measures to address anthropogenic climate change, in particular following the 2015 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement and the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report 'Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C'. This increasing significance for global climate policy is faced with a multitude of open questions regarding, among others, the geopolitical implications of large-scale use of NETs. This paper outlines what we can learn for the possible geopolitical futures of NETs from existing international 'green' approaches. Technical summary We contribute to assessing political implications of NET scenarios, addressing the following question: What are potential geopolitical challenges, conflicts, and consequences of a large-scale deployment of three NETs, namely afforestation, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and direct air capture and carbon storage (DACCS)? We turn to the two cases of renewable energies and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation for answers. We find that, first, not only afforestation, but also BECCS and even DACCS would have a geopolitical impact due to their requirements of territory - in the latter two cases, for instance, due to requirements for appropriate carbon storage space. Second, the material requirements of various NETs might also impact geopolitical constellations and induce conflict, providing certain countries and regions of the world with new leverage in the case of large-scale deployment, for instance those which can provide raw materials for fertilizer (for afforestation and BECCS) or energy generation (for DACCS). Third, discursive construction of space and identity might lead to very interesting new patterns of contestation, for instance if specific nation-states can successfully construct an identity of front-running climate protectors and use this to put pressure on other states. Social media summary What might be geopolitical implications of using NETs on a large scale to counteract anthropogenic climate change?

AB  - Purpose Napier grass, one of the high yield perennial energy crops can be grown on marginal lands with minimal inputs, but with increased soil carbon sequestration in the southeastern US. The sustainable use of Napier grass for bioenergy applications such as combined heat and power at low cost to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions needs to be investigated. Methods In this study, an integrated life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis approach were used to estimate the energy use, environmental emissions, and minimum selling price (MSP) of electricity and thermal heat produced from Napier grass and compared with a coal or natural gas-fired combined heat and power generation plant. Results and discussion The use of Napier grass as a feedstock decreased the global warming potential (GWP) of the medium-sized CHP (i.e., 13 MWe) plant by 73-92 % compared to that of a coal and natural gas-fired CHP plants. Other environmental impacts were also reduced by 24-100 %. Eutrophication was the only impact comparable to that of the coal-fired CHP plant. The energy return on investment (EROI) was around 5:1. The minimum selling price of electricity generated from the CHP plant was US$0.05-0.4 MJ(e)(-1) (US$0.13-0.18 kWh(-1)) considering the credits for steam production, renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC), and carbon footprint from the fossil fuel-based electricity generation. Conclusions Although the pelleting of Napier grass for the CHP plant increased the cost and GHG emissions by 38% and 55% over the non-pelleted system, the pelleting process can ensure consistent quality and uninterrupted supply of the feedstock for heat and power generation.

AB  - In this work, tunnelling junction sensors (TJS) are proposed for monitoring the curing of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP). Tunnelling junction sensors are very sensitive to temperature changes; therefore they are suitable for this application. TJS are manufactured by Low-Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (LPCVD) and electronically characterized to obtain their V(I) diagram. One sensor is embedded on a carbon-epoxy plate for measuring temperature evolution during composite's autoclave cycle. By means of a temperature-voltage-time curve, the evolution of sensor's signal related to temperature changes can be tracked. The main goals are to verify the viability to apply this technology to composite's curing process and to provide a first approach of the initial state of the composite plate by verifying the temperatures at each curing stage. Both purposes were achieved and help to better understand the composite polymerization process, which has a strong influence on the composite's mechanical performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global warming challenges the persistence of local populations, not only through heat-induced stress, but also through indirect biotic changes. We study the interactive effects of temperature, competition and parasitism in the water flea Daphnia magna. We carried out a common garden experiment monitoring the dynamics of Daphnia populations along a temperature gradient. Halfway through the experiment, all populations became infected with the ectoparasite Amoebidium parasiticum, enabling us to study the interactive effects of temperature and parasite dynamics.
   We combined Integral Projection Models with epidemiological models, parameterized using the experimental data on the performance of individuals within dynamic populations. This enabled us to quantify the contribution of different vital rates and epidemiological parameters to population fitness across temperatures and Daphnia clones originating from two latitudes.
   Interactions between temperature and parasitism shaped competition, where Belgian clones performed better under infection than Norwegian clones. Infected Daphnia populations performed better at higher than at lower temperatures, mainly due to an increased host capability of reducing parasite loads. Temperature strongly affected individual vital rates, but effects largely cancelled out on a population-level. In contrast, parasitism strongly reduced fitness through consistent negative effects on all vital rates. As a result, temperature-mediated parasitism was more important than the direct effects of temperature in shaping population dynamics. Both the outcome of the competition treatments and the observed extinction patterns support our modelling results.
   Our study highlights that shifts in biotic interactions can be equally or more important for responses to warming than direct physiological effects of warming, emphasizing that we need to include such interactions in our studies to predict the competitive ability of natural populations experiencing global warming.

AB  - There is a close analogy between statistical thermodynamics and the evolution of allele frequencies under mutation, selection and random drift. Wright's formula for the stationary distribution of allele frequencies is analogous to the Boltzmann distribution in statistical physics. Population size, 2N, plays the role of the inverse temperature, 1/kT, and determines the magnitude of random fluctuations. Log mean fitness, log((W) over bar), tends to increase under selection, and is analogous to a (negative) energy; a potential function, U, increases under mutation in a similar way. An entropy, S(H), can be defined which measures the deviation from the distribution of allele frequencies expected under random drift alone; the sum G = E[log((W) over bar) + U +S(H)] gives a free fitness that increases as the population evolves towards its stationary distribution. Usually, we observe the distribution of a few quantitative traits that depend on the frequencies of very many alleles. The mean and variance of such traits are analogous to observable quantities in statistical thermodynamics. Thus, we can define an entropy, S(Omega), which measures the volume of allele frequency space that is consistent with the observed trait distribution. The stationary distribution of the traits is exp[2N(log((W) over bar) + U + S(Omega))]; this applies with arbitrary epistasis and dominance. The entropies S(Omega), S(H) are distinct, but converge when there are so many alleles that traits fluctuate close to their expectations. Populations tend to evolve towards states that can be realised in many ways (i.e., large S(Omega)), which may lead to a substantial drop below the adaptive peak; we illustrate this point with a simple model of genetic redundancy. This analogy with statistical thermodynamics brings together previous ideas in a general framework, and justifies a maximum entropy approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits.

AB  - Thermal sensitivity during brood care was analysed in two Neotropical Camponotus ant species, related phylogenetically but disparate in ecology, Camponotus mus is dominant in temperate climates, whereas C. rufipes is dominant in subtropical climates, Sensitivity was assessed by first allowing workers to manifest their preference along a thermal gradient, and thereafter increasing the temperature of the nest floor continuously at a rate of 0.2 degrees C/min, The removal of brood by workers was recorded as an indicative response of upper thermal tolerance, Along a thermal gradient, while C. mus nurse workers exhibited a bimodal circadian rhythm of temperature preference to locate the brood, C, rufipes nurses selected an invariant temperature throughout the day, Irrespective of their thermal preferences, sensitivity to temperature changes in both species showed a conspicuous circadian rhythm. Its endogenous nature was supported by a free-run under constant darkness, In C, mus, instantaneous resetting by the light:dark cycle could also be demonstrated, and experiments suggest the involvement of one oscillator controlling thermal responses, At the middle of the light period when extreme environmental temperatures are expected, C, mas nurses exhibited the highest sensitivity (brood removal after an increase of 0.2 degrees C), while C, rufipes showed the lowest (removal after an increase of 6.7 degrees C), For both species, the time-course of thermal sensitivity during brood care suggests an adaptation to the wide and slight daily fluctuations undergone by temperature in temperate and tropical climates, respectively.

TI  - Florovsky at the Crossroads: Imagining Byzantine Renaissance from Morningside Heights
T2  - SOCIAL EVOLUTION & HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Georges Florovsky, an influential theologian, came to New York City in 1948 to be dean of the Russian St Vladimir Theological Seminary. At Morningside Heights, Florovsky taught about what went wrong in Russia in 1917 and what needed to be done about it. His ideas prefigure the critique of European Enlightenment and its Orientalism formulated by Edward Said. Florovsky argued that Russia, imitating Western Europe, gave up its own Hellenic heritage of the Church Fathers, and replaced it with the western style of the Renaissance of ancient Hellenic philosophy. His remedy for this condition was 'the return to the fathers', establishing a direct philosophical connection with Russia's Hellenic heritage, thus bypassing the West. These ideas of Hellenic patristic revival also run into problems at Morningside Heights, in the World Council of Churches and with the powerful theological figures at Union Theological Seminary. Florovsky misread the changing political situation in the late 1950s. American theology and politics were becoming influenced by Reinhold Niebuhr, who was not interested in the nuances of Church History. The new American priorities were the homogenization of ethnic churches into a union. Florovsky's ideas about the Russian religious revival, once popular at the height of the Cold War now became outdated. Thus, Florovsky was removed from the deanship of St Vladimir Theological Seminary in 1955 and a more Americanized generation took over the leadership, while his ideas found fertile soil in more nationalistic circles.

AB  - Mutants resistant to the wild-type phage PM2 (type C bacteria) were isolated from a culture of the marine bacterium Alteromonas espejiana BAL-31 (type B bacteria). The wide-host-range mutant phages PM2 r and PM2 r2 capable of reproduction in type C bacteria were obtained. Unlike the wild-type phage (phage w), phage r did not reproduce in type B bacteria at temperatures above 26 degrees C, although both phages displayed similar kinetics of thermoinactivation at 45 degrees C. Phage r2, like phage w, reproduced at temperatures of up to 30 degrees C, i.e., it was not a temperature-sensitive mutant (ts-mutant), The frequency of the w --> r mutation equaled 10(-6)-10(-7). The frequency of the reverse mutation r --> w, resulting in the loss of both ts and wide-host-range properties, was the same, In type B bacteria, the frequency of mutations toward resistance to phages w or r was 10(-6)-10(-8) per cell per generation. In type C bacteria, the frequency of mutations toward resistance to phage r was below 10(-6) per cell per generation; however, over 10% of the bacteria formed colonies on Petri dishes with an excess of the phage, i.e., the mutation frequency in this system could not be determined by the standard procedure. In phage r lysates, an inhibitor considerably decreasing the rate of the death of type C bacteria induced by concentrated phage preparations (probably a reversible inhibitor of adsorption) was found.

AB  - Although breeding of rare shell colour variants has drawn widespread attention from shellfish breeders, the potential disadvantages of their adaptive capacity have been ignored in practice. To explore the difference in adaptive capacity between orange shell variant (OSO) and commercially cultured population (CPO) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas at early life stage, the development to D-larvae and larval survival and growth (just 23 and 30 degrees C for larval experiment) of them were compared under different temperature (16, 23 and 30 degrees C) and salinity (17, 25 and 33 psu) combinations. In this study, at 23 degrees C and 25 psu, for both OSO and CPO there was no difference in fertilization rates and survival (p > .05) (mean percentages of D-larvae after fertilized 40 hr >= 95.00%; mean larval survival rates on day 10 > 80.00%). However, the percentage of D-larvae of CPO at 40 hr was significantly (p < .05) higher than OSO at temperatures of 16 and 30 degrees C and 25-33 psu and 17 psu at 23 degrees C. Similarly, CPO has a better larval survival on day 10 and growth than OSO at salinities of 17 and 33 psu at 23 degrees C. Overall, our results indicate that OSO can have an equally good performance like CPO at early life stage under optimal condition (23 degrees C; 25 psu), but the potential disadvantages in adaptive capacity will be shown at suboptimal conditions. These findings can guide future hatchery breeding of OSO, and suggest the potential disadvantages in adaptive capacity in rare colour variants need more attention in further breeding.

AB  - The fossil fuel-based linear economy has inherent intricacies such as environmental pollution and the continued need for energy sourcing. Consequently, there has been a shift to a more sustainable circular bio-economy, in which biomass waste is valorised for energy generation while reducing the bulk waste materials and greenhouse gas emissions. In modern bioeconomy, biogas is a primary energy production vehicle. Bio-based economy-enabled technologies result in heat and electricity generation, considerable substitution of fossil fuels for transport, and also the manufacture of additional value-added products and byproducts of economic benefits. Wastes from industrial operations, agriculture, and other anthropogenic activities such as food waste (FW) can be biodigested and transformed into valuable energy sources, nutrient-rich manure, and speciality chemicals. However, for instance, although closed anaerobic membrane bioreactors can totally avoid a microbial runoff, membrane fouling frequently affects the hydraulic performance. Recent developments in anaerobic digestion (AD) of FW have diversified into pretreatment, organic loading, additive supplementation, parametric optimisation, and digestate recirculation to enhance the utility potential of biomass for energy and environment. These numerous anaerobic and microbial interventions support biomass valorisation and related processes, resulting in more efficient biomethanation. Valorisation of FW through biogas-based energy production could serve as an essential cog in the wheel of a circular bioeconomy.

AB  - China has a wetland area of 53.42 million hectares, the fourth largest in the world; it includes all types of wetlands defined by the Ramsar Convention and has a carbon sink capacity of more than 1.71 million metric tons per year. Inland wetlands in China are mainly distributed in 10 major catchments, among which the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, the rivers in the northwest, and the rivers in the northeast each have more than 8 million hectares of wetlands. There are 4220 species of plants and 4015 species of animals in China's wetland ecosystem. The wetland resources that have been developed and utilized include edible products, reeds for paper making, peat for fertilizer, fuel for power generation, and chemical, pharmaceutical, ceramic, and building materials. However, wetland areas in China have shrunk by about 54% since 1980. In recent years, China's central government has set great store by Chinese wetlands, and although 49.03% of wetland area is now officially protected, many issues have confounded the implementation of that protection. It is imperative that knowledge gained from scientific research be used to formulate a sound wetland protection and management plan that takes into consideration social, economic, and ecological issues in a way that facilitates the sustainable use of wetland resources and informs decision-makers of the paths that must be followed to achieve that goal.

AB  - Phosphogypsum (PG) is a by-product in the phosphate fertilizer industry, and low rank coal-lignite has high moisture which seriously influence its direct use. As a promising raw material for chemical industry, syngas can be obtained through a properly designed lignite Chemical Looping Gasification (CLG) of PG oxygen carrier. The understanding of the reaction mechanism has been developed, while optimal conditions have been investigated. The study found that the product of syngas mainly comes from the solid solid and gas-solid reactions, while the consumption of syngas mainly takes place via gas-solid reaction. Additionally, the effects of several reaction conditions on the production of syngas have also been analyzed. The optimum values of these reaction conditions are found to be as follows: the PG/lignite molar ratio (X) should be about 0.2; reaction temperature should be over 1123 K; 40-140 mesh size particles should be used. Meanwhile, the crystallization and properties of used phosphogypsum have been studied using X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The results suggested that calcium sulfate was almost completely converted to CaS at a temperature higher than 1123 K, while the sintering of used PG particles can take place for 140 mesh and 200 mesh sizes.

AB  - A highly inbred line of Drosophila melanogaster was subdivided into replicate sublines that were subsequently maintained independently with 10 pairs of parents per generation. The parents were randomly sampled for 19 'unselected' sublines, and artificially selected for high or low abdominal or sternopleural bristle number for 12 'selected' sublines (with 3 replicate selection lines/trait/direction of selection). Divergence in mean bristle number among the unselected sublines, and response of the selected sublines to selection, are attributable to the accumulation of new mutations affecting bristle number. The input of mutational variance per generation, V-M, can be estimated from the magnitude of response or divergence, assuming neutrality of mutations affecting the bristle traits. We reared unselected lines at generations 222 and 224, and selected lines at generations 182-184 of mutation accumulation at each of three temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C), and estimated the mutational variance common to all environments and the mutational variance from genotype x environment interaction. For sternopleural bristle number, the mutational interaction variance was 26% of the mutational variance common to all temperatures, and the interaction variance was due to temperature x line interaction. For abdominal bristle number, the mutational interaction variance was 142% of the mutational variance common to all temperatures, and the interaction variance was due to interactions of temperature x line, sex x line, and temperature x sex x line. It is possible that segregating variation for bristle number is maintained partly by genotype x environment interaction, but information on the fitness profiles of mutations affecting bristle number in each environment will be necessary to evaluate this hypothesis quantitatively.

AB  - The next generation of space telescopes will require primary mirrors that push beyond the current state of technology for mirror fabrication. These mirrors are large, up to 8 meters in diameter, have low mass per unit area, less than 15 kg/m(2) and must maintain diffraction limited performance at cryogenic temperatures. To meet these requirements, we have developed an active mirror that has a thin membrane as the optical surface, which is attached to a stiff lightweight support structure through a set of screw-type actuators. This system allows periodic adjustments with the actuators to maintain the surface figure as measured from star light. The optical surface accuracy and stability are maintained by the active system, so the support structure does not have to be optically stable and can be made using light weight carbon fiber laminates to economically provide stiffness. The key technologies for implementing this technology are now in place. We have performed two critical demonstrations using 2-mm glass membranes - diffraction limited optical performance of a 0.5-m diameter mirror and launch survival of a I-m diameter mirror. We have also built and tested a prototype actuator that achieves 25 nm resolution at cryogenic temperatures. We are now building a 2-m mirror as a prototype for the Next Generation Space Telescope. This mirror will have mass of only 40 kg, including support structure, actuators, and control electronics. It will be will be actively controlled and interferometrically measured at 35 K.

AB  - The increasing use of flow cytometry (FCM) for analyses of environmental samples has resulted in a large variety of staining protocols with varying results and limited comparability. Viability assessment with FCM is in this context of particular interest because incorrect staining could severely affect the outcome/interpretation of the results. Here we propose a pipeline for the development and optimization of staining protocols for environmental samples, demonstrated with the common viability dye combination of SYBR Green I (SG) and propidium iodide (PI). Optimization steps included the assessment of dye solvents, determination of suitable PI concentration, and determining the optimal staining temperature and staining time. We demonstrated that di methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) could impair membrane integrity, when used for SGPI stock solution preparation, and TRIS buffer was chosen as an alternative. Moreover we selected 6 mu M as optimal PI final concentration: less than 3 mu M resulted in incomplete staining of damaged cells, while concentrations higher that 12 mu M resulted in false Pl-positive staining of intact cells. Low temperatures (25 degrees C) resulted in a slow reaction and did not enable the staining of all bacteria, while high temperatures (44 degrees C) caused damage to cells'and false PI-positive results. Hence, 35 degrees C was selected as optimal staining temperature. We further showed that a minimum of 15 min were necessary to obtain stable staining results. Moreover, we showed that addition of EDTA resulted in 1-39% more Pl-positive results compared to an EDTA-free sample, and argue that insufficient evidence currently exist in favor of adding EDTA to all samples in general. Altogether, the data clearly shows the need to be careful, precise and reproducible when staining cells for flow cytometric analyses, and the need to assess and optimize staining protocols with both viable and non-viable bacteria.

AB  - Rolling bearings play an important role in the design of gear transmissions. For a successful process, the best type and size of the rolling bearings has to be defined in an early stage of development. However, high operational reliability and economic viability depends on durability, as well as on the frictional and temperature behavior of the rolling bearings. Practical methods to calculate the loss torque of rolling bearings according to the state of the art partly show significant differences among each other. In addition, the calculated loss torques frequently show high deviations compared to measured values in practice. Thus, comprehensive experimental investigations at the FZG bearing power loss test rig have been carried out in a collective FVA research project investigating the losses and temperatures of rolling bearings. In this paper, the principle of the FZG bearing power loss test rig is shown and selected results of the experimental investigations are compared to the calculation methods according to state of the art. Finally, measures for an improved estimation of the loss torque of rolling bearings are given.

AB  - The amount of biowaste generated by university canteens (BWUC) in the faculties of the University of A Coruna (UDC) varies between 6 and 100 kg/day. In addition, the gardening services of the campus generate even higher amounts of garden waste (GrW), including pruning, which, once crushed, serves as bulking material for composting the biowaste from the canteens. Decentralized composting has been chosen with the aim of producing high quality organic fertilizers for university urban gardens while reducing the environmental burdens of both waste management and agricultural practice. Small static home composters of 340 L (SHC) for smaller amounts of generation (up to 20 kg BWUC/day) were used, while, for faculties of higher generation (up to 40 kg BWUC/day on average), the first composting stage was carried out in a closed and dynamic composter (DC). The dynamic composter was designed and built specifically for this project and its features were improved and optimized throughout the study. The pilot project was carried out in two centers of the UDC, which are known as the Philology Faculty (PF) and the School of Architecture (SA). All the organic waste generated by the canteens of these two colleges from January 2011 to July 2011 (approximately 3000 kg) was treated. Composting in SHC included a thermophilic phase that extended one month beyond the loading period for which thermophilic temperatures were also recorded. The use of the DC as the first stage in combination with static composters (SC) for the maturation stage reduced the overall thermophilic phase to 6-8 weeks. The complete maturation (Rottegrade class IV-V) was achieved after about four months in SHC and after two months when using the combined DC-SC system, if the right conditions of moisture were maintained. The chemical quality of the compost produced was compatible with Class A of Spanish legislation (equivalent to organic farmer quality) and the C/N ratio ranged from 9 to 15 depending on the relation BWUC:GrW.

AB  - Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm), which is a Gram positive bacterium, causes the bacterial canker of tomato disease. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Polygonum orientale extracts against Cmm. In this study, firstly, effects of three extracting parameters (extractive time, extractive temperature, and solid to liquid ratio) of orthogonal experiment design L27 (313) were conducted. Secondly, survival rate was determined and inhibition zone of Cmm rescued post-stress was monitored. Finally, extracellular OD26onm value, extracellular protein content, conformational structure of membrane protein, extracellular alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, and ATPase activity were measured to investigate the antibacterial mechanism. Results of orthogonal experiment revealed that extractive time and extractive temperature had highly significant (P<0.01) effects on the antibacterial activity of P. orientale extracts. The optimum conditions were as follows: 10h of extractive time, 60 C of extractive temperature, and 1:20 (g:mL) of solid to liquid ratio. This study also demonstrated that the living cells of each sample from survival rate test had almost no resistance or adaptability, and rescued Cmm cells were much easier to be inhibited by P. orientale extracts. The results of antibacterial mechanism indicated that cell membrane and cell wall of Cmm were seriously damaged by P. orientale extracts, and P. orientale extracts reduced the intracellular ATPase activity dramatically. All these findings suggested that P. orientale extracts had a strong antibacterial activity to inhibit Cmm, and could be used for the ecological management of the bacterial canker of tomato disease.

AB  - Temperature selection in tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus) is strongly influenced by hydration state and this response varies between two distinct neighbouring populations on semi-arid Carnac Island and mainland wetland (Herdsman Lake). Fed and hydrated (control) Carnac Island snakes selected a preferred body temperature of 26.2 +/- 1.2 degreesC and an average maximum temperature of 32.5 +/- 0.5 degreesC in a photo-thermal gradient. Dehydrated Carnac Island snakes selected a significantly lower preferred body temperature (19.7 +/- 1.6 degreesC) and average maximum temperature (27.7 +/- 1.0 degreesC). Control Herdsman Lake snakes selected a preferred body temperature of 27.5 +/- 10.6 degreesC and an average maximum temperature of 33.3 +/- 0.4 degreesC. Dehydrated Herdsman Lake snakes selected a significantly lower preferred body temperature (23.3 +/- 1.1degreesC) and a lower average maximum temperature (31.8 +/- 0.6 degreesC). Thermal depression (decreased preferred body and average maximum temperatures) in response to dehydration was greater for Carnac Island than Herdsman Lake snakes. As decreases in temperature and activity can reduce water loss, our laboratory data suggest that the survival of the relict population of tiger snakes on Carnac Island is associated with thermoregulatory modifications, which may have the effect of enhancing water conservation in this waterless habitat.

TI  - A model of debonding instability for solid propellant rocket motor .1. Uniform longitudinal and transverse stress rate
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FRACTURE MECHANICS
LA  - English
AB  - The interface between a soft and a hard material is vulnerable to debonding because of the prevailing high stress gradient that could be further aggravated under dynamic transient conditions. Such a situation is common in a solid-fuel rocket motor where unstable debonding could be triggered from the initiation of a macrocrack near the interface. The transition from a survival state to a failure state requires knowledge of how the nonlinear, dissipative and nonhomogeneous effects of the dissimilar material interface would interact with load.
   The solid-fuel rocket motor problem is modeled by a three-layered composite system made of steel, adhesive and rubber under plane extension. Assessed are the time dependent nonhomogeneous deformation and possible failure modes. Only initial properties of the materials were used to determine the evolution of nonequilibrium response. This is made possible by application of the isoenergy density theory that accounts for internal heat generation and energy dissipation effects. Results are presented in two parts. In Part I, the applied stress rates are assumed to be 0.75 ksi/s in both the longitudinal and transverse direction while Part II assumes different stress rates in these two directions. At approximately one second after loading, a slanted but straight: macrocrack of about 5 x 10(-3) in. is predicted to occur in the rubber next to the interface. This initial crack was found to become unstable at eight seconds and was estimated to be close to the adhesive/rubber interface over a length of 1.88 in. The onset of fracture depended directly on the load transient behavior.

AB  - Many continental backarcs have thin (similar to 60 km) lithosphere for 100s of km behind the volcanic arc even where, there has been no significant extension. One mechanism to produce thin backarc lithosphere is through gravitational thinning of normal thickness lithosphere by subduction-related mantle flow. The stability of backarc mantle lithosphere is examined using thermal-mechanical models of subduction of an oceanic plate beneath continental lithosphere with an initial thickness of 120 km and a thermal structure similar to average Phanerozoic continental lithosphere. Subduction-induced mantle flow shears the base of the backarc lithosphere producing lateral density perturbations. Owing to the non-Newtonian lithosphere rheology, shearing also reduces the effective viscosity of the lowermost lithosphere, enabling the density perturbations to become gravitationally unstable. The perturbations develop into rapidly-growing downwellings which result in removal of lower backarc lithosphere on timescales of 5-10 Ma. Conductive heating and shearing of the remaining lithosphere results in a second, more muted, phase of gravitational instability and thinning. Lower lithosphere instability is enhanced by higher subduction rates, weaker intrinsic rheology, higher compositional density, and hotter initial thermal structure. The numerical model results are in good agreement with a buoyancy stability analysis, which includes the vertical gradients in temperature and strain rate through the lithosphere. As both rheology and density depend on lithosphere composition, significant thinning may be restricted to continental mantle lithosphere that is fertile and contains a small amount of water. To produce a final thickness comparable to that observed without lithospheric contraction OF extension, it is necessary to have a weak lithosphere rheology, an initial thermal structure hotter than average Phanerozoic continental geotherms, or a combination of the two. The region of thin lithosphere at the northern Cascadia backarc coincides with terranes that were accreted to the North American craton. The known fertile composition of the backarc lithosphere may allow it to be thinned, while the drier, more refractory craton lithosphere is resistant to thinning. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for all living organisms. At the current rate of extraction, global reserves of mineable deposits will be exhausted within the next few centuries. This publication aims to summarize the current knowledge on P recycling for organic farming. The evaluation of recycled P fertilizers (RPFs) includes (i) a chemical characterization, (ii) assessment of their plant P availability and added effects in the soil, (iii) life cycle assessments, (iv) a risk assessment of their long-term impacts on soil pollution, and (v) the compilation of other environmental impacts of different treatment approaches to produce RPFs.
   The highest nutrient recovery rates for P are achieved by rather simple process approaches of P recycling, while more sophisticated approaches often result in lower P recovery rates (e.g., chemical approaches for P precipitation), lower plant P availability in the final product (e.g., most thermal approaches), and losses of organic matter and nutrients like nitrogen and sulfur (e.g., thermal approaches). The plant P availability of many RPFs is higher than that of phosphate rock. Each P recycling approach has strengths and weaknesses. We conclude that any decision not to use a potential recycled P source or to introduce sophisticated treatments may have consequences compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Nevertheless, we need to minimize risks for current and future generations caused by contamination linked to fertilization. Therefore, any management of nutrient recycling requires navigation between constraints. The challenge for the organic agriculture sector is to assess RPFs using a balanced approach that compromises neither the principle of ecology nor the principle of care.

AB  - Following previous work on the Colorado Basin using a 3D crustal structural model, we now investigate the presence of lower crustal bodies at the base of the crust using 3D lithospheric gravity, modelling and calculations of the conductive thermal field.
   Our first study highlighted two fault directions and depocentres associated with thinned crust (NW-SE in the West and NE-SW at the distal margin). Fault relative chronology argues for two periods of extension: (1) NW-SE faulting and thinning in the western Colorado Basin and (2) NE-SW faulting and thinning related to the continental breakup and formation of the NE-SW-striking volcanic margins of the Atlantic Ocean.
   In this study, the geometry of modelled high-density Lower Crustal Bodies (LCBs) enables the reproduction of the gravimetric field as well as of the temperature measured in wells down to 4500 m. The modelled LCBs correlate with geological observations: (1) NW-SE LCBs below the deepest depocentres in the West, (2) NE-SW LCBs below the distal margin faults and the seaward dipping reflectors. Thus the proposed poly-phased evolution of the margin could as well correspond to two emplacement phases of the LCBs. The calculated conductive thermal field fits the measured temperatures best if the thermal properties (thermal conductivity and radiogenic heat production) assigned to the LCBs correspond to either high-grade metamorphic rocks or to mafic magmatic intrusions. To explain the possible lithology of the LCBs, we propose that the two successive phases of extension are accompanied by magma supply, emplaced (1) in the thinnest crust below the older NW-SE depocentres, then (2) along the NE-SW continentward boundary of the distal margin and below the volcanic seaward dipping reflectors. The South African conjugate margin records only the second NE-SW event and we discuss hypotheses which could explain these differences between the conjugate margins.

AB  - Average field body temperatures of pregnant female Podarcis muralis (32.62-degrees-C) were significantly lower than that of males and non-pregnant females (overall average: 33.74-degrees-C). However, when tested in terrarium with a strong thermal gradient in a limited space, which represents a low-cost environment for thermoregulation, neither body temperature nor position in the thermal gradient differed among groups of sex and reproductive condition. Body temperatures selected in thermal gradient (overall average: 33.77-degrees-C) was similar to those exhibited in the field by males and non-pregnant females. This means that low body temperature exhibited by pregnant females in the field is not a consequence of a change of the thermal preferences at this stage, but might be explained on the basis of constraints related to their reproductive condition. Pregnant females stay closer to the refuge and allow approach to a shorter distance than do males and non-pregnant females. Approach distance was partially explained by the distance to refuge, but even when the effects of the distance to refuge were removed by applying the residuals of the regression, the approach distance for pregnant females was significantly lower than for other individuals. This reflects the existence of a behavioural component of motion-less in addition to the tendency to remain closer to a shelter, and means a shift in the predator-avoidance tactic from flight to crypsis, presumably because effectiveness of the flight tactic would be reduced during pregnancy. The behavioural changes associated with pregnancy may preclude careful thermoregulation, as this requires frequent movements to exploit the variability of the thermal environment.

AB  - Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles were the most prominent, abrupt climate events of the last glacial period whose impact was most strongly felt in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic region. The climate links between the North Atlantic, the Asian and American tropics, and Antarctica during these cycles are well documented. However, the potential role of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and Australasian monsoon system in propagating climate impacts across the hemispheres is still unclear. Here, we use tandem measurements of oxygen isotopes in calcite and fluid inclusions, as well as carbon-isotope ratios, from multiple stalagmites from Liang Luar Cave, Flores (southern Indonesia) to examine the monsoon response to D-O event number 21 (similar to 87,000-84,000 years ago), the longest and warmest event recorded in Greenland ice cores. The record shows that there was a rapid decline in monsoon rainfall in Indonesia during D-O21 warming in Greenland and cooling in Antarctica. At around the same time, the East Asian monsoon was intensified, indicating that the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) shifted abruptly to the north during this event. Our record also shows that there was a 2-3 degrees C increase in local air temperature, which would have acted to increase primary productivity and promote the generation of soil carbon for methanogenesis. Therefore, our findings indicate that ITCZ positioning in tropical Australasia-through its influence on large-scale oceanic-atmospheric circulation-played a key role in transmitting the abrupt climate signal between the hemispheres, thereby facilitating the rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations during D-O21 that ultimately led to global warming and the demise of the MIS5b stadial.

AB  - The impact of thermal processing on the fresh-like characteristics of foods is well-known. Eggs have unique fresh-like characteristics, functional properties, nutritional value, and sensory quality that can be modified by thermal processing. This complex scenario has led to the study and optimization of technologies that do not use high temperatures to enhance egg shelf life and preserve fresh-like characteristics. Technologies such as high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), pulsed electric fields (PEF), ultrasound (US), pulsed light (PL), cold plasma (CP) and ozonation, have been investigated for egg treatment, and findings were summarized in this paper. These novel treatments improve food safety, shelf life, and have minimal impact on the functional properties of fresh eggs and egg products. The immunoreactivity of egg allergens is reduced and the bioactivity of egg component is favored (in selected conditions) by non-thermal technologies. However, additional studies are necessary to clarify the effect of these technologies on the sensory properties of treated products, evaluate different combinations of hurdles to ensure safety, improve the knowledge about the effect in egg allergens and bioactive compounds, and also explore the processing of healthier and functional eggs and egg products.

AB  - Small, isolated and/or peripheral populations are expected to harbour low levels of genetic variation and may therefore have reduced adaptability to environmental change, including climate warming. In the Arctic, global warming has already caused vegetation change across the region and is acting as a significant stressor on Arctic biodiversity. Many of the rare plants in the Arctic are relicts from early Holocene warm periods, but their ability to benefit from the current warming is dependent on the viability of their populations. We therefore examined Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data from regional red listed vascular plant species in the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and reference populations from the main distribution area of: (1) Botrychium lunaria, (2) Carex capillaris ssp. fuscidula, (3) Comastoma tenellum, (4) Kobresia simpliciuscula ssp. subholarctica, (5) Ranunculus wilanderi, (6) Sibbaldia procumbens and (7) Tofieldia pusilla. In addition, we gathered population size data in Svalbard. The Svalbard populations had low genetic diversity and distinctiveness and few or no private markers compared to populations outside the archipelago. This is similar to observations in other rare species in Svalbard and the genetic depletion may be due to an initial founder effect and/or a genetic bottleneck caused by late Holocene cooling. There seems to be limited gene flow from other areas and the Svalbard populations should therefore be considered as demographically independent management units. Overall, these management units have small and/or few populations and are therefore prone to stochastic events which may further increase vulnerability to inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variation, and reduced evolutionary potential. Our results support theory predicting lower levels of genetic diversity in small, isolated and/or peripheral populations and may be of importance for management of other rare plant species in the Arctic.

AB  - In this study we produce two urban development scenarios estimating potential urban sprawl and optimized development concerning building construction, and we simulate their inf uence on air temperature, surface temperatures and human thermal comfort. We select two heat waves representative for present and future conditions of the mid 21st century and simulations are run with the Town Energy Balance Model (TEB) coupled online and offlin to the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). Global and regional climate change under the RCP8.5 scenario causes an increase of daily maximum air temperature in Vienna by 7 K. The daily minimum air temperature will increase by 2-4 K. Changes caused by urban growth or densificati n mainly affect air temperature and human thermal comfort locally where new urbanisation takes place and does not occur significa tly in the central districts. A combination of near zero-energy standards and increasing albedo of building materials on the city scale accomplishes a maximum reduction of urban canyon temperature achieved by changes in urban parameters of 0.9 K for the minima and 0.2 K for the maxima. Local scale changes of different adaptation measures show that insulation of buildings alone increases the maximum wall surface temperatures by more than 10 K or the maximum mean radiant temperature (MRT) in the canyon by 5 K. Therefore, measures to reduce MRT within the urban canyons like tree shade are needed to complement the proposed measures. This study concludes that the rising air temperatures expected by climate change puts an unprecedented heat burden on Viennese inhabitants, which cannot easily be reduced by measures concerning buildings within the city itself. Additionally, measures such as planting trees to provide shade, regional water sensitive planning and global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce temperature extremes are required.

AB  - Paper-manufacturing industries utilize rice straw (RS) as raw material, generating huge quantity of black liquor (BL), which should be treated before reaching the environment. BL is mainly rich in organic pollutants that can be utilized to obtain valuable by-products and meet sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this investigation, BL from a paper-making industry was efficiently employed as a substrate for bio-H-2 generation via dark fermentation at pH value of 7.5 and temperature of 35 degrees C for 14 days, resulting in a hydrogen yield (HY) of 0.579 mol/mol(glucose). The HY was substantially increased up to 1.654, 1.908, and 2.187 mol/mol(glucose) with immobilization of anaerobes on Graphene (GN), hydroxyapatite (HN), and Graphene/hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (GHN). Further, the activities of protein- and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes i.e. protease, alpha-amylase, xylanase, and CM-cellulase was highly improved. Results were validated with respect to the operational tax-onomical unit (OUT) richness estimators (ACE and Chao), diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson), and electron-equivalent and mass balances. The H-2 productivity data were techno-economically assessed for proposing a bioenergy-based project, revealing a payback period of 5.92 y to recoup the initial investment. The findings of this study would promote interaction in the areas of industrialization, pollution prevention, and clean energy production to attain SDGs keys.

AB  - Observations of climate impacts on ecosystems highlight the need for an understanding of organismal thermal ranges and their implications at the ecosystem level. Where changes in aquatic animal populations have been observed, the integrative concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) has successfully characterised the onset of thermal limits to performance and field abundance. The OCLTT concept addresses the molecular to whole-animal mechanisms that define thermal constraints on the capacity for oxygen supply to the organism in relation to oxygen demand. The resulting 'total excess aerobic power budget' supports an animal's performance (e.g. comprising motor activity, reproduction and growth) within an individual's thermal range. The aerobic power budget is often approximated through measurements of aerobic scope for activity (i.e. the maximum difference between resting and the highest exercise-induced rate of oxygen consumption), whereas most animals in the field rely on lower (i.e. routine) modes of activity. At thermal limits, OCLTT also integrates protective mechanisms that extend time-limited tolerance to temperature extremes - mechanisms such as chaperones, anaerobic metabolism and antioxidative defence. Here, we briefly summarise the OCLTT concept and update it by addressing the role of routine metabolism. We highlight potential pitfalls in applying the concept and discuss the variables measured that led to the development of OCLTT. We propose that OCLTT explains why thermal vulnerability is highest at the whole-animal level and lowest at the molecular level. We also discuss how OCLTT captures the thermal constraints on the evolution of aquatic animal life and supports an understanding of the benefits of transitioning from water to land.

AB  - Recent work shows communities and ecosystems can be shaped by predator intraspecific variation, but it is unclear whether the magnitude and direction of these influences are context-dependent. Temperature is an environmental context of strong ecological influence and widespread relevance given global warming trends. Warming should increase per capita predator effects on prey through increases in predator metabolic rate, potentially exacerbating intraspecific differences in ecological effects. Here, we used two populations of the potent pelagic freshwater predator, WesternMosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), to test how experimental pond temperature mediates the differences between their ecological impacts. Mosquitofish introduction induced a strong pelagic trophic cascade, causing a large reduction of crustacean zooplankton biomass, an increase in phytoplankton biomass, and changes to ecosystem-level response variables. Warming (+/- 28 degrees C above unwarmed treatments) exacerbated fish-induced reduction of zooplankton biomass, but moderated the cascade to phytoplankton, primary productivity, and nutrient concentrations. Effects of intraspecific variation were apparent only on zooplankton, and only at warmed environmental temperatures. The traits underlying this divergence may be related to the population source thermal environments. Overall, results show that warming may increase the ecological importance of predator intraspecific variation. In general, extrinsic environmental drivers, such as those associated with climate change, may reshape the effects of intraspecific trait variation on ecosystems.

AB  - Here we report the viability of natural chromosomal O-inversion structural homo- and heterokaryotypes in a population of D. subobscura from Avala Mountain, Serbia, subjected to cold and heat stress during spring 2004. These results were compared with those observed in the same population in September 2004. We detected protection of a great number of lethal genes in O-chromosome lethal heterozygous combinations, independently of inversion backgrounds and temperature stress. The positive epistatic interactions of mildly-deleterious genes observed only in O-inversion heterokaryotypes (at distinct temperatures) and lethal genes in O-inversion homokaryotypes (under temperature stress only) could be responsible for reducing the genetic load. The seasonal fluctuations in frequencies of several chromosomal arrangements and karyotypes indicate a seasonal adaptation to changeable environmental conditions. The sample of D. subobscura collected in spring 2004 was tolerant to cold but not to heat, and these results point to tolerance to extreme low temperatures, possibly as a result of natural selection. Also, a non-random distribution of distinct combinations of viability classes among several O-inversion karyotypes (under both optimal conditions and heat stress) was observed. This observation could be taken as evidence of co-adaptation: different capacities of several O-inversion karyotypes with different combinations of genes to tolerate a range of temperatures. We conclude that frequency-dependent and supergene selection are balancing selection mechanisms and are responsible for the protection of chromosomal inversions in natural populations of D. subobscura.

AB  - Temperature is one of the main factors affecting insect growth, development and reproduction. The effects of temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) on the development and reproduction of Cinara cedri Mimeur (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea: Lachnidae) fed on Cedrus deodara (Roxb.) G. Don were evaluated in this study. With the increase of temperature from 10 to 30 degrees C, the development duration at different development stages gradually shortened. There was a significant positive correlation between the developmental rates and temperature, following a quadratic regression model. The lower developmental threshold temperature (C) and effective accumulated temperatures (K) for completing a generation were 4.13 degrees C and 263.4 degree-days, respectively. The highest fecundity was observed at 20 degrees C with 25.74 first-instar nymphs/female. Both the highest intrinsic rate of increase (r, 0.11 +/- 0.03) and net reproduction rate (R-0, 19.06 +/- 2.05) were observed at 20 degrees C, whereas the lowest values of r (0.05 +/- 0.01) at 10 degrees C and R-0 (5.78 +/- 0.88) at 30 degrees C were observed. The results suggest that temperature significantly affects the biology of C. cedri and the optimal temperature for its development is 20 degrees C.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity occurs at a variety of timescales, but little is known about the degree to which plastic responses at different timescales are associated with similar underlying molecular processes, which is critical for assessing the effects of plasticity on evolutionary trajectories. To address this issue, we identified differential gene expression in response to developmental temperature in the muscle transcriptome of adult threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exposed to 12, 18 and 24 degrees C until hatch and then held at 18 degrees C for 9months and compared these results to differential gene expression in response to adult thermal acclimation in stickleback developed at 18 degrees C and then acclimated to 5 and 25 degrees C as adults. Adult thermal acclimation affected the expression of 7,940 and 7,015 genes in response to cold and warm acclimation, respectively, and 4,851 of these genes responded in both treatments. In contrast, the expression of only 33 and 29 genes was affected by cold and warm development, respectively. The majority of the genes affected by developmental temperature were also affected by adult acclimation temperature. Many genes that were differentially expressed as a result of adult acclimation were associated with previously identified temperature-dependent effects on DNA methylation patterns, suggesting a role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene expression plasticity during acclimation. Taken together, these results demonstrate similarities between the persistent effects of developmental plasticity on gene expression and the effects of adult thermal acclimation, emphasizing the potential for mechanistic links between plasticity acting at these different life stages.

AB  - Various methods have been proposed to determine the heat of adsorption indirectly from adsorption isotherms or directly through calorimeter, whereas authors rarely compared different models for calculating isosteric heat of methane adsorption on coal and seldom studied adsorption thermodynamics related to calorimetric heat flux. In this work, for better probing thermodynamics of adsorption of methane on coal, seeking a reliable model to describe adsorption heat, and predicting the adsorption heat at given temperatures and pressures from heat flow, isothermal adsorption experiments of methane on anthracite at temperatures of 298 K, 308 K and 318 K were conducted, with both calorimetric and volumetric method. The calorimetric results indicate that isosteric heat decreases with the increase of adsorption capacity and temperature. Then the calorimetric heat was compared with the isosteric heat using four adsorption models, in the fitness sequence of D-A > Toth > C-C > Virial. To be noted that the heat flux measured calorimetrically increases to the crest rapidly, then gradually decreases to the initial state. This tendency is proposed to be described by the exponential function with the fitting parameters estimated by empirical formulas proposed. The predicted heat flows were thus acquired, agreeing well with the experimental data except for the low coverage or pressure stage. Furthermore, it is revealed that the temperature evolution of adsorption can also be expressed by an exponential-like polynomial solution, induced from the proposed thermal flux prediction model based on the Tian's equation.

AB  - Temperature fluctuations have caused considerable biological and ecological impacts on marine organisms and their communities. For example, increased temperatures in sub-tropical environments have led tothe influx of tropical vagrant marine species into cooler temperate waters in a phenomenon called tropicalisation'. Here we combine metabolic performance metrics, feeding manipulations and nutritional geometry models to examine the influence of temperature on macronutrient selection (energy amounts of protein, lipid and carbohydrates) in the Indo-Pacific damselfish Abudefduf vaigiensis and explore the role of temperature and macronutrient intake on individual performance (active and routine metabolic rate, and burst swim speed). Indo-pacific damselfish fed non-randomly from presented food blocks, showing selection for their macronutrient intake. In our high-temperature treatment we observed a significant increase in the intake of protein and lipid, but not carbohydrate. The fish in our low-temperature treatment had a significantly higher active metabolic rate and burst swim speed compared to our high-temperature treatment. Our findings provide evidence that the vagrant Indo-Pacific Damselfish in Sydney are able to select specific macronutrients in their diets ameliorating the effects on performance when thermally stressed. This work also suggests some underlying level of acclimation to or selection for colder water temperatures in these relatively recently recruited fish. Further studies should benefit from the approach proposed here, to better understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers that influence the survival of tropical species in marginal thermal habitats.

AB  - Natural gas purification by economic and low-energy adsorptive separation processes is important. However, as a difficult global problem, N-2 removal from N-2/CH4 mixtures is challenging because of their similar physical properties. In this study, the separation of N-2/CH4 by Cr-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (MIL-100Cr, MIL-101Cr and TYUT-96Cr) with various open Cr site densities was studied. Gas sorption isotherms showed that TYUT-96Cr exhibited the highest N-2/CH4 uptake ratio (13.67 at 0.01 bar and 298 K) of the selected Cr-MOFs, which was consistent with the highest density of Cr (III) sites. This material provided the highest CH4 productivity (0.716 mmol/cm(3)) per cycle for N-2 removal from a 5:95 N-2/CH4 mixture to produce 99.99% pure CH4, as shown by the breakthrough experiments. Pressure-swing adsorption simulations indicated that, by a two-bed sixstep method, pristine 95% methane was enriched to 98.9% by TYUT-96Cr. The largest CH4 productivity, high breakthrough selectivity and thermal stability of TYUT-96Cr among the Cr-MOFs, made it a promising adsorbent in trace N-2 removal for practical industrial application.

AB  - The voracity of larvae of Melangyna viridiceps and Symosyrphus grandicornis fed on the rose aphid, Macrosiphum rosae (L.), was measured at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. Over the three larval instars, a lifetime total of about 300 aphids (third-instar equivalents) was consumed for a weight gain of 20 mg. Lifetime consumption was greater at lower temperatures. At 20 degrees C, the third-instar larva ate about 80% of the total, although this instar accounted for only 50% of larval development time. Melangyna viridiceps consumed more aphids than Symosyrphus grandicornis at 10 and 15 degrees C, Development of eggs, larvae and pupae of both species was studied at constant temperatures of 4, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. Although eggs hatched at 4 degrees C, first-instar larvae died at this temperature. A computer program (PMDS) was used to fit temperature/development functions for all stages. Linear, LoganT(b), Stinner and exponential functions were fitted to the data. A day-degree program, using the parameters given by PMDS and records of daily maximum-minimum temperatures and data obtained from the field, suggested that the hoverflies might go through 10-13 generations per year in the field.

AB  - Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.

AB  - Understanding cues for diapause termination in insects can be valuable in predicting phenological events in their lifecycles. Once identified, such cues can be utilized as a biofix, the point at which the majority of individuals within a population begin to accumulate degree days. We investigated the impact of photoperiod on completion of reproductive diapause in the invasive eastern North American population of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), by exposing diapausing females to varying light regimes in otherwise identical environments. The critical photoperiod estimated to initiate reproductive development in at least 50% of the potential reproductive population was 13.0-13.5 h, with increasing photoperiods coinciding with increased probability of females reproducing, earlier time to first oviposition, and higher rates of fecundity. These data on the species' response to photoperiod are in agreement with previous modeling that predicted the twin constraints of photoperiod and temperature on H. halys reproduction prevents populations that undergo diapause from producing more than two generations annually anywhere within the continental U.S. However, the facultative nature of diapause in H. halys leaves open the possibility that sub-populations may not enter diapause in some conditions, potentially allowing for additional annual generations.

AB  - Minimising predation risk is critical to fitness in all animals. For animals that utilise retreat sites as an anti-predator strategy, there are many factors that influence retreat site selection and determine when to emerge from a hiding place. In this paper we test for seasonal and daily variation in cover use in a temperate-zone lizard (Elgaria coerulea). We also test for age- and sex-related differences in capture-site temperature, cover use, and sprint speed. We conducted a mark-recapture study on Elgaria coerulea in south-eastern British Columbia, Canada. We recorded temperature, precipitation, lizard's position, proximity to cover, and rock size. The results showed seasonal variation in both. retreat-site selection and emergence patterns. Lizards selected thicker rocks during the summer compared to spring, perhaps to avoid lethal high temperatures. Adult males used larger, thicker rocks than adult females and juveniles. Emergence patterns also differed between the sexes. The probability of capturing an adult female in the open steadily increased over the summer, while male emergence declined over the season. The tendency to be in the open also increased with the amount of rain that fell the previous day. This study shows that while remaining under cover is important in Elgaria coerulea, specific circumstances (lethal temperatures, reproduction, precipitation) will modify their cover use.

AB  - The potential correlation between fir tree-ring width (Abies borisii regis Mattf.) variability and the respective variability of the main climatic parameters in the region of University Forest of Pertouli (central Greece) are being analyzed in the current study, taking into consideration a 60-year period (1961-2020). Correlation and response function analyses were applied to examine the climate-tree-growth relationship. Precipitation was found to be the most crucial and driving factor that most intensively influences the tree growth of A. borisii-regis trees under Mediterranean climate conditions. It was evident that this species is characterized by drought sensitivity and even a short and mild drought event could significantly influence adversely its growth and productivity. June, May and July precipitation present the higher and statistically significant correlation of monthly precipitation with tree-ring width, affecting the ring-width variability by 31.2%. Temperature (mean, max or min) does not seem to highly influence the tree growth, despite the obvious and statistically significant trend increase that has been recorded in the last decades within the frame of climate change. June maximum temperature presents a strong negative correlation with tree-ring width, while April maximum temperature is positively correlated with tree-ring width. The combined impact of precipitation and max temperatures on tree-ring growth is 38.5%. Snow did not reveal any statistically significant correlation to tree-ring width, independent of the height of monthly snow accumulation. A. borisii-regis grown in high altitudes in the Mediterranean region demonstrate high adaptability to the recorded temperature increase and could potentially be able to adapt in future to even warmer climate conditions. The constructed tree-ring chronology could be utilized towards the implementation of further dendroclimatological analyses and climate reconstruction.

AB  - The high arctic aphid Acyrthosiphon svalbardicum Heikinheimo is endemic to Svalbard and has developed a shortened life cycle to cope with harsh environmental conditions prevailing in this archipelago. Previous studies in the 1990s showed that contrarily to Sitobion calvulum, a species which is also restricted to Svalbard and displays a two-generation life cycle, A. svalbardicum can produce a third generation that, on average, should complete its development and reproduction once every 28 years. Because temperature has risen substantially in Svalbard during the past 10 -15 years and is predicted to rise further, budget requirements for this extra-generation should be met more and more frequently and the impact of the resulting demographic increase should be easily measurable in field populations of A. svalbardicum. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing a series of experiments designed to study population dynamics and morph production of A. svalbardicum. Surprisingly, the three-generation life cycle was not detected either in field populations surveyed for two consecutive years or in controlled conditions where temperature was manipulated. Although we cannot reject the possibility that A. svalbardicum populations may develop a three-generation life cycle under certain circumstances, this strategy seems very rare and not adaptive as it would have been selected in the recent years of warming observed in Svalbard.

AB  - The surface mucosa that lines many of our organs houses myriad biometric signals and, therefore, has great potential as a sensor-tissue interface for high-fidelity and long-term biosensing. However, progress is still nascent for mucosa-interfacing electronics owing to challenges with establishing robust sensor-tissue interfaces; device localization, retention and removal; and power and data transfer. This is in sharp contrast to the rapidly advancing field of skin-interfacing electronics, which are replacing traditional hospital visits with minimally invasive, real-time, continuous and untethered biosensing. This Review aims to bridge the gap between skin-interfacing electronics and mucosa-interfacing electronics systems through a comparison of the properties and functions of the skin and internal mucosal surfaces. The major physiological signals accessible through mucosa-lined organs are surveyed and design considerations for the next generation of mucosa-interfacing electronics are outlined based on state-of-the-art developments in bio-integrated electronics. With this Review, we aim to inspire hardware solutions that can serve as a foundation for developing personalized biosensing from the mucosa, a relatively uncharted field with great scientific and clinical potential.

AB  - Domestication of fish is a key strategy for diversification of farmed species to meet consumer's choices and demands as well as conservation of the species for sustainable provision of nutrition benefits and incomes. Initial successful induced spawning of Barbus altianalis was achieved, but there is low adoption attributed to lack of sufficient quality seed. This paper reviews the ecological and social-economic trends, and potential prospects that justify the domestication of this high value indigenous species, and identify gaps that could be addressed to increase seed production for commercialization. Review findings show that due to overexploitation, there is a steady decline of B. altianalis in Ugandan water bodies, with no current record from Lake Victoria where catches had in the past been reported. B. altianalis shows ability to survive in interlacustrine-riverine environments although, the juveniles are largely confined in the river or stream water. Varying levels of adaptability and tolerance to environmental conditions including oxygen and temperature by different age groups occur. The species has a great potential for culture as an omnivorous species with high chances of adapting to varying feeding strategies. Knowledge gaps in size at maturity, appropriate inducing hormones, growth conditions, egg hatchability and larvae weaning were identified as key challenges associated with B. altianalis domestication. Understanding the underlying natural ecological dynamics of B. altianalis will guide further research in the areas mentioned to ensure advancement in domestication so as to meet the rising demand for B. altianalis. This will curtail its overexploitation in the wild and also improve the livelihoods of the communities in the region.

AB  - Recoding viral genomes by introducing numerous synonymous but suboptimal codon pairs-called codon-pair deoptimization (CPD)-provides new types of live-attenuated vaccine candidates. The large number of nucleotide changes resulting from CPD should provide genetic stability to the attenuating phenotype, but this has not been rigorously tested. Human respiratory syncytial virus in which the G and F surface glycoprotein ORFs were CPD (called Min B) was temperature-sensitive and highly restricted in vitro. When subjected to selective pressure by serial passage at increasing temperatures, Min B substantially regained expression of F and replication fitness. Whole-genome deep sequencing showed many point mutations scattered across the genome, including one combination of six linked point mutations. However, their reintroduction into Min B provided minimal rescue. Further analysis revealed viral genomes bearing very large internal deletions (LD genomes) that accumulated after only a few passages. The deletions relocated the CPD F gene to the first or second promoter-proximal gene position. LD genomes amplified de novo in Min B-infected cells were encapsidated, expressed high levels of F, and complemented Min B replication in trans. This study provides insight on a variation of the adaptability of a debilitated negative-strand RNA virus, namely the generation of defective minihelper viruses to overcome its restriction. This is in contrast to the common "defective interfering particles" that interfere with the replication of the virus from which they originated. To our knowledge, defective genomes that promote rather than inhibit replication have not been reported before in RNA viruses.

AB  - Latitudinal variation in fitness-related traits has often been attributed to local adaptation to climates. In poikilotherms including fishes, lower temperatures and shorter reproductive seasons at high latitudes would be expected to cause a reduction in annual reproductive output of an individual. Theories of latitudinal compensation predict that organisms at high latitudes should evolve compensatory responses for these climatic effects. Therefore, latitudinal compensation in female reproductive rate (egg production rate), that individuals from high latitudes produce eggs at higher rates than those from lower latitudes, is likely to occur. I tested this hypothesis with a latitudinally widespread reef fish Pomacentrus coelestis that is a multiple batch spawner, from three different localities, from temperate to subtropical waters, within Japan. I used common-environment experiments at three different temperatures to compare reproductive capacity among local populations. In the experiments, average inter-spawning intervals were the shortest and average size-specific clutch weight was the heaviest in fish from the most northern locality across all temperatures, showing clear latitudinal clines. Thus, the northern fish can achieve higher reproductive output per unit time both by shortening inter-spawning intervals and increasing size-specific clutch weight. Additionally, faster egg production rate of the northern fish did not result from increased food consumption. This finding suggests that gross egg production efficiency was higher in the northern fish and that northern fish had a superior capacity for reproduction within a season. These results support the prediction that latitudinal compensation occurs in the female reproductive rate of P. coelestis. As the reproductive season of this species decreases drastically with increasing latitude, the observed cline in the reproductive rate must be an adaptive response to the local selective regime, i.e., length of the reproductive season. Such latitudinal compensation in female reproductive rates may be a common pattern in latitudinally widespread fishes.

AB  - 1. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled for 1 year to assess functional and taxonomic differences in invertebrate biomass and production with respect to habitat types, reaches and catchments in Wine Spring Basin, western North Carolina. Quantitative samples were collected from depositional, cobble-riffle and bedrock outcrop habitats at four stream reaches (two headwater sites, one second order, and one third order). Other measures included physical parameters, periphyton and organic matter standing crops. Invertebrate data from the Wine Spring catchment were also compared with data from another catchment (Ball Creek) within the same region.
   2. The three habitat types had different current velocities and mean substratum particle sizes; both measures were greatest in bedrock outcrop habitats and lowest in depositional habitats. Organic matter standing crops, invertebrate functional group productivity and biomass also differed significantly with respect to habitat type. Cobble-riffle areas had the lowest standing crops of organic matter, invertebrate productivity and biomass.
   3. Both invertebrate communities and organic matter standing crops differed significantly between the two headwater reaches. First- to third-order reaches differed in taxonomic composition at the genus level, yet had similar relative functional group productivity and biomass.
   4. Annual mean invertebrate biomass and secondary production were greater in the Wine Spring Basin than in Ball Creek. Sites in both the Wine Spring and Ball Creek catchments, however, exhibited similar functional group distributions per habitat type.
   5. Local geomorphology and related physical parameters influenced the structure of invertebrate functional group composition, and the distribution of organic matter standing crops. Furthermore, comparison of community structure in Wine Spring with that in Ball Creek suggested that taxonomic composition was more related to catchment-specific parameters (e.g. thermal regime, evolutionary history) than stream size.

AB  - The European Union is currently immersed in policy development to address the effects of climate change around the world. Key plans and processes for facilitating adaptation to high temperatures and for reducing the adverse effects on health are among the most urgent measures. Therefore, it is necessary to understand those factors that influence adaptation. The aim of this study was to provide knowledge related to the social, climate and economic factors that are related to the evolution of minimum mortality temperatures (MMT) in Spain in the rural and urban contexts, during the 1983-2018 time period. For this purpose, local factors were studied regarding their relationship to levels of adaptation to heat.
   MMT is an indicator that allows for establishing a relationship to between mortality and temperature, and is a valid indicator to assess the capacity of adaptation to heat of a certain population. MMT is obtained through the maximum daily temperature and daily mortality of the study period. The evolution of MMT values for Spain was established in a previous paper.
   An ecological, longitudinal and retrospective study was carried out. Generalized linear models (GLM) were performed to identify the variables that appeared to be related to adaptation. The adaptation was calculated as the difference in variation in MMT based on the average increase in maximum daily temperatures.
   In terms of adaptation to heat, urban populations have adapted more than non-urban populations. Seventynine percent (n = 11) of urban provinces have adapted to heat, compared to twenty-one percent (n = 3) of rural provinces that have not adapted. In terms of urban zones, income level and habituation to heat (values over the 95th percentile) were variables shown to be related to adaptation. In contrast, among non-urban provinces, a greater number of housing rehabilitation licenses and a greater number of health professionals were variables associated with higher increases in MMT, and therefore, with adaptation.
   These results highlight the need to carry out studies that allow for identifying the local factors that are most relevant and influential in population adaptation. More studies carried out at a small scale are needed.

AB  - Climate change is expected to result in an increased occurrence of heat stress. The long-term population-level impact of this stress would be lessened in populations able to genetically adapt to higher temperatures. Adaptation requires the presence of genetically-based variation. At-risk populations may undergo strong declines in population size that lower the amount of genetic variation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the heritability of heat tolerance in populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa, and to determine if heritabilities were reduced following a population bottleneck. Heritabilities of heat tolerance were determined for two lines of each of two source populations; two bottlenecked lines (established with one pair of fish) and two regular lines. Heat tolerance was quantified as temperature-at-death (TAD), when fish acclimated at 28A degrees C were subjected to an increase in water temperature of 2A degrees C/day. Mid-parent/mean offspring regressions and full-sib analyses were used to estimate the heritability of TAD. Heritability estimates from parent/offspring regressions ranged from 0.185 to 0.462, while those from sib analyses ranged from 0 to 0.324, with an overall estimate of 0.203 (0.230 for the regular lines, 0.168 for bottlenecked ones). Fish from the bottlenecked line from one source population (but not the other) had a lower heritability than did those from the regular line. These results show that the populations tested had some potential for adaptation to elevated water temperatures, and that this potential may be reduced following a population bottleneck. This should not be construed as evidence that natural populations will not suffer negative consequences from global warming; this study only showed that these specific populations have some potential to adapt under a very specific set of conditions.

AB  - Long-term experimental investigations of transgenerational plasticity (TGP) and transgenerational acclimatization to global change are sparse in marine invertebrates. Here, we test the effect of ocean warming and acidification over a 25-month period of Echinometra sp. A sea urchins whose parents were acclimatized at ambient or one of two near-future (projected mid and end of the 21st century) climate scenarios for 18 months. Several parameters linked to performance exhibited strong effects of future ocean conditions at 9 months of age. The Ambient-Ambient group (A-A, both F-0 and F-1 at ambient conditions) was significantly larger (21%) and faster in righting response (31%) compared to other groups. A second set of contrasts revealed near-future scenarios caused significant negative parental carryover effects. Respiration at 9 months was depressed by 59% when parents were from near-future climate conditions, and righting response was slowed by 28%. At 10 months, a selective pathogenic mortality event led to significantly higher survival rates of A-A urchins. Differences in size and respiration measured prior to the mortality were absent after the event, while a negative parental effect on righting (29% reduction) remained. The capacity to spawn at the end of the experiment was higher in individuals with ambient parents (50%) compared to other groups (21%) suggesting persistent parental effects. Obtaining different results at different points in time illustrates the importance of longer term and multigeneration studies to investigate effects of climate change. Given some animals in all groups survived the pathogenic event and that effects on physiology (but not behavior) among groups were eliminated after the mortality, we suggest that similar events could constitute selective sweeps, allowing genetic adaptation. However, given the observed negative parental effects and reduced potential for population replenishment, it remains to be determined if selection would be sufficiently rapid to rescue this species from climate change effects.

AB  - Convincing data now show that temperatures are increasing, and that changing precipitation patterns are already affecting agriculture. Predicted future impacts vary by region, but all are projected to suffer productivity declines by the late twenty-first century unless successful mitigation measures are implemented soon. Exacerbating the climate change challenge, doubling of overall crop productivity will be required by mid-century. Clearly, crop protection will become increasingly difficult as higher-yielding varieties present a larger and more tempting target to all pests, and the pests themselves extend their ranges poleward and into other new geographies owing to reduced winter kill and longer growing seasons. Fortunately, good progress on enhancing crop protection technology to meet these challenges is already being made, but the scope of this climatic provocation is such that complacency is not an option. Increased investment into new technologies and adoption of new agricultural practices with improved adaptive and mitigation potential are both essential. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The 1998 and 2016 thermal anomalies were among the 2 most severe global-scale anomalies in recent history, with broad-scale impacts on reef condition. In 2 Kenyan fully protected national park reef lagoons, the water flow, light, and temperature exposure severity of these 2 events was grossly similar at 7.3 cm s(-1), similar to 50 Einsteins m(-2) d(-1) and similar to 85 degree-days above summer baseline. Yet, despite similarities in the coral communities' metrics over this time, the bleaching responses were diminished considerably across this 17 yr period. For example, the numbers of pale and bleached colonies declined from 73 to 27% and from 96 to 60% in the low and high thermal exposure reefs, respectively. A metric that weights bleaching by the intensity of the response and the number of individuals of each taxon also found a decline from 35 to 10% and from 65 to 33%. Of the 21 most common coral taxa, 11, including major contributors to coral cover such as Porites and Acropora, showed declines in their sensitivity. Ten taxa, including Montipora and Pocillopora, showed either little or weak evidence for change in sensitivity, and 1 taxon, Acanthastrea, was more sensitive to the exposure in 2016 than in 1998. Sampling limitations and qualitative differences in the pre-peak temperature conditions did not allow separating the influences of genetic adaptation, acclimatization, and community change.

AB  - Evolutionary physiology represents an explicit fusion of two complementary approaches: evolution and physiology. Stimulated by four major intellectual and methodological developments (explicit consideration of diverse evolutionary mechanisms, phylogenetic approaches, incorporation of the perspectives and tools of evolutionary genetics and selection studies, and generalization of molecular techniques to exotic organisms), this field achieved prominence during the past decade. It addresses three major questions regarding physiological evolution: (a) What are the historical, ecological, and phylogenetic patterns of physiological evolution? (b) How important are and were each of the known evolutionary processes (natural selection, sexual selection, drift, constraint, genetic coupling/hitchhiking, and others) in engendering or Limiting physiological evolution? and(c) How do the genotype, phenotype, physiological performance, and fitness interact in influencing one another's future values? To answer these questions, evolutionary physiology examines extant and historical variation and diversity, standing genetic and phenotypic variability in populations, and past and ongoing natural selection in the wild. Also, it manipulates genotypes, phenotypes, and environments of evolving populations in the laboratory and field. Thus, evolutionary physiology represents the infusion of paradigms, techniques, and approaches of evolutionary biology, genetics, and systematics into physiology. The reciprocal infusion of physiological approaches into evolutionary biology and systematics can Likewise have great value and is a future goal.

AB  - Hypothesis: Divergence in thermal preference, in combination with temperature-related metabolic adaptations, promotes ecological specialization and co-existence of a sympatric species pair of coregonid fish.
   Background: The coregonids show substantially lower divergence in diet composition than other sympatric fish pairs in temperate freshwater lakes, but segregate vertically within the pelagic area and differ in physiology with respect to metabolism.
   Organism: Sympatric European vendace (Coregonus albula) and endemic dwarf-sized Fontane cisco (C. fontanae) from Lake Stechlin, Germany.
   Methods: We determined the final thermal preferendum (FTP) of both species previously hatched and raised under identical laboratory conditions by using a shuttle-box system that allowed the fish to control body temperature through behavioural thermoselection.
   Results: The species showed clearly different temperature selection behaviours. Vendace had a significantly higher FTP (9.0 degrees C) than Fontane cisco (4.2 degrees C). The FTPs comply with temperatures of minimum net swimming costs, suggesting that performance is optimized at the respective thermal preference of both species.
   Conclusions: The correspondence of thermal preference, thermal performance functions, and thermal ecology shows that the species are adapted to different temperature regimes.

AB  - Climate change is a continuous spatiotemporal reality, possibly endangering the viability of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) in the future. Europe emerges as an especially responsive area where the grapevine is largely recognised as one of the most important crops, playing a key environmental and socio-economic role. The mounting evidence on significant impacts of climate change on viticulture urges the scientific community in investigating the potential evolution of these impacts in the upcoming decades. In this review work, a first attempt for the compilation of selected scientific research on this subject, during a relatively recent time frame (2010-2020), is implemented. For this purpose, a thorough investigation through multiple search queries was conducted and further screened by focusing exclusively on the predicted productivity parameters (phenology timing, product quality and yield) and cultivation area alteration. Main findings on the potential impacts of future climate change are described as changes in grapevine phenological timing, alterations in grape and wine composition, heterogeneous effects on grapevine yield, the expansion into areas that were previously unsuitable for grapevine cultivation and significant geographical displacements in traditional growing areas. These compiled findings may facilitate and delineate the implementation of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, ultimately potentiating the future sustainability of European viticulture.

AB  - Author summary
   Members of the Proteobacteria are reported to adopt a survival strategy and enter a viable but non culturable (VBNC) state, when exposed to stressful or non-permissible growth conditions. This is a characteristic employed widely in the natural environment in order for bacteria to survive harsh environmental conditions over a long period. In spite of the importance of the VBNC state in microbiology, we know little about the molecular makeup of VBNC cells. In this study, using the model organism Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we resolved that distinct subpopulations of bacteria exist in the VBNC state and these have different resuscitation potentials and distinct proteomic profiles. We also discovered that deletion of the gene encoding the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (lldD) triggered the cells to enter the VBNC state, and adding lactate to VBNC cells extended their resuscitation potential window. The ability for bacteria to survive in the VBNC state might be linked to their ability to overcome oxidative stress.
   The viable but non culturable (VBNC) state is a condition in which bacterial cells are viable and metabolically active, but resistant to cultivation using a routine growth medium. We investigated the ability of V. parahaemolyticus to form VBNC cells, and to subsequently become resuscitated. The ability to control VBNC cell formation in the laboratory allowed us to selectively isolate VBNC cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting, and to differentiate subpopulations based on their metabolic activity, cell shape and the ability to cause disease in Galleria mellonella. Our results showed that two subpopulations (P1 and P2) of V. parahaemolyticus VBNC cells exist and can remain dormant in the VBNC state for long periods. VBNC subpopulation P2, had a better fitness for survival under stressful conditions and showed 100% revival under favourable conditions. Proteomic analysis of these subpopulations (at two different time points: 12 days (T12) and 50 days (T50) post VBNC) revealed that the proteome of P2 was more similar to that of the starting microcosm culture (T0) than the proteome of P1. Proteins that were significantly up or down-regulated between the different VBNC populations were identified and differentially regulated proteins were assigned into 23 functional groups, the majority being assigned to metabolism functional categories. A lactate dehydrogenase (lldD) protein, responsible for converting lactate to pyruvate, was significantly upregulated in all subpopulations of VBNC cells. Deletion of the lactate dehydrogenase (RIMD2210633:Delta lldD) gene caused cells to enter the VBNC state significantly more quickly compared to the wild-type, and adding lactate to VBNC cells aided their resuscitation and extended the resuscitation window. Addition of pyruvate to the RIMD2210633:Delta lldD strain restored the wild-type VBNC formation profile. This study suggests that lactate dehydrogenase may play a role in regulating the VBNC state.

AB  - Symbiosis is prevalent throughout the tree of life and has had a significant impact on the ecology and evolution of many bacteria and eukaryotes. The benevolence of symbiotic interactions often varies with the environment, and such variation is expected to play an important role in shaping the prevalence and distributions of symbiosis throughout nature. In this study, we examine how the fitness of aphids is influenced by infection with one of three maternally transmitted bacteria, 'Candidatus Serratia symbiotica', 'Candidatus Hamiltonella defensa' and 'Candidatus Regiella insecticola', addressing how symbiont benevolence varies with temperature. We find that the effects of these 'secondary' symbionts on Acyrthosiphon pisum depend on when and whether aphids are exposed to a brief period of heat shock. We also demonstrate that symbionts-even closely related isolates-vary in their effects on hosts. Our results indicate similar effects of S. symbiotica and H. defensa in conferring tolerance to high temperatures and a liability of R. insecticola under these same conditions. These findings reveal a role for heritable symbionts in the adaptation of aphids to their abiotic environments and add to an expanding body of knowledge on the adaptive significance of symbiosis.

AB  - South Africa has large deposit of coal that supports about 95% of electric power generation in the country. The fuel is fast depleting, though the current reserve may serve for the next century. However, the emissions from the coal projects huge threat to the environment. Similarly, the country has abundant solid wastes that can be co-gasified with coal to H-2 enriched syngas for clean energy production. A 5 MW combined heat and power plant was studied using different coal-to-solid waste ratios of 1:1, 3:2, and 4:1 and economy of the plant was evaluated with feedstock costing (WFC) and without feedstock costing (WOFC). The lower heating value of the fuels, determined from a model equation was applied to estimate the annual feedstock requirement and the feed rate. Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period (PBP) were used to evaluate the viability of the power generation at the 10th, 11th, 17th and 18th year business periods. The predicted optimum period of the plant is the 10th year. The use of Coal + Pine saw-dust (PSD) blend of blend ratio 1:1, is the most attractive feedstock for the energy generation. A higher profit of about 13.82%, and 23.56% were estimated for the use of Coal + PSD as compared to the use of 100% Matla coal at WFC and WOFC, thus; enabling a savings of about 1,868.81 t feedstock per annum. The use of Coal + PSD blend of blend ratio 1:1 reduces the CO, CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions by 3.4%, 23.28%, 22.9%, and 0.55%, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Because magmatism conveys radioactive isotopes plus latent heat rapidly upwards while advecting heat, this process, not convection, links and controls Earth's thermal and chemical evolution. On this basis, we present an alternative view of Earth's internal workings. Earth's beginning involved cooling via explosive outgassing of substantial ice (mainly CO) buried with dust during accretion. High carbon content is expected from Solar abundances and ice in comets. Reaction of CO with metal provided a carbide-rich core while converting MgSiO3 to olivine via oxidizing reactions. Because thermodynamic law indicates that primordial heat from gravitational segregation is neither large, nor carried downwards, whereas differentiation forced radioactive elements upwards, formation of the core and lower mantle greatly cooled the Earth. Reference conductive geotherms, calculated by using accurate thermal diffusivity data, require that heat-producing elements are sequestered above 670 km which limits convection to the upper mantle.
   These irreversible beginnings limit secular cooling to radioactive wind-down, permitting deduction of Earth's inventory of heat-producing elements from today's heat flux. Coupling this estimate with meteoritic data indicates that Earth's oxide content has been underestimated. Density sorting segregated a Si-rich, peridotitic upper mantle from a refractory lower mantle with high Ca, Al and Ti contents, consistent with diamond inclusion mineralogy. Early and rapid differentiation means that internal temperatures have long been buffered by freezing of the inner core, allowing survival of crust as old as similar to 4 Ga. Magmatism remains important. Melt escaping through stress-induced fractures in the rigid lithosphere imparts a lateral component and preferred direction to upper mantle circulation. Mid-ocean magma production over 4.5 Ga has deposited a slab volume at 670 km that is equivalent to the transition zone, thereby continuing differentiation by creating a late-stage chemical discontinuity near 400 km.

AB  - Overheating in buildings arising from climatic extreme heat events has been identified as a health concern to vulnerable occupants. However, there have been very limited studies to generate suitable weather data to evaluate by simulation the overheating risk and its effect on the comfort and health of occupants. This paper develops a methodology to identify reference summer weather years (RSWY) for overheating risk analysis. The methodology includes generation of historical climate data, and development of a heat stress metric for the definition and characterization of heat events. The Standard Effective Temperature was selected among a short list of popular metrics, modified and named t-SET to account for transient heat events, activity levels of occupants, and thermoregulatory controls of sleeping subjects. The t-SET model predictions compared well with measured body temperatures of subjects undergoing multi-stage activities under hot conditions. The t-SET index was used to generate RSWY for selected Canadian cities.

AB  - The Coal Authority operates over 70 mine water treatment schemes across the UK and treats around 100 billion litres of mine water per annum to protect the water environment. Funded by the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change to manage the legacy of historic coal mining in Britain, the Authority is challenged to build new mine water treatment schemes within a flat line budget.
   In 2015, the Coal Authority commenced an innovation work stream to accelerate efficiencies and generate income to off-set costs. This programme ambitiously aims to deliver the UK coal mine water treatment programme without government funding and with improved environmental benefits. These aims will be achieved through efficiencies, income generation, adopting transferable technologies, using renewable energy and introducing step-change innovation.
   To achieve this aim step changes are needed in terms of design and operation of schemes, but also in terms to how the water and by products are considered. Step-change designs include the adoption of small footprint schemes with minimal chemical dosing requirements and below ground schemes. Aeration and degassing technologies are being progressed to accelerate iron deposition rates.
   By products for reuse include mine water for non-drinking purposes; over 63 MW of low carbon recoverable heat and over 4,000 dry tonnes of ferrous hydroxide ochre produced each year. A Ferrous Hydroxide Product Project is underway aiming to cease disposal to landfill and deliver commercial uses for this material. Options for re-use include phosphate management in rivers, agriculture and wastewater treatment, and conversion into pigments and coagulants. Commercially viability requires innovation throughout the product development process including in desludging, dewatering and processing.
   Approaching mine water as an asset and understanding the value of benefits delivered by mine water treatment is helping the Coal Authority ensure the long-term sustainability of mine water treatment in the UK.

AB  - This paper introduces an innovative and cost-effective multi-generation plant, driven by the central receiverbased concentrated solar systems, to facilitate the desired global green-transition process. The vanadium chlorine thermochemical cycle, which uses hydrogen instead of natural gas in the combustion chamber, is used as an innovative approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed system also includes a thermoelectric generator (TEG) for excess power generation and a multi-effect desalination (MED) unit to reduce exergy loss. The suggested system's technological, economic, and environmental metrics are analyzed and compared to a similar system that stores the created hydrogen rather than burning it in the combustion chamber. Furthermore, the viability of the studied model is investigated under the optimal operating condition, using the example of Sevilla in order to make the conclusions more reliable. According to the findings, the suggested novel configuration is a better alternative in terms of cost and environmental impact owing to decreased product energy costs and CO2 emissions. The outcomes further indicate that the substitution of the condenser with TEG leads to considerably higher power production. According to the optimization findings, the multi-objective grey wolf algorithm is the best optimization strategy compared to the non-dominated genetic and particle swarm approaches. At the best optimization point, 2.5% higher exergy efficiency, 1 $/GJ cheaper product energy cost, and 0.12 kg/kWh lower levelized CO2 emission are achieved compared to the operating condition. The Sankey diagram indicates that the solar heliostat system has the highest irreversibility. The exergy analysis results further reveal that the flue gas condensation process through the Rankine cycle and MED unit lead to a 53.2% reduction in exergy loss. Finally, considerable CO2 emission reductions show that the suggested new method is an effective solution for cleaner energy production in warmer climate countries.

AB  - The production of nitrous oxide, N2O, via NH3 oxidation is not on a practical scale due to the lack of a suitable catalyst. Instead, it is produced via thermal decomposition of NH4NO3, rendering N2O too costly and limiting its prospective uses. Herein, we report CeO2-supported Au nanoparticles (2-3 nm) as a highly selective catalyst for low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher space-time yield than the state-of-the-art Mn-Bi/alpha-Al2O3 and remarkable stability over 70 h on stream. The reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, with the density of interfacial Au delta+ species and the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 identified as the key performance descriptors. The latter could be enhanced by cobalt doping, improving the catalytic activity and setting a new benchmark for N2O productivity. These findings establish NH3 oxidation as an efficient process for N2O manufacture and facilitate its broader utilization in selective oxidations.

AB  - Mortality responses of 2 species of fruit fly, Bactrocera melanotus (Coquillett) and B. xanthodes (Broun), to heat treatments were investigated using hot water immersion. The eggs (young or mature), 1st, 2nd, and 3 ages (early-, mid-, and late-aged) of 3rd instars were immersed in hot water at selected temperatures in the range 43-48 degrees C. B. melanotus mature eggs were more heat-tolerant than all other life stages of either fruit fly species except B. xanthodes early-aged 3rd instars at 48 degrees C, where the difference was not significant. At temperatures less than or equal to 45 degrees C, 1st instars of both fruit fly species were more heat tolerant than 3rd instars (all ages), whereas at 48 degrees C the estimated times for 99% mortality for 1st and 3rd instars were similar. B. xanthodes young eggs were significantly less tolerant to heat than all other life stages of the same species, whereas for B. melanotus young eggs were less tolerant to heat than late-aged 3rd instars, 1st instars, or mature eggs. B. melanotus eggs were more heat tolerant than B. xanthodes eggs, whereas the reverse was true for larval stages.

AB  - Urban areas are usually warmer than their surrounding natural areas, an effect known as the urban heat island effect. As such, they are particularly vulnerable to global warming and associated increases in extreme temperatures. Yet ensemble climate-model projections are generally performed on a scale that is too coarse to represent the evolution of temperatures in cities. Here, for the first time, we combine unprecedented long-term (35years) urban climate model integrations at the convection-permitting scale (2.8km resolution) with information from an ensemble of general circulation models to assess temperature-based heat stress for Belgium, a densely populated midlatitude maritime region. We discover that the heat stress increase toward the mid-21st century is twice as large in cities compared to their surrounding rural areas. The exacerbation is driven by the urban heat island itself, its concurrence with heat waves, and urban expansion. Cities experience a heat stress multiplication by a factor 1.4 and 15 depending on the scenario. Remarkably, the future heat stress surpasses everywhere the urban hot spots of today. Our results demonstrate the need to combine information from climate models, acting on different scales, for climate change risk assessment in heterogeneous regions. Moreover, these results highlight the necessity for adaptation to increasing heat stress, especially in urban areas.

AB  - Thermal characteristics have a critical influence on the working stability, control accuracy, and even service life of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based clutch. The present study aims to reveal the thermal characteristics of a proposed liquid-cooled MR clutch under various operating conditions. In this paper, theoretical analyses of heating and heat dissipation of the MR clutch was performed firstly. Then a steady temperature simulation was carried out on the MR clutch, followed by a detailed illustration of the experiments, including MR fluid selection, experimental content and procedure. Thereafter, several heating tests were conducted on the MR clutch, and experimental results concerning the slip power loss of the clutch, temperature variation of the MR fluid, temperature effect on the torque output, and maximum allowable slip power of the clutch were presented and discussed. Experimental results indicate that the proposed liquid cooling method can effectively assist in the heat dissipation of the clutch. Moreover, the temperature increase can lead to a reduction of both the viscous torque and total output torque, especially after long-term service. Furthermore, the allowable steady slip power of the clutch is 35 kW and the allowable transient slip power reaches up to 53.2 kW for a slip time of 120 s under the present experimental conditions.

AB  - Cratons stabilized in the Archean because their mantle roots remained strong despite temperatures in the convecting mantle and amounts of radiogenic elements in the crust and in the lithospheric mantle that were larger than today. Thermal evolutionary models are developed using constraints from heat flow and heat production data in Archean provinces. The large time-scale of diffusive heat transport implies that the lithospheric mantle can remain thermally decoupled from the crust for as long as 1 Gyr. Heat production in the lithospheric mantle is a key variable in determining thermal conditions that permit stabilization of the crust and the preservation of a thick cratonic mantle root.
   Archean provinces are currently characterized by low heat flow, with an average of 41 MW m(-2) less than the global continental average (56 mW m(-2)). The range of regionally averaged heat flow values in Archean provinces (18-54 mW m(-2)) is narrower than in Proterozoic and Paleozoic terranes. However, at the end of the Archean, when crustal heat production was double the present value, surface heat flow would have varied over a range (approximate to 45-90 mW m(-2)) at least as wide as that presently observed in Paleozoic provinces. The high crustal heat production during the Archean is not sufficient to account for elevated lower crustal temperatures recorded in some metamorphic assemblages without some additional heat input, or without the crust being thicker, or the vertical distribution of radioelements being different from today's.
   Thermal models and the observed correlation between the degree of upper crustal enrichment and heat production values indicate that crustal melting and differentiation were largely driven by heating due to insitu radiogenic heat production. Even for values of the surface heat flow higher than average in cratons, the crust can be stabilized before 2.5 Ga if the radioelements are confined to shallow crustal layers. For present surface heat flow of 40-45 MW m(-2), calculations indicate that, prior to differentiation, the lowermost crust was near the solidus.
   Present heat production in the mantle root is constrained by estimates of the mantle heat flow. Further constraints can be obtained by modeling the past thermal regime of the root when heat production was higher. If heat generation is high and/or if the root is thick, the lower lithosphere must have cooled more rapidly than the convecting mantle, which implies that the temperature gradient was inverted at the base of the lithosphere and a weak mechanical layer formed in the middle of the root, precluding its survival. A low temperature gradient at the base of the root leads to the development of convective instabilities and possible removal of the lowermost part.
   Following its isolation from the convecting mantle and stabilization, thick continental lithosphere adjusts slowly to in-situ heat production and basal heat supply. We show that, due to in-situ heat production, temperatures in the lithospheric mantle may rise above their initial values inherited from the process of root formation due to in-situ radiogenic heat production.

AB  - This paper presents an improved version of Linear Population Size Reduction Success History Based Adaptive Differential Evolution (LSHADE) algorithm for solving global optimization problems. Fitness Distance Balance (FDB) selection method was used to redesign the mutation operator in order to enhance the search performance of the LSHADE algorithm. In order to test and validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a comprehensive experimental study was carried out. For this purpose, it was tested on the CEC14 and CEC17 benchmark problems, consisting of different problem types and dimensions. Results of the FDB-LSHADE was compared to the performance of 8 other up-to-date and highly preferred metaheuristic search (MHS) algorithms. According to Friedman test results, the proposed FDBLSHADE algorithm ranked first among the all competing algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm was used to solve single- and multi-objective energy hub economic dispatch (EHED) problems, which were a non-convex, a nonlinear, and high dimensional problems. To analyze the results of the proposed algorithm obtained from experimental studies, two non-parametric statistical methods, which are Wilcoxon and Friedman tests, were used. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm were compared to the results of the 8 other MHS algorithms. The results demonstrated that the FDB-LSHADE was a superior performance compared to other MHS algorithms for solving both benchmark and EHED problems.

AB  - Liolaemus elongatus and Phymaturus patagonicus are viviparous lizards syntopic in the rock promontories of the and Patagonia exposed to seasonal extremes, short activity seasons and long submergence periods. L. elongatus is a slender lizard mainly heliothermic, which occupies a variety of microhabitats and has a widespread distribution. P. patagonicus, instead is a tigmotherm and flat body lizard which lives only in the clefts of rock promontories and has a restricted distribution to the north west Patagonia. In the present work, the field and selected body temperature and their thermal tolerance are explored. L. elongatus shows a higher plasticity than P. patagonicus in the use of the microhabitats, the heat acquisition, and the activity timetables. However both species show low field and selected body temperature compared to most lizards (30 degrees C). These results reinforce the hypothesis between reproduction and body temperature postulated by previous works on reproductive biology of both species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estuaries are subject to high environmental variability coupled to tidal salinity shifts. Under restricted freshwater flow and prolonged drought conditions, salinity may exceed natural ranges and thus organisms may experience stressful hypersaline conditions. This study assessed the physiology of a juvenile marine estuarine-dependent species Rhabdosargus holubi (Family: Sparidae) under changing salinity to determine the impact on respiration and survival under shock and acclimatisation exposures. Oxygen consumption was not significantly different in the 2.5 to 45 salinity range and the interaction between temperature and salinity was not significant at the moderate levels tested. This confirmed the strong osmoregulatory capabilities of marine estuarine-dependent R. holubi. However, respiration was impacted at salinities of 55-62.5. The salinity tolerance ranges of R. holubi were expanded beyond those previously observed in the laboratory, to a maximum of 77 when fish were gradually exposed to daily 20% incremental changes. This indicated the ability to adapt to hypersaline conditions that occur gradually in anthropogenically altered estuaries which is an important aspect for management decisions regarding freshwater inputs. The adaptability of Rhabdosargus holubi to hypersaline conditions in estuaries may thereby ensure the maintenance of populations in the short term under certain environmental conditions, such as those currently occurring in a freshwater-scarce South Africa. However, in the long term and at more extreme salinities (> 55), the physiology of R. holubi and similar species may be compromised, thus placing the species at risk.

AB  - New developments on hot and dense QCD in effective field theories are reviewed. Recent investigations in lattice gauge theories for the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes suggest survival hadrons in restored phase of chiral symmetry. We discuss expected properties of those bound states in a medium using chiral approaches. We also examine the role of higher-lying hadrons near chiral symmetry restoration from the conventional and the holographic points of view. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report the kinetic characterization of a previously unidentified pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in extracts from Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. This activity was about 74% of the activity of pyruvate phosphate dikinase. EhPK differed from most PKs in that its pH optimum was 5.5-6.5 and was inhibited by high PEP concentrations (1-5 mM); these are concentrations at which PK is usually assayed. The optimal temperature was above 40degreesC with negligible activity below 20degreesC. EhPK exhibited hyperbolic kinetics with respect to both PEP (K-m = 0.018 mM) and ADP (K-m = 1.05 mM). However, it exhibited a sigmoidal behavior with respect to PEP at sub-saturating ADP concentrations. EhPK did not require monovalent cations for activity. Fructose-1,6 bisphosphate was a potent non-essential activator; it increased the affinity for ADP without modification of the V a or the affinity for PEP. Phosphate, citrate, malate, and alpha-ketoglutarate significantly inhibited EhPK activity. A putative EhPK gene fragment found in EhDNA was analyzed. The data indicate that E. histolytica trophozoites contain an active PK, which might contribute to the generation of glycolytic ATP for parasite survival. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Third-generation oriental armyworm larvae, Mythimna separata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), have caused considerable economic losses in Jilin. Understanding the occurrence, regularity and return movement of third-generation adults is crucial for pest forecasting. The study was conducted using systemic monitoring, radar observations and molecular markers from 2015 to 2019. The main results are as follows: (1) third-generation moths were regularly captured from late August to late September. These moths have been attributed to local emergence and were identified as an "emigration population." Wind speed and temperature were advantageous for moth migration, and advantageous northeasterly winds account for 9.6% of the total. Radar studies determined that the migrant flying height was mainly below 600 m. Moths migrated over a range of directions, including their return movements. Forward trajectories predicted that the destination regions of the Korean Peninsula, the Russian Far East, and northern China were unfavorable for survival. (2) A total of 29 haplotypes were detected. There were unique haplotypes between two sampling years. The haplotype analysis indicated similar content in the two sampling years. The haplotype diversity indices appear to have been maintained. Overall, our findings indicate that the moths did not make a successful return flight, but the genetic diversity was unaffected.

AB  - We studied the influence of environmental factors relating to climate, soil and vegetation cover on total species richness, species richness of different life-forms and species composition of plant communities occurring in Quercus ilex woodlands, across a 450-km long transect in Northern Algeria constituting a gradient of aridity and human use. We sampled vegetation and collected environmental data in 81 10 m x 10 m plots in five zones representing the largest Q. ilex woodlands throughout the study area, analysing them within an a priori hypothesis framework with the use of Path Analysis. Changes in plant diversity were mainly influenced by environmental factors related to precipitation and temperature regimes, as well as by total plant cover. In particular, changes in species composition were determined by factors associated with the temperature regime through their influence on both woody and annual herbaceous plant richness, and by factors related to the precipitation regime through their influence on perennial herbaceous plant richness, likely due to the differential tolerances of these functional groups to cold and water stress. Our results emphasize the importance of differences in environmental adaptability of the most important life-forms with regard to explaining compositional change (beta diversity) along aridity gradients, and the mediator role of total plant cover in relation to the effects of soil conditions on plant diversity.

AB  - Intraspecific assisted migration (ISAM) through seed transfer during artificial forest regeneration has been suggested as an adaptation strategy to enhance forest resilience and productivity under future climate. In this study, we assessed the risks and benefits of ISAM in white spruce based on long-term and multilocation, rangewide provenance test data. Our results indicate that the adaptive capacity and growth potential of white spruce varied considerably among 245 range-wide provenances sampled across North America; however, the results revealed that local populations could be outperformed by nonlocal ones. Provenances originating from south-central Ontario and southwestern Quebec, Canada, close to the southern edge of the species' natural distribution, demonstrated superior growth in more northerly environments compared with local populations and performed much better than populations from western Canada and Alaska, United States. During the 19-28 years between planting and measurement, the southern provenances have not been more susceptible to freezing damage compared with local populations, indicating they have the potential to be used now for the reforestation of more northerly planting sites; based on changing temperature, these seed sources potentially could maintain or increase white spruce productivity at or above historical levels at northern sites. A universal response function (URF), which uses climatic variables to predict provenance performance across field trials, indicated a relatively weak relationship between provenance performance and the climate at provenance origin. Consequently, the URF from this study did not provide information useful to ISAM. The ecological and economic importance of conserving white spruce genetic resources in south-central Ontario and southwestern Quebec for use in ISAM is discussed.

AB  - Here, we report a detailed analysis of changes in gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster selected for ecologically relevant environmental stress resistance traits. We analysed females from seven replicated selection regimes and one control regime using whole genome gene expression arrays. When compared with gene expression profiles of control lines, we were able to detect consistent selection responses at the transcript level in each specific selection regime and also found a group of differentially expressed genes that were changed among all selected lines. Replicated selection lines showed similar changes in gene expression (compared with controls) and thus showed that 10 generations of artificial selection give a clear signal with respect to the resulting gene expression profile. The changes in gene expression in lines selected for increased longevity, desiccation and starvation resistance, respectively, showed high similarities. Cold resistance-selected lines showed little differentiation from controls. Different methods of heat selection (heat survival, heat knock down and constant 30 degrees C) showed little similarity verifying that different mechanisms are involved in high temperature adaptation. For most individual selection regimes, and in the comparison of all selected lines and controls, the gene expression changes were exclusively in one direction, although the different selection regimes varied in the direction of response. The responses to selection restricted to individual selection regimes can be interpreted as stress specific, whereas the response shared among all selected lines can be considered as a general stress response. Here, we identified genes belonging to both types of responses to selection for stress resistance.

AB  - The objective of this study was to manipulate ventilation rate to characterize interactions between stocks of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) and ventilation setting on varroa mite (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman) mortality in honey bee colonies kept indoors over winter. The first experiment used colonies established from stock selected locally for wintering performance under exposure to varroa (n = 6) and unselected bees (n = 6) to assess mite and bee mortality and levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O-2) in the bee cluster when kept under a simulated winter condition at 5 degrees C. The second experiment, used colonies from selected bees (n = 10) and unselected bees (n = 12) that were exposed to either standard ventilation (14.4 liter/min per hive) or restricted ventilation (0.24 liter/min per hive, in a Plexiglas ventilation chamber) during a 16-d treatment period to assess the influence of restricted air flow on winter mortality rates of varroa mites and honey bees. Experiment 2 was repeated in early, mid-, and late winter. The first experiment showed that under unrestricted ventilation with CO2 concentrations averaging < 2% there was no correlation between CO2 and varroa mite mortality when colonies were placed under low temperature. CO2 was negatively correlated with O-2 in the bee cluster in both experiments. When ventilation was restricted, mean CO2 level (3.82 +/- 0.31%, range 0.43-8.44%) increased by 200% relative to standard ventilation (1.29 +/- 0.31%; range 0.09-5.26%) within the 16-d treatment period. The overall mite mortality rates and the reduction in mean abundance of varroa mite over time was greater under restricted ventilation (37 +/- 4.2%) than under standard ventilation (23 +/- 4.2%) but not affected by stock of bees during the treatment period. Selected bees showed overall greater mite mortality relative to unselected bees in both experiments. Restricting ventilation increased mite mortality, but did not affect worker bee mortality relative to that for colonies under standard ventilation. Restricted ventilation did not affect the overall level of Nosema compared with the control. However, there was an interaction between stock, season, and time of the trial. Unselected stock showed an increase in Nosema over time in the late winter trial that did not occur in the selected stock. In conclusion, these findings suggested that restricted ventilation has potential to suppress varroa mite in overwintering honey bee colonies via a low-cost and environmentally friendly measure.

AB  - In the cold regions of China, lignin-rich corn straw accumulates at high levels due to low temperatures. The application of psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria should be an effective means of overcoming the low-temperature limit for lignin degradation and promoting the utilization of corn straw. However, this application is limited by the lack of suitable strains for decomposition of lignin; furthermore, the metabolic mechanism of psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria is unclear. Here, the whole genome of the psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacterium Arthrobacter sp. C2, isolated in our previous work, was sequenced. Comparative genomics revealed that C2 contained unique genes related to lignin degradation and low-temperature adaptability. DyP may participate in lignin degradation and may be a cold-adapted enzyme. Moreover, DyP was proven to catalyze lignin C alpha-C beta bond cleavage. Deletion and complementation of the DyP gene verified its ability to catalyze the first-step reaction of lignin degradation. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that the transcriptional expression of the DyP gene was upregulated, and the genetic compensation mechanism allowed C2 Delta DyP to degrade lignin, which provided novel insights into the survival strategy of the psychrotrophic mutant strain C2 Delta dyP. This study improved our understanding of the metabolic mechanism of psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria and provided potential application options for energy-saving production using cold-adapted lignin-degrading enzymes.

AB  - Bioceramics are widely used materials as filling bone and implants, which can be classified into three groups according to their reactivity with the body fluid and its interaction with the bone tissue: bioinert, resorbable or bioactive. Within the last class mentioned are bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics.
   One of the most researched topics in this area is based on ensuring the ability of the implant to long term survival, as well as improves its mechanical properties. Hence, glass-ceramics are produced by a controlled crystallization of a glass, which enables to obtain very small crystallite sizes, that increases considerably the mechanical resistance and durability of the material. The SiO2-CaO-P2O5-Na2O system is the most widely used for the production of bioactive glasses, which can be added to other compounds such as Al2O3 that, forming part of some crystal phase in the glass-ceramic, that can provide improved mechanical properties.
   In this work, two glasses were prepared starting from commercial Bioglass composition, adding potassium and aluminum. Both were included in the formulation by means of purified feldspar. Performed tests were differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction in order to follow up thermal transformation and to reveal the developed phases after such treatments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Background. Glucose degradation products (GDPs) are formed during heat sterilization of peritoneal dialysis fluid and, to a lesser extent, during their prolonged storage. In vitro studies have demonstrated that GDPs impair functions of peritoneal mesothelial cells, including proliferation, viability and cytokine release. In the present study, we studied the acute effect of GDPs on the expression of tight junction-associated protein, zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1), in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC). The role of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced by GDPs in the expression of ZO-1 was also examined.
   Methods. HPMC were cultured with GDPs, including 2-furaldehyde (FurA), methylglyoxal (M-Glx) and 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene (3,4-DGE). The expression of ZO-1 and the synthesis of VEGF were examined. To define the role of VEGF on the regulation of ZO-1 expression, HPMC were cultured with GDPs in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody to VEGF. The signal pathways involved in VEGF synthesis induced by GDPs were also characterized.
   Results. ZO-1 expression in HPMC was downregulated in a time- and dose-dependent manner following culture with subtoxic concentrations of GDPs (FurA, M-Glx and 3,4-DGE). All three GDPs increased VEGF synthesis in HPMC. Exogenous VEGF downregulated the expression of ZO-1 and neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody reversed the effect of GDPs on ZO-1 expression in HPMC, suggesting the action of GDPs on ZO-1 expression was mediated by VEGF. All three GDPs activated the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathways. The GDP-induced VEGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta synthesis in HPMC was partially reduced by either the p42/p44 MAPK inhibitor (PD98059) or the PKC inhibitor (staurosporine). More importantly, the VEGF and TGF-beta synthesis induced by GDPs in HPMC was completely blocked by synergistic action of both inhibitors.
   Conclusions. We have demonstrated that short-term exposure to GDPs downregulates ZO-1 expression in HPMC through the generation of VEGF. Our study provides evidence that GDPs can directly induce VEGF and TGF-beta production in HPMC through the activation of p42/44 MAPK and PKC signal transduction pathways.

AB  - While the effect of the global biodiversity crisis on local species loss is still debated, there is empirical evidence for major changes in local biodiversity attributed to increased species turnover. In communities exposed to a climate stressor, species turnover can lead to increased dominance of well-adapted species and consequently to an overall decline in species diversity. Despite the known importance of species turnover for community dynamics and functioning, experimental results on the connection between biodiversity loss and species turnover are scarce. We still do not fully understand which specific factors increase the rate of change in species composition, especially when considering natural compared to artificially lab assembled communities. In the present study, we experimentally tested whether a heatwave and dispersal increased species turnover and decreased species diversity in natural benthic diatom communities with different initial species compositions. We found that on the local scale, dispersal had overall positive effects on species richness while the relationship between exposure to the heatwave, species turnover, and diversity depended on initial community composition. However, on the regional (i.e. metacommunity) scale, exposure to the heatwave and dispersal both increased turnover and decreased Shannon diversity by almost 50%. Turnover in these metacommunities was not caused by a loss of species, but rather by a change in dominance patterns leading to homogenization, and consequently decreased diversity. Our study shows that climate change can destabilize community composition and degrade species diversity, but still after ca. 15 generations does not decrease the number of species in the community, demonstrating that the response of species diversity and richness to changing conditions can be fundamentally decoupled on ecological time scales.

AB  - A R&D programme has been launched addressing the needs of the development of an indirect cycle flexible modular HTR operating at 850 degrees C for electricity generation and/or heat production for industrial processes. In the frame of this program, several significant technical challenges required to demonstrate the viability and performance of the system have been successfully addressed. Design and safety analysis needed the development of computational tools, therefore reactor physics, and thermo-fluid dynamics codes have been developed and are now in the process of being validated in the frame of international code-to-code and code to experiment benchmarks.
   Most importantly, the performance of the HTR/VHTR fuel identified as TRISO-coated particle must prove to be excellent in operating as well as accidental conditions. A manufacturing and quality control process has been developed and now fuel qualification based on irradiation and heating safety tests is being prepared on the basis of irradiation programs in France and in the frame of the GENERATION IV International Forum (GIF) as well as the development of fuel behaviour models including performance data, failure particle prediction and long-term integrity of the coating.
   Material and component technologies have been investigated in normal and accident conditions for V/HTR objectives. Significant progress has been made for vessel structures and reactor core structural elements. Major challenges still lie ahead for plate type compact intermediate heat exchangers, especially at temperatures above 850 degrees C, but an alternative solution with helical tubes is also being developed. In order to demonstrate that materials have adequate performance over long service life under impure helium environment and constraints, the research programme focuses on microstructural and mechanical property data, long-term irradiation behaviour, corrosion, modelling and codification of design rules as well as qualification of components in representative helium test loops. The potential of this type of reactor for higher performances in terms of fuel burn-up and temperature (VHTR objective) has been explored, in particular for application to hydrogen production. The major research axes on hydrogen production technologies include the development and optimization of high temperature electrolysis and thermo-chemical water splitting processes such as sulphur/iodine or hybrid sulphur. Alternative thermo-chemical hydrogen generation processes operating at lower temperatures are also investigated.
   This paper addresses the R&D work performed since 2001 and the future work anticipated until 2012, where decisions about a demonstrator could be made at a European level within the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technological Platform (SNE-TP). This program is strongly connected to the Euratom Framework Programmes as well as to GIF.

AB  - Shared host cells can serve as melting pots for viral genomes, giving many phylogenies a web-like appearance due to horizontal gene transfer. However, not all virus families exhibit web-like phylogenies. Microviruses form three distinct clades, represented by phi X174, G4, and alpha 3. Here, we investigate protein-based barriers to horizontal gene transfer between clades. We transferred gene G, which encodes a structural protein, between phi X174 and G4, and monitored the evolutionary recovery of the resulting chimeras. In both cases, particle assembly was the major barrier after gene transfer. The G4 phi XG chimera displayed a temperature-sensitive assembly defect that could easily be corrected through single mutations that promote productive assembly. Gene transfer in the other direction was more problematic. The initial phi XG4G chimera required an exogenous supply of both the phi X174 major spike G and DNA pilot H proteins. Elevated DNA pilot protein levels may be required to compensate for off-pathway reactions that may have become thermodynamically and/or kinetically favored when the foreign spike protein was present. After three targeted genetic selections, the foreign spike protein was productively integrated into the phi X174 background. The first adaption involved a global decrease in gene expression. This was followed by modifications affecting key protein-protein interactions that govern assembly. Finally, gene expression was re-elevated. Although the first selection suppresses nonproductive reactions, subsequent selections promote productive assembly and ultimately viability. However, viable chimeric strains exhibited reduced fitness compared with wild-type. This chimera's path to recovery may partially explain how unusual recombinant viruses could persist long enough to naturally emerge.

AB  - In recent decades, soil erosion by water has become a worldwide problem, especially with climate change and progressive declines in the ratio of natural resources to human populations. Changes in future climate will influence soil erosion, particularly suspended sediment (SS) yield, and alter the effectiveness of water resources management strategies from a water quality perspective. We qualitatively assessed future changes in SS yield in Japan. We focused on the impacts of future hydrological changes projected by two models, the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) and the Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-GCM), whose results have produced monthly data sets for the whole of Japan. The impacts of future climate changes on SS in Japan depend on the balance between changes in climatic and geologic factors. Methods for assessing impact using the catchment simulator were expanded to estimate the SS yield for the whole of Japan. The results indicated that SS generation will increase by the 2090s, with an 8% increase predicted using MRI-GCM data and a 24% increase using MIROC data, compared to present-day values measured by the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMEDAS) of the Japan Meteorological Agency. Analysis by month showed the largest increases in SS in September, related to the frequency of extreme events such as typhoons. Increased SS can have negative effects on both society and the environment, including reduced crop productivity, worsened water quality, lower effective reservoir water levels, flooding and habitat destruction. Prediction of the impacts of future climate change on SS generation is crucial for effective environmental planning and management (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction:Individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV) can be partly attributed to genetic factors that may be more pronounced during stress. Using data from the Oman Family Study (OFS), we aimed to estimate and quantify the relative contribution of genes and environment to the variance of HRV at rest and during stress; calculate the overlap in genetic and environmental influences on HRV at rest and under stress using bivariate analyses of HRV parameters and heart rate (HR).Methods:Time and frequency domain HRV variables and average HR were measured from beat-to-beat HR obtained from electrocardiogram recordings at rest and during two stress tests [mental: Word Conflict Test (WCT) and physical: Cold Pressor Test (CPT)] in the OFS - a multigenerational pedigree consisting of five large Arab families with a total of 1326 participants. SOLAR software was used to perform quantitative genetic modelling.Results:Heritability estimates for HRV and HR ranged from 0.11 to 0.31 for rest, 0.09-0.43 for WCT, and 0.07-0.36 for CPT. A large part of the genetic influences during rest and stress conditions were shared with genetic correlations ranging between 0.52 and 0.86 for rest-WCT and 0.60-0.92 for rest-CPT. Nonetheless, genetic rest-stress correlations for most traits were significantly smaller than 1 indicating some stress-specific genetic effects.Conclusion:Genetic factors significantly influence HRV and HR at rest and under stress. Most of the genetic factors that influence HRV at rest also influence HRV during stress tests, although some unique genetic variance emerges during these challenging conditions.

AB  - Both proteins and RNAs can misfold into non-functional conformations. Protein chaperones promote native folding of nascent polypeptides and re-folding of misfolded species, thereby buffering mutations that compromise protein structure and function. Here we show that RNA chaperones can also act as mutation buffers that enhance organismal fitness. Using competition assays, we demonstrate that overexpression of select RNA chaperones, including three DEAD box RNA helicases (CsdA, SrmB, RhlB) and the cold shock protein CspA, improves fitness of two independently evolved E. coli mutator strains that have accumulated deleterious mutations during short-and long-term laboratory evolution. We identify strain-specific mutations that are deleterious and subject to buffering when introduced individually into the ancestral genotype. For DEAD box RNA helicases we show that buffering requires helicase activity, implicating RNA structural remodelling in the buffering process. Our results suggest that RNA chaperones might play a fundamental role in RNA evolution and evolvability.

AB  - Mixed mountain forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) cover a total area of more than 10 million hectares in Europe. Due to altitudinal zoning, these forests are particularly vulnerable to climate change. However, as little is known about the long-term development of the productivity and the adaptation and mitigation potential of these forest systems in Europe, reliable information on productivity is required for sustainable forest management. Using generalized additive mixed models this study investigated 60 long-term experimental plots and provides information about the productivity of mixed mountain forests across a variety of European mountain areas in a standardized way for the first time. The average periodic annual volume increment (PAI) of these forests amounts to 9.3 m(3)ha(-1)y(-1). Despite a significant increase in annual mean temperature the PAI has not changed significantly over the last 30 years. However, at the species level, we found significant changes in the growth dynamics. While beech had a PAI of 8.2 m(3)ha(-1)y(-1) over the entire period (1980-2010), the PAI of spruce dropped significantly from 14.2 to 10.8 m(3)ha(-1)y(-1), and the PAI of fir rose significantly from 7.2 to 11.3 m(3)ha(-1)y(-1). Consequently, we observed stable stand volume increments in relation to climate change.

LA  - English
AB  - Rapidly increasing energy and electricity demands, global concerns over the climate changes and strong dependence on foreign fossil fuel supplies are powerfully influencing greater use of nuclear power. In order to establish the viability of next-generation reactor concepts to meet tomorrow's needs for clean and reliable energy production the fundamental research and development issues need to be addressed for the Generation-IV nuclear-energy systems. Generation-IV reactor concepts are being developed to use more advanced materials, coolants and higher burn-ups fuels, while keeping a nuclear reactor safe and reliable. One of the six Generation-IV concepts is a very high temperature reactor (VHTR).
   The VHTR concept uses a graphite-moderated core with a once-through uranium fuel cycle, using high temperature helium as the coolant. Because helium is naturally inert and single-phase, the helium-cooled reactor can operate at much higher temperatures, leading to higher efficiency. Current VHTR concepts will use fuels such as uranium dioxide, uranium carbide, or uranium oxycarbide. Since some of these fuels are new in nuclear industry and due to their unknown properties and behavior within VHTR conditions it is very important to address these issues by investigate their characteristics within conditions close to those in VHTRs. This research can be performed in a research reactor with in-pile helium loop designed and constructed in Research Center Rez Ltd. One of the topics analyzed in this article are also physical characteristic and benefits of gas coolants.
   The purpose of the high temperature helium loop (HTHL) is to simulate technical and chemical conditions of VHTR's coolant. The loop is intended to serve an as experimental device for fatigue and creep tests of construction metallic materials for gas-cooled reactors and it should be also employed for research in field of gaseous coolant chemistry. The loop will serve also for tests of nuclear graphite, dosing and helium purification systems. Because the VHTR is a new reactor concept, major technical uncertainties remain relative to helium-cooled advanced reactor systems. This paper summarizes also the concept of the HTHL in the Research Centre Rez Ltd., its design, utilization and future plans for experimental setup. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rabensburg virus (RBGV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) has been classified as both a novel flavivirus and a unique lineage of West Nile virus (WNV). RBGV and WNV share approximately 76% sequence homology, yet RBGV does not replicate to high viral titers within vertebrate cell lines at physiological temperatures and has not been naturally isolated from a vertebrate host. These unique genetic and biological characteristics make RBGV a viable tool to identify the genetic determinants of flavivirus infectivity and fitness in vertebrate hosts. Using experimental evolution, we characterized mutated variants of RBGV that have altered capacity for infection and replication in various cell lines. Shared genetic differences within these variants were identified throughout the genome, with a large majority found in the NS3 and NS5 genes. Our results support a role for the replication complex in host utilization and suggest that epistatic interactions likely contribute to host-specific fitness and emergence.

AB  - Survival requires the selection of appropriate behavioural responses in the face of danger. With respect to the threat of predation, both the decision to escape and the underlying neuronal mechanisms have been extensively studied, but processes that trigger evasion of abiotic stressors, which are potentially hazardous to survival, are less well understood. Here, we document the interplay between rhythmic locomotory and 'C-start' escape swimming in Xenopus frog larvae when exposed to hyperthermic conditions. As temperature rises, swim cycle frequency increases while swim bout duration decreases, until swimming can no longer be initiated by sensory stimuli. Above a critical higher temperature, more intense sequences of spontaneous high amplitude C-start escape activity occur. Each C-start is followed by a few cycles of fast rhythmic swimming in which activity alternates between the two sides. The initial, high amplitude ventral root burst of an escape sequence propagates rostrocaudally approximately threefold faster than subsequent cycles. The high conduction velocity of this initial burst is consistent with the activation of a Mauthner neuron, one of a pair of giant reticulospinal neurons in fish and amphibians. In support of the involvement of a Mauthner neuron, unilateral lesions of the caudal hindbrain eliminated escape activity on the operated side, but activity remained on the un-operated side. Behaviourally, tadpoles responded to temperature ramps with a sequence of C-start responses in which the body arced through similar to 130 degrees in 22 ms, followed by high frequency swimming. These results suggest that high temperature activates the Mauthner neurons to trigger C-start escape behaviour.

AB  - With the increased uncertainty introduced through climate change and fishing pressure, having accurate estimates of fish biomass is essential for global ecosystem and economic health. Acoustic surveys are an efficient way to determine population size for pelagic species in the Northeast Atlantic (NEA), but acoustic population estimates still contain uncertainty and are difficult for some species. For example, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) is one of the most valuable fisheries in the NEA and is not monitored acoustically, as mackerel lack the swim bladder that provides the strongest acoustic echo (target strength) at common assessment frequencies. For all pelagic species, and especially for mackerel, behavior is a source of variation in acoustic measurements and therefore in population estimates. Behavior is mediated by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as the environment and the life history of the fish. In turn, behavior affects the density of the shoal and the tilt angle of the fish relative to the survey vessel, affecting their target strength, which affects the biomass estimate. Some fish may also undergo an anti-predator response to survey vessels, changing their behavior in response to the survey. Understanding these behaviors and incorporating them into acoustic stock assessment methods can improve the accuracy of population estimates. Individual-based models (IBM) offish shoals provide a pathway for incorporating behavior into acoustic methods. IBMs have been used extensively to build theoretical models of fish shoals, but few have been successfully tested in lab or field conditions. As computational power and monitoring technology improve, modeling the collective behavior of pelagic fishes will be possible. Novel, interdisciplinary approaches to data collection and analysis will help translate theoretical IBMs to the fisheries science domain. Beyond acoustic stock assessments, this approach can be used to investigate knowledge gaps in the effects of fisheries-induced evolution and the potential for range shifts under climate change. Further work to synthesize existing models and incorporate field data will help determine how environmental, ecological, physiological, and anthropogenic factors, often affecting both behavior and acoustic surveying, are Interconnected. Moving from theoretical models to practical applications will be a valuable tool In tackling the uncertainty that accompanies further fisheries exploitation and warming oceans.

AB  - The Earth's mantle potential temperature (T-p) is thought to have cooled by similar to 250 degrees C since the Archean, causing a progressive change in both the structure and composition of oceanic lithosphere. These variables affect the negative buoyancy of subducting slabs, which is known to be an important force in driving plate motions. However, the relationship between T-p and slab buoyancy remains unclear. Here, we model the formation and subduction of oceanic lithosphere as a function of T-p, to investigate how T-p influences the buoyancy of subducting slabs, and by extension how buoyancy forces may have changed through time. First, we simulate isentropic melting of peridotite at mid-ocean ridges over a range of T-p (1300-1550 degrees C) to calculate oceanic lithosphere structure and composition. Second, we model the thermal evolution of oceanic plates undergoing subduction for a variety of scenarios (by varying lithospheric thickness, slab length and subduction velocity). Finally, we integrate the structural, compositional and thermal constraints to forward model subduction metamorphism of oceanic plates to determine downgoing slab density structures. When compared with ambient mantle, these models allow us to calculate buoyancy forces acting on subducting slabs. Our results indicate that oceanic lithosphere derived from hotter mantle has a greater negative buoyancy, and therefore subduction potential, than lithosphere derived from cooler mantle for a wide range of subduction scenarios. With respect to the early Earth, this conclusion supports the viability of subduction, and models of subduction zone initiation that invoke the concept of oceanic lithosphere being primed to subduct. However, we also show that decreases to lithosphere thickness and slab length, and reduced crustal hydration, progressively reduce slab negative buoyancy. These results highlight the need for robust estimates of early Earth lithospheric properties when considering whether subduction was operative at this time. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that subduction processes on the early Earth may have been uniformitarian. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Symbiotic relationships between microbes and their hosts are widespread and diverse, often providing protection or nutrients, and may be either obligate or facultative. However, the genetic mechanisms allowing organisms to maintain host-symbiont associations at the molecular level are still mostly unknown, and in the case of bacterial-animal associations, most genetic studies have focused on adaptations and mechanisms of the bacterial partner. The gutless tubeworms (Siboglinidae, Annelida) are obligate hosts of chemoautotrophic endosymbionts (except for Osedax which houses heterotrophic Oceanospirillales), which rely on the sulfide-oxidizing symbionts for nutrition and growth. Whereas several siboglinid endosymbiont genomes have been characterized, genomes of hosts and their adaptations to this symbiosis remain unexplored. Results Here, we present and characterize adaptations of the cold seep-dwelling tubeworm Lamellibrachia luymesi, one of the longest-lived solitary invertebrates. We sequenced the worm's similar to 688-Mb haploid genome with an overall completeness of similar to 95% and discovered that L. luymesi lacks many genes essential in amino acid biosynthesis, obligating them to products provided by symbionts. Interestingly, the host is known to carry hydrogen sulfide to thiotrophic endosymbionts using hemoglobin. We also found an expansion of hemoglobin B1 genes, many of which possess a free cysteine residue which is hypothesized to function in sulfide binding. Contrary to previous analyses, the sulfide binding mediated by zinc ions is not conserved across tubeworms. Thus, the sulfide-binding mechanisms in sibgolinids need to be further explored, and B1 globins might play a more important role than previously thought. Our comparative analyses also suggest the Toll-like receptor pathway may be essential for tolerance/sensitivity to symbionts and pathogens. Several genes related to the worm's unique life history which are known to play important roles in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and aging were also identified. Last, molecular clock analyses based on phylogenomic data suggest modern siboglinid diversity originated in 267 mya (+/- 70 my) support previous hypotheses indicating a Late Mesozoic or Cenozoic origins of approximately 50-126 mya for vestimentiferans. Conclusions Here, we elucidate several specific adaptations along various molecular pathways that link phenome to genome to improve understanding of holobiont evolution. Our findings of adaptation in genomic mechanisms to reducing environments likely extend to other chemosynthetic symbiotic systems.

KW  - GROWTH
AB  - The St. Lawrence coastal area is characterized by strong salinity gradients along its axis. The Atlantic wolffish, a coastal species, is expected to be tolerant to a wide range of salinities and temperatures. Based on the energy allocation theory, it as been hypothesised that energy spent on ionic regulation at high salinities (> 14parts per thousand) is not allocated to somatic growth. In order to evaluate the possibility of rearing this species at intermediate and low salinities and the potential for associated growth benefits, challenge tests followed by growth trials were conducted. Experiments were conducted on 1(+) following direct transfer to 7-14-21-28parts per thousand. Atlantic wolffish displayed a high tolerance to low salinity. Observed growth in length and the calculation of the growth trajectories (length and weight) indicated better growth performance at intermediate salinity (14parts per thousand) compared to full-strength seawater (28parts per thousand). After 19 weeks, fish at 7parts per thousand displayed lower osmolality, but growth and survival were not impaired compared to the group held at 28parts per thousand salinity. This species can be reared successfully at intermediate salinities with growth enhancement perspectives. The typical U-shaped enzyme adaptation curve in relation to salinity was observed for branchial Na(+)K(+)ATPase and LDH, from week 14 after exposure.

AB  - Bacteria show remarkable adaptability under several stressful conditions by shifting themselves into a dormant state. Less is known, however, about the mechanism underlying the cell transition to dormancy. Here, we report that the transition to dormant states is mediated by one of the major toxin-antitoxin systems, RelEB, in a cell density-dependent manner in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. We constructed a strain, IKA121, which expresses the toxin RelE in the presence of rhamnose and lacks chromosomal relBE and rhaBAD. With this strain, we demonstrated that RelE-mediated dormancy is enhanced at high cell densities compared to that at low cell densities. The initiation of expression of the antitoxin RelB from a plasmid, pCA24N, reversed RelE-mediated dormancy in bacterial cultures. The activation of RelE increased the appearance of persister cells against beta-lactams, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, and more persister cells appeared at high cell densities than at low cell densities. Further analysis indicated that amino acid starvation and an uncharacterized extracellular heat-labile substance promote RelE-mediated dormancy. This is a first report on the induction of RelE-mediated dormancy by high cell density. This work establishes a population-based dormancy mechanism to help explain E. coli survival in stressful environments.

AB  - A systematic techno-economic analysis of geothermal assisted power generation (GAPG) was performed for a 500 MW unit of a typical coal-fired power plant located at the upper Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. Specifically, the GAPG viability and performance was examined by investigating the impacts of reservoir temperature, resource distance, hybridisation scheme, and economic conditions including carbon tax and Renewable Energy Certificates (REC). The process simulation package, Aspen HYSYS, was employed for all simulation purposes. Thermodynamically, GAPG system was found to increase the power output of the plant by up to 19% under the booster mode whilst in fuel saving mode the coal consumption reduced by up to 0.3 million tonne/year decreasing the Green House Gas (GHG) emission by up to 15% (0.6 million tonne/year). Economic analyses showed that for a typical HDR resource with a reservoir temperature about 150 degrees C located within a 5 km radius from the power plant, the GAPG system becomes economically competitive to the stand-alone fossil fuel based plant when minimum carbon tax and RECs rates of 40 $/tonne and 60 cents/kW h are introduced. The figure of merit analyses comparing GAPG system with both stand-alone fossil fuel and stand-alone geothermal plants showed that an economically feasible GAPG system requires the use of HDR resources located no further than 20 km from the plants. Reference maps were also developed to predict suitable conditions for which the hybrid plant outperforms the stand-alone plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - curcas L. seeds as a raw material for biodiesel production is a rapidly growing interest over the world because of its high oil content, ecological adaptability, and excellent fuel properties. Though there is an increase in productivity of biodiesel, showing solution for future energy insecurity, there still remains some concern for commercialization due to its susceptibility to degradation during long storage. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of temperature and ambient condition on Jatropha biodiesel storage. An experiment was conducted for a period of 12 months, where Jatropha biodiesel stored in three groups at different temperatures (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) and environmental conditions (exposed in dark, light, and air). At regular intervals, the samples were taken out to analyze acid value, density, kinematic viscosity, and thermogravimetric profile to monitor the quality of biodiesel. Analysis showed that acid value, density, kinematic viscosity, and the onset temperature of volatilization and distillation increases with the increase in storage time of biodiesel samples. However, Jatropha biodiesel stored at 35 degrees C, in contact with ambient air and light showed highest degradation compared to those which were stored at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Among all the parameters studied, high temperature and air exposure are the two most potent parameters which accelerate the degradation process. Along with that, light exposure had mild but significant effect on Jatropha biodiesel degradation over a long storage period.

AB  - Three hundred fifty newborns from Rome and 351 from Penne were studied in continental Italy. Medium high altitude above sea level and cold winters characterize the area of Penne, while low altitude and very mild winters characterize the area of Rome. An effect of environmental conditions on the association between adenosine deaminase (ADA) and acid phosphatase (ACP1), previously shown in Sardinia, has been confirmed in continental Italy. When compared with expected independent assortment, the proportion of ACP1*A/*A carrying the ADA*2 allele is lower than expected in the lowlands and higher than expected in highlands. In continental Italy there is an interaction among ACP1-ADA genotype, season of conception, and locality. The excess of *A/*A newborns carrying the ADA*2 allele is present only among those conceived in the first half of the year (January-June). Among newborns in Penne conceived in the Spring, the proportion of those with *A/*A genotype is increased and these infants show decreased intrauterine growth, The present data suggest that ADA and ACP1 interact during intrauterine life with effects on development and survival and that such effects are dependent on local environment and season of conception.

AB  - Malolactic fermentation, a spontaneous step in vinification, is frequently controlled by used of malolactic bacterial starters of Leuconostoc oenos. Strains isolated from fermenting wines and then submitted to industrial processes to obtain freeze-dried preparations lose their natural adaptation to survive and to grow in wine. However, culture conditions influence their adaptability as well as their survival after exposure to stress. As the plasma membrane was considered as the primary target for the deleterious effects of the environment, the changes of its components after cell heating and incubation in hostile conditions were studied. The ratio of phospholipids to proteins of the membrane decreased significantly when cells were submitted to any kind of stress. Phospholipids decreased while the protein content increased up to fivefold. Only some membrane proteins were over-synthesized compared to control cells. Seventeen protein bands were separated by gel electrophoresis of which three in particular were always over-expressed after the cells were shocked. Some also appeared when the cells entered the stationary phase. These results show that Leuc. oenos responded to environmental stresses by changing its membrane composition. Stress proteins appeared whatever the nature of the shock. This phenomenon may be involved in the acquisition of resistance of Leuc. oenos to harsh conditions in wine.

AB  - Survival of Bemisia tabaci (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) on the winter conditions of the north zone Mediterranean Sea. The aim of this job was to study the influence of the winter temperatures on the survival of B. tabaci adults. The individuals are subjected to a cycle of temperatures which corresponds to temperatures noticed during 24 hours by one of the most cold days of the winter of the south of France (Perpignan). The evolution of these temperatures is reproduced in controlled conditions, and the individuals were subjected to one, three or four of these cycles. After a cycle of 24 hours, the rate of survival of the individuals is 73,5 % while that of the control is 85%. After an exposure of 3 cycles, the rate of survival remained high (44,4 %). The probability to survive to 4 cycles of 24 hours is 7,4 %. The Mediterranean North seems to be a buffer zone for the establishment of the populations of B. tabaci because neither the regularly recorded minimal temperatures nor their length seem to be limiting factors.

AB  - Regulation of gene expression plays a key role in bacterial adaptability to changes in the environment. An integral part of this gene regulatory network is achieved via quorum sensing (QS) systems that coordinate bacterial responses under high cellular densities. In the nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the 2-alkyl-4-quinolone (pqs) signaling pathway is crucial for bacterial survival under stressful conditions. Biosynthesis of the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) is dependent on the pqsABCDE operon, which is positively regulated by the LysR family regulator PqsR and repressed by the transcriptional regulator protein RhlR. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that not only PqsR but also RhlR activates transcription of pqsA. The latter uses an alternative transcriptional start site and induces expression of a longer transcript that forms a secondary structure in the 5' untranslated leader region. As a consequence, access of the ribosome to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is restricted and translation efficiency reduced. We propose a model of a novel posttranscriptional regulation mechanism that fine-tunes PQS biosynthesis, thus highlighting the complexity of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa.

AB  - World production of rice exceeds 750 million tonnes per year of which a fifth is removed in the form of rice husk during the milling process. The use of rice husks as a source of sustainable and renewable energy is often hindered by lack of capital and a poor understanding of rice husk combustion characteristics. This results in the selection of poor quality technology which generates significant quantities of harmful crystalline Silica waste. Despite previous work in the area, detailed characterisation of the combustion of rice husk ash in a TORBED reactor across a wide temperature range has not yet been attempted and little effort has been directed towards assessing the economic viability of generating quality rice husk ashes. The use of a TORBED reactor enables low residual carbon after combustion without the generation of harmful crystalline material. Rice husk was combusted in a 400 mm reactor at temperatures between 700 and 950 degrees C. In the subsequent characterisation studies the resulting materials were shown to be fully amorphous high purity silica (>95%) and were readily digested in a series of alkaline digestion experiments. Complete silica conversion was only possible using uneconomic Na2O/SiO2 ratios and further optimisation of the combustion process to generate higher surface area material is necessary to increase the digestion rates further. Provisional economic analysis suggests that sales of the by-product enhance the returns from rice husk based power generation. TORBED reactors enable the combustion of rice husk with considerable operating flexibility and they generate products that could be used to displace resource intensive products and processes thus, added value from the by-products can be obtained by using TORBED reactor technology.

AB  - Predictability of a zonal-wavenumber (WN) 1 stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) event occurring in December 1998 is examined using the operational 1-month forecast dataset based upon a numerical weather prediction model (NWPM) of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The stratospheric warming in the polar region of this event is predictable by NWPM from 1 month in advance. The amplification of tropospheric planetary waves triggering the onset of the SSW is closely connected with weak vertical westerly shear near the surface around 60degreesN, in association with rather strong synoptic wave activity. Thus, the fair reproduction of the interaction between zonal-mean flows and synoptic waves in the troposphere for promoting the generation of WN 1 planetary waves is found to be essential for the successful prediction of this event.
   The authors also point out prolonged predictability for the onset of a tropospheric blocking event occurring over Alaska just after the warming peak. The blocking is formed because of the poleward propagation of planetary waves causing the SSW event, which suggests a predictable downward control of the tropospheric circulation by the stratosphere after the SSW.

AB  - Genetic Algorithms are adaptive search algorithms based on the Darwinian principle of natural selection and survival of the fittest. They efficiently exploit data at hand to anticipate new search points with expected improvement performance. The aim of this paper is to show the feasibility of applying genetic algorithms to determine the thermal profile of a basic package. To illustrate this, genetic algorithms were employed to compute the junction temperature of a 12-pin lead DIP chip. Further, the package parameters were modified to check the capabilities of genetic algorithms to determine the junction temperature of the chip. The paper also shows that the solutions obtained from this evolutionary search method, does not depend on the initially generated members of the family of solutions. The present application is specific only for purposes of illustration. This study also elaborates the factors that affect the efficiency of the solutions obtained by genetic algorithms. Finally, the paper shows that the rules of natural selection can be used to solve more complex problems faced in the packaging industry.

AB  - Body pigmentation is an evolutionarily diversified and ecologically relevant trait with substantial variation within and between species, and important roles in animal survival and reproduction. Insect pigmentation, in particular, provides some of the most compelling examples of adaptive evolution, including its ecological significance and genetic bases. Pigmentation includes multiple aspects of color and color pattern that may vary more or less independently, and can be under different selective pressures. We decompose Drosophila thorax and abdominal pigmentation, a valuable eco-evo-devo model, into distinct measurable traits related to color and color pattern. We investigate intra- and interspecific variation for those traits and assess its different sources. For each body part, we measured overall darkness, as well as four other pigmentation properties distinguishing between background color and color of the darker pattern elements that decorate each body part. By focusing on two standard D. melanogaster laboratory populations, we show that pigmentation components vary and covary in distinct manners depending on sex, genetic background, and temperature during development. Studying three natural populations of D. melanogaster along a latitudinal cline and five other Drosophila species, we then show that evolution of lighter or darker bodies can be achieved by changing distinct component traits. Our results paint a much more complex picture of body pigmentation variation than previous studies could uncover, including patterns of sexual dimorphism, thermal plasticity, and interspecific diversity. These findings underscore the value of detailed quantitative phenotyping and analysis of different sources of variation for a better understanding of phenotypic variation and diversification, and the ecological pressures and genetic mechanisms underlying them.

AB  - Despite the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying range limits and abundance structure, few studies have sought to do so. Here we use a terrestrial slug species, Deroceras panormitanum, that has invaded a remote, largely predator-free, Southern Ocean island as a model system to do so. Across Marion Island, slug density does not conform to an abundant centre distribution. Rather, abundance structure is characterized by patches and gaps. These are associated with this desiccation-sensitive species' preference for biotic and drainage line habitats that share few characteristics except for their high humidity below the vegetation surface. The coastal range margin has a threshold form, rapidly rising from zero to high density. Slugs do not occur where soil-exchangeable Na values are higher than 3000 mg kg(-1), and in laboratory experiments, survival is high below this value but negligible above it. Upper elevation range margins are a function of the inability of this species to survive temperatures below an absolute limit of -6.4 degrees C, which is regularly exceeded at 200 m altitude, above which slug density declines to zero. However, the linear decline in density from the coastal peak is probably also a function of a decline in performance or time available for activity. This is probably associated with an altitudinal decline in mean annual soil temperature. These findings support previous predictions made regarding the form of density change when substrate or climatic factors set range limits.

AB  - The temperature evolution of the infrared luminescence of yttrium orthoaluminate nano-perovskite, doped with 1.0 mol% of Nd3+ ions, was analyzed in order to check its viability as optical thermal sensor in the well-known "near infrared biological windows" of the human tissue. For this purpose, the dependences of the emission bands of the (H-2(9/2), F-4(5/2)), F-4(3/2) -> I-4(9/2) transitions from RT up to 610 K and the emission band of the F-4(3/2) -> I-4(3/2) transition from RT up to 370 K for the first and second biological windows respectively, were measured and calibrated as functions of the temperature. From the calibration procedure of the optical sensor in the first biological window, the maximum value of the relative sensitivity was obtained and compared with others Nd-based optical sensors of the literature, showing a notable sensitivity. In addition, the relative sensitivity in the second biological window at RT was almost twice higher than the obtained one in the first biological window at the same temperature, showing a high sensitivity of the nano-perovskite in the biophysical temperature range (30-45 degrees C). Moreover, it has been studied among the emission sub-tissue penetration depth through a phantom tissue, taking advantage of the emission of Nd3+ in the second biological window. These results show the potential use of the yttrium orthoaluminate nano-perovskite doped with 1.0 mol% of Nd+3 for both sub-tissue luminescence imaging and luminescence-based thermal sensing.

AB  - Water is necessary for the origin and survival of life as we know it. In the search for life-friendly worlds, water-rich planets therefore are obvious candidates and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The surface H2O layer on such planets (containing a liquid water ocean and possibly high-pressure ice below a specific depth) could potentially be hundreds of kilometres deep depending on the water content and the evolution of the proto-atmosphere.
   We study possible constraints for the habitability of deep water layers and introduce a new habitability classification relevant for water-rich planets (from Mars-size to super-Earth-size planets). A new ocean model has been developed that is coupled to a thermal evolution model of the mantle and core. Our interior structure model takes into account depth-dependent thermodynamic properties and the possible formation of high-pressure ice.
   We find that heat flowing out of the silicate mantle can melt an ice layer from below (in some cases episodically), depending mainly on the thickness of the ocean-ice shell, the mass of the planet, the surface temperature and the interior parameters (e.g. radioactive mantle heat sources). The high pressure at the bottom of deep water-ice layers could also impede volcanism at the water-mantle boundary for both stagnant lid and plate tectonics silicate shells.
   We conclude that water-rich planets with a deep ocean, a large planet mass, a high average density or a low surface temperature are likely less habitable than planets with an Earth-like ocean. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of alternative feedstocks for producing oil-based biofuels needs to meet the majority of the following criteria: low cost, high oil content, low agricultural inputs, favorable fatty acid (FA) composition, compatibility with existing farm equipment and infrastructure, production in off-season from conventional commodity crops, adaptability to marginal/idle lands, and viable markets for co-products such as seed meal. Recently a "potential weed", pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) has become one of the most attractive new non-food oil crops. Pennycress is highly tolerant to low temperatures, tolerating temperatures below -15 degrees C after reaching a 4-to-6-leaves rosette stage. The seed contains up to 37% oil (DM) with the major fatty acid as erucic (36%). The fatty acid composition in pennycress has been shown to have physical properties suitable for biofuels like biodiesel and hydro-treated renewable jet fuel (HRJ). In the last decade, pennycress has attracted increasing interest as a potential oilseed for biofuel production in the USA, either biodiesel and/or jet fuel, in Europe very few studies have specifically focused on pennycress. In the present study, we compared the productivity of pennycress in response to environment in two European countries, Italy (Bologna) and Greece (Aliartos), and in two USA states, Illinois (Peoria) and Minnesota (Morris). Seed yield, seed oil content and oil compositions were evaluated in response to growing environment. Representative seed samples from each study location was solvent extracted for total oil recovery and compared across locations.

The survival of exponential- and stationary-phase cells of AK01 in ACES [N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid] buffer was at least 2 log units higher than that of the wild type over a broad range of pressures (150 to 500 MPa), while both strains showed higher HHP tolerance (piezotolerance) in the stationary than in the exponential phase of growth. In semiskim milk, exponential-phase cells of both strains showed lower reductions upon pressurization than in buffer, but again, AK01 was more piezotolerant than the wild type. The piezotolerance of AK01 was retained for at least 40 generations in rich medium, suggesting a stable phenotype. Interestingly, cells of AK01 lacked flagella, were elongated, and showed slightly lower maximum specific growth rates than the wild type at 8, 22, and 30degreesC. Moreover, the piezotolerant strain AK01 showed increased resistance to heat, acid, and 11,0, compared with the wild type. The difference in HHP tolerance between the piezotolerant strain and the wild-type strain could not be attributed to differences in membrane fluidity, since strain AK01 and the wild type had identical in situ lipid melting curves as determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The demonstrated occurrence of a piezotolerant isolate of L. monocytogenes underscores the need to further investigate the mechanisms underlying HHP resistance of food-borne microorganisms, which in turn will contribute to the appropriate design of safe, accurate, and feasible HHP treatments.

AB  - For different combinations acclimation temperature-salinity of shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) the preferred temperature range was from 26.1 to 31.4 degrees C without salinity effect.
   Shrimp acclimated at 10 parts per thousand and 19 parts per thousand preferred salinities higher than those to which they were acclimated. However, shrimp acclimated at 28 parts per thousand and 36 parts per thousand preferred lower salinities than those to which they were acclimated. This behavior was associated with the selection of a higher temperature.
   Behavioral studies of organisms exposed to experimental environmental gradients allowed the establishment of optimal cultivation conditions of L. vannamei. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Greenhouses provide fresh vegetables and ornamentals year-round, worldwide; the type and equipment used in any region generally suit the local weather, construction materials availability, and type of crop. In each region, elements such as structure, cover materials, climate-control systems, and irrigation and fertilization equipment are routinely evaluated by growers, designers and researchers, to improve their efficiency, reduce inputs, and minimize undesired environmental effects. The term "greenhouse design" includes too many aspects to be covered in one paper, therefore, this paper mainly addresses developments related to possible effects of manipulations of structure and cover materials on microclimate; it also emphasizes the main concepts and trends in greenhouse horticulture that emerged during the last decade. The major driving forces toward improving greenhouse design have sprung from the desire to achieve a sustainable greenhouse that is energy neutral, consumes only the essential amount of water, and has minimal negative environmental impact - all while maximizing net financial return. Consequently, recent years have witnessed the development and expansion of tall and large structures, innovative cover materials, and closed and semiclosed greenhouses, and progress in solar greenhouses that harvest solar energy for heating. Most recently the incorporation of arrays of photovoltaic cells for power generation in protected cultivation became popular: a trend that still has to be carefully evaluated. In warm climates we have witnessed the expansion of screenhouses and innovative insect-proof screens that provide a reasonable environment for various crops, with much lower capital investment than fully equipped greenhouses. Progress was also made in development of tools for better and faster design of structures for protected cultivation. For example, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations were extensively used to investigate the effects of structure shape, and ventilator size and arrangement (with or without insect-proof screens) on microclimate. These studies indicated that there is still scope for improving the currently prevailing designs of structures and their components.

AB  - As temperatures warm and precipitation patterns shift as a result of climate change, interest in the identification of tree genotypes that will thrive under more arid conditions has grown. In this review, we discuss the multiple definitions of 'drought tolerance' and the biological processes involved in drought responses. We describe the three major approaches taken in the study of genetic variation in drought responses, the advantages and shortcomings of each, and what each of these approaches has revealed about the genetic basis of adaptation to drought in conifers. Finally, we discuss how a greater knowledge of the genetics of drought tolerance may aid forest management, and provide recommendations for how future studies may overcome the limitations of past approaches. In particular, we urge a more direct focus on survival, growth and the traits that directly predict them (rather than on proxies, such as water use efficiency), combining research approaches with complementary strengths and weaknesses, and the inclusion of a wider range of taxa and life stages.

AB  - A geographic mosaic of coevolution has produced local reciprocal adaptation in tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima (L.), and the goldenrod ball-gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Fitch 1855). The fly is selected to induce gall diameters that minimize mortality from natural enemies, and the plant is selected to limit gall growth that reduces plant fitness. We conducted a double reciprocal transplant experiment where S. altissima and E. solidaginis from three sites were grown in gardens at each site to partition the gall morphology variation into fly genotype, plant genotype, and the environment components. The host plant gall diameter induced by each E. solidaginis population was adapted to inhibit local natural enemies from ovipositing on or consuming enclosed larvae. Reciprocally, increasing the gall size induced by the local fly population increased the resistance of the local plant host population to gall growth. Differences among sites in natural enemies produced a mosaic of hotspots of coevolutionary arms races between flies selecting for greater gall diameter and plants for smaller diameters, and coldspots where there is no selection on plant or fly for a change in gall diameter. In contrast, the geographic variations of gall length and gall shape were not due to coevolutionary interactions.

AB  - Fraser River sockeye salmon have been the basis for a major commercial fishery shared by Canada and the United States, and an important cultural foundation for many aboriginal groups; they are also of huge ecological significance throughout the Fraser Basin. The potential for altered aquatic habitat and temperature regimes due to climate change is an important concern for Fraser River sockeye salmon. This paper characterizes the vulnerability of Fraser River sockeye salmon to future climate change using an approach that is novel on three counts. First, previous efforts to assess the vulnerability of salmon to climate change have largely focused on only part of the life cycle, whereas we consider climate vulnerability at all stages in the life cycle. Second, we use the available scientific literature to provide a basis for structuring and eliciting judgments from fisheries science and management experts who research and manage these systems. Third, we consider prospects for mitigating the effects of climate change on sockeye salmon. Tests showed that participants' judgments differentiated in statistically significant ways among questions that varied in terms of life stages, spawning regions and climate scenarios. The consensus among participants was that Fraser River sockeye are most vulnerable to climate change during the egg and returning adult stages of the life cycle. A high temperature scenario was seen as imposing the greatest risk on sockeye stocks, particularly those that migrate to the upper reaches of the Fraser River system and spawn earlier in the summer. The inability to alter water temperature and the highly constrained nature of sockeye management, with competing gear types and sequential fisheries over a long distance, suggest the potential to mitigate adverse effects is limited. Fraser River sockeye already demonstrate a great deal of adaptive capacity in utilizing heterogeneous habitats in different river sub-basins. This adaptability points to the potential value of policies to make stocks more resilient to uncertain futures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mechanisms of Precambrian orogeny and their contribution to the origin of ultrahigh temperature granulites, granite-greenstone terranes and net crustal growth remain debatable. Here, we use 2D numerical models with 150 degrees C higher mantle temperatures compared to present day conditions to investigate physical and petrological controls of Precambrian orogeny during forced continental plates convergence. Numerical experiments show that convergence between two relatively thin blocks of continental lithosphere with fertile mantle creates a short-lived cold collisional belt that later becomes absorbed by a long-lived thick and flat ultra-hot accretionary orogen with Moho temperatures of 700-1100 degrees C. The orogen underlain by hot partially molten depleted asthenospheric mantle spreads with plate tectonic rates towards the incoming lithospheric block. The accretionary orogeny is driven by delamination of incoming lithospheric mantle with attached mafic lower crust and invasion of the hot partially molten asthenospheric wedge under the accreted crust. A very fast convective cell forms atop the subducting slab, in which hot asthenospheric mantle rises against the motion of the slab and transports heat towards the moving orogenic front. Juvenile crustal growth during the orogeny is accompanied by net crustal loss due to the lower crust subduction. Stability of an ultra-hot orogeny is critically dependent on the presence of relatively thin and warm continental lithosphere with thin crust and dense fertile mantle roots subjected to plate convergence. Increased thickness of the continental crust and subcontinental lithospheric mantle, pronounced buoyancy of the lithospheric roots, and decreased mantle and continental Moho temperature favor colder and more collision-like orogenic styles with thick crust, reduced magmatic activity, lowered metamorphic temperatures, and decreased degree of crustal modification. Our numerical modeling results thus indicate that different types of orogens (cold, mixed-hot and ultra-hot) could be created at the same time in the Early Earth, depending on compositional and thermal structures of interacting continental blocks.

AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are rapidly changing seawater temperature, pH and carbonate chemistry. This study compares the embryonic development under high pCO(2) conditions across the south-north distribution range of the marine clam Limecola balthica in NW Europe. The combined effects of elevated temperature and reduced pH on hatching success and size varied strongly between the three studied populations, with the Gulf of Finland population appearing most endangered under the conditions predicted to occur by 2100. These results demonstrate that the assessment of marine faunal population persistence to future climatic conditions needs to consider the interactive effects of co-occurring physico-chemical alterations in seawater within the local context that determines population fitness, adaptation potential and the system resilience to environmental change.

AB  - Rapid changes in climate may impose strong selective pressures on organisms. Evolutionary responses to climate change have been observed in natural populations, yet no example has been documented for a metabolic enzyme locus. Furthermore, few studies have linked physiological responses to stress with allozyme genotypic variation. We quantified changes in allele frequency between 1988 and 1996 at three allozyme loci (isocitrate dehydrogenase, Idh; phosphoglucose isomerase, Pgi; and phosphoglucomutase, Pgm) for the leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis in the Bishop Creek region of the Sierra Nevada of California (2900-3300 m). Beetles often experience high daytime (>32degreesC) and extremely low nighttime (<-5degreesC) temperatures during summer. Bishop Creek weather station data indicated that conditions were unusually dry before 1988, and that conditions were cool and wet during the years preceding the 1996 collection. We found directional change, in allele frequency at Pgi (11% increase in the Pgi-1 allele), but not at Idh or Pgm. We also found that physiological response to thermal extremes depended on Pgi genotype. Pgi 1-1 individuals induced expression of a 70-kD heat shock protein (FISP) at lower temperatures than 1-4 or 4-4 individuals, and 1-1 individuals expressed higher levels of HSP70 after laboratory exposure to temperatures routinely experienced in nature. Survival after nighttime laboratory exposure to subzero temperatures depended on gender, previous exposure to cold, and Pgi genotype. Females expressed higher levels of HSP70 than males after exposure to heat, and recovery by female Pgi 1-1 homozygotes after exposure to cold (-5degreesC) was significantly better than 1-4 or 4-4 genotypes. These data suggest that the cooler climate of the mid-1990s may have caused an increase in frequency of the Pgi-1 allele, due to a more robust physiological response to cold by Pgi 1-1 and 1-4 genotypes.

AB  - We documented the behaviour of pregnant McCann's skinks (Oligosoma maccanni) before, during and after parturition. Females were maintained in captivity from early pregnancy under thermal environments differing in basking opportunity (low, mid and high regimes). Thermal regime during pregnancy had little influence on maternal behaviours, including basking behaviour prior to birth and the duration of, and site selection for, labour. The majority of births (78%) occurred in the open and warm areas. Most females (61%; n=102 births, n=36 females) aided offspring post-birth by biting them free of the enclosing extra-embryonic membrane. Some females from the low regime consumed non-viable offspring, but whether this is a consistent difference among females held under different basking regimes requires further study. Many females (c. 79%) also exhibited a brief transient decrease in control of hind-limbs post-birth. Further studies on other squamates are recommended to shed light on the evolutionary history and possible conservation consequences of maternal behaviour during parturition.

AB  - Host populations often evolve defenses against parasites due to the significant fitness costs imposed by infection. However, adaptation to a specific parasite may alter the effectiveness of the host's defenses in general. Consequently, the specificity of host defense may be influenced by a host population's evolutionary history with parasites. Further, the degree of reciprocal change within an interaction may profoundly alter the range of host defense, given that antagonistic coevolutionary interactions are predicted to favor defense against specific parasite genotypes. Here, we examined the effect of host evolutionary history on host defense range by assessing the mortality rates of Caenorhabditis elegans host populations exposed to an array of Serratia marcescens bacterial parasite strains. Importantly, each of the host populations were derived from the same genetic background but have different experimental evolution histories with parasites. Each of these histories (exposure to either heat-killed, fixed genotype, or coevolving parasites) carries a different level of evolutionary reciprocity. Overall, we observed an effect of host evolutionary history in that previously coevolved host populations were generally the most susceptible to novel parasite strains. This data demonstrates that host evolutionary history can have a significant impact on host defense, and that host-parasite coevolution can increase host susceptibility to novel parasites.

AB  - We study evolutionary canalization using a spin-glass model with replica theory, where spins and their interactions are dynamic variables whose configurations correspond to phenotypes and genotypes, respectively. The spins are updated under temperature T-S, and the genotypes evolve under temperature T-J, according to the evolutionary fitness. It is found that adaptation occurs at T-S < T-S(RS), and a replica symmetric phase emerges at T-S(RSB) < T-S < T-S(RS). The replica symmetric phase implies canalization, and replica symmetry breaking at lower temperatures indicates loss of robustness. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2012

AB  - Ice streams are bounded by abrupt transitions in speed called shear margins. Some shear margins are fixed by subglacial topography, but others are thought to be self-organizing, evolving by thermal feedback to ice viscosity and basal drag which govern the stress balance of ice sheets. Resistive stresses (and properties governing shear-margin formation) manifest nonuniquely at the surface, motivating the use of subsurface observations to constrain ice sheet models. In this study, we use ice-penetrating radar data to evaluate three 3-D thermomechanical models of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, focusing on model reproductions of ice temperature (a primary control on viscosity) and subsurface velocity. Data/model agreement indicates elevated temperatures in the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream margins, with depth-averaged temperatures between 2 degrees C and 6 degrees C warmer in the southeast margin compared to ice in streaming flow, driven by vertical heat transport rather than shear heating. This work highlights complexity in ice divergence across stagnant/streaming transitions.

AB  - BACKGROUNDTrichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura is widely used as a biological control agent for control of lepidopteran agricultural pests in China and can be successfully reared using the large eggs of the Chinese silkworm, Antheraea pernyi. In this study, biological parameters of diapaused, non-diapaused, and cold-stored T. dendrolimi were investigated for two generations on host eggs of A. pernyi under laboratory conditions.
   RESULTSThe cold-stored T. dendrolimi performed more poorly than diapaused and non-diapaused T. dendrolimi based on biological parameters. In the F1 generation, the non-diapaused T. dendrolimi had a higher emergence rate, longer longevity, and a lower proportion of deformed individuals than diapaused T. dendrolimi. In the F2 generation, the diapaused T. dendrolimi had a lower proportion of unemerged parasitoids than non-diapaused T. dendrolimi. However, the diapaused T. dendrolimi had a higher number of parasitized hosts than non-diapaused T. dendrolimi in both generations. In the F1 generation, the index of population trend (I) was found to be similar for diapaused (140.792) and non-diapaused (141.542) T. dendrolimi and was approximately 3.4 times that of cold-stored T. dendrolimi (41.698). In the F2 generation, the diapaused T. dendrolimi showed the largest I (146.791), followed by non-diapaused (136.859) and cold-stored T. dendrolimi (59.607).
   CONCLUSIONIn a 3-year augmentative field release from 2014 to 2016, diapaused T. dendrolimi showed effective parasitism on eggs of the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis. These results indicated that diapaused T. dendrolimi can be an efficient alternative method for mass rearing of T. dendrolimi for long-term cold storage. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Depth-stratified zooplankton samples were collected from the Georges Bank with a plankton pump and a 1 m(2) MOCNESS during 1995 and 1996 as part of the US GLOBEC Georges Bank program. All development stages of Calanus finmarchicus were enumerated. During both years, recruitment of C. finmarchicus began in late December/early January in the southern Gulf of Maine, with the G1 generation being advected onto the northern edge of the Georges Bank. This winter generation spread across the bank, reaching the S Flank by March. It immediately began to mature, replacing adults of the GO generation. Because of the prolonged period that the GO population was present, there was a considerable overlap of G1 and subsequent generations. Nauplii were at a minimum during May throughout the region during both years. A large increase in numbers of nauplii was observed on the NE Peak and the S Flank of the Georges Bank during June 1995, but only on the S Flank during June 1996. The decline in abundance of nauplii in this region during May might have been due to food limitation of reproduction. On the Crest, numbers of C. finmarchicus declined following the March-April peak, reaching very low le, els during June of both years. This appears to be in response to high levels of predation and isolation of the waters of the Crest as the tidal-mixing front strengthens. The development of the G1 generation on the Georges Bank was earlier in 1995 than during 1996, but the peak abundance was greater during 1996. Mean temperatures on the Georges Bank were about 1 degreesC colder during winter 1996, and the delay in development and larger numbers of peaks that year are consistent with the effects of the colder temperatures on development.

AB  - Given the complexity of generating energy from biomass, the need has arisen for support tools to assist in balancing energy and forestry policies which are sufficiently flexible to address the issues of planning and management at small and large scales.
   The present study aims to adapt WISDOM GIS methodology for application in the autonomous region of Asturias (Northern Spain) and thereby, by creating a geodatabase, to contribute to a support tool for investigating the potential of woodfuel. This will aid the public administration by providing information on woodfuel supply and demand at the regional, municipality and site-specific level, and thus assist in decision making in terms of formulating new energy strategies.
   In terms of supply (t year(-1)), in this work, woodfuel from forest area is defined as the crown fraction only (branches and leaves), although in the case of Eucalyptus spp., bark is also included as it is remains on-site following extraction of eucalypts for the pulp industry. Non-Forest Direct Supply was calculated on the basis of the relevant categories from an agricultural land use inventory and average woodfuel productivity. In addition, physical and legal constraints related to accessibility of the woodfuel were considered, the former applying restriction filters with values weighted depending on the interaction between slope map, road networks and centres of population, and the latter considering legal limitations in protected areas. In addition, unused waste from the wood processing industry was included. To calculate total woodfuel demand (t year-1) for energy generation (heat and electricity), both the residential and industrial sector were taken into account.
   All data was georeferenced through Geographic Information Systems (GISs), which allow operations between raster maps to be performed to generate numeric and spatial results focusing on logistics and biomass strategies, depending on the inputs data and scale employed for each scenario considered. In addition, the application of the methodology at the site-specific level illustrates the practical implementation at the small scale of the geodatabase created, by evaluating the woodfuel available to feed, in case 1, a wood-fired power plant in a specific proposed location and, in case 2, this plant combined with a second plant in a different municipality, both cases also taking into consideration industrial demand.

AB  - Quantitative genetic models of evolution of phenotypic plasticity are used to derive environmental tolerance curves for a population in a changing environment, providing a theoretical foundation for integrating physiological and community ecology with evolutionary genetics of plasticity and norms of reaction. Plasticity is modelled for a labile quantitative character undergoing continuous reversible development and selection in a fluctuating environment. If there is no cost of plasticity, a labile character evolves expected plasticity equalling the slope of the optimal phenotype as a function of the environment. This contrasts with previous theory for plasticity influenced by the environment at a critical stage of early development determining a constant adult phenotype on which selection acts, for which the expected plasticity is reduced by the environmental predictability over the discrete time lag between development and selection. With a cost of plasticity in a labile character, the expected plasticity depends on the cost and on the environmental variance and predictability averaged over the continuous developmental time lag. Environmental tolerance curves derived from this model confirm traditional assumptions in physiological ecology and provide new insights. Tolerance curve width increases with larger environmental variance, but can only evolve within a limited range. The strength of the trade-off between tolerance curve height and width depends on the cost of plasticity. Asymmetric tolerance curves caused by male sterility at high temperature are illustrated. A simple condition is given for a large transient increase in plasticity and tolerance curve width following a sudden change in average environment.

AB  - The unpredictability of evolution makes it difficult to deal with drug resistance because over the course of a treatment there may be mutations that we cannot predict. The authors propose to use quantum methods to control the speed and distribution of potential evolutionary outcomes.
   The pace and unpredictability of evolution are critically relevant in a variety of modern challenges, such as combating drug resistance in pathogens and cancer, understanding how species respond to environmental perturbations like climate change and developing artificial selection approaches for agriculture. Great progress has been made in quantitative modelling of evolution using fitness landscapes, allowing a degree of prediction for future evolutionary histories. Yet fine-grained control of the speed and distributions of these trajectories remains elusive. We propose an approach to achieve this using ideas originally developed in a completely different context-counterdiabatic driving to control the behaviour of quantum states for applications like quantum computing and manipulating ultracold atoms. Implementing these ideas for the first time in a biological context, we show how a set of external control parameters (that is, varying drug concentrations and types, temperature and nutrients) can guide the probability distribution of genotypes in a population along a specified path and time interval. This level of control, allowing empirical optimization of evolutionary speed and trajectories, has myriad potential applications, from enhancing adaptive therapies for diseases to the development of thermotolerant crops in preparation for climate change, to accelerating bioengineering methods built on evolutionary models, like directed evolution of biomolecules.

AB  - Ecosystem services are the basis of human survival and development and play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the dynamic balance of the earth's life support system and environment. This study evaluated the annual forest ecosystem service values (ESVs) and their spatial evolution characteristics from 2001 to 2020 in China and revealed the impact of climatic factors as well. The equivalent factor method was applied to calculate ESVs in combination with net primary productivity (NPP) calculated by the CASA model. The water conservation results based on the InVEST model and equivalent factor method were compared to test the reliability of the method. From 2001 to 2020, the annual forest ESVs ranged from RMB 9.17 trillion to 10.81 trillion, with an average of RMB 9.99 trillion in China. The forest ESVs increased from the northwest to the southeast regions of China with the lowest values of less than RMB 3 million per square kilometer and relatively high values of more than RMB 9 million per square kilometer. In the past 20 years, the forest ESVs have shown a significant increasing trend, especially in the Northeast Forest Region and Southeast Forest Region. The ESVs have decreased only in very few forest areas such as Cuona and Motuo counties on the southern edge of Tibet Province in Southwest China and Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties in southern Taiwan. The mean annual forest ESV was necessarily higher in the recent 10 years (2011-2020, RMB 10.43 trillion) than in the previous 10 years (2001-2010, RMB 9.55 trillion), while the spatial growth rate was usually less than 20%. The annual forest ESVs were significantly correlated with temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration but not with sunshine hours and relative humidity across the 20 years. In most areas (>60%), the positive impact of various climatic factors was dominant, and the area positively affected by precipitation was the largest (76%). The mean annual forest water conservation from 2001 to 2020 was RMB 1.46 trillion based on the InVEST model and was RMB 1.77 trillion based on the equivalent factor method. Overall, the results obtained by the two methods are roughly equal and mostly spatially matched. This study has some guiding significance for utilizing resources rationally, strengthening ecological environment protection and improving adaptability to climate change.

AB  - Background: The nematode species Pristionchus pacificus has an androdioecious mating system in which populations consist of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and relatively few males. The prevalence of males in such a system is likely to depend on the relative pros and cons of outcrossing. While outcrossing generates novel allelic combinations and can therefore increase adaptive potential, it may also disrupt the potentially beneficial consequences of repeated generations of selfing. These include purging of deleterious alleles, inheritance of co-adapted allele complexes, improved hermaphrodite fitness and increased population growth. Here we use experimental and population genetic approaches to test hypotheses relating to male production and outcrossing in laboratory and natural populations of P. pacificus sampled from the volcanic island of La Reunion.
   Results: We find a significant interaction between sampling locality and temperature treatment influencing rates of spontaneous male production in the laboratory. While strains isolated at higher altitude, cooler localities produce a higher proportion of male offspring at 25(circle)C relative to 20 or 15(circle)C, the reverse pattern is seen in strains isolated from warmer, low altitude localities. Linkage disequilibrium extends across long physical distances, but fails to approach levels reported for the partially selfing nematode species Caenorhabditis elegans. Finally, we find evidence for admixture between divergent genetic lineages.
   Conclusions: Elevated rates of laboratory male generation appear to occur under environmental conditions which differ from those experienced by populations in nature. Such elevated male generation may result in higher outcrossing rates, hence driving increased effective recombination and the creation of potentially adaptive novel allelic combinations. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium decay support selfing as the predominant reproductive strategy in P. pacificus. Finally, despite the potential for outcrossing depression, our results suggest admixture has occurred between distinct genetic lineages since their independent colonization of the island, suggesting outcrossing depression may not be uniform in this species.

AB  - We outline a phenomenological theory of evolution and origin of life by combining the formalism of classical thermodynamics with a statistical description of learning. The maximum entropy principle constrained by the requirement for minimization of the loss function is employed to derive a canonical ensemble of organisms (population), the corresponding partition function (macroscopic counterpart of fitness), and free energy (macroscopic counterpart of additive fitness). We further define the biological counterparts of temperature (evolutionary temperature) as the measure of stochasticity of the evolutionary process and of chemical potential (evolutionary potential) as the amount of evolutionary work required to add a new trainable variable (such as an additional gene) to the evolving system. We then develop a phenomenological approach to the description of evolution, which involves modeling the grand potential as a function of the evolutionary temperature and evolutionary potential. We demonstrate how this phenomenological approach can be used to study the "ideal mutation" model of evolution and its generalizations. Finally, we show that, within this thermodynamics framework, major transitions in evolution, such as the transition from an ensemble of molecules to an ensemble of organisms, that is, the origin of life, can be modeled as a special case of bona fide physical phase transitions that are associated with the emergence of a new type of grand canonical ensemble and the corresponding new level of description.

AB  - The mating strategy of Halicarcinus cookii was investigated to ascertain how males maximised their fitness through mate choice. An intertidal population at Kaikoura, New Zealand, was dominated by mature crabs of both sexes in summer and by immature crabs in the colder months. More than 95% of mature females were ovigerous with early stage and late stage broods found in almost every month, indicating that egg production and larval release is continuous. The operational sex ratio was less than 1 male/female in summer, but often more than 1.0 in the colder months. The gonosomatic index increased along with brood development so that as soon as zoeae were released, the next clutch of eggs was ready to be fertilised. Males searched for receptive females and began pre-copulatory mate guarding without any courtship display. They mated preferentially with late stage or non-ovigerous females: copulation duration was longest for stage 5 females as was post-copulatory guarding (mean 18.3 h). Late stage females were up to 14% of the female population. Mate attraction seems to be the result of an ovarian signal rather than from the developing brood. Manipulation of the sex ratio had effects upon copulation duration and post-copulatory guarding: presence of a rival male increased duration of guarding. Females showed precocious mating in the penultimate instar and were able to lay fertilised eggs after their pubertal moult in the absence of males. H. cookii females have many mates, but males attempt to ensure paternity by preferentially pursuing mature females close to egg laying and by guarding these females after copulation. These behaviours are all elements of a competitive strategy to ensure that a male loses (not wins) the race to copulate because females have a ventral seminal receptacle, giving sperm precedence to the last male to mate. Male mating behaviour is a consequence and evolutionary response to female morphology. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climatic variability threatens inland ecosystems, fisheries, societies and economies globally. The impacts are evident in India as manifested by altered geographic distribution, loss of species, change in breeding period, life cycle and physiological behaviour of inland fishes. In India, several inland fisheries research advancements have been made including development of innovative environmental, climatological and biological thresholds associated with successful spawning of fish species in the Ganges River basin, which is a landmark in predicting reproductive adaptation and minimum fitness required for natural breeding. The innovative concept of determining a threshold condition factor of the female fish population to indicate readiness for spawning, expressed as pre-spawning fitness (Kspawn 50), has been used to map and benchmark several freshwater fish species and thereby identify potential climate resilient species. A flow chart showing the impact of climatic variability in inland fisheries and climate resilient fisheries have been conceptualized. Moreover, research pertaining to climate change and its impact on aquatic ecology and fisheries, heat wave studies, climate resilient adaptation techniques, carbon sequestration potential of wetlands, and vulnerability assessment framework at various levels has also been reported. In the present compilation we synthesize, report, and discuss the status of scientific advancements on the impact of the climate change, and associated impacts on inland ecosystems and fisheries at various levels, which would help in developing mitigation and adaptation strategies.

AB  - Frequent and extreme heat waves have strongly influenced the sustainable development of cities and resulted in a higher level of mortality in residents. Using the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme, combined with the factors of land surface temperature (LST), building age (BA), and housing price (HP), and the normalized values of which represent heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability, respectively, this paper investigates a practical method for assessing the heat vulnerability of different LCZ classes in the old areas of a Chinese megacity, taking the Yuzhong district of Chongqing city as a case study. The results reveal that the distribution of LCZ classes in this study area exhibits a typical circle-layer distribution pattern from the city center to the suburbs. Heavy industry areas are the most vulnerable, with the highest exposure to heat waves, the oldest building age and the lowest housing price. Compact class areas (compact high-rise, compact mid-rise and compact low-rise) are usually more vulnerable than open class areas (open high-rise, open mid-rise, and open low-rise) and low-rise buildings are always more susceptible to heat waves than mid-rise and high-rise buildings. The methods and findings can help us to better understand the comprehensive and space-time action rules of heat vulnerability, thereby inspiring scientific and rational urban planning strategies to mitigate or adapt to urban heat weaves towards the sustainable development of cities and society.

AB  - The biological activity of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) against the larvae and adults of the economically important Oulema melanopus (L.) (Coleoptera: Chysomelidae) was assessed under laboratory conditions. The EPNs assessed were five native isolates of the species Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) and Heterorhabditis megidis (Poinar, Jackson, and Klein). Steinernema feltiae (isolate ZAG15) demonstrated the highest biological activity, causing 100% of mortality of larvae and beetles. The lowest activity occurred with H. megidis (isolate Wipsowo), with mortality that did not exceed 58%. At a concentration of 100 infective juveniles/adult, greatest mortality of beetles was observed at 25 degrees C as opposed to lower temperatures for all EPN isolates except the Wipsowo isolate, which showed no statistical significance of mortality among the temperatures tested. At 15 degrees C, adult beetle mortality was concentration-dependent with the S. feltiae isolates ZWO4 and ZAG15. However, neither concentration nor temperature had statistically significant effects on larval mortality.

AB  - Diatomaceous earth (DE) can be used as a grain protectant under UK conditions as part of an integrated strategy based on cooling and drying. Previous work has shown that a surface treatment of DE applied at 1-3 g/kg prevents development of surface arthropods for a storage season, if the bulk is cooled to 5 degrees C by December. For these experiments, samples were scooped from the surface of treated and untreated bulks of wheat and used to set up efficacy tests under controlled laboratory conditions. Bioassays were carried out at temperatures of 10, 15 and 25 degrees C and moisture contents of 16-17% using two mite and,two insect species. Mean percentage population inhibition was calculated for surface doses of 3, 2 and 1 g/kg after one generation. All doses achieved 100% inhibition against the mites, Acarus siro and Lepidoglyphus destructor, with the exception of 1 g/kg at 25 and 15 degrees C for A. siro and 2 g/kg at 25 degrees C for L. destructor (99.9%). For the insects, 100% inhibition was achieved for Oryzaephilus surinamensis, but developing stages of Sitophilus granarius within the kernel escaped treatment, resulting in inhibitions of 61-99%, depending on dose and temperature. However, this reduction in population compared to the controls showed that the treatment clearly affected the number of eggs laid. Samples from the 2 g/kg treatment were also used to estimate the evenness of surface treatment. The dose achieved across the surface was between 0.55 and 3.46 g/kg. Although uneven, there was no indication that this affected efficacy between paired treatments. These results also suggest that DE treatments will still give protection during different stages of cooling and against surface populations that may occur during summer warming and prolonged storage.

AB  - This study proposes a slack-based endogenous directional distance function model (SBEDDF) to assess the environmental impact of China's power generation industry. By selecting directional vectors according to slack values and endowing them with norms, this model guarantees that unit invariance and efficiency value measures are suitable for economic interpretation. The results of this study indicate that the environmental efficiency of China's power generation industry is low and varies considerably from one region to another. The optimal approach to reduction of emissions is unique for each region. For example, in Guangxi, reducing SO2 emissions is the priority, while in Shanxi, NOx emissions need to be targeted. The results of the Tobit regression analysis indicate that the power function of unit elasticity fits the environmental Kuznets curve of the power industry well. These results demonstrate that it is prudent for environmental administrators to tailor emission reduction standards and incentive policies to the prevailing circumstances in a region.

AB  - In the present work, factorial design and response surface techniques were used in combination with modeling and simulation to design and optimize an industrial bioprocess. Alcoholic fermentation process with multiple stages was considered. The fermentation system is composed of four ideal continuous-stirred tank reactors (ICSTR), linked in series,with cell recycling. Operational conditions for maximal yield and productivity were determined with ten parameters under consideration: temperature (four stages), residence time for each stage, cell recycling concentration, and the fraction of fresh medium fed into the second fermentation stage. Initially, screening design methodology was used to evaluate the process variables which were relevant in relation to yield and productivity. Five statistically significant parameters for each response were selected and utilized in factorial design in order to optimize the process. With the models obtained from the factorial design, response surfaces were generated, and the productivity improved to 12 g/l.h (an increase of 52% in relation to the control version of the bioprocess), while maintaining the high yield of 86.28% (99.1% conversion).

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a nosocomial bacterium causing different infectious diseases, ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to more serious and life-threatening infections such as septicaemia. S. aureus forms a complex structure of extracellular polymeric biofilm that provides a fully secured and functional environment for the formation of microcolonies, their sustenance and recolonization of sessile cells after its dispersal. Staphylococcus aureus biofilm protects the cells against hostile conditions, i.e., changes in temperature, limitations or deprivation of nutrients and dehydration, and, more importantly, protects the cells against antibacterial drugs. Drugs are increasingly becoming partially or fully inactive against S. aureus as they are either less penetrable or totally impenetrable due to the presence of biofilms surrounding the bacterial cells. Other factors, such as evasion of innate host immune system, genome plasticity and adaptability through gene evolution and exchange of genetic material, also contribute to the ineffectiveness of antibacterial drugs. This increasing tolerance to antibiotics has contributed to the emergence and rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a serious problem that has resulted in increased morbidity and mortality of human and animal populations globally, in addition to causing huge financial losses to the global economy. The purpose of this review is to highlight different aspects of S. aureus biofilm formation and its overall architecture, individual biofilm constituents, clinical implications and role in pathogenesis and drug resistance. The review also discusses different techniques used in the qualitative and quantitative investigation of S. aureus biofilm and various strategies that can be employed to inhibit and eradicate S. aureus biofilm.

AB  - An understanding of factors that influence species richness of lotic insects is generally lacking. We present comparative data on aquatic insect species richness from several North American and other streams. Factors such as large sample numbers and drainage area (species area relationships) are not significant predictors of species richness across the streams we examined. We explore several hypotheses regarding the origins and maintenance of species richness using Upper Three Runs Creek (UTR), South Carolina, USA, as a reference stream. UTR has the highest species richness of any stream in the Western Hemisphere. Hypotheses examined included historical, regional and local processes such as: (1) Evolutionary time, (2) disturbance regime/environmental variability, (3) temperature/evolutionary-speed, (4) productivity, and (5) habitat heterogeneity. Of these hypotheses, we suggest that productivity and habitat heterogeneity appear to contribute most to the high species richness found in UTR. We believe that multidisciplinary analysis of other streams is necessary because without this crucial information our knowledge of, and desire to protect biodiversity in streams will be wanting.

AB  - In a denitration conversion processes of the nuclear fuel cycle, mixed oxides (MOX) are produced from the reprocessing solution (plutonium and uranium mixed nitrate solution) of used nuclear fuel. The microwave heating (MIT) method has various advantages as one of denitration conversion techniques, i.e., this can complete rapidly processes, reduce the waste liquid, and operated easily by the waveguide. Fine crystal powders are thereby generated, and the manufacture of high-density and high-quality pellets is significant advantage.
   The MH method is accompanied with transient boiling phenomena such as overflow and flushing. From the viewpoint of enhancing mass productivity and cost efficiency, in the future, scaling up for the size of denitration vessel and shortening processing time are desired. In addition, the safe design of device and the appropriate conditions in microwave irradiation process are required. Hence the extensive understanding of transient boiling phenomena induced by microwave heating is important, and the detailed mechanism of flushing and overflow should be clarified. The aim of this study is to clarify transient boiling phenomena and detailed mechanism of flushing and overflow. Flushing and overflow are affected by physical factors such as solution properties, vessel characteristics, and input energy. Distilled water and different dielectric constant solution as working fluid are used. Dielectric constant was adjusted the concentration of potassium chloride aqueous solution. A cylindrical vessel kept enough clean by ultrasonic washing machine before experiments was used. The influence of vessel diameter and initial water depth on flushing and overflow are examined. As input energy, amount of power supplied and position of the object to be heated in a oven are varied. A high-speed video camera was installed to observe boiling phenomena, and thermography and fiber optic thermometer were to measure the temperature on vessel walls and in a solution, respectively.
   As a result, it was confirmed that generation of single bubble led to flushing from visualization. Boiling water was strongly blown up after rapid generation and collapse of the bubble. Positions where bubbles generated were randomly, and flushing strength is also various. Behaviors leading to flushing were classified into three types. First type is that first generation bubble from heating leads to flushing. Second type is that nucleate boiling continues during heating and stop, finally single bubble generates and leads to flushing. Third type is defined that gradual evaporation occurs without bubbles. Temperature rising behavior of three types were measured.
   By observing transient boiling phenomena, it was confirmed that numerous microbubbles were instantaneously generated and grown rapidly in water. Thus, we focused the total quantities of heat required for bubble formation and growth and released by flushing were calculated. Finally, both quantity of heat tended to be roughly same.

AB  - Background An area of current study concerns analysis of the possible adaptation of the population to heat, based on the temporal evolution of the minimum mortality temperature (MMT). It is important to know how is the evolution of the threshold temperatures (Tthreshold) due to these temperatures provide the basis for the activation of public health prevention plans against high temperatures. The objective of this study was to analyze the temporal evolution of threshold temperatures (Tthreshold) produced in different Spanish regions during the 1983-2018 period and to compare this evolution with the evolution of MMT. The dependent variable used was the raw rate of daily mortality due to natural causes ICD X: (A00-R99) for the considered period. The independent variable was maximum daily temperature (Tmax) during the summer months registered in the reference observatory of each region. Threshold values were determined using dispersion diagrams (annual) of the prewhitened series of mortality temperatures and Tmax. Later, linear fit models were carried out between the different values of Tthreshold throughout the study period, which permitted detecting the annual rate of change in Tthreshold. Results The results obtained show that, on average, Tthreshold has increased at a rate of 0.57 oC/decade in Spain, while Tmax temperatures in the summer have increased at a rate of 0.41 oC/decade, suggesting adaptation to heat. This rate of evolution presents important geographic heterogeneity. Also, the rate of evolution of Tthreshold was similar to what was detected for MMT. Conclusions The temporal evolution of the series of both temperature measures can be used as indicators of population adaptation to heat. The temporal evolution of Tthreshold has important geographic variation, probably related to sociodemographic and economic factors, that should be studied at the local level.

AB  - The identification of site location is one of the critical tasks in developing or expanding any supply chain system including the construction of renewable power generation plants. The accurate identification of a plant site can considerably reduce unforeseen risks and costs and also raise productivity and efficacy. As such, this study sought to thoroughly evaluate all capital cities of a developing country for the establishment of a hybrid wind/solar power plant to produce hydrogen while considering the most influential and conflicting criteria. For this, 14 criteria including daily solar radiation, wind power density, clearness index, altitude, population, average sunny hours in a year, unemployment rate, average air temperature, average air humidity, average yearly precipitation, natural disasters, the distance between the site and the main road, average dusty days per year, and land price constituted the set of vital factors. To prioritize alternatives, a Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach named FVIKOR (Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution) was used. The results indicated that among 31 capital cities, the city of Yazd with a wind power density of 309.5 W/m(2) and daily solar radiation of 5.4 kWh/m(2) would be the best location for the purpose of this study. To validate the findings, FTOPSIS (Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was utilized and it also ranked Yazd as the first option. Then, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to discern the behavior of each criterion and their impact on the ranking of the cities. Finally, for hydrogen generation, an autonomous hybrid wind/solar system was techno-economically assessed using HOMER software. According to the analysis outcome, the proposed system showed a payback period of 7 years with levelized cost of 4.75 $/kg for hydrogen. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Nest-site microhabitat influences hatching success, hatchling phenotype and offspring sex in reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). How females assess environmental features at potential nest sites, and then use such features in predicting the future incubation regime of the site, is integral to understanding how nest-site choice affects offspring fitness and ultimately female reproductive success. Tuatara Sphenodon punctatus are colonially nesting reptiles with TSD. We examined nest-site fidelity and nest-site choice in tuatara over 5 years on Stephens Island, New Zealand. Female tuatara nested every 2-4 years and showed high fidelity to nesting rookeries. Over 93% of females nested in the same rookery at least twice in 5 years. Approximately 25% of nests contained conspecific cues from previous nesting seasons, indicating that some females choose nest sites based on locations already selected by conspecifics. In experimental plots, female tuatara selected nest sites with loose soil and minimal vegetation, but they showed no preference for shaded compared with unshaded sites. This study provides insight into the development of colonial nesting structures in reptiles in that females are both attracted to nesting areas used by conspecifics, and show strong site fidelity to areas they have used in the past.

AB  - Pure copper is widely used for complex shapes, high thermal conductivity and good conductivity parts, such as heat exchangers, welding nozzles, injection molds, and various conductive parts. However, traditional manufacturing techniques are difficult to design complex pure copper parts into the most effective thermal and conductive structure. Selective Laser melting(SLM) can fabricate parts with complex shapes directly. However, due to the characteristics of easy oxidation, high optical reflectivity and high thermal conductivity, 3D printing pure copper by SLM is extremely challenging. In this study, the feasibility of fabricating pure copper by low-laser energy was studied by both numerical simulation and printing experiments, and the characteristics of the molten pool (molten pool structure, temperature flow and velocity flow) were studied. The results showed that due to its high thermal conductivity, heat spread out quickly in the molten pool, temperature rise rate and cooling rate reached as high as 1.36 x 10(7)K S-1, 2.99 x 10(5)K S(-1)respectively. And it took only about 1.7 x 10(-4)S for the process time of powder melting and solidification. Additionally, by reducing the particle size, the absorption rate for pure copper was improved, pure copper parts were successfully fabricated with low-laser energy: laser power 500 W, hatching space 0.07 mm, layer thickness 0.03 mm, laser scanning velocity 2500 mm s(-1).

AB  - Summer and perennial planktonic rotifers from temperate regions can vary greatly in their ability to reproduce at low temperatures. The population growth rate (r day(-1)) of a Patagonian Keratella tropica was 0.025 at 3.9 degrees C and gradually increased to 0.083 at 9.3 degrees C. The ability of this rotifer to survive and reproduce at low winter temperatures suggests that populations in permanent waters with cold winters may have life cycles with little or no commitment to sexually produced diapausing eggs. In contrast, three Brachionus taxa from two localities in southeastern Australia reproduced poorly at low temperatures. At 3.9 degrees C, all females died before reproducing. At 6.1 degrees C, only a single amictic female of the Darling Brachionus (B. calyciflorus species complex) from Lake Littra survived to produce a few offspring. At 9.3 degrees C, amictic females of the Darling Brachionus from both Lake Littra and a billabong produced many more offspring (7-9 offspring female(-1)) than those of the Lake Littra B. calyciflorus and the billabong B. rubens (1-2 offspring female(-1)). At 14.9 degrees C, amictic females of the latter two taxa, and the Darling Brachionus from Lake Littra, produced many (14-17) offspring female(-1). Seasonal changes in temperature occurring in natural populations of these Brachionus taxa should have important ecological and evolutionary implications. Low temperatures likely favor the occurrence and reproduction of the Darling taxon. The inability of active individuals to survive and reproduce at low winter temperatures may be a factor favoring selection for sexual reproduction and production of resting eggs in both permanent and temporary water bodies.

AB  - Given the limitations of acidogens and methanogens activities under saline environments, this work aims to optimize the main operational parameters affecting hydrogen and methane production from saline-to-hypersaline wastewater containing mono-ethylene glycol (MEG). MEG is the main contaminant in several saline industrial effluents. Anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR), as a multi-stage system, was used at different temperatures (Le., 19-31 degrees C [ambient] and 35 degrees C), organic loading rates (OLRs) of 0.6-2.2 gCOD/L/d, and salinity of 5-35 gNaCl/L. Mesophilic conditions of 35 degrees C substantially promoted MEG biodegradability (92-98%) and hydrogen/methane productivity, even at elevated salinity. Hydrogen yield (HY) and methane yield (MY) peaked to 258 and 140 mL/gCOD(add), respectively, at OLR 0.64 gCOD/L/d and salinity up to 20-25 gNaCl/L. An immobilized sludge ABR (ISABR), packed with polyurethane media, was further compared with classical ABR, resulting in 1.8-fold higher MY, at 35 gNaCl/L. Microbial analysis showed that introducing attached growth system (ISABR) substantially promoted methanogens abundance, which was dominated by genus Methanosarcina. Among bacterial genera, Acetobacteriwn was dominant, particularly in 1st compartment, representing MEG-degrading/salt-tolerant genus. At high salinity up to 35 gNaCl/L, the multi-phase and attached growth configuration can efficiently reduce the induced salt stress, particularly on methanogens, towards balanced and separated acidogenesis/ methanogenesis. Overall, producing hydrogen and methane from anaerobic treatment of MEG-based saline wastewater is feasible at optimized parameters and configuration.

AB  - Simple Summary Bemisia tabaci MED is an invasive pest that had caused considerable economic damage in the past decades. Its successful colonization is closely related to heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which are related to heat resistance. In this study, 33 BtaHsps were identified based on the sequenced genome of B. tabaci MED belonging to six HSP families, among which 22 BtaHsps were newly identified. Analysis of the secondary structure and evolutionary relationship showed that they were all closely related. In addition, BtaHsp90A3 of the HSP90 family was screened by analyzing the expression level changes of these genes under 42 degrees C heat shock and RNAi was performed on the BtaHsp90A3. The results showed that the silencing of BtaHsp90A3 is closely related to the heat resistance of B. tabaci MED. Taken together, this study conducted an in-depth identification of BtaHsps that clarifies their evolutionary relationships and their response to thermal stress in B. tabaci MED. The thermal tolerance of Bemisia tabaci MED, an invasive whitefly species with worldwide distribution, plays an important role in its ecological adaptation during the invasion process. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are closely related to heat resistance. In this study, 33 Hsps (BtaHsps) were identified based on sequenced genome of B. tabaci MED belonging to six HSP families, among which 22 Hsps were newly identified. The secondary structures of a further 22 BtaHsps were also predicted. The results of RT-qPCR showed that heat shock could affect the expression of 14 of the 22 Hsps newly identified in this study. Among them, the expression level of six Hsps increased under 42 degrees C treatment. As the unstudied gene, BtaHsp90A3 had the highest increase rate. Therefore, BtaHsp90A3 was chosen for the RNAi test, and silencing BtaHsp90A3 by RNAi decreased the survival rate of adult B. tabaci at 42 degrees C. The results indicated that only a few Hsps were involved in the thermal tolerance of host whitefly although many Hsps would response under heat stress. This study conducted a more in-depth and comprehensive identification that demonstrates the evolutionary relationship of BtaHsps and illustrates the response of BtaHsps under the influence of thermal stress in B. tabaci MED.

AB  - Background: The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum has two modes of reproduction: parthenogenetic during the spring and summer and sexual in autumn. This ability to alternate between reproductive modes and the emergence of clonal populations under favorable conditions make this organism an interesting model for genetic and epigenetic studies. The pea aphid hosts different types of endosymbiotic bacteria within bacteriocytes which help the aphids survive and adapt to new environmental conditions and habitats. The obligate endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola has a drastically reduced and stable genome, whereas facultative endosymbionts such as Regiella insecticola have large and dynamic genomes due to phages, mobile elements and high levels of genetic recombination. In previous work, selection toward cold adaptation resulted in the appearance of parthenogenetic A. pisum individuals characterized by heavier weights and remarkable green pigmentation.
   Results: Six adenine-methylated DNA fragments were isolated from genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from the cold-induced green variant of A. pisum using deoxyadenosine methylase (Dam) by digesting the gDNA with the restriction enzymes DpnI and DpnII, which recognize the methylated and unmethylated GATC sites, respectively. The six resultant fragments did not match any sequence in the A. pisum or Buchnera genomes, implying that they came from facultative endosymbionts. The A1 fragment encoding a putative transposase and the A6 fragment encoding a putative helicase were selected for further comparison between the two A. pisum variants (green and orange) based on Dam analysis followed by PCR amplification. An association between adenine methylation and the two A. pisum variants was demonstrated by higher adenine methylation levels on both genes in the green variant as compared to the orange one.
   Conclusion: Temperature selection may affect the secondary endosymbiont and the sensitive Dam involved in the survival and adaptation of aphids to cold temperatures. There is a high degree of adenine methylation at the GATC sites of the endosymbiont genes at 8 degrees C, an effect that disappears at 22 degrees C. We suggest that endosymbionts can be modified or selected to increase host fitness under unfavorable climatic conditions, and that the phenotype of the newly adapted aphids can be inherited.

AB  - Age, genetics and social status of trees affect their sensitivity to environmental factors, and information about such effects is needed for comprehensive assessment of growth potential. Climatic sensitivity of radial increment (i. e., tree-ring width) of introduced European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) of different generations and social status, growing in its northeasternmost stands in Europe, was studied by dendroclimatological methods. At present, the studied stands occur outside of the natural distribution area of the species, providing opportunity to study adaptability and potential growth of beech in novel environments under changing climate. The sensitivity of radial growth to climatic factors was modulated by the generation and social status (size) of trees. The first generation trees, which were propagated from the material transferred from the northern Germany, were highly sensitive to climatic factors and showed wide spectrum of responses. The dominant trees were particularly sensitive to June precipitation, indicating sensitivity to water deficit in summer. The suppressed trees were mainly sensitive to temperature in the dormant period. Tree-ring width of the second generation trees, which were propagated from the first generation stands, was mainly affected by water deficit in summer, yet the local factors, modulated the mechanisms of response. In one stand, tree-ring width was affected by conditions during the formation of tree-ring, indicating direct influence of weather conditions on xylogenesis. In the other stand, tree-ring width was correlated to weather conditions in the preceding year, suggesting influence via carbohydrate reserves. The effect of social status on climatic sensitivity in the second generation stands was considerably weaker, likely due to the natural and anthropogenic selection of the material best adapted for local conditions. The effect of climatic factors on radial growth of beech has shifted during the 20th century. The effect of autumn temperature has weakened, likely due to warming; the effect of factors related to water deficit in summer has intensified that could be related to both, changes in climate and ageing. The observed climate-growth relationships suggested that conditions in winter have become suitable for beech, yet careful selection of sites/regions with appropriate hydrological conditions appear necessary to counteract the increasing effect of water deficit, hence to ensure productivity of future beech sites in Latvia.

AB  - This study was designed to elucidate the mechanisms leading to down-regulation of the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) survival pathway during H2O2-induced cell death. H2O2 produced early activation of Akt/PKB and also DNA damage that was followed by stabilization of p53 levels, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and generation of ceramide through activation of a glutathione-sensitive neutral sphingomyelinase. These events correlated with long term dephosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Akt. A membrane-targeted active Akt version attenuated apoptosis but not necrosis induced by H2O2 and was more resistant to dephosphorylation and proteolysis induced by apoptotic concentrations of H2O2. Proteolysis of Akt was prevented by exogenous addition of glutathione, indicating a role of ROS and ceramide in Akt degradation. However, Akt was degraded similarly in cells transfected with wild type and dominant negative p53 mutant, indicating that degradation of Akt under oxidative injury may be p53-independent. Specific inhibitors of caspase groups I and III prevented proteolysis of Akt/PKB and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in cells submitted to apoptotic but not necrotic H2O2 concentrations. Surprisingly, in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells Akt was more sensitive to H2O2-induced degradation than the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Moreover, the Akt/PKB double mutant Akt(D108A,D119A), which is not cleaved by caspase-3, and a triple mutant (D453A,D455A,D456A), which lacks the consensus sequence for caspase-3 cleavage, were also degraded in H2O2-treated cells. Our results suggest that strong oxidants generate intracellular ROS and ceramide which in term lead to down-regulation of Akt by dephosphorylation and caspase-3-independent proteolysis.

AB  - Adaptations to the cold and to short growing seasons characterize arctic life, but climate in the Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate. Will plant and animal populations of the Arctic be able to cope with these drastic changes in environmental conditions? Here we explore the potential contribution of evolution by natural selection to the current response of populations to climate change. We focus on the spring phenology of populations because it is highly responsive to climate change and easy to document across a wide range of species. We show that evolution can be fast and can occur at the time scale of a few decades. We present an example of reproductive phenological change associated with climate change (North American red squirrels in the Yukon), where a detailed analysis of quantitative genetic parameters demonstrates contemporary evolution. We answer a series of frequently asked questions that should help biologists less familiar with evolutionary theory and quantitative genetic methods to think about the role of evolution in current responses of ecological systems to climate change. Our conclusion is that evolution by natural selection is a pertinent force to consider even at the time scale of contemporary climate changes. However, all species may not be equal in their capacity to benefit from contemporary evolution.

AB  - We conducted laboratory evaluations of food consumption, growth, and metabolic rate as functions of water temperature (5-27.5 degrees C) to examine how the young of year in six populations of muskellunge Esox masquinongy (Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, St. Lawrence River, and Wisconsin) from three drainages might perform under various thermal regimes. Relative food consumption (g . g(-1). d(-1)) and growth (g . g(-1). d(-1)) were similar among populations at lower temperatures (5 and 10 degrees C), but at higher temperatures (15-27.5 degrees C) fish from Wisconsin and Ohio had higher consumption and faster growth rates than fish from Kentucky and the St. Lawrence River. Metabolic rates increased with temperature from 0.08 mg O-2 . g(-1). h(-1) at 5 degrees C to 0.25 mg O-2 . g(-1). h(-1) at 25 degrees C, but few differences in metabolic rates were observed among populations at any temperature. Although we found bioenergetic differences among muskellunge from these populations, they could not be explained solely in terms of thermal adaptation or previously defined genetic groupings. Energetic differences among age-0 muskellunge have important implications for conserving existing esocid populations and managing introduced populations.

AB  - A staircase Inconel 718 block was fabricated to investigate the effects of the thermal cycles on the microstructure evolution in the selective laser melting (SLM) part using optical scope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The laser beam scanning strategy was clearly shown in the part under OM, including laser scanning pattern and hatch spacing. The Y-plane (side surface) was characterized by elongated colonies of cellular dendrites with an average cell spacing of 0.511 similar to 0.845 mu m. In addition, Laves phase was observed in the inter layers and inter-cellular regions. Under the continuing effects of the thermal cycles, the fraction of the Laves-phase showed a significant drop with their morphology changing from coarse and interconnected particles to discrete Laves phase. This is attributed to the reheating process as Laves phase can be dissolved at a proper heat treatment. In terms of the width of the cellular dendrites, the longer the thermal cycle period is, the coarser the elongated grains are. Due to the preferred orientation of the crystal, the Y-plane and Z-plane had a strong texture of < 1 0 1 > and < 0 0 1 >, respectively. With the repeating thermal cycle period elongating, the maximum intensity of the texture, together with the fraction of larger grains and the high misorientation angles, increased. At the same height, there was no significant changes with the grains size, but the fraction of the high misorientation angles (>15 degrees) increased with the subsequent building of the part. Moreover, the area fraction of the porosity was below 0.2%, with no remarkable effects found from the thermal cycles and the build height.

AB  - Winter wheat is an important UK cereal, suited to the current climate. However, recent climate projections show changes in temperature and precipitation are likely, potentially affecting UK crop yields. Assessments of future yields contain several sources of uncertainty including those associated with climate and potential adaptation. Here we address these uncertainties using the CERES-Wheat model fed with an ensemble of regional model projections and different sowing dates and fertiliser regimes. In all of the 13 administrative regions in the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09), increases in temperature accelerated the development rate of wheat, a result that was robust across the ensemble. This generally leads to positive impacts on yield and a northward shift in cultivation, with some decreases in the south. Uncertainties in yield became greater towards 2100, a result of corresponding increases in the uncertainty of climate changes. Sensitivity analysis suggests that CO2 fertilisation could compensate for yield losses due to changes in temperature and precipitation in most regions. Earlier sowings appear to be more beneficial in the future over the UK, whilst later sowings increase the risk of yield losses. In a warmer climate, increasing the amount of fertiliser did not improve yields and in fact increased the risk to productivity. Critically, adjustments to sowing date and fertiliser addition did not mitigate the loss of yield experienced in southern regions, suggesting limited adaptation potential in this case. We propose that regional yield changes may not be critical for wheat production in the UK as a whole, as losses in some regions are more than compensated for by gains in others.

AB  - In this paper, we have addressed the question of whether selective growth and mortality of juvenile 0-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa (L.) occurs in the Dutch Wadden Sea as a consequence of irreversible non-genetic adaptation to water temperature conditions during early pelagic life. As tracers, the number of vertebrae, and of dorsal and anal fin rays were used, since the variability in these characteristics reflects the phenotypic plasticity induced by differences in environmental conditions, and especially water temperature, during early pelagic life. From the onset of larval immigration in March 1995, the juvenile O-group plaice population was sampled frequently and the variability in its meristic characteristics was analysed. The number of vertebrae appeared to be established by water temperature conditions during the egg stage, while the number of dorsal and anal fin rays seemed to be determined during the larval stage. As a consequence, the number of vertebrae was not correlated with either the number of dorsal fin rays or the number of anal fin rays, but the numbers of anal fin rays and dorsal fin rays were strongly correlated. Strong support was found for Kinne's (1962; Comp Biochem Physiol 5:265-282) 'irreversible non-genetic adaptation' hypothesis-that the variability induced by environmental conditions during early life still expresses itself later on in juvenile life-as there was a significant positive relationship in our study between growth and the number of vertebrae during the period April to July. Also, instantaneous mortality was positively related to the number of vertebrae. It is suggested that the relationship with mortality results from a correlation between vertebral number and some important characteristic involved in avoiding predators, such as locomotory performance. Also, mean growth rate during the growing season and instantaneous mortality rate were positively correlated for each meristic characteristic. It is argued that the relationship between growth and mortality will vary over the years and will depend on the combination of environmental conditions during egg and larval stage compared to those during the subsequent juvenile stage.

AB  - On purpose, selective oligomerization of ethylene to its linear trimer and tetramer such as 1-hexene and 1-octene has assumed significant commercial interest. Catalytic systems based on chromium and titanium have shown remarkable selectivity and productivity for the tri and tetramerization of ethylene to 1-hexene or 1-octene. Chromium-based catalysts are the most selective and active and show the highest structural diversity. This article discusses the most recent mechanistic approaches regarding active catalytic species that determine the selectivity to either hexene-1 or octene-1 and reaction parameters that control selectivity of byproducts. Isotopic labeling protocols, in-situ spectroscopic investigations and DFT studies on selected chromium-based catalyst systems are reviewed.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Environmental changes of habitat shaped the sable (Carnivora Mustelidae Martes zibellina) gut microbial community structure and altered the functions of gut microbiota, showing that the wild sable gut microbial community diversity was resilient and responded to environment change. Elevated habitat is a pivotal factor for wild sable survival and reproduction, and the adaptability is in part enabled through their gut microbial communities. Our observations show that despite having been forced to migrate from low altitudes to high altitudes because of anthropogenic habitat encroachment, wild sables showed robustness in adapting to harsh conditions. Additionally, we propose that the crucial factor enabling wild sables to survive in changeable environments was their gut microbial communities. It is widely understood that harsh conditions, such as high altitude and low temperature environments, have an adverse effect on wild fauna survival. However, our results suggested that increasing altitude can enhance some functions in wild sable gut microbial communities.
   In recent decades, wild sable (Carnivora Mustelidae Martes zibellina) habitats, which are often natural forests, have been squeezed by anthropogenic disturbances such as clear-cutting, tilling and grazing. Sables tend to live in sloped areas with relatively harsh conditions. Here, we determine effects of environmental factors on wild sable gut microbial communities between high and low altitude habitats using Illumina Miseq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Our results showed that despite wild sable gut microbial community diversity being resilient to many environmental factors, community composition was sensitive to altitude. Wild sable gut microbial communities were dominated by Firmicutes (relative abundance 38.23%), followed by Actinobacteria (30.29%), and Proteobacteria (28.15%). Altitude was negatively correlated with the abundance of Firmicutes, suggesting sable likely consume more vegetarian food in lower habitats where plant diversity, temperature and vegetation coverage were greater. In addition, our functional genes prediction and qPCR results demonstrated that energy/fat processing microorganisms and functional genes are enriched with increasing altitude, which likely enhanced metabolic functions and supported wild sables to survive in elevated habitats. Overall, our results improve the knowledge of the ecological impact of habitat change, providing insights into wild animal protection at the mountain area with hash climate conditions.

AB  - White clover (Trifolium repens) is an allotetraploid pasture legume widely used in moist temperate climates, but its vulnerability to drought, grazing pressure and pests has restricted its wider use. A related species, Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum), is a potential source of resistances to drought, cold, grazing pressure and pests that could potentially be transferred to white clover by interspecific hybridization. Although direct hybridization has been achieved with difficulty, the hybrids have not been easy to backcross for introgression breeding and no interspecific chromosome recombination has been demonstrated. The present work shows that interspecific recombination can be achieved by using Trifolium occidentale, one of the ancestral parents of T. repens, as a bridging species and that large white clover breeding populations carrying recombinant chromosomes can be generated. A 4x hybrid between T. ambiguum and T. occidentale was crossed with T. repens and then backcrossed for two generations. Five backcross hybrid plants with phenotypes appearing to combine traits from the parent species were selected for FISH-GISH analyses. Recombinant chromosome segments from T. ambiguum were found in all five plants, suggesting that recombination frequencies were significant and sufficient for introgression breeding. Despite early chromosome imbalances, the backcross populations were fertile and produced large numbers of seeds. These hybrids represent a major new resource for the breeding of novel resilient forms of white clover.

AB  - Correct synthesis and maintenance of functional tRNA 3-CCA-ends is a crucial prerequisite for aminoacylation and must be achieved by the phylogenetically diverse group of tRNA nucleotidyltransferases. While numerous reports on the in vitro characterization exist, robust analysis under in vivo conditions is lacking. Here, we utilize Escherichia coli RNase T, a tRNA-processing enzyme responsible for the tRNA-CCA-end turnover, to generate an in vivo system for the evaluation of A-adding activity. Expression of RNase T results in a prominent growth phenotype that renders the presence of a CCA- or A-adding enzyme essential for cell survival in an E.coli cca background. The distinct growth fitness allows for both complementation and selection of enzyme variants in a natural environment. We demonstrate the potential of our system via detection of altered catalytic efficiency and temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, we select functional enzyme variants out of a sequence pool carrying a randomized codon for a highly conserved position essential for catalysis. The presented E.coli-based approach opens up a wide field of future studies including the investigation of tRNA nucleotidyltransferases from all domains of life and the biological relevance of in vitro data concerning their functionality and mode of operation.

AB  - The Glen Gollaidh aillikite dyke (58.36741 degrees N 4.69751 degrees W), N.W. Scotland, occurs within the Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Moine Supergroup 4km east of the Moine Thrust. Phlogopite Ar-40/Ar-36 measurements give a late Devonian maximum emplacement age of 360.3 +/- 4.9 (2 sigma) Ma. This age occurs in a quiet period of Scottish magmatic history c. 30Ma after the closure of the Iapetus and before the start of intra-plate alkali magmatism which affected southern Scotland for 60 My from c. 350Ma. Abundant chromites and Cr-diopsides and a few unaltered olivines, reflecting a mantle provenance, were recovered from heavy mineral concentrates. The North Atlantic Craton, exposed in Lewisian gneisses west of the Moine thrust, is therefore inferred to extend east at depth under Glen Gollaidh, presenting an opportunity to investigate the thickness and composition of the cratonic margin in the Devonian. The aillikite was found to be barren of diamond and no picro-ilmenites or garnets were definitively identified. However, mineral chemistry suggests that a proportion of Glen Gollaidh xenocrysts crystallised in equilibrium with garnet. Most spinels are Mg, Al chromites, with some Mg chromite present. All fall within the garnet peridotite field based on Ti and Cr but with insufficient Cr2O3 (up to 47.2wt%) to be consistent with the diamond stability field. Amongst Cr-diopsides 30% of grains have Cr and Al contents consistent with derivation from garnet peridotite. The majority of clinopyroxenes also show a marked depletion in heavy compared to light rare-earth elements, again consistent with equilibration with garnet. The opx-cpx solvus thermometer demonstrates that average Cr-diopside compositions require at least 37kbar to give a temperature (979 degrees C) lying even on a relatively warm 40 mWm(-2) geotherm (Hasterok and Chapman Earth Planet Sc Lett 307:59-70, 2011). Large variations in the chemistry of mantle minerals reflect a complex history of metasomatism akin to constituents of alkali igneous rocks elsewhere in the Hebridean and Northern Highlands Terranes. Fertilised mantle provided the conditions for generation of aillikite melts, probably triggered by break-off of the advancing Avalonia slab. The cratonic root underlying the Glen Gollaidh aillikite during the late Devonian was apparently too thin to lie within the diamond stability field, consistent with xenoliths from alkali basalts further south. Nonetheless, sufficient geophysical and mineral chemical evidence supports Glen Gollaidh aillikite sitting close to the edge of diamond-prospective mantle therefore suggesting diamond potential a short distance to the west within the Lewisian and what is now East Greenland.

AB  - Chilled storage of spermatozoa in fish has been extensively investigated for many years, but limited research was focused on crustacean species. Chilled storage of spermatophores of black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon is needed to generate consistent and reliable supply of spermatozoa for subsequent use. The objective of this study was to develop a protocol for the chilled storage of black tiger shrimp spermatophores and to evaluate bacterial propagation during chilled storage of spermatophores. In the first experiment, spermatophores were selected and preserved using four different extenders, namely mineral oil, Ringer's solution, phosphate buffer and 0.85% sodium chloride, and stored at low temperature (2-4 C) for 42 d without antibiotic supplementation. Results showed that mineral oil was the best extender for chilled storage of spermatophores, since the highest percentage of viable sperm (58.3 +/- 2.9%) was observed with this extender at the end of experiment (day 42). Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as the predominant bacteria occurring during chilled storage, and the total bacteria count gradually increased during the experiment. In the second experiment, spermatophores were preserved in the mineral oil with four concentrations of the antibiotic, penicillin-streptomycin (0.1%, 1%, 2%, and 3%). There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the percentage of viable sperm among treatments with 0.1%, 1%, 2%, and 3% antibiotics. The total count of Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and P. aeruginosa in the antibiotic treated groups significantly decreased (P < 0.05) to undetectable levels by day 14 of the experiment. Fertility studies from artificial insemination indicated that P. monodon spermatophores preserved with mineral oil for 7-8 d at 2-4 C were capable of fertilizing eggs with hatching rates similar to the controls. This study suggests that chilled storage of spermatophores is a feasible approach for the management and spawning of black tiger prawn broodstock or other invertebrate species that produce spermatophores.

AB  - To attain Salmonella detection thresholds in spinach suspensions using enrichment media requires at least 24 hr. Separation and concentration of selected microorganisms via microfiltration and microfugation reduce time for sample preparation, especially when working with large volumes of vegetable suspensions. This facilitates accelerated detection of Salmonella in spinach suspensions, and may contribute to effectively monitoring this pathogen before it reaches the consumer. We report a microfiltration-based protocol for accelerated sample preparation to concentrate and recover =1 colony forming unit (CFU) Salmonella/g pathogen-free spinach. Storebought samples of spinach and a spinach plant subjected to two environmental conditions (temperature and light exposure) during its production were tested. The overall procedure involves extraction with buffer, a short enrichment step, prefiltration using a nylon filter, crossflow hollow fiber microfiltration, and retentate centrifugation to bring microbial cells to detection levels. Based on 1 CFU Salmonella/g frozen spinach, and a Poisson distribution statistical analyses with 99% probability, we calculated that 3 hr of incubation, when followed by microfiltration, is sufficient to reach the 2 log concentration required for Salmonella detection within 7 hr. Longer enrichment times (5 hr or more) is needed for concentrations lower than 1 CFU Salmonella/g of ready to eat spinach. The recovered microbial cells were identified and confirmed as Salmonella using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and plating methods. Different environmental conditions tested during production did not affect Salmonella viability; this demonstrated the broad adaptability of Salmonella and emphasized the need for methods that enable efficient monitoring of production for the presence of this pathogen.

AB  - Sex determination, the developmental process by which sexually dimorphic phenotypes are established, evolves fast. Evolutionary turnover in a sex determination pathway may occur via selection on alleles that are genetically linked to a new master sex determining locus on a newly formed proto-sex chromosome. Species with polygenic sex determination, in which master regulatory genes are found on multiple different proto-sex chromosomes, are informative models to study the evolution of sex determination and sex chromosomes. House flies are such a model system, with male determining loci possible on all six chromosomes and a female-determiner on one of the chromosomes as well. The two most common male-determining proto-Y chromosomes form latitudinal clines on multiple continents, suggesting that temperature variation is an important selection pressure responsible for maintaining polygenic sex determination in this species. Temperature-dependent fitness effects could be manifested through temperature-dependent gene expression differences across proto-Y chromosome genotypes. These gene expression differences may be the result of cis regulatory variants that affect the expression of genes on the proto-sex chromosomes, or trans effects of the proto-Y chromosomes on genes elswhere in the genome. We used RNA-seq to identify genes whose expression depends on proto-Y chromosome genotype and temperature in adult male house flies. We found no evidence for ecologically meaningful temperature-dependent expression differences of sex determining genes between male genotypes, but we were probably not sampling an appropriate developmental time-point to identify such effects. In contrast, we identified many other genes whose expression depends on the interaction between proto-Y chromosome genotype and temperature, including genes that encode proteins involved in reproduction, metabolism, lifespan, stress response, and immunity. Notably, genes with genotype-by-temperature interactions on expression were not enriched on the proto-sex chromosomes. Moreover, there was no evidence that temperature-dependent expression is driven by chromosome-wide cis-regulatory divergence between the proto-Y and proto-X alleles. Therefore, if temperature-dependent gene expression is responsible for differences in phenotypes and fitness of proto-Y genotypes across house fly populations, these effects are driven by a small number of temperature-dependent alleles on the proto-Y chromosomes that may have trans effects on the expression of genes on other chromosomes.

AB  - Pregnant females modify their thermoregulatory behaviour in many species of viviparous (live-bearing) reptiles, typically maintaining higher and more stable body temperatures at this time. Such modifications often have been interpreted as adaptations to viviparity, functioning to accelerate embryonic development and/or modify phenotypic traits of hatchlings. An alternative possibility is that similar maternal thermophily may be widespread also in oviparous species and if so, would be a pre-adaptation (rather than an adaptation) to viviparity. Because eggs are retained in utero for a significant proportion of development even in oviparous reptiles, maternal thermophily might confer similar advantages in oviparous as in viviparous taxa. Experimental trials on montane oviparous scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) support the pre-adaptation hypothesis. First, captive females (both reproductive and non-reproductive) selected higher temperatures than males. Second, experimentally imposing thermal regimes on pregnant females significantly affected their oviposition dates and the phenotypic traits (body shape, running speed) of their hatchlings. Thus, as for many other behavioural correlates of pregnancy in viviparous reptiles, maternal thermophily likely may have already been present in the ancestral oviparous taxa that gave rise to present-day viviparous forms.

AB  - With the aim of producing insect-resistant potato plants, internode explants of Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Desiree were transformed with an Agrobacterium strain C58pMP90 containing an insect (Phaedon cochleariae: Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) chitinase gene and the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) gene as selectable marker, both under the control of the viral CaMV 35S promoter. Three transformed potato lines (CH3, CH5 and CH25) exhibiting the highest chitinolytic activities were selected for feeding experiments with the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), under controlled photoperiod and temperature conditions. Aphids fed on transgenic potato plants showed a reduced pre-reproductive period and an enhanced daily fecundity. Transgenic potato lines did not affect nymphal mortality, but improved several biological parameters related to aphid populations growth. Artificial diets were used to provide active (1, 10, 100 and 500 mug ml(-1)) and inactive (500 mug ml(-1)) bacterial (Serratia marcescens) chitinase to M. persicae. These compounds increased nymph survival at all active chitinase doses when compared to the control diet, while inactive chitinase did not. Although the pre-reproductive period was slightly shortened and the daily fecundity slightly higher, active and inactive chitinase provided as food led a reduction from 1 to 1.5 day populations doubling time. Therefore chitinase activity was responsible for the probiotic effects on aphids. Our results question the relevance of a chitinase-based strategy in the context of potato culture protection.

AB  - Winter survival develops efficient tolerance mechanisms in plants by regulating cold-responsive and cold-regulated genes at the transcriptional level. Hence, an insight into the expression would provide the molecular function of these cold responsive genes. In this study, an uncharacterized gene encoding a cold-regulated (Cor413) protein identified from Saccharum spontaneum (wild relative species of sugarcane) low-temperature transcriptome with environmental adaptability is isolated and characterized. The full-length coding region possesses an open reading frame of 642 bp, which encodes a putative polypeptide of 213 amino acids of molecular weight 25.6 kDa and an isoelectric point (Pi) of 9.69. The SsCor413 sequence showed a high similarity to monocot Cor413 proteins comprising a WCOR413 domain. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that Cor413 protein has multispanning transmembrane helices along with highly conserved phosphorylation sites. String analysis suggested that SsCor413 is grouped with LEA and Rab proteins that are involved in freezing tolerance. Gene ontology analysis assigned the protein to terms such as "plasma membrane," "cold acclimation," and "response to cold." Sub-cellular localization experiments of sugarcane callus and onion epidermal cells indicated the nuclear localized expression. Quantitative gene expression analysis indicated that the SsCor413 gene is up-regulated in leaf and root tissues of S. spontaneum under low temperature, salinity, and water deficit stress conditions. These results highlight the potential role of SsCor413 in abiotic stress tolerance, and this gene could be a new candidate for combating multiple stresses in sugarcane.

AB  - One of the most enigmatic features of long-term Cenozoic climatic evolution, with some analog potential for present/future global climate change, is the last sustained warm and high-atmospheric CO2 interval in Earth's history, which started after the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.971-5.332 Ma) in the Mediterranean Sea. We present high-resolution, astronomically-tuned climate (Mg/Ca, delta O-18) and productivity (Ba/Ca, delta C-13) proxy records from the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides obliquus in the Kalamaki section (Zakynthos Island, Greece), which sheds new light on the early Pliocene Mediterranean hydrographic dynamics, and the associated climatic transition from 5.33 to 5.11 Ma. We recognized four distinct climatic phases with variable amplitude changes: (1) very warm climate interval prior to 5.28 Ma characterized by minimum ice volume, large salinity fluctuations, enhanced productivity, and intense river runoff, (2) stable paleoceanographic conditions from 5.28 to 523 Ma, which reflect a relatively warm and mesotrophic to eutrophic open-marine environment with improved ventilation, (3) a brief interval (20 ky) characterized by the most pronounced ice growth and intense cooling (similar to 5 degrees C) coupled with the abrupt decrease of ventilation and primary productivity, and (4) reinstatement of relatively stable conditions (warm and well-ventilated mesotrophic upper water column) in conjunction with relatively stable sea-level after 5.21 Ma. Overall, the succession of these phases provides an explanation for the more variable Mediterranean climate and stronger hydrographic variability with respect to other regions during the early Pliocene.

AB  - We compare heat-related mortality impacts for three European cities, London, Lisbon and Budapest, under five climate change policies representing different dates at which carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions peak, rates at which emissions decline, and emissions floors, and compare them with a non-mitigation business-as-usual emissions scenario, for three time periods, the 2030s, 2050s and 2080s. Under an SRES A1B business-as-usual emissions scenario and using climate projections from 21 GCMs, heat-related mortality rates (per 100,000 of the population) attributable to climate change in the 2080s are simulated to be in the range 2-6 for London, 4-50 for Lisbon and 10-24 for Budapest. Whilst the policy scenarios serve to reduce the number of heat-related deaths attributable to climate change, by up to 70% of the A1B impacts under an aggressive mitigation scenario that gives a 50% chance of avoiding a 2 degrees C global-mean temperature rise from pre-industrial times, they do not eradicate the effects of climate change on heat-related mortality. The magnitude of avoided impacts is minor in the early 21st century but increases towards the end of the century. Importantly, the magnitude of avoided impacts is more sensitive to the year at which emissions are reduced than to the rate at which emissions are reduced. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Platform carbonates are a major component of the Earth System but their spatial extent through geological time is difficult to reconstruct, due to the incompleteness of the geological record, sampling heterogeneity and their intrinsic complexity. Here we use coupled ecological niche modeling and deep-time general circulation models to predict the occurrence of platform carbonates at the global scale during the Cretaceous. Specifically, niche modeling uses fuzzy logic to predict probable occurrence of platform carbonates as a function of sea-surface temperature, sea-surface salinity, primary productivity and water depth. The first three parameters derive from Cretaceous global paleoclimatic simulations using a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model, while bathymetry is based on paleogeographical reconstructions. Model predictions are validated with the well documented and abundant geological data from the Aptian. The methodologies developed for the Aptian are subsequently extended to other Cretaceous time intervals. The results of the niche model accurately predict the geographic distribution of Aptian carbonate platforms if a preference for low open-marine productivity levels is assumed for the rudist-dominated carbonate factories. However, if a preference for high productivity levels is assumed, the modeling results do not match the reported global distribution of Aptian carbonate platforms. From the Early Cretaceous into the Late Cretaceous sea level rose and the continents, on average, moved into lower latitudes. The model predicts a corresponding increase in the extent of the carbonate platforms, mainly due to the increasing extent of shallow-water environments available to carbonate development. These results indicate that long-term sea-level rise may have been a major factor responsible for the increase in the area of platform carbonates during the Cretaceous.

AB  - Larvae of the weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus L. can cause substantial damage to sugarcane and citrus. To test the feasibility of managing Diaprepes populations by flooding canefields for extended periods of time,larval mortalities were recorded after submerging larvae under water in soil filled trays at temperatures from 18 to 27 degrees C for up to 5 weeks. Mean mortality exceeded 90% by 3 weeks of submergence at 24 and 27 degrees C and after 5 weeks at 21 degrees C, but was only 46% after 5 weeks at 18 degrees C. A model was derived by multiple regression analysis, describing the response of mortality to time and temperature. The model accounted for 84% of the variation in larval mortality. Levels of O-2 and pH were monitored in selected trays during the experiment; only pH correlated significantly with larval mortality but contributed only 20% of total variation.

AB  - Accurate prediction of the thermal behavior of the axle-brake systems is an imperative part of the design process of the braking systems in off-highway machinery. The frictional heat generated during repetitive braking cycles under heavy braking loads can cause several negative effects including brake fade, thermal cracks and even fluid vaporization. Despite its significance, limited capability has been developed to predict the thermo-fluids of the wet axle-brake systems. The multi-scale and multi-physics nature of the problem in combination with the significant complexity of the geometries involved renders the application of the common-practice computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods impractical. This paper, proposes a framework for the application of CFD to predict the time-dependent thermo-fluid state of a wet axle-brake system under repetitive braking with varying loads. The thermal model includes full consideration of the heat transfer in the friction pairs, air-oil mixture, and eventually the surrounding solid parts. To achieve this goal, the problem is broken into two sub-problems: the flow between a pair of the friction and separator plates, the global solution of the fluid motion of the air-oil mixture in the housing and eventually the heat transfer In the solid parts. Finally, the temporal evolution of the temperature in both fluid and solid phases predicted by the proposed simulation method, are validated against experimental measurements showing good correlation level.

AB  - The metabolism of juvenile hormone by JH-esterase and JH-epoxide hydrolase, and octopamine by tyrosine decarboxylase were studied under normal and stress conditions in flies of two related lines of D. melanogaster. One was selected for high (HA line) and another for low (LA line) male sexual activity for more than 700 generations. It was demonstrated that prolonged selection for low male sexual activity results in considerable changes in both systems. Tyrosine decarboxylase activity in males and females of the LA line was sharply reduced as compared with those of the HA and controle Canton-S lines; JH-esterase and JH-epoxide hydrolase activities were decreased in females, and not in males, of the LA line. It was demonstrated that the response of both metabolic systems to heat stress is impaired in individuals of the LA line: the system of juvenile hormone metabolism does not respond to stress, and that of octopamine metabolism is decelerated. The role of juvenile hormone metabolism in male reproductive function is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The three species of blue mussels, Mytilus trossulus Gould 1850, M. edulis Linnaeus 1758 and M. galloprovincialis Lamarck 1819, have distinct global distribution patterns that are hypothesized to reflect differences in their tolerances of temperature and salinity. We examined effects on heart rate (beats min(-1)) of acute exposure and acclimation to different combinations of temperature and salinity to test this hypothesis and, in the context of the invasive success of M. galloprovincialis, to gain insights into the factors that may explain the replacement of the temperate Pacific native, M. trossulus, by this Mediterranean Sea invader along much of the California coast. Heart rate of M. trossulus was significantly higher than that of M. galloprovincialis, consistent with evolutionary adaptation to a lower habitat temperature (temperature compensation) in the former species. Heart rates of M. trossulus/M. galloprovincialis hybrids were intermediate between those of the parental species. Following acclimation to 14 degrees C and 21 degrees C, heart rates of all species exhibited partial compensation to temperature.
   Heart rate increased with rising temperature until a high temperature was reached at which point activity fell sharply, the high critical temperature (H-crit). H-crit increased with increasing acclimation temperature and differed among species in a pattern that reflected their probable evolutionary adaptation temperatures: M. galloprovincialis is more heat tolerant than the other two congeners. Ability to sustain heart function in the cold also reflected evolutionary history: M. trossulus is more cold tolerant than M. galloprovincialis.
   Heart rates for all three congeners decreased gradually in response to acute reductions in salinity until a low salinity (S-crit) was reached at which heart rate dropped precipitously. S-crit decreased with decreasing salinity of acclimation and was generally lowest for M. galloprovincialis. Mortality during acclimation under common garden conditions was greatest in M. trossulus and was highest at high acclimation temperatures and salinities. These intrinsic differences in basal heart rate, thermal and salinity responses, acclimatory capacity, and survivorship are discussed in the contexts of the species' biogeographic patterning and, for the invasive species M. galloprovincialis, the potential for further range expansion along the Pacific coast of North America.

AB  - The spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is one of the most important insect pests attacking maize and sorghum in Ethiopia. Recent studies have indicated that the pest is spreading to new locations where it was not reported before. In the current study, laboratory investigations were carried out to determine the combined effect of different levels of relative humidity and temperature regimes on the development and fecundity of C. partellus, as these physical factors are known to play an important role in the life cycle of insects and adaptability to local climate. Developmental time, longevity, potential fecundity and realized fecundity of C. partellus were measured under controlled conditions. Three temperature regimes (22 degrees C, 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and three relative humidity levels (40%, 60% and 80%) were tested. It was found that temperature, relative humidity (RH) and their interaction significantly affected the developmental time, adult longevity, potential fecundity and realized fecundity of the pest. Developmental time was inversely related to temperature. Mean duration of C. partellus life cycle was 70.2 days at 22 degrees C and 80% RH, whereas it took only 26.5 days to complete its life cycle at 30 degrees C and 40% RH. Male and female longevity were similar in most cases. The adult life span ranged between 6.9-11.1 days at 22 degrees C and 3.1-7.2 days at 30 degrees C for different levels of relative humidity. The most suitable conditions for C. partellus development and fecundity were 26-30 degrees C temperatures regimes and 60-80% RH levels.

AB  - Sulfate-reducing granular sludge has recently been developed and characterized in detail as part of the development of the sulfate reduction, autotrophic denitrification, nitrification integrated (SANI) process. However, information regarding temperature of granules to environmental fluctuation is lacking, an aspect that is important in dealing with real wastewater. A comprehensive assessment of sulfate-reducing granular sludge performance under various environmental conditions was thus conducted in this study, including temperature, pH, oxygen, nitrite, and free nitrous acid (FNA) as possible encountering conditions in the removal of organics and/or nitrate. Specific chemical oxygen demand removal rate of the granules was determined to be reduced by 65 % when the temperature varied between 10-15 A degrees C, reduced by 70 % when dissolved oxygen (DO) was 0.5 mg/L or greater, and at least, reduced by 75 % when nitrite was 30 mg N/L or above. Nevertheless, the sludge activity recovered by 82, 100, and 86 % from exposure to high oxygen and nitrite and low temperature levels, respectively. Combined inhibition of nitrite and FNA on the sludge is strong and complex, while FNA alone reduced cell viability from 60 to 40 % when its concentration increased to 2.3 mg N/L. The present study demonstrates that sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) granules possess high resilience against varying environmental conditions, showing the high application potential of sulfate-reducing granular sludge in dealing with brackish and saline industrial or domestic wastewaters.

AB  - Dermatophagoides farinae is a major exogenous allergen. Its ability to tolerate adverse external temperatures makes it responsible for widespread occurrence of allergies. Heat shock protein (HSP), a recognized temperature stress response gene, but its role in D. farinae remained unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive study. First, we found that 25 degrees C was the optimal temperature, and all mites died at 48 or -20 degrees C for 1 h (LT100). Thus, 41 degrees C (LT15), 43 degrees C (LT25), 45 degrees C (LT45), and -10 degrees C (LT25) were selected as stress temperatures to perform de novo RNA-seq. Then, 17 main genes of the 47 differentially expressed HSP, were detected by qRT-PCR. Temperature and time gradient versus expression magnitude histogram revealed that HSP70, HSP83-1, HSP83-2, and HSP16-1 showed heat stress response only at 41-43 degrees C, while HSC71 and HSF played a regulatory role under both heat and cold stress, particularly HSF, with strong intensity, long duration, and quick upregulation at recovery for 10-20 min. Finally, gene expression and D. farinae survival rates significantly decreased following RNAi. These findings indicated that HSPs conferred thermo-tolerance or cold-tolerance to D. farinae. In conclusion, this was the first meaningful exploration that confirmed HSP and HSF playing an important role in temperature resistance of D. farinae. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some properties of the functions yielding from the temperature field have been employed as a tool to determine the structural zones' localization in a large static steel ingot. Thus, a numerical simulation was performed to generate the temperature field converged subsequently into the thermal gradient field. As a result, the selection of a zone, in which a columnar into equiaxed structure transformation (CET) is expected, is possible. It is shown that the CET - zone is formed when the thermal gradient becomes temporarily constant. Moreover, the CET localization can be easily controlled / shifted by the mold thickness selection. Both temperature and thermal gradient fields were also calculated to predict mathematically the creation of some structural zones in the continuously solidifying brass ingot. The columnar structure resulting from the constrained growth seems dominant in these ingots. However, when the s/l interface rate and velocity of the liquidus isotherm movement are subjected to a separation then the birth of the equiaxed structure is to be expected. In the industrial practice, the following structural zones are evinced in a continuously cast brass ingot: chilled columnar grains-, (CC), fine columnar grains-, (FC), columnar grains-, (C), equiaxed grains zone, (E), and eventually the single crystal, (SC), situated axially. The current innovative method for the mathematical predictions of the CET appearance in the static ingot turns out also useful in the reproduction of the all mentioned structural zones' localization. In particular, a study of the behavior of the velocity of the liquidus isotherm movement and thermal gradient changes versus solidification time delivers a precise information about these structural zones' situation.

AB  - Late-Variscan (S-, A-type) granites and rhyolitic ignimbrites/lavas (similar to 325 Ma) of the Altenberg-Teplice Caldera (Erzgebirge/Krusne acute accent hory Mts., NW Bohemian Massif) were investigated by using mineral and whole-rock chemistry and Nd-Pb isotopic systematics. Focus was given to the normally zoned Teplice Rhyolite (TR) volcanic successions and, to a lesser extent, the younger comagmatic rapakivi granite porphyry to assess the involvement of magma mixing and to identify differentiation processes in the petrogenesis of A-type rocks. Mineralogical, geochemical, and isotope data disprove A-type magma evolution by closed-system fractional crystallization and favor crystal-liquid separation under complex open-system conditions. Although no compelling mineralogical or chemical evidence for basic-acid magma mixing was found in the caldera, all rocks have constant isotopic fingerprints (epsilon Nd-(i) = -1.9 to -3.7, Pb-207/Pb-204((i)) = 15.53-15.65) and two-stage Nd model ages (T-DM2 = 1.2-1.3 Ga) that represent intermediate ranges between crustal and mantle components of the Cadomian and Lower Paleozoic basement. Thus, the caldera rocks were derived from a heterogeneous source region without basic magma input. The A-type magmas were generated chiefly by biotite dehydration melting of metasediments and non-restitic granodioritic-tonalitic rocks, likely prompted by heat advection from basement exhumation. Contrasting degrees of fertility, together with the distribution of heterogeneous protoliths relative to the heat source, played a critical role in the production of nearly coeval S-and A-type magmas in the Erzgebirge. The shift from S-to A-type magmatism was then controlled by a change in protolith compositions during the late-orogenic regime. Origin of the rapakivi granite porphyry (An(27-43), similar to the TR range) can be explained by self-mixing in the lowest zone of the chamber owing to ponding/recharge of hotter, isotopically similar granitic magma. This study reinforces the idea that generation of A-type rocks and zoned silicic systems does not necessarily require basic magma input despite heterogeneous isotopic fingerprints and presence of rapakivi-textured rocks. The concept of S-and A-type magmas requiring significantly different pressures, H2O contents, and protoliths in the source region does not conform to the Erzgebirge/Krusne acute accent hory Mts. magmatism. Similar pressures and water-absent conditions at the melting site suggest that mixed protoliths and their melting temperatures were the decisive variables in magma production.

AB  - Phytophthora ramorum outbreaks have been documented to occur in natural settings during favourable environmental conditions, and to be caused by the overdominance of highly infectious genotypes. However, little is known about the dynamics of outbreaks in nursery settings. Through the description and quantification of symptoms, as well as through systematic pathogen isolation and genotyping, this study examines the scale and dynamic of spread of four different genotypes of P. ramorum in soil, water and leaves among Rhododendron plants in a nursery setting. Phytophthora ramorum isolation success was highest from leaves and intermediate from soil, reaching peak values at the end of the wet-warm season. The observed disease outbreak was of moderate intensity, and abundance among the four genotypes used as inoculum varied, depending on substrate and isolation time. The spread mechanism of the disease was mostly through leaf-to-leaf contagion, followed by leaf-to-soil, and the scale of pathogen spread was less than 2 m in the 20 months of the experiment. Surprisingly, a large number of novel genotypes were detected during the experiment, and all were clearly derived from the four used as inoculum. The frequency of two such novel genotypes in the post-outbreak phase was comparable to the frequency of some of the original four genotypes, suggesting they may be competitive. The creation of new genotypes in a nursery setting poses a threat to the industry itself, as well as to wildlands, due to the increase in pathogen adaptability often associated with new genetic variation.

AB  - The accuracy is one of the key indicators for capacitive accelerometers. However, it will be affected by temperature drift especially the rapid temperature variation. To compensate the temperature drift, a back propagation (BP) neural network model based on an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) has been proposed. According to the ratio of average fitness to maximum fitness, a nonlinear equation constructed is to obtain adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation. Moreover, the algorithm flow of crossover and mutation is also adaptive by this ratio. Hence, the compensation model will avoid local optimal values effectively. Five experiments with different input accelerations have been conducted in a temperature variation rate of 1 degrees C/min to test the model. The results validate that, the AGA-BP compensation model has the best effect, compared to the multiple linear regression (MLR) compensation model and GA-BP compensation model. This model is of high reference values for compensating rapid temperature variation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluating the high-temperature creep behaviour of the Al alloys used in the automotive industries has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers over the last decade. However, very little investigation into the high-temperature tertiary creep of Al alloys has been published to date. In this study, in-situ neutron diffraction analysis was employed in order to evaluate the tertiary creep behaviour of A206 aluminum alloy under tensile load at 225 degrees C. The selected pressure and temperature was chosen to simulate actual in-service condition experienced by the automotive powertrain components; e.g. cylinder block and engine head. The results of the in-situ neutron diffraction revealed the tertiary creep behaviour of the selected {111} planes in A206 via monitoring the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak and creep strain (%). This technique is first of a kind, which provides a method to observe damage accumulation during tertiary creep prior to actual observed material failure (fracture) in the A206 alloy at high temperature.

AB  - Increased concerns over global warming and air pollution has pushed governments to consider renewable energy as an alternative to meet the required energy demands of countries. Many government policies are deployed in Taiwan to promote solar and wind energy to cope with air pollution and self-dependency for energy generation. However, the residential sector contribution is not significant despite higher feed-in tariff rates set by government. This study analyzes wind and solar power availability of four different locations of southern Taiwan, based on the Koppen-Geiger climate classification system. The solar-wind hybrid system (SWHS) considered in this study consists of multi-crystalline photovoltaic (PV) modules, vertical wind turbines, inverters and batteries. Global reanalysis weather data and a climate-based electricity load profile at a 1-h resolution was used for the simulation. A general framework for multi-objective optimization using this simulation technique is proposed for solar-wind hybrid system, considering the feed-in tariff regulations, environmental regulations and installation area constraints of Taiwan. The hourly load profile is selected using a climate classification system. A decomposition-based differential evolutionary algorithm is used for finding the optimal Pareto set of two economic objectives and one environmental objective with maximum installation area and maximum PV capacity constraints. Two types of buildings are chosen for analysis at four climate locations. Analysis of Pareto sets revealed that the photovoltaic modules are economic options for a grid-connected mode at all four locations, whereas solar-wind hybrid systems are more environmentally friendly. A method of finding the fitness index for the Pareto front sets and a balanced strategy for choosing the optimal configuration is proposed. The proposed balanced strategy provides savings to users-up to 49% for urban residential buildings and up to 32% for rural residential buildings with respect to buildings without a hybrid energy system (HES)-while keeping carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions lower than 50% for the total project lifecycle time of 20 years. The case study reveals that for all four locations and two building types an HES system comprising a 15 kW photovoltaic system and a small capacity battery bank provides the optimal balance between economic and environmental objectives.

KW  - FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA
AB  - Pupae of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), were maintained in the laboratory for emergence under selected constant and fluctuating temperatures and humidities. Temperatures ranged from 10 to 40-degrees-C, with a vapor pressure deficiency maintained constant at 8.5 mb in one study. No eclosion occurred at 10-degrees-C or at 40-degrees-C. Insects held at 15 and 35-degrees-C had low survival and a high percentage (39-62%) were deformed. The optimum rate of development occurred at 30 and 35-degrees-C, but a high percentage (58% of males, 39% of females) of the insects held at 35-degrees-C emerged deformed. In a comparison between the constant and fluctuating temperatures (the mean of the fluctuating temperature equalled the constant temperature treatment), survival was not affected, but development was generally faster with the fluctuating treatment. In another study, relative humidity ranged from 20 to about 100% (33.9 to about 0 mb) and was maintained at 30-degrees-C. Percentage survival, rate of development, or percent deformity were not affected by humidity. Weight loss was similar among insects held under different humidity treatments and was not affected by constant or fluctuating condition. Although survival was the same for the sexes, females developed at a faster rate and a smaller percentage emerged deformed as compared with males.

AB  - Adaptive coloration among animals is one of the most recognizable outcomes of natural selection. Here, we investigate evolutionary drivers of white coloration in velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae), which has previously been considered camouflage with the fruit of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). Our analyses indicate instead that velvet ants evolved white coloration millions of years before creosote bush was widespread in North America's hot deserts. Furthermore, velvet ants and the creosote fruit exhibit different spectral reflectance patterns, which appear distinct to potential insectivorous predators. While the white coloration in velvet ants likely did not evolve as camouflage, we find that white-coloured species remain cooler than their red/orange relatives, and therefore we infer the white coloration likely evolved in response to Neogene desertification. This study shows the importance of cross-disciplinary investigation and of testing multiple hypotheses when investigating evolutionary drivers of adaptive coloration.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) convert chemical energy to electrical energy via electrochemically active microorganisms. The interactions between microbes and the surface of a carbon electrode play a vital role in capturing the respiratory electrons from bacteria. Therefore, improvements in the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of carbon materials are essential for increasing performance. In this study, a microwave and sulfuric acid treatment was used to modify the surface structure of graphite granules. The prepared expandable graphite granules (EGG) exhibited a 1.5 times higher power den-sity than the unmodified graphite granules (1400 vs. 900 mW/m ). Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed improved physical and chemical characteristics of the EGG surface. These results suggest that physical and chemical surface modification using sulfuric acid and microwave heating improves the performance of electrode-based bioprocesses, such as MFCs.

AB  - Thermal cover may influence habitat selection by white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in subtropical climates with hot summers. We 1) tested the hypothesis that thermal environment is more important in habitat selection at midday during summer than forage quality or quantity and concealment cover and 2) determined whether operative temperature, vegetation height, or woody plant canopy cover (or some combination of these) explain habitat selection at midday. We predicted that during crepuscular periods and at night habitat use increases with increasing forage quality and quantity and concealment cover and is unrelated to thermal environment. Male white-tailed deer were fitted with GPS collars to determine resources selected within habitats during June and July 2008 and 2009. A generalized linear mixed model using logistic regression was used to estimate resource selection functions. We used the first principal component in a principal components analysis (PCA) of forage standing crop, crude protein, and acid detergent fiber (ADF) to create a 'forage index'. This index and vegetation height, operative temperature and concealment cover, together with their interactions with activity period, were used to develop a priori candidate models. Akaike weights were used to compare candidate models. A model that included the forage index, vegetation height, operative temperature, concealment cover and their interactions with activity period was the best model out of 97 candidate models for explaining habitat selection by adult male white-tailed deer. Male white-tailed deer selected areas with taller vegetation in morning and midday activity periods but selected shorter vegetation during evening and nighttime. Forage quality was important in habitat selection in all activity periods. Male white-tailed deer did not select areas with greater concealment cover during any activity period. A combination of operative temperature, vegetation height, and woody plant canopy cover predicted midday habitat use better than any of these three variables alone. Thermoregulatory behavior in male white-tailed appears to include a combination of seeking cooler environments during midday but at the same time using areas with greater forage quality.

AB  - The compositions and volumes of basalts erupted in divergent margin environments provide a record of the thermal, chemical, and dynamical state of their mantle source regions. To relate basalt compositions and volumes to the underlying thermochemical and dynamical state of their mantle source regions, we have developed REEBOX PRO, a compiled stand-alone application that simulates adiabatic decompression melting of passively or actively upwelling mantle containing up to five distinct lithologies. The model calculates melt compositions using thermodynamic and experimental constraints on the melting behaviors and mineral-melt partitioning behavior of homogeneous and lithologically heterogeneous mantle sources containing anhydrous peridotite, hydrous peridotite, harzburgite, and/or silica-saturated/-undersaturated pyroxenite. Key model outputs include the mean composition and crustal thickness for the bulk basaltic crust, calculated for passive and active upwelling scenarios. Here, we present the mathematical formulations underlying the model and benchmark it against existing hydrous melting models and models for mid-ocean ridge basalt formation. We show that the hydrous and anhydrous peridotite melting models incorporated in REEBOX PRO capture the essential differences in basalt composition and volume demonstrated by previous models, and constrain the ambient mantle beneath the global spreading ridge system to be between 1319 and 1366 degrees C, depending on the relative fertility and/or water content of the mid-ocean ridge mantle source. We also show how model outputs may be manipulated outside of the modeling program to calculate nontraditional melt mixing scenarios. These examples highlight the flexibility of REEBOX PRO for simulating melt generation within a range of geodynamical contexts.

AB  - Parasitism can be a driver of species divergence and thereby significantly alter species formation processes. While we still need to better understand how parasite-mediated speciation functions, it is even less clear how this process is affected by environmental change. Both rapid and gradual changes of the environment can modify host immune responses, parasite virulence and the specificity of their interactions. They will thereby change host-parasite evolutionary trajectories and the potential for speciation in both hosts and parasites. Here, we summarise mechanisms of host-parasite interactions affecting speciation and subsequently consider their susceptibility to environmental changes. We mainly focus on the effects of temperature change and nutrient input to ecosystems as they are major environmental stressors. There is evidence for both disruptive and accelerating effects of those pressures on speciation that seem to be context-dependent. A prerequisite for parasite-driven host speciation is that parasites significantly alter the host's Darwinian fitness. This can rapidly lead to divergent selection and genetic adaptation; however, it is likely preceded by more short-term plastic and transgenerational effects. Here, we also consider how these first responses and their susceptibility to environmental changes could lead to alterations of the species formation process and may provide alternative pathways to speciation.

AB  - Introduced plants provide a unique opportunity to examine how plants respond through plasticity and adaptation to changing climates. We compared plants of Spartina alterniflora from the native (United States, 27-43 degrees N) and introduced (China, 19-40 degrees N) ranges. In the field and greenhouse, aboveground productivity of Chinese plants was greater than that of North American plants. Aboveground biomass in the field declined with increasing latitude in the native range, a pattern that persisted in the greenhouse, indicating a genetic basis. Aboveground biomass in the field displayed hump-shaped relationships with latitude in China, but this pattern disappeared in field and greenhouse common gardens, indicating phenotypic plasticity. Relationships in both geographic regions were explained by temperature, which is probably the underlying environmental factor affecting aboveground biomass. S. alterniflora has evolved greater biomass in China, but in the four decades since it was introduced, it has not yet evolved the genetic cline in biomass seen in its native range. By working at lower latitudes in the introduced range than have been sampled in the native range, we identified an optimum temperature in the introduced range above which aboveground productivity decreases.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to check if it is possible to influence sea bass juvenile metabolism by a conditioning of larvae from day 6 post hatching to day 45 to a low or a high HUFA compound diet (LH, 0.8% EPA + DHA and HH, 2.2% EPA + DHA) when reared at 16 or 22 degrees C. Following a 3-month intermediate period (at 19 degrees C using a commercial diet), the adaptability of the 4 initial larval groups to a HUFA experimental deprived diet (0.5% EPA + DHA) were tested at 19 degrees C in a 60 day-experiment (d-151-211). The four experimental duplicated conditions were ex-LH 16 and ex-HH 16 for the 2 groups previously reared at 16 degrees C (initial weight, 7.3 +/- 0.5 g) and ex-LH22 and ex-HH22 for the 2 groups previously reared at 22 degrees C (initial weight, 11.1 +/- 0.5 g). Survival was maximal and there was a 1.6-2 fold increase in mass during the experiment. Growth was similar in the 4 experimental groups: NS difference in growth curve slopes (P=0.7). At the end of the experiment (d-211), whole body fat levels were in the same range in all groups (13-15% WW). The fatty acid (FA) composition in polar lipids (PL) and total lipids (TL) were significantly affected by initial weight related to larvae conditioning, which can be mainly attributed to a dilution effect (impact of initial FA content on final FA content versus relative mass increase during the course of the experiment). Conversely to this trend, DHA content in PL was higher in the ex-LH groups than in the ex-HH groups whatever thermal conditioning of larvae was. This indicated that ex-LH groups had a better capacity to adapt to a deficient HUFA diet than ex-HH fish. The relative expression of the delta-6 desaturase (Delta 6D) was significantly higher in ex-LH than in ex-HH groups (P<0.001) between d-151 and d-181, which suggested that Delta 6D transcription in ex-LH groups was positively modulated by the HUFA-deprived diet. This stimulation of the first step of the desaturation/elongation pathway could allow synthesizing FA needed to compensate low dietary HUFA supply. This study shows for the first time that it seems possible to influence juvenile fish metabolism by a nutritional conditioning during the larval stage. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Along a thermal gradient and under a LD 12:12 h cycle, nurse workers of the ant Camponotus mus select for the brood two different temperatures daily: 30.8 degrees C at the middle of the light period (circadian phase = 90 degrees), and 27.5 degrees C 8 h later, during the dark period (CP = 210 degrees). Brood-carrying activity proved to be self-sustained, running its two daily bursts free with a similar period of 23.5 h, under both LL and DD. The LD alternation acted as a strong Zeitgeber. A phase-delay of the LD 12:12 h cycle reset the overt rhythm at once, being both daily events locked-on to the delayed light:dark transition. However, changes in expression, non-occurrence, or even splitting of the two daily brood-carrying events during resetting depended on the phase of the delayed DL transition. By comparing the occurrence of activity with predictions based on a threshold curve of thermal sensitivity, results indicated that an immediate resetting of the involved pacemaker actually takes place. Nurse workers do not directly control the total time spent by the brood at the selected temperature. Instead, the endogenously-driven thermal sensitivity triggers their thermal-searching behavior at two critical times of the day, when environmental temperature is expected to reach its maximum and minimum.

AB  - In a previous directed evolution study, the BFIT approach to increasing the thermal robustness of proteins was introduced and applied to the lipase from Bacillus subtilis. It is based on the general concept of iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM), according to which sites in an enzyme are subjected to saturation mutagenesis, the best hit of a given library is then used as a template for randomization at other sites, and the process is continued until the desired catalyst improvement has been achieved. The appropriate choice of the ISM sites is crucial; in the BFIT method the criterion is residues characterized by highest B factors available from Xray crystallography data. In the present study, BFIT was employed in order to increase the thermal robustness of the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger. Several rounds of ISM resulted in the best variant showing a 21 degrees C increase in the T-50(60) value, an 80-fold improvement in half-life at 60 degrees C, and a 44 kcal mol(-1) improvement in inactivation energy. Seven other variants were also evolved with moderate yet significant improvements; these were characterized by 10-14 degrees C increases in T-50(60), 20-30-fold improvement in half-lives at 60 degrees C and 15-20 kcal mol(-1) elevations in activation energy. Unexpectedly, in the ISM process the best variants were obtained from essentially neutral or even inferior mutant parents, that is, when a given library contains no improved mutants. This constitutes a practical way to escape from what appear to be local minima ("dead ends") in the fitness landscape-a finding of notable significance in directed evolution.

AB  - In vitro culture offers approaches to study cellular responses and to obtain cells tolerant to high temperature stress. The objectives of this study were to select wheat cells that tolerate high temperature stress, study cell line stability and cytogenetic characteristics, and compare protein synthesis in selected and control cell lines after exposure to heat stress. Three of 600 colonies plated were recovered after cells had been exposed to 48-degrees-C. Forty-five percent of the cells of the tolerant cell line, M48 survived when they were returned to a normal temperature (22-degrees-C) for 6 mo and rechallenged with a 48-degrees-C treatment. The control cell line exhibited 0.8% survival under this treatment. Chromosomal elimination and genomic rearrangements were observed extensively for the cell lines before and after heat selection. Heat selection did enhance the occurrence of polytene chromosomes and the frequency of extrachromosomal DNA. When cell viability was evaluated in cell suspension cultures, M48 had a higher percentage of viable cells than the control cell line. Analysis of S-35-methionine in vivo labeled proteins showed that the selected M48 cell line maintained the synthesis of most normal proteins under a heat shock of 40-degrees-C for 4 h, with synthesis of several unique low molecular weight heat-shock proteins (HSPs). A quantitative increase in high molecular weight HSPs was also observed in this cell line. This study demonstrated that a heat-tolerant cell line of wheat can be obtained from in vitro selection, and that this phenomenon was associated with the synthesis of specific proteins under heat stress.

AB  - Large dams often alter flow and thermal regimes downstream, resulting in fish spawning delays and larval abundance declines. Accurate prediction of the delayed spawning period under changed thermal regime is critical for selecting a correct timing to modify dam operation and to release the environmental flow needed to enhance fish spawning. We used correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between thermal regime alteration and spawning delay of the four major Chinese carps (FMCC) below the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River, China, using a 13-year ecological data series (1997-2009). Eighteen variables were defined to quantify thermal regime and related to two variables representing spawning timing. Our results demonstrate that the start of FMCC spawning has been delayed from early May to middle June since the Three Gorges Dam initiated operation in 2003. Water temperature declines of 2 degrees C-4 degrees C in March, April and May (a critical period for gonad development) were the principal reason for the observed spawning delay. The variable most associated with spawning timing was the arrival date of the cumulative temperature needed for gonad development from stages IV to V (DDegDayIV-V), which describes the long-term impacts of the timing, magnitude and duration of thermal regime upon gonad development. Only the cumulative temperature for gonad development and the minimum temperature for FMCC spawning (18 degrees C) are both satisfied, the occurrence of suitable flow conditions, that is, flow increase or flash flood, would produce a successful spawning event. Consequently, we suggest that the experimental flow increase process of the Three Gorges Reservoir aimed at enhancing FMCC spawning should initiate after 15 June when the requisite thermal regime can be met.

AB  - Gynogenetic diploid induced by retaining second polar body and that by suppressing first cleavage of eggs of Indonesian common carp Cyprinus carpio were produced by inseminating eggs with ultra-violet ray irradiated sperm of Java carp Puntius gonionotus and giving heat shock treatment to the developing eggs.  The morphometric and meristic characters of 3 month old fish were measured and counted.  There was the prominent trend that the degree of phenotypic variation was larger in the mitotic- and meiotic-gynogenetic diploids than in the control-2N in the almost all morphological characters examined.  These phenomena observed in variation of quantitative characters were explained by the function showing the relationship among phenotypic variance (V(p)), genetic variance (V(g)), environmental variance (V(e)) and coefficient of inbreeding (F) in the first gynogenetic generation.  The genetic implications for gynogenetic diploids were discussed in relation to genetic improvement of fish race in aquaculture.

AB  - It is vital for security experts to learn from the historical records of global climate change as to how the human society has been impacted by its consequences in the "new" Anthropocene Epoch. Some of these consequences of global climate change include the perishing of several human settlements in different parts of the globe at different times, e.g., in 1700 B.C., prolonged drought contributed to the demise of Harappan civilization in northwest India. In 1200 B.C., under a similar climatic extremity, the Mycenaean civilization in present-day Greece (as well as the Mill Creek culture of the northwestern part of the present-day US state of Iowa) perished. Why did some societies under such climatic events perish while others survived? Lack of preparedness of one society and its failure to anticipate and adapt to the extreme climatic events might have attributed to their extinction. The authors will also analyze the extinction of one European Norse society in Greenland during the Little Ice Age (about 600 years ago), as compared to the still-surviving Inuit society in the northern segment of Greenland, which faced even harsher climatic conditions during the Little Ice Age than the extinct Norsemen. This is how the adaptability and "expectation of the worst" matter for the survival of a particular community against climatic "black swan" events (Taleb, 2007). Similar impacts in terms of sea-level rise expected by the year 2100 whereby major human populations of many parts of the world are expected to lose their environmental evolutionary "niche" will be discussed. Rising temperature will not only complicate human health issues, but also will it take its toll on the staple food producing agricultural belts in some latitudinal expanse. It will also worsen the living condition of the populace living in areas where climate is marginal.
   Through the Socio-Economic Systems Model provided by Vadineanu (2001), the authors will next consider the effect of extant policy-making "prisms" responding to climate change (such as the "Club of Rome" versus the "Club for Growth" visions) as concerns the ongoing process of globalization and survival of the nation-state.

AB  - Incubation temperatures profoundly affect many phenotypic traits of squamate reptiles, and mean selected body temperatures of such animals also are plastic in response to environmental factors. Plausibly, then, incubation temperatures might affect hatchling thermoregulation, either via adaptation (i.e., populations that historically experience different nest conditions, also will diverge in hatchling thermoregulatory behaviour) or phenotypic plasticity (incubation temperatures directly modify hatchling behaviours). We tested this hypothesis with a montane scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi), using thermal-imaging methods to quantify temperatures (of both head and body) selected by hatchling lizards. The Young lizards kept their heads cooler than their bodies, but mean selected temperatures did not differ among hatchlings from three populations with differing thermal regimes in natural nests, nor were they affected by thermal conditions during incubation. The conservatism of mean selected temperatures stands in strong contrast to the lability of many other phenotypic traits in response to incubation temperatures in this species.

AB  - Skin pigmentation and coat pigmentation are two of the best-studied examples of traits under natural selection given their quantifiable fitness interactions with the environment (e.g., camouflage) and signalling with other organisms (e.g., warning coloration). Previous morphological studies have found that skin pigmentation variation in the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is associated with variation in precipitation and temperatures across its distribution range following Gloger's rule (lighter pigmentation in temperate environments). To investigate the molecular mechanism associated with skin pigmentation variation, we used RNA-Seq and quantified gene expression of wild opossums from tropical and temperate populations. Using differential expression analysis and a co-expression network approach, we found that expression variation in genes with melanocytic and immune functions is significantly associated with the degree of skin pigmentation variation and may be underlying this phenotypic difference. We also found evidence suggesting that the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway might be regulating the depigmentation observed in temperate populations. Based on our study results, we present several alternative hypotheses that may explain Gloger's rule pattern of skin pigmentation variation in opossum, including changes in pathogen diversity supporting a pathogen-resistant hypothesis, thermal stress associated with temperate environments, and pleiotropic and epistatic interactions between melanocytic and immune genes.

AB  - Acer truncatum Bunge and Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge are small deciduous trees distributed in East Asia and have high ecological and nutrient value due to their strong environmental adaptability and seed oil abundant in nervonic acid and unsaturated fatty acids. However, their natural distribution remains unclear, which will also be affected by the changing climatic conditions. The main purpose of this study was to map and predict the current and future potential suitable habitats of these two species using MaxEnt based on the presence location of species and environmental variables. The results showed that A. truncatum was more suitable for warm and humid climates and was more durable to climate change compared to X. sorbifolium. Under the current environmental conditions, the suitable habitat of A. truncatum was mainly concentrated in Inner Mongolia Plateau, Loess Plateau, Sichuan Basin, Northeast Plain, North China Plain, Korean Peninsula, as well as Japan, with an area of 115.39 x 10(4) km(2). X. sorbifolium was mainly distributed in Inner Mongolia Plateau and Loess Plateau with an area of 146.15 x 10(4) km(2). Under future climate scenarios, the model predicted that higher concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions could result in greater expansion of the potential distribution of both species. Meanwhile, the study also revealed that the two species migrated to the north by east to varying degrees with the change in suitable habitats. This work could provide scientific basis for resource protection and utilization of the two economic forest trees.

AB  - Nitrogen contamination is regarded as a major threat to terrestrial net productivity and environmental sustainability. Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is a cost-effective and promising technology in wastewater treatment. In this study, the effects of pH/temperature and their short-term shocks on a hybrid system of anammox coupled with iron-carbon micro-electrolysis (IC-ME) were investigated. Results indicated that the hybrid system significantly enhanced the total nitrogen (TN) removal and expanded the stable pH operating range (TN removal efficiencies over 50%) from pH 6.5-8 to pH 5.5-8.5. Free nitrous acid (FNA) in acid environment, when its concentration was higher than 396.36 +/- 5.51 mu g/L, was thought to be one critical degradation inhibitor. After suffering a short-term (one day) pH shock, the hybrid system exhibited the improved performance of both stability and nitrogen removal, mainly because Fe corrosion maintained the pH value by IC-ME. More diverse nitrogen removal processes promoted by IC-ME enhanced the TN removal of hybrid after high temperature shocks. However, the susceptibility and inferior adaptability of anammox bacteria were considered to inhibit the nitrogen removal performance of the hybrid and individual anammox system. Microbial analysis identified Candidatus Kuenenia as the major anammox genus, accounting for 3.61% of the microbial community biomass, and the genus of SM1A02 might be one novel potential strain that help the anammox process.

AB  - The observation of two-state unfolding for many small single-domain proteins by denaturants has led to speculation that protein sequences may have evolved to limit the population of partially folded states that could be detrimental to fitness. How such strong cooperativity arises from a multitude of individual interactions is not well understood. Here, we investigate the stability and folding cooperativity of the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 in the pressure-temperature plane using site-specific NMR. In contrast to apparent cooperative unfolding detected with denaturant-induced and thermal-induced unfolding experiments and stopped-flow refolding studies at ambient pressure, NMR-detected pressure unfolding revealed significant deviation from two-state behavior, with a core region that was selectively destabilized by increasing temperature. Comparison of pressure-dependent NMR signals from both the folded and unfolded states revealed the population of at least one invisible excited state at atmospheric pressure. The core destabilizing cavity-creating 198A mutation apparently increased the cooperativity of the loss of folded-state peak intensity while also increasing the population of this invisible excited state present at atmospheric pressure. These observations highlight how local stability is subtly modulated by sequence to tune protein conformational landscapes and illustrate the ability of pressure- and temperature-dependent studies to reveal otherwise hidden states.

AB  - A randomized complete block experiment was performed to measure the effect of prescribed, dormant-season bums of three different levels of severity (measured as fuel consumption and soil surface heating) on subsequent insect infestation and mortality of mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.). Multiple-funnel traps baited with a low release rate of turpentine and ethanol were used to monitor activity of certain coniferophagous beetles. Non-aggressive species, including the root beetles Hylastes salebrosus Eichhoff and H. tenuis Eichhoff, the ambrosia beetle Xyleborus pubescens Zimmermann, the reproduction weevil Pachylobius picivorus (Germar), and buprestid borers, were attracted to burned plots in numbers that correlated positively with burn severity. Beetle attraction to burned sites was greatest in the first weeks post-burn and disappeared by the second year. Two potential tree-killing bark beetles, Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier) and Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff), were trapped in significant numbers but exhibited no attraction to burned plots. Tree mortality correlated significantly with the severity of the burns and amounted to 5% of stems in the hottest burn treatment after 3 years. The majority of the mortality was observed in the second and third years post-burn. Attacks of Ips and Dendroctonus bark beetles were apparent on nearly all dead or dying trees, and evidence suggested that root pathogens may have contributed to tree susceptibility to beetle attack and mortality. Our data indicate that selection of burn regimes that reduce or eliminate consumption of duff (e.g., favoring heading fires over backing fires) could significantly reduce mortality of longleaf pine managed for long rotations.

AB  - As a characteristic sessile inhabitant of the intertidal zone, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas occupies one of the most physically stressful environments on earth. With high exposure to terrestrial conditions, oysters must tolerate broad fluctuations in temperature range. However, oysters' cellular and molecular responses to temperature stresses have not been fully characterized. Here, we analyzed oyster transcriptome data under high and low temperatures. We also identified over 30 key temperature stress-responsive candidate genes, which encoded stress proteins such as heat shock proteins and apoptosis-associated proteins. The expression characterization of these genes under short-term cold and hot environments (5 and 35 A degrees C) and long-term cold environments (5 A degrees C) was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Most of these genes reached expression peaks during the recovery stage after 24 h of heat stress, and these genes were greatly induced around day 3 in long-term cold stress while responded little to short-term cold stress. In addition, in the second heat stress after 2 days of recovery, oysters showed milder expression in these genes and a lower mortality rate, which indicated the existence of plasticity in the oyster's response to heat stress. We confirmed that homeostatic flexibility and anti-apoptosis might be crucial centers of temperature stress responses in oysters. Furthermore, we analyzed stress gene families in 11 different species and found that the linage-specific expansion of stress genes might be implicated in adaptive evolution. These results indicated that both plasticity and evolution played an important role in the stress response adaptation of oysters.

AB  - The present study extends evidence that Drosophila heat-shock genes are distinctively evolvable because of insertion of transposable elements by examining the genotypic diversity and phenotypic consequences of naturally occurring P element insertions in the proximal promoter regions of two small heat-shock genes. Detailed scrutiny of two populations revealed 16 distinctive P transposable elements collectively segregating in proximal promoters of two small heat-shock genes, Hsp26 and Hsp27. These elements vary in size, orientation and insertion site. Frequencies of P element-containing alleles varied from 5% to 100% in these populations. Two Hsp26 elements chosen for detailed study, R(s)P(26) and D(2)P(m), reduced or abolished Hsp26 expression respectively. The R(s)P(26) element increased or did not affect inducible tolerance of high temperature, increased fecundity, but decreased developmental rate. On the other hand, the D(2)P(m) element decreased thermotolerance and fecundity. In lines subjected to experimental evolution, the allelic frequency of the R(s)P(26)P element varied considerably, and was at lower frequencies in lines selected for increased longevity and for accelerated development than in controls. Transposable element insertions into small Hsp genes in Drosophila populations can have dramatic fitness consequences, and therefore create variation on which selection can act.

AB  - Common objectives of high-performance research reactors include neutron scattering, materials irradiation, and isotope production. The design of a core that optimizes these multiple objectives often presents a multidimensional (i.e., in design space), multiobjective optimization problem. The developed systematic approach discussed herein draws on response surface methodology to validate and leverage a surrogate model to serve in place of high-fidelity computational analyses. Optimization and design analysis methods leverage this surrogate model to provide a flexible tool for generating optimized designs and understanding the impact of design decisions on desired metrics. In applications to High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) low-enriched uranium (LEU) core designs, neutronic, isotopic evolution, and thermal hydraulic analyses are used to generate key performance and safety metrics for assessing the feasibility and fitness of given designs. Three optimized designs that consider different desired metrics and constraints (e.g., key metric weighting and fabrication constraints) are presented, providing potential design options that satisfy the requirements for HFIR's conversion from high enriched uranium to LEU fuel.

AB  - Centaurs are believed to be Kuiper Belt objects in transition between Jupiter and Neptune before possibly becoming Jupiter family comets. Some indirect observational evidence is consistent with the presence of amorphous water ice in Centaurs. Some of them also display a cometary activity, probably triggered by the crystallization of the amorphous water ice, as suggested by Jewitt and this work. Indeed, we investigate the survival of amorphous water ice against crystallization, using a fully three-dimensional thermal evolution model. Simulations are performed for varying heliocentric distances and obliquities. They suggest that crystallization can be triggered as far as 16 AU, though amorphous ice can survive beyond 10 AU. The phase transition is an efficient source of outgassing up to 10-12 AU, which is broadly consistent with the observations of the active Centaurs. The most extreme case is 167P/CINEOS, which barely crystallizes in our simulations. However, amorphous ice can be preserved inside Centaurs in many heliocentric distance-obliquity combinations, below a similar to 5-10 m crystallized crust. We also find that outgassing due to crystallization cannot be sustained for a time longer than 10(4)-10(4) years, leading to the hypothesis that active Centaurs might have recently suffered from orbital changes. This could be supported by both observations (although limited) and dynamical studies.

AB  - Carbon sequestration in soil organic matter is increasingly advocated as a possible win-win strategy in the rehabilitation of degrading dryland agro-ecosystems because it simultaneously contributes to the reduction of global atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations while enhancing local land productivity. A study was conducted in Senegal's Old Peanut Basin to assess current carbon stocks and to examine management options for their increase. Average soil and woody biomass carbon contents were 11.3 and 6.3 t carbon (C) ha(-1), respectively. CENTURY, a biogeochemical model, was used to simulate soil and biomass carbon over a period of 25 and 50 years under a series of land use and management options. These simulated practices resulted in C dynamics ranging from -0.13 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) from a worst-case millet-sorghum rotation to +0.43 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) on intensively managed agricultural fields. Agroforestry simulations involving Faidherbia albida (Del.) Chev. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) deWit. also resulted in promising carbon gain (+0.22 and +0.12 t C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively), suggesting that improving agricultural practices is key to enhancing food production and mitigating climate change. Results from a sensitivity analysis suggest that woody biomass carbon is more sensitive to long-term changes in precipitation and temperature than soil carbon. Other management strategies likely to result in lower rates of soil carbon sequestration, including short-term improved fallows, should also be considered viable opportunities because promoting too narrow a set of 'best management practices' risks weakening local adaptability and opportunistic management regimes, both of which are crucial elements in small-scale farming systems in drylands.

AB  - Increasingly arisen environmental constraints may contribute to heritable phenotypic variation including methylation changes, which can help the animals with development, growth and survival. In this study, we assessed the DNA methylation levels in three tissues (gonad, kidney and gill) of half smooth tongue sole under the salinity stress. The methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique was applied to illustrate the regulation of epigenetic mechanism in environmental stimuli. Fish were subjected to 15 salinity treatment for 7 and 60 days, respectively. A total of 11259 fragments were amplified with 8 pairs of selective primers. The levels of methylated DNA in different tissues of females and males without salinity stress were analyzed, which were 32.76% and 47.32% in gonad; 38.13% and 37.69% in kidney; 37.58% and 34.96% in gill, respectively. In addition, the significant difference was observed in gonad between females and males, indicating that discrepant regulation in gonadal development and differentiation may involve sex-related genes. Further analysis showed that total and hemi-methylation were significantly decreased under 15 salinity for 7 days, probably resulting in up-regulating salt-tolerance genes expression to adjust salt changing. With the adjustment for 60 days, total and hemi-methylation prominently went back to its normal levels to obtain equilibrium. Particularly, full methylation levels were steady along with salinity stress to maintain the stability of gene expression. Additionally, the data showed that gonads in females and gills in males were superior in adaptability. As a result, DNA methylation regulates tissue- specific epiloci, and may respond to salinity stress by regulating gene expression to maintain animal survival and activity.

AB  - Here we aimed to explore some vital phenotypes and potential genes involved in probiotic functions and adaptive responses of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DMDL 9010 (LP9010), isolated from Chinese traditional naturally fermented paocai. We found that LP9010 showed good tolerance to simulated human gastrointestinal tract, self-coagulation and cholesterol-reducing abilities, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Comparative genomic analysis of six L. plantarum strains showed that LP9010 contained 392 unique genes. LP9010 genome possessed 281 genes related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism, including 138 sugar transporters and 60 phosphotransferase system enzymes. LP9010 contained high number (98) of carbohydrate-active enzymes especially glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. Extensive stress-related proteins may help the survival of LP9010 under gastrointestinal environment including temperature, pH, bile, osmotic and oxidative stresses. Many surface or extracellular proteins identified in LP9010 can attribute to adhesion to various extracellular matrices or external environment. The plantaricin gene cluster of LP9010 showed high identity with that of the reference strain WCFS1. Three exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters, two in the chromosome and one in Plasmid 2 were present in LP9010, and only one cluster was highly homologous to WCFS1. This study provided new insights into the probiotic properties and interaction with gastrointestinal environment of LP9010.

AB  - To promote the economic feasibility of Nannochloropsis oculata, efficacy of using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to increase microalgal growth and lipid accumulation was investigated. We first examined the effects of PEG concentrations on microalgal growth using 0-5 % (w/v) PEG-6000, and followed by exploring the effects of PEG molecular weights (400, 600, 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 20,000) on microalgal growth, size, as well as on yields of biomass, total lipids, and eicosapentaenoic acid. In addition, the capacity of PEG to reduce the effect of oxygen inhibition on microalgal growth was also investigated to evaluate its adaptability for use in large-scale and closed setting. Our results showed that PEG-induced osmotic stress (I ) in the range of 2.465-2.472 MPa can raise microalgal growth. The PEG with higher molecular weight exhibited greater efficacy of growth promotion but less lipid content under equal concentration. In this study, 0.5 % (w/v) PEG-20000 (I = 2.466 MPa) remarkably enhanced microalgal growth without interference of intracellular lipid productivity and cellular size, yielding > 50 % (w/w) increases in biomass, total lipid, and eicosapentaenoic acid amounts after 7 days that provided the optimal condition for microalgal cultivation. These positive effects possibly resulted from the moderate enhancement of osmotic stress in the medium and stronger chaotrope-like behavior from higher molecular weight PEG. With further verification that 0.5 % (w/v) PEG-20000 enabled to reduce the effect of oxygen inhibition on microalgal growth, the PEG-20000-mediated cultivation offers a feasible means for mass culture of N. oculata in closed setting.

AB  - As scientists seek to better understand the linkages between energy, water, and land systems, they confront a critical question of scale for their analysis. Many studies exploring this nexus restrict themselves to a small area in order to capture fine-scale processes, whereas other studies focus on interactions between energy, water, and land over broader domains but apply coarse resolution methods. Detailed studies of a narrow domain can be misleading if the policy intervention considered is broad-based and has impacts on energy, land, and agricultural markets. Regional studies with aggregate low-resolution representations may miss critical feedbacks driven by the dynamic interactions between subsystems. This study applies a novel, gridded energy-land-water modeling system to analyze the local environmental impacts of biomass cofiring of coal power plants across the upper MISO region. We use this framework to examine the impacts of a hypothetical biomass cofiring technology mandate of coal-fired power plants using corn residues. We find that this scenario has a significant impact on land allocation, fertilizer applications, and nitrogen leaching. The effects also impact regions not involved in cofiring through agricultural markets. Further, some MISO coal-fired plants would cease generation because the competition for biomass increases the cost of this feedstock and because the higher operating costs of cofiring renders them uncompetitive with other generation sources. These factors are not captured by analyses undertaken at the level of an individual power plant. We also show that a region-wide analysis of this cofiring mandate would have registered only a modest increase in nitrate leaching (just +5% across the upper MISO region). Such aggregate analyses would have obscured the extremely large increases in leaching at particular locations, as much as +60%. Many of these locations are already pollution hotspots. Fine-scale analysis, nested within a broader framework, is necessary to capture these critical environmental interactions within the energy, land, and water nexus.

AB  - Bioactive components of fruit and vegetables play an important role in scavenging free radicals and protect the body from degenerative diseases. A kinetic study was conducted to quantify the losses occurring in bioactive components, antioxidant activity and changes in colour and firmness of four commonly used vegetables (beetroot, green pea, eggplant and green pepper) during heat treatment (70-90 degrees C). The study revealed that logistic model can predict the variation in bioactive components and antioxidant activity with higher R-2 and lower root mean square error (RMSE) as compared to first order model due to logarithmic reduction in these properties in the beginning of the process itself. However zero and first order kinetic models were found suitable to predict the changes occurring in colour and firmness respectively during blanching. D, z value, activation energy (E-a), activation enthalpy and entropy were calculated for all measured parameters for selected vegetables in the temperature range of 70-90 degrees C. These finding would be useful in designing thermal processes and related calculations for these vegetables.

AB  - Climate change challenges marine species with seawater that is warmer, with less oxygen and lower pH, To date, most climate-change studies have focused on organisms' acclimation or shifts in distribution; relatively little is known about the capacity of marine species to respond through evolution. We propose that important insights can he gained from recent studies of fishery-induced evolution (FIE), which show that increased adult mortality from fishing leads to rapid changes in growth and reproduction schedules, These changes consistently involve evolution of "faster" life histories: earlier maturation at smaller sizes and shorter life spans. In the ocean, coupled effects of higher temperatures and reduced oxygen also differentially affect larger or older individuals, so expected evolutionary consequences of climate change are qualitatively similar to those of HE. This general pattern will apply to large numbers of marine species and has important implications for conservation and management.

AB  - Recently, the commercialization of hybrid machine tools that combine directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM) technology and subtractive manufacturing (SM) has rapidly progressed. This technology trend has been developed to meet the market demand for processing quality (precision) and productivity, and to produce products such as lightweight parts, and complex and special functional parts, as well as to facilitate mold production and part repair. Compared to SM technology, metal AM technology has limitations in terms of surface quality and shape accuracy. Therefore, post-processing is necessary for the AM output. Laser-assisted machining (LAM) is an innovative hybrid technique in which surface quality and productivity can be improved by enhancing the machinability of difficult-to-cut materials. LAM studies have mainly been performed on titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and ceramic materials. However, except for ceramics, no high-strength material studies have been conducted to analyze the LAM process machining characteristics of workpieces fabricated by AM process. Therefore, in this study, LAM is applied to post-processing of output fabricated by AM of Ti-6Al-4V. DED device was developed using metal powder feeder and a laser. The Ti-6Al-4V workpieces were successfully fabricated through many tests. The cutting depth for LAM was selected through thermal analysis for LAM of the fabricated workpiece. Compared to the case of traditional machining without preheating, machining characteristics in LAM experiments were analyzed and property testing was performed.

AB  - We have analysed the Wufeng-Longmaxi shale gas field (gas pool) in the Southeastern Sichuan Basin in the light of previous studies on the main constraints of shale gas field enrichment in North America. We have demonstrated that, unlike the relatively simple tectonic evolutionary history of its North American counterparts, South China, represented by the Sichuan Basin and its peripheral areas, has undergone multiple uplifting events and intense folding and thrusting processes. After the distribution of high-quality shale formations has been identified, the structural and preservation conditions are important determinants of the level of shale gas enrichment and productivity. For a complex structural area that has experienced high thermal evolution to become enriched in shale gas and highly productive, the following prerequisites are indispensable: (1) normal structures, i.e. uplifts and anticlines, the latter being the most favourable structural type for shale gas enrichment; (2) hyperpressure, which is not only an important identifier of the presence of a regionally closed environment, but also, an important signature of natural gas pool enrichment; (3) late regional strike-slipping processes and good roof and floor conditions-the existence of structural conditions for forming and maintaining a compressional-shearing environment and a roof and floor that provide good closure are critical indicators of shale gas enrichment in complex structural areas; (4) distance to any regional aqueous layers and avoidance of faults channelling these aqueous layers.

AB  - This series of papers comprises a systematic exploration of the hypothesis that the far-ultraviolet radiation from star clusters and elliptical galaxies originates from extremely hot horizontal-branch (HB) stars and their post-HB progeny. This first paper presents an extensive grid of calculations of stellar models from the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) through to a point late in post-HB evolution or a point on the white dwarf cooling track. The grid will be used to produce synthesized UV fluxes for the interpretation of existing and future short-wavelength (900-3000 angstrom) observations. Our sequences have been computed for a range of masses which concentrates on models that begin their HB evolution very close to the hot end of the ZAHB. We have calculated tracks for three metal-poor compositions ([Fe/H] = -2.26, -1.48, -0.47 with [O/Fe] > 0), for use with globular cluster observations. We have also chosen three metal rich compositions (Z = 0.017 = Z., Z = 0.04, 0.06) for use in the study of elliptical galaxy populations. For each of the two super-metal-rich compositions, for which the helium abundance is unconstrained by observation, we have computed two sets of sequences: one assuming no additional helium, and a second with a large enhancement (Y(HB) = 0.29 and 0.36 for Z = 0.04), and (Y(HB) = 0.29 and 0.46 for Z = 0.06). For each set of sequences, our lowest ZAHB envelope masses (M(env)0 are in the range 0.002 < M(env)0 < 0.006 M..
   We use the term extreme horizontal branch (EHB) to refer to HB sequences of constant mass that do not reach the thermally pulsing stage on the AGB. These models evolve after core helium exhaustion into postearly asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which leave the AGB before thermal pulsing, and AGB-manque stars, which never reach the AGB. We describe various features of the evolution of post-HB stars, discussing the correspondence between slow phases of evolution at high temperature and the early-AGB evolution. We note that the relationship between core mass and luminosity for stars on the upper AGB is not straightforward, because stars arrive on the ZAHB with a range of masses and subsequently burn different amounts of fuel. We determine from our models an upper bound to the masses of EHB stars, finding that it varies little for [Fe/H] < 0, but that it is sensitive to the helium abundance. We show that for each composition there is a range of M(env)0 (at least a few hundredths M.) in which the models have a slow phase of evolution at high temperature. The duration of this phase is found to increase with the metallicity, but its luminosity is lower, so that total UV energy output is not significantly different from metal-poor sequences. The properties of very metal rich stars are, however, made uncertain by our lack of knowledge of the helium abundance for [Fe/H] > 0; the range of stellar masses in which high temperatures are attained for significant periods of time increases with Y. There is no intrinsic composition dependence of the peak UV output from evolved stars; the output from a stellar population depends most directly on the mass distribution of stars arriving on the ZAHB. This is determined mainly by the mass loss that occurs on the red giant branch.

AB  - For the purpose of developing biodegradable magnesium alloys with suitable properties for biomedical applications, Mg-Zn-Ca-Ag metallic glasses (MGs) were synthesized by copper-mold casting and melt spinning. The effects of Ag addition on the glass formation, thermal stability, microhardness, hydrogen evolution, corrosion resistance, and cytocompatibility of the Mg-based glassy alloys were studied in vitro. The corrosion resistance and the capability of suppressing the hydrogen evolution are enhanced for the Ag-containing alloys, in comparison to the Mg-Zn-Ca MG, though the incorporation of Ag decreases the glass-forming ability but influences insignificantly on microhardness. The higher cellular viability of the Ag-containing alloys than that of the Ag-free alloy was also revealed by direct cell-culture experiments. Thus, Mg-Zn-Ca-Ag MGs possess the potential to be employed as biodegradable materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Glucose degradation products (GDP) are an important factor that contribute to bioincompatibility of peritoneal dialysis fluids. These substances are generated in the dialysis fluid during heat sterilization. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the content or toxicity, or both, of GDP present in the dialysis fluid. We examined whether L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTZ), a precursor for glutathione synthesis, reduces the cytotoxicity of GDP in human peritoneal mesothelial cells.
   Methods. Experiments were performed on primary mesothelial cell cultures. Free radical generation in these cells after exposure to acetaldehyde (ACT), glyoxal (GLYO) or methylglyoxal (M-GLYO) was detected with a fluorescent probe. Cell viability measurements were based on release of LDH from cell cytosol, and synthesis of IL-6 and proliferation after exposure to GDP. Effects of individual GDPs and of dialysis fluid free of GDP (GDP-free PDF) or containing GDP (GDP-high PDF) on cell viability were also studied in the presence of OTZ (1 mmol/l).
   Results. All of the GDPs as well as the autoclaved dialysis fluid caused increased free radical generation. ACT increased LDH release from the cells by 374% (P<0.001), and this effect was abolished by OTZ. All of the GDPs inhibited cell growth (ACT, 47%, P<0.01; GLYO, 52%, P<0.01; M-GLYO, 26%, P<0.05) and this effect was reversed in presence of OTZ. ACT inhibited I1-6 synthesis in mesothelial cells by 74% P<0.01 and this effect was prevented by OTZ. GDP-high PDF but not GDP-free PDF reduced synthesis of IL-6 in mesothelial cells by 40% (P<0.01) an effect that was reversed by OTZ. Mesothelial cell growth was more strongly inhibited by GDP-high PDF (76%, P<0.01) than by GDP-free PDF (31%, P<0.05). OTZ improved growth of mesothelial cells in the presence of GDP-high PDF (+150%, P<0.01) and in presence of GDP-low PDF (+38%, P<0.05). OTZ prevented the cytotoxic effect of GDP-high PDF on mesothelial cells.
   Conclusions. The GDP-induced stimulation of free radicals in mesothelial cells in the present study may provide a possible mechanism of GDP cytotoxicity. Because OTZ reduced the toxic effects of GDP on mesothelial cells, this compound may improve biocompatibility of peritoneal dialysis fluids.

AB  - Harsh weather conditions often require heating during winters and cooling in summers. In many developing countries, power outages caused by energy shortages cause discomfort for the residents. Thus, more sustainable systems for air conditioning are desirable in these countries. The present study proposes an examination of the viability of Earth-to-Air Heat Ex-changers (EAHE) in severe environments (extreme summer and winter seasons) and comprises numerical modeling using COMSOL Multiphysics.
   In most existing studies, EAHE systems are examined and validated for particular field conditions. Despite the valuable information from these studies, it is vital to perform investigations within a regional context, considering specific environmental conditions at the regional scale. The current research addresses the performance of Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers in a severe climate typical of the region of Islamabad. To this end, thermal properties are selected according to soil profiles specific of this region. The annual mean earth temperature is carefully chosen from RETScreen daily records in the same region.
   Models are tested against analytic solutions in a 2-D context and validated using large-scale field tests. The complete numerical model integrates heat transfer in the ground where em-bedded piping is subject to air circulation. Heat transfer occurs between the piping system and the surrounding soil, which results in heating or cooling of the circulating air mass, depending on the seasonal conditions.
   The results obtained in field conditions validated by actual experiments show interesting predictions of air temperatures at the outlet even in a severe climate. This depicts that ground temperatures preserved from climatic conditions can benefit EAHE systems even in severe climate conditions.

AB  - The ecological and genetic factors determining the extent of introgression between species in secondary contact zones remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the relative importance of isolating barriers and the demographic expansion of invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis on the magnitude and the direction of introgression with the native Mytilus trossulus in a hybrid zone in central California. We use double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to genotype 1337 randomly selected single nucleotide polymorphisms and accurately distinguish early and advanced generation hybrids for the first time in the central California Mytilus spp. hybrid zone. Weak levels of introgression were observed in both directions but were slightly more prevalent from the native M. trossulus into the invasive M. galloprovincialis. Few early and advanced backcrossed individuals were observed across the hybrid zone confirming the presence of strong barriers to interbreeding. Heterogeneous patterns of admixture across the zone of contact were consistent with the colonization history of M. galloprovincialis with more extensive introgression in northern localities furthest away from the putative site of introduction in southern California. These observations reinforce the importance of dynamic spatial and demographic expansions in determining patterns of introgression between close congeners, even in those with high dispersal potential and well-developed reproductive barriers. Our results suggest that the threat posed by invasive M. galloprovincialis is more ecological than genetic as it has displaced, and continues to displace the native M. trossulus from much of central and southern California.

AB  - The Avila batholith of central Spain is composed of upper Carboniferous peraluminous granitoids that were preceded by volumetrically insignificant bodies of mafic-ultramafic hybrid magmas and postdated by several dike swarms of camptonitic lamprophyres. Rb-Sr dating indicates continuous magmatic activity from similar to 350 Ma to similar to 280 Ma, starting with the mafic precursors and a few midcrustal anatectic leucogranites, followed by massive autochthonous and allochthonous granodiorites and granites, and ending with the camptonitic lamprophyres. Early hybrid mafic magmas (epsilon(340Ma) Sr similar to 25; epsilon(340Ma) Nd similar to -1.5) were produced in small batches during or immediately after the main deformation phase, probably by the partial melting of a mixture of similar to 8 :2 mantle and biotite-bearing crustal rocks at the crust-mantle interface. These magmas were emplaced in the middle crust at similar to 340 Ma, advecting a negligible amount of heat. The generation of crustal granites during the main deformation phase was very scarce and limited to highly fertile protoliths, rich in heat-producing elements, affected by strong shear zones. The generation of crustal granitoids on a batholithic scale took place from similar to 330 Ma to similar to 290 Ma, during the main extensional period. Granites (epsilon(310Ma) Sr similar to 45-150; epsilon(310Ma) Nd similar to-2.1 to -9) were produced by the partial melting of fertile crustal rocks (epsilon(310Ma) Sr similar to 48-218; epsilon(310Ma) Nd similar to 2.2 to -9), characterized by high heat production (similar to 2.5-3 mu W m(-3)). The zone of partial melting, similar to 15-22 km in depth, was heated by thermal conduction from below after crustal thinning, but the contribution of radiogenic heat and the fertility of source rocks would have been essential for anatexis. The fast thinning of the crust from similar to 310 Ma to similar to 285 Ma released lithostatic pressure in the upper mantle and caused decompressional melting of the metasome layer at similar to 60-85 km in depth, producing camptonitic melts dated at similar to 283 Ma. The existence of a fertile metasome layer implies that the lithospheric mantle beneath central Iberia was not actively involved in subduction during the Variscan orogeny.

AB  - Successful formation of electronic interfaces between living cells and semiconductors hinges on being able to obtain an extremely close and high surface-area contact, which preserves both cell viability and semiconductor performance. To accomplish this, we introduce organic semiconductor assemblies consisting of a hierarchical arrangement of nanocrystals. These are synthesised via a colloidal chemical route that transforms the nontoxic commercial pigment quinacridone into various biomimetic three-dimensional arrangements of nanocrystals. Through a tuning of parameters such as precursor concentration, ligands and additives, we obtain complex size and shape control at room temperature. We elaborate hedgehog-shaped crystals comprising nanoscale needles or daggers that form intimate interfaces with the cell membrane, minimising the cleft with single cells without apparent detriment to viability. Excitation of such interfaces with light leads to effective cellular photostimulation. We find reversible light-induced conductance changes in ion-selective or temperature-gated channels.

AB  - We investigated Brucella melitensis methionyl-tRNA-synthetase (BmMetRS) with molecular, structural and phenotypic methods to learn if BmMetRS is a promising target for brucellosis drug development. Recombinant BmMetRS was expressed, purified from wild type Brucella melitensis biovar Abortus 2308 strain ATCC/CRP #DD-156 and screened by a thermal melt assay against a focused library of one hundred previously classified methionyl-tRNA-synthetase inhibitors of the blood stage form of Trypanosoma brucei. Three compounds showed appreciable shift of denaturation temperature and were selected for further studies on inhibition of the recombinant enzyme activity and cell viability against wild type B. melitensis strain 16M. BmMetRS protein complexed with these three inhibitors resolved into three-dimensional crystal structures and was analyzed. All three selected methionyl-tRNA-synthetase compounds inhibit recombinant BmMetRS enzymatic functions in an aminoacylation assay at varying concentrations. Furthermore, growth inhibition of B. melitensis strain 16M by the compounds was shown. Inhibitor-BmMetRS crystal structure models were used to illustrate the molecular basis of the enzyme inhibition. Our current data suggests that BmMetRS is a promising target for brucellosis drug development. However, further studies are needed to optimize lead compound potency, efficacy and safety as well as determine the pharmacokinetics, optimal dosage, and duration for effective treatment.

AB  - In this paper we structure, obtain and analyze results of an expert elicitation on the relationship between U. S. government Research & Development funding and the likelihood of achieving advances in cellulosic biofuel technologies. While there was disagreement among the experts on each of the technologies, the patterns of disagreement suggest several distinct strategies. Selective Thermal Processing appears to be the most promising path, with the main question being how much funding is required to achieve success. Thus, a staged investment in this path looks promising. With respect to gasification, there remains fundamental disagreement over whether success is possible even at higher funding levels. Thus, basic research into the viability of the path makes sense. The Hydrolysis path induced the widest range of responses from the experts, indicating there may be value in collecting more information on this technology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The primary aim of this work is to study the response of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of landscapes in the lower Tigris basin to current global and regional climate variability presented, respectively, by the global circulation indices and monthly temperatures and precipitation extracted from five observational/reanalysis datasets. The second task is to find the dataset that best reflects the regional vegetation and climate conditions. Comparison of the Koppen-Trewartha bioclimatic landscapes with the positions of botanical districts, land-cover types, and streamflow estimates led to the conclusion that only two datasets correctly describe regional climatic zones. Therefore, searching for the NDVI response to regional climate variability requires the use of normalized analogs of temperatures and precipitations, as well as the Spearman rank correlation. We found that March/April NDVI, as proxies of the maximum biological productivity of the regional landscapes, are strongly correlated with October-March precipitation derived from three datasets and January-March temperatures derived from one dataset. We discovered the significant impact of autumn-winter El Nino-Southern Oscillation and winter Indian Oceanic dipole states on regional weather (e.g., all five recent severe droughts occurred during strong La Nina events). However, the strength of this impact on the vegetation was clearly linked to the zonal landscape type. By selecting pairs of the temperature/precipitation time series that best correlated with NDVI at a given landscape, we have built a synthetic climate dataset. The landscape approach presented in this work can be used to validate the viability of any dataset when assessing the impacts of climate change and variability on weather-dependent components of Earth's surface.Y

AB  - Semi-aquatic north-temperate reptiles experience challenging environmental conditions for thermoregulation on both seasonal and daily bases. We studied the thermal biology of north-temperate Northern Water Snakes (Nerodia sipedon) in central Michigan by remote radiotelemetry monitoring of snake body temperature (T-b) using surgically implanted thermally-sensitive radio-transmitters and by measuring operative temperatures (T-e) across a range of microhabitats using biophysical models. Our goals included evaluation of thermoregulatory capabilities at a locality that we viewed to be a fine-grained thermal environment, seasonal variations in patterns of thermoregulation, and the effects of sex on thermoregulation. During summer, snakes showed diel T-b cycling apparently using the open Sphagnum mat for late morning warming and shuttling among different microhabitats until early evening when a monotonic decline in T-b ensued and continued through the early morning hours. Snakes attained T-b within their laboratory-determined preferred body temperature range (T-set = 28-33 degrees C) mostly during late afternoon and with average percentages of T-b values for individual snakes within T-set range when permitted by operative temperatures (E-x) between 68 and 70% of the time depending on method of measurement. Relatively high investment in thermoregulation when thermal conditions were poor occurred only during September but declined thereafter as snakes prepared to overwinter. We did not detect differences in thermoregulation among reproductive females, non-reproductive females, and males. Relative to a population of N. sipedon at a higher latitude in Ontario our snakes showed a relatively high T-set range and thermoregulated more effectively, particularly during the daylight hours. It remains unclear how much inter-population variation in thermoregulation is due to potential adaptations to latitude, to habitat differences, or variations in methodologies.

AB  - Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is an important Queensland commercial fishery that exhibits dramatic inter-annual fluctuations in catch which, according to fishers, are explained in part by variations in the climate. Traditionally, modelling of fisheries harvest has focussed on the development of surplus production/yield models which use catch and effort data, and more complex age-structured models. More recently, however, the effect of climate variability has been shown to have a significant impact on the catch of fisheries such as anchovies, and so techniques to incorporate climate parameters into fisheries modelling and management are being developed. This paper explores, through correlation and cross validated regression modelling techniques, the possible impact of climate variability on the commercial barramundi fishery harvest in Princess Charlotte Bay (PCB) far north Queensland which varies on a year-to-year basis. Results suggest a strong relationship between tested climate variables two years prior and annual barramundi landings.
   A conceptual model explaining the life history of the barramundi was constructed to reduce the number of variables used in the analysis. Selected climate variables (air temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), evaporation, fresh water flows), and climate forecasting indices (Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO)), were initially correlated against local commercial catch data for PCB. Forward stepwise ridge regression (FSRR) analysis was then used in constructing models to quantify the effects of climate on barramundi.
   Zero-lagged correlations support the well established theory that early wet season fresh water flow affects the catchability of barramundi in PCB. This is because fish in the fresh water reaches are flushed into the estuary (and fishing grounds) in these years.
   Next, a FSRR model was developed from climate variables and selected: rainfall July - September(-2) (lagged two years), annual evaporation(-2) and October - December SOI (no lag) and explained 67.6% of the variance in catch adjusted for effort. A second model using climate forecasting indices explained only 53.1% of the variance in catch adjusted for effort. However, because each of these models required data collected in the year of fishing, they did not allow sufficient time for a response from fisheries managers or operators.
   A third FSRR model using climate variables known to impact on spawning and early juvenile development 2-3 years earlier, included rain July - September(-2), evaporation annual(-2) and average January - March SST-2 and explained 62.7% of the variance in catch. When the predictive capacity of the model was tested using a cross validated "leave-one-out" regression analysis, 48.1% of the variance in future catch was explained (Figure 1).

CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Acclimatization and Establishment of Micropropagated Plants
AB  - A series of hybrid hazelnuts developed by Phillip Rutter, Badgersett Research Farms, Canton, MN, have gained interest as potential alternative crops for farmers in mid-western USA. These hybrids were derived from crossing the commercially important Corylus avellana with North American species (C. cornuta and C. americana), possess tolerance to the harsh winter temperatures of the region and are relatively disease resistant, but they are difficult to propagate by conventional methods. Successful micropropagation has been achieved in our laboratory for selected genotypes by employing a medium based in part on the composition of the hazelnut kernel (Nas and Read, 2004). Acclimatization and subsequent establishment in the field proved to initially be an obstacle, but direct rooting of the microcuttings in rehydrated compressed peat pellets under conditions of high humidity and moderate light and temperature led to successful production of potted plants of one-half to one meter in height. Use of direct rooting in special plastic containers, together with a regimen of dilute nutrient sprays has facilitated more efficient and rapid multiplication, resulting in improved potential for scaled-up acclimatization and field establishment of the micropropagated hazelnut hybrids. Field plantings have been made in several locations and are being evaluated for trueness to type, winter survival, disease tolerance, growth characteristics and productivity.

AB  - Thermal unfolding of proteins is used extensively in screening of drug candidates because molecular interactions with ligands and substrates affect strongly protein stability, transition temperature, and cooperativity. We use synchrotron radiation circular dichroism to monitor the thermal evolution of secondary structure in proteins as they approach the melting point and the impact of substrate on their thermal behavior. Using Landau free energy expansion, we quantify transition strength and proximity to a critical point through the relative separation tau(+) between the transition temperature T-m and the spinodal T+, obtained from the equation of state. The weakest transition was observed in lysozyme with tau(+) = -0.0167 followed by holo albumin with tau(+) = -0.0208 with the strongest transition in monomeric apo albumin tau(+) = -0.0242. A structural transition at 45 degrees C in apo albumin leads to a noncooperative melt with tau(+) = -0.00532 and amyloidogenic increase in beta content.

AB  - This study examined how spring-flow (SF) contributions to streams related to the distribution and abundance of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu in a predominately pasture landscape in Missouri, USA. Stream segments (N=13) with similar landscape characters were classified by SF volume into high SF (HSF) or low SF (LSF) groups. The densities of smallmouth bass, channel unit (CU) use and temperature-selection patterns were assessed for several life stages and frequency distributions for age 0 fish. More smallmouth bass were present in stream segments with HSF influence. Age 0 fish were twice as likely to be present in HSF stream segments. Older age classes were present in stream reaches independent of SF contribution. For all age classes, the use of particular CUs did not depend on SF influence. All age classes were more likely to be present in pools than other CUs. Microhabitat temperature selection differed among age classes. Age 0 fish selected warmer temperatures with a gradual shift towards cooler temperatures for older age classes. The length frequency of age 0 fish was skewed towards larger individuals in streams with limited SF influence, whereas the length frequency in HSF stream segments was skewed towards smaller individuals. The benefits of significant groundwater via SF influence seem to be related to increased hatch or survival of age 0 fish and the availability of optimal temperatures for adult smallmouth bass growth. Thermal refugia and stable flows provided by springs should be recognised for their biological potential to provide suitable habitat as climate change and other land-use alterations increase temperature regimes and alter flow patterns.

AB  - Overwintering females of Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni) entered a reproductive diapause, and the ovary development in females collected before December 22 was retarded at 20 C under short (L10 : D14) and long (L15 : D9) days. In contrast, ovarian eggs in females collected after the beginning of the year developed normally. I examined the effects of temperature on the development of overwintering females that infested tea branches and on the hatch of the first generation at various constant temperatures. The base temperature was determined to be 10.5 degreesC and 10.9 degreesC for 50% of the females to begin laying eggs and for the egg hatch to reach a peak, respectively. Seasonal changes in oviposition of the overwintering generation and hatch of the first generation were monitored from 1998-2002 at Kanaya, Shizuoka Prefecture. When the base temperature was assumed to be 10.5 C and day-degrees (DD) were summed from January 1, 50% of the females began laying eggs when an average of 149 DD had accumulated, and the peak of hatching coincided with an average of 288 DD. The logistic equation y=1/[1+exp{-(alpha(0) + alpha(1)x)}] (y, proportion of parous females or hatch; x, DD accumulations; alpha(0) and alpha(1), constants) was used to model a sequence of the population events and to predict the optimum timing of insecticide application for controlling the first-generation larvae of P. pentagona.

AB  - The properties of crystalline protein materials are closely linked to crystal shape. However, the effective strategies for the shape control of protein crystals are lacking. The conventional sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed to investigate the influence of pH and temperature on the crystal nucleation behavior of hen egg white lysozyme. Moreover, the size distributions of protein crystals grown at different conditions were analyzed. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to evaluate the thermal stability of lysozyme crystals. The results indicated that pH and temperature will affect the supersaturation and electrostatic interactions among protein molecules in the nucleation process. In particular, the crystals with different aspect ratios can be selectively nucleated, depending upon the choice of pH and temperature. Therefore, this study provided a simple method for obtaining shape-controlled lysozyme crystals and supplied some information on thermal behaviors of lysozyme crystals grown at different pH values.

AB  - Archean tectonics was capable of producing virtually indestructible cratonic mantle lithosphere, but the dominant mechanism of this process remains a topic of considerable discussion. Recent geophysical and petrological studies have refuelled the debate by suggesting that thickening and associated vertical movement of the cratonic mantle lithosphere after its formation are essential ingredients of the cratonization process. Here we present a geodynamical study that focuses on how the thick stable cratonic lithospheric roots can be made in a thermally evolving mantle. Our numerical experiments explore the viability of a cratonization process in which depleted mantle lithosphere grows via lateral compression into a >200-km thick, stable cratonic root and on what time-scales this may happen. Successful scenarios for craton formation, within the bounds of our models, are found to be composed of two stages: an initial phase of tectonic shortening and a later phase of gravitational self-thickening. The initial tectonic shortening of previously depleted mantle material is essential to initiate the cratonization process, while the subsequent gravitational self-thickening contributes to a second thickening phase that is comparable in magnitude to the initial tectonic phase. Our results show that a combination of intrinsic compositional buoyancy of the cratonic root, rapid cooling of the root after shortening, and the long-term secular cooling of the mantle prevents a Rayleigh-Taylor type collapse, and will stabilize the thick cratonic root for future preservation. This two-stage thickening model provides a geodynamically viable cratonization scenario that is consistent with petrological and geophysical constraints.

AB  - Reliability of microbial (starter) strains in terms of quality, functional properties, growth performance, and robustness is essential for industrial applications. In an industrial fermentation process, the bacterium should be able to successfully withstand various adverse conditions during processing, such as acid, osmotic, temperature, and oxidative stresses. Besides the evolved defense mechanisms, stress-induced mutations participate in adaptive evolution for survival under stress conditions. However, this may lead to accumulation of mutant strains, which may be accompanied by loss of desired functional properties. Defining the effects of specific fermentation or processing conditions on the mutation frequency is an important step toward preventing loss of genome integrity and maintaining the productivity of industrial strains. Therefore, a set of Lactobacillus plantarum mutator reporter strains suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of low-frequency mutation events was developed. The mutation reporter system constructed was validated by using chemical mutagenesis (N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine) and by controlled expression of endogenous candidate mutator genes (e.g., a truncated derivative of the L. plantarum hexA gene). Growth at different temperatures, under low-pH conditions, at high salt concentrations, or under starvation conditions did not have a significant effect on the mutation frequency. However, incubation with sublethal levels of hydrogen peroxide resulted in a 100-fold increase in the mutation frequency compared to the background mutation frequency. Importantly, when cells of L. plantarum were adapted to 42 C prior to treatment with sublethal levels of hydrogen peroxide, there was a 10-fold increase in survival after peroxide treatment, and there was a concomitant 50-fold decrease in the mutation frequency. These results show that specific environmental conditions encountered by bacteria may significantly influence the genetic stability of strains, while protection against mutagenic conditions may be obtained by pretreatment of cultures with other, nonmutagenic stress conditions.

AB  - Observations made on a rearing population of Diprion pini L. bred since more than 30 generations in photoperiodic and thermic conditions favourable to without-diapause development, show that during the first reared generations sex-ratio evolued rapidly in favour of males while diapause rate highly increased, reaching more than 90% of individuals.  Then diapause rates decreased gradually, after what, stay devinitively to a low level, while males remain much more numerous than females.  These observations suggest a high consanguinity in rearing populations and that the increasing diapause rates, that are not without analogy with diapause variations during outbreaks of natural populations, may be linked with this consanguinity.  Initial diapause rate recovery will result in the selection realised by the reproduction of the without diapause individuals only at every generation.  The hypothesis is further advanced that the increase in males may result in a sex determinism well-known for some Hymenoptera and at least for a Diprionidae that involve the production of diploid males favoured by consanguinity.  This phenomenon may be at the origin of observed diapause rate variations.  Several factors such as insect weight, wing setae number and, in particular, the presence of heterozygote males in natural populations corroborate the existence of diploid males for D. pini.  The existence of gynandromorphs in nature as in laboratory populations may also constitute an indicator of the consanguinity.  Consanguine crossings realised between brother-sister insects through several generations reproduce the phenomena seen in rearing quite faithfully, as much for diapause as sex-ratio.

AB  - Large tablet controlled-release fertilizers (LCRFs) can significantly improve nutrient utilization and reduce coating costs. However, traditional petrochemical coating materials are expensive and non-renewable. Furthermore, conventional heat-curing coating process is both time and energy consuming and severely impairs the controlled-release characteristics of LCRFs. To solve above problems, green processes using renewable biomaterials have become the research hotspot for the new generation of LCRFs. In this work, bio-based polyurethane acrylate (BPUA), synthesized from castor oil, was used to coat large tablet by an innovative UV-curing process for controlled-release fertilizer to overcome the drawbacks of the heat-curing process. Furthermore, BPUA was modified with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and thiol grafted nanosilica (TNS) to prepare dense and superhydrophobic biopolymer-coated large tablet controlled-release fertilizer (DSBCF). The DSBCF exhibited remarkable controlled-release characteristics with a nitrogen release longevity of nearly 120 days, requiring only 4% of the coating materials. This research provides an efficient UV-curing strategy to manufacture energy saving, superior performance and biopolymer-coated LCRFs. It can solve bottlenecks that limit the development of coated fertilizers and provide theoretical and technical support for the green upgrade of the industry.

AB  - This study estimates agricultural residue biomass available for biogas generation in smallholder farming systems in the rural Vakinankaratra region of Madagascar, during 2017-2018. Estimations of biomass were done using a combination of agricultural household surveys, literature models, and publicly available data. Manure from four types of farm animals and 17 residue types from ten crops were assessed. In the studied period, gross biomass produced from animal manure and crop residue were 19.4 +/- 7.41 and 7.3 +/- 1.08 tonnes fresh weight per year per agricultural household, respectively, of which up to 54% and 83% are estimated as recoverable for the production of bioenergy in the studied area, respectively. Estimations indicate that available animal manure and crop residue have the potential to generate 291 +/- 92 and 745 +/- 122 Nm(3) of methane per year per agricultural household respectively, equivalent to 10.5 +/- 3.34 and 26.8 +/- 4.28 GJ of heat energy from manure and residues, respectively. Theoretically, the average estimated energy potential can result in the complete substitution of domestic fuels in agricultural households. Approximately 0.12 tonnes of nitrogen per household per year can be recovered from the estimated digestate (using all residue types) after energy recovery, which can be employed for crop fertilization. The recovered nitrogen corresponds to 0.26 tonnes urea fertilizer per household per year. The investigation shows that anaerobic digestion based on crop residue and manure has the potential to meet a significant portion of energy needs of smallholder farmers in the Vakinankaratra region of Madagascar and can make an important contribution to providing fertilizer for on-farm use.

AB  - To investigate the occurrence of thermal adaptation in the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, inhabiting the lower reaches of the Mississippi River, we compared lethal heat-tolerance among three populations (mussels collected at Lake Pepin, MN; Alton, IL; and Baton Rouge, LA). We determined time-to-death at 32 degrees C for 160 individuals per site, for mussels collected at a water temperature of 15 degrees C and then maintained in the laboratory for about 8 wk under uniform conditions. Both shell length and condition index significantly affected survival time and were included as covariates in the analysis for interpopulation differences in heat-tolerance. Zebra mussels from our southernmost location had a higher heat-tolerance than those from the two northern locations. This difference in heat-tolerance among sites may indicate adaptation to local temperature regimes. In addition, in a comparison of heat tolerance within populations, we separated mussels into size classes (where larger mussels have been exposed to local conditions longer) and calculated an adjusted mean time-to-death (TTD). We found a different TTD/size relationship depending on sampling location. Minnesota mussels had decreasing heat tolerance as size increased, where Louisiana mussels had the opposite relationship. These patterns of heat-tolerance within populations indicate a selection pressure for increased heat-tolerance at Louisiana. However, even if the selection pressure is strong at the Louisiana site, it has not (at least not yet) resulted in an adaptation, as high heat-tolerance is not ubiquitous within this population. Zebra mussels may have insufficient genetic variation for heat-tolerance or gene flow may have been too strong for genetic adaptation to occur in the short amount of time that zebra mussels have occurred in the lower Mississippi River.

AB  - For decades, multiple anthropogenic stressors have threatened the Galapagos Islands. Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galapagos species. Simultaneously, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and structure of endemic and native Galapagos pelagic communities. In this novel review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated ecotoxicological implications for Galapagos species in the face of climate change stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galapagos. For example, the survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galapagos sea lions exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming (El Nino events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants, resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The Galapagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on understanding the processes of change through research to champion the conservation of the Galapagos.

AB  - Non-target effects of two varieties of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-maize straw (5422Bt1 [event Bt11] and 5422CBCL [MON810]) return on the Eisenia fetida were investigated by using multilevel assessments, compared to near-isogenic non-Bt-maize (5422). 5422Bt1 straw return had no deleterious effects on adult earthworms and had significantly positive effects on juveniles over three generations. Negative, no, and positive effects on adults treated with 5422CBCL straw were observed in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation, respectively. Negative and positive effects were observed on juveniles produced from the 1st- and 2nd-generation adults treated with 5422CBCL straw, respectively. Glutathione peroxidase activity of earthworms from Bt-maize treatments was significantly higher than that of control on the 90th d. Translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes were down-regulated, while annetocin (ANN) expression was up-regulated in 5422Bt1 treatments. TCTP and SOD genes were up-regulated, while ANN and heat shock protein 70 were down-regulated in E. fetida from 5422CBCL treatments. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that Cry1Ab released from 5422Bt1 and 5422CBCL straw degraded rapidly on the 15th and 30th d and had a slow decline in the rest testing time. Cry1Ab concentrations in the soil, casts and guts of earthworm significantly decreased over the course of the experiment. This study was the first to evaluate generational effects of Bt-maize straw return on earthworms under laboratory conditions. The responses of enzymes activity and genes expression may contribute to better understand above different effects of Bt-maize straw return on earthworms from the 1st generation.

AB  - Elevation of temperature and CO2 levels within the world's aquatic environments is expected to cause numerous physiological challenges to their inhabitants. While effects on marine ecosystems have been well studied, freshwater ecosystems have rarely been examined using a dual-stressor approach leaving our understanding of its inhabitants upon these challenges unclear. We aimed to identify the affects of elevated temperature and hypercapnia in isolation and in combination on the metabolic and acid-base regulatory processes of a freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish were exposed to freshwater conditions that may be prevalent by the year 2100 and metabolic responses were determined after 14-days of exposure. In addition, changes in branchial mRNA expression of acid-base linked transporters were investigated. Interactions between exposure conditions influenced extracellular pH as well as the nitrogen physiology and routine metabolic rate of the crayfish. Crayfish exposed to individual and combined elevations in temperature and/or hypercapnia maintained an extracellular pH similar to that of control crayfish. Dual-stressor exposed crayfish seem to elevate the importance of ammonium as an excretable acid-equivalent based on an overall increase in the branchial mRNA expression of transporters related to ammonia excretion including the Na+/K+-ATPase, Rhesus-protein, and the V-type H+- ATPase. Overall, hypercapnia and dual-stressor conditions caused a metabolic depression that may have longlasting consequences such as limited locomotion, growth, and reproduction. Future generations of crayfish given the chance to adapt over several generations may ameliorate these consequences.

AB  - Random mutagenesis is a useful tool to genetically modify organisms for various purposes, such as adaptation to cultivation conditions, the induction of tolerances, or increased yield of valuable substances. This is especially attractive for systems where it is not obvious which genes require modifications. Random mutagenesis has been extensively used to modify crop plants, but even with the renewed interest in microalgae and cyanobacteria for biofuel applications, there is relatively limited current research available on the application of random mutagenesis for these organisms, especially for cyanobacteria. In the presented work we characterized the lethality and rate of non-lethal point mutations for ultraviolet radiation and methyl methanesulphonate on the model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Based on these results an optimal dosage of 10-50 J/m(2) for UV and either 0.1 or 1 v% for MMS was determined. A Synechocystis wildtype culture was then mutagenized and selected for increased temperature tolerance in vivo. During the second round of mutagenesis the viability of the culture was monitored on a cell by cell level from the treatment of the cells up to the growth at an increased temperature. After four distinct rounds of treatment (two with each mutagen) the temperature tolerance of the strain was effectively raised by about 2 degrees C. Coupled with an appropriate in vivo screening, the described methods should be applicable to induce a variety of desirable characteristics in various strains. Coupling random mutagenesis with high-throughput screening methods would additionally allow to select for important characteristics for biofuel production, which do not yield a higher fitness and can not be selected for in vivo, such as fatty acid concentration. In a combined approach with full genome sequencing random mutagenesis could be used to determine suitable target-genes for more focused methods.

AB  - Gram positive mycobacteria with a high GC content, such as the etiological agent of tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis, possess an outer membrane mainly composed of mycolic acids (MAs), the so-called mycomembrane, which is essential for the cell. About thirty genes are involved in the biosynthesis of MAs, which include the hadA, hadB and hadC genes that encode the dehydratases Fatty Acid Synthase type II (FAS-II) known to function as the heterodimers HadA-HadB and HadB-HadC. The present study shows that M. smegmatis cells remain viable in the absence of either HadA and HadC or both. Inactivation of HadC has a dramatic effect on the physiology and fitness of the mutant strains whereas that of HadA exacerbates the phenotype of a hadC deletion. The hadC mutants exhibit a novel MA profile, display a distinct colony morphology, are less aggregated, are impaired for sliding motility and biofilm development and are more resistant to detergent. Conversely, the hadC mutants are significantly more susceptible to low-and high-temperature and to selective toxic compounds, including several current anti-tubercular drugs.

AB  - In a 2-yr study of causes of mite outbreaks in apple (Males spp.) orchards in Nova Scotia, we monitored immigration of Tetranychus urticae Koch from orchard ground cover into trees populated by the generalist phytoseiid predator Typhlodroinus pyri Scheuten. In both years, T. urticae-days in the tree canopy increased with number of T. urticae caught in sticky bands on tree trunks. In 2000, T. urticae-days were negatively correlated with T. pyri-days. Lack of correlation in 2001 was attributed to higher rates of immigration, which would mask the effects of predation. Weather also affected mite dynamics. Rainfall in July and August was less in 2001 than in 2000. Heat units were sufficient for six generations of T. urticae in 2001 but only for five in 2000. Consequently, T. urticae-days in the tree canopy and immigration rates were significantly greater in 2001 than in 2000, despite three-fold greater use of miticides. We also tested the effects of herbicides on T. urticae immigration. Application of selective herbicides in laneways reduced coverage of reproductive hosts of T. urticae, but these changes did not reduce immigration. In 2001, application of a miticidal herbicide, glufosinate, in tree rows reduced captures of T. urticae on sticky bands in high immigration orchards but not in low immigration orchards. We conclude that generalist predators and modified herbicide use are insufficient remedies and that effective biological control of T. urticae in the ground cover by a specialist phytoseiid such as Amblyseius fallacis Garman is essential to prevent outbreaks.

AB  - The close association of mantle-derived mafic rocks and crust-derived felsic rocks in AMCG suites the world over is now interpreted in terms of delamination of the lithospheric keel of an orogen within a short time after the cessation of a major collision. The stage is set for the ascent of an asthenospheric diapir, which is accompanied by the ascent of a stream of H2O-CO2 representing regional degassing of the mantle in the ensuing extensional setting. The crust gets variably metasomatized prior to melting, and this episode of melting seems to involve almost complete melting rather than the expected films of leucosome. Results of polythermal experiments with a large array of target rocks (pulverized) + H2O show that it is possible to mobilize the major elements K, Na, Al, Si and Fe such that the transported fractions resembles an A-type granite or syenite. The open-system process increases in efficiency with increasing temperature and increasing pressure. A stream of such fluid interacting with gabbro or basic magma could create anorthositic and ultrabasic assemblages that are candidates for contamination of pools of basic magma in the uppermost mantle and lower crust. The same stream continues its buoyant rise and makes over the sterile granulitic lower and middle crust into a geochemically fertile protolith for the generation of A-type felsic magmas by wholesale anatexis.

AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts originating from wild (Imsa) and selected (AquaGen) strains were maintained on simulated natural photoperiod (SNP) or constant light (LL) in replicate tanks between 3 December 1998 and 26 May 1999. Gill Na+,K-ATPase activity, plasma growth hormone (GH) levels, condition factor (CF) as well as individual food intake, growth and food conversion were monitored regularly in all groups during the experimental period. Freshwater temperature was kept constant at approximately 12 degreesC. In both strains, GH levels and gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity rose steadily in the SNP groups, whereas the abrupt increase in day-length caused a significant increase in GH levels within 4 weeks, concurrent with an increase gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The close relationship between GH levels and gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity indicates that GH plays and important role in the development of hypoosmoregulatory ability during smolting. Overall, a higher growth rate was seen in smolts from the AquaGen strain compared with the Imsa strain. No differences in food consumption were seen between strains, whereas an improved food conversion was observed in smolts from the AquaGen strain. Photoperiod was found to enhance growth through stimulation of food intake. It is concluded that the observed differences in growth and food conversion between wild and selected smolts are genetic, and probably reflect the fact that the AquaGen fish have been bred for rapid growth for several generations.

AB  - Similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, influenza A virus poses a constant threat to the global community. For the treatment of flu disease, both antivirals and vaccines are available with vaccines the most effective and safest approach. In order to overcome limitations in egg-based vaccine manufacturing, cell culture-based processes have been established. While this production method avoids egg-associated risks in face of pandemics, process intensification using animal suspension cells in high cell density perfusion cultures should allow to further increase manufacturing capacities worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a perfusion process using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension cells for influenza A (H1N1) virus production from scale-down shake flask cultivations to laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactors. Shake flask cultivations using semi-perfusion mode enabled high-yield virus harvests (4.25 log(10)(HAU/100 mu L)) from MDCK cells grown up to 41 x 10(6) cells/mL. Scale-up to bioreactors with an alternating tangential flow (ATF) perfusion system required optimization of pH control and implementation of a temperature shift during the infection phase. Use of a capacitance probe for on-line perfusion control allowed to minimize medium consumption. This contributed to a better process control and a more economical performance while maintaining a maximum virus titer of 4.37 log(10)(HAU/100 mu L) and an infectious virus titer of 1.83 x 10(10) virions/mL. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates recent advances in cell culture-based perfusion processes for next-generation high-yield influenza vaccine manufacturing for pandemic preparedness.

AB  - In earlier work, we compared the amount of newly fixed nitrogen (N, as synthetic fertilizer and biologically fixed N) entering agricultural systems globally to the total emission of nitrous oxide (N2O). We obtained an N2O emission factor (EF) of 3-5%, and applied it to biofuel production. For 'first-generation' biofuels, e.g. biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), that require N fertilizer, N2O from biofuel production could cause (depending on N uptake efficiency) as much or more global warming as that avoided by replacement of fossil fuel by the biofuel. Our subsequent calculations in a follow-up paper, using published life cycle analysis (LCA) models, led to broadly similar conclusions. The N2O EF applies to agricultural crops in general, not just to biofuel crops, and has made possible a top-down estimate of global emissions from agriculture. Independent modelling by another group using bottom-up IPCC inventory methodology has shown good agreement at the global scale with our top-down estimate. Work by Davidson showed that the rate of accumulation of N2O in the atmosphere in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries was greater than that predicted from agricultural inputs limited to fertilizer N and biologically fixed N (Davidson, E. A. 2009 Nat. Geosci. 2, 659-662.). However, by also including soil organic N mineralized following land-use change and NOx deposited from the atmosphere in our estimates of the reactive N entering the agricultural cycle, we have now obtained a good fit between the observed atmospheric N2O concentrations from 1860 to 2000 and those calculated on the basis of a 4 per cent EF for the reactive N.

AB  - This study provides a multi-site hybrid statistical downscaling procedure combining regression-based and stochastic weather generation approaches for multisite simulation of daily precipitation. In the hybrid model, the multivariate multiple linear regression (MMLR) is employed for simultaneous downscaling of deterministic series of daily precipitation occurrence and amount using large-scale reanalysis predictors over nine different observed stations in southern Qu,bec (Canada). The multivariate normal distribution, the first-order Markov chain model, and the probability distribution mapping technique are employed for reproducing temporal variability and spatial dependency on the multisite observations of precipitation series. The regression-based MMLR model explained 16 % similar to 22 % of total variance in daily precipitation occurrence series and 13 % similar to 25 % of total variance in daily precipitation amount series of the nine observation sites. Moreover, it constantly over-represented the spatial dependency of daily precipitation occurrence and amount. In generating daily precipitation, the hybrid model showed good temporal reproduction ability for number of wet days, cross-site correlation, and probabilities of consecutive wet days, and maximum 3-days precipitation total amount for all observation sites. However, the reproducing ability of the hybrid model for spatio-temporal variations can be improved, i.e. to further increase the explained variance of the observed precipitation series, as for example by using regional-scale predictors in the MMLR model. However, in all downscaling precipitation results, the hybrid model benefits from the stochastic weather generator procedure with respect to the single use of deterministic component in the MMLR model.

AB  - This study explores a new high temperature molten hydroxide domain to electrochemically split water into hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen fuel, if produced without greenhouse gas emissions, is a promising fuel for transportation. This study opens a pathway to low energy water splitting and the electrolytic production of hydrogen fuel without carbon dioxide emission. A wide range of pure and mixed alkali and alkali earth hydroxide electrolytes are explored at temperatures ranging from 200 to 700 degrees C. Higher temperature leads to improved (lower voltage) water splitting and improved rates of charge transfer, but carries challenges (increased rates of parasitic side reactions as the molten electrolytes dehydrate with increasing temperature). This study extends the range of hydrogen formation in alkaline electrolysis water splitting to over 600 degrees C, and demonstrates that lithium and/or barium hydroxide electrolytes remain hydrated at high temperatures, and in the high temperature domain are advantageous over sodium or potassium hydroxide electrolytes. In pure LiOH, the coulombic efficiency for hydrogen generation decreases with temperature and is measured respectively at eta(H2) = 88%, 21%, 4% and 0%, respectively at 500, 600, 700 and 800 degrees C.

AB  - Bioenergy crop production can enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, whilst producing feedstocks for energy generation. However, the GHG balance of these ecosystems is intimately linked to crop selection, previous and current land management and the effects of land conversion. This study aims to quantify nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the early stage of land -use change (LUC) from perennial grassland to two perennial rhizomatous grasses in a temperate climate: Miscanthus and reed canary grass (RCG) in the south of Ireland. Emissions of N2O were measured during the first two years of RCG and Miscanthus establishment. Miscanthus stands emitted 7.7 +/- 1.6 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the first and the second year, respectively, while RCG produced 1.1 +/- 0.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the first year following LUC. Temporal fluxes of N2O were generally low, however peak emissions observed in the first year contributed approximately 83% of annual N2O in the Miscanthus treatment. This peak occurred in wet (50 mm rainfall in the week preceding the peak) and warm ( > 18.5 degrees C in the top 5 cm of soil) weather conditions and was significantly affected (R-2 = 0.77) by the soil moisture deficit. However large, annual losses from Miscanthus and RCG found in this study are well within the range of those from grassland soils in temperate climate, drawing conclusions that any short-term increases in N2O production will soon be offset by the reduced future fertilisation, carbon sequestration and produced bioenergy feedstock.

AB  - Evolutionary transitions between sex-determining mechanisms (SDMs) are an enigma. Among vertebrates, individual sex (male or female) is primarily determined by either genes (genotypic sex determination, GSD) or embryonic incubation temperature (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD), and these mechanisms have undergone repeated evolutionary transitions. Despite this evolutionary lability, transitions from GSD (i.e. from male heterogamety, XX/XY, or female heterogamety, ZZ/ZW) to TSD are an evolutionary conundrum, as they appear to require crossing a fitness valley arising from the production of genotypes with reduced viability owing to being homogametic for degenerated sex chromosomes (YY or WW individuals). Moreover, it is unclear whether alternative (e.g. mixed) forms of sex determination can persist across evolutionary time. It has previously been suggested that transitions would be easy if temperature-dependent sex reversal (e.g. XX male or XY female) was asymmetrical, occurring only in the homogametic sex. However, only recently has a mechanistic model of sex determination emerged that may allow such asymmetrical sex reversal. We demonstrate that selection for TSD in a realistic sex-determining system can readily drive evolutionary transitions from GSD to TSD that do not require the production of YY or WW individuals. In XX/XY systems, sex reversal (female to male) occurs in a portion of the XX individuals only, leading to the loss of the Y allele (or chromosome) from the population as XX individuals mate with each other. The outcome is a population of XX individuals whose sex is determined by incubation temperature (TSD). Moreover, our model reveals a novel evolutionarily stable state representing a mixed-mechanism system that has not been revealed by previous approaches. This study solves two long-standing puzzles of the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms by illuminating the evolutionary pathways and endpoints.

AB  - Acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) has been proven to enhance high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) thermal ablation of tumor. It has also been demonstrated that triggering droplets before HIFU exposure could be a potential way to control both the size and the shape of the thermal lesion. In this paper, a numerical model is proposed to predict the thermal lesion created in ADV enhanced HIFU treatment. Bubble oscillation was coupled into a viscoelastic medium in the model to more closely represent real applications in tissues. Several physical processes caused by continuous wave ultrasound and elevated temperature during the HIFU exposure were considered, including rectified diffusion, gas solubility variation with temperature in the medium, and boiling. Four droplet concentrations spanning two orders of magnitude were calculated. The bubble cloud formed from triggering of the droplets by the pulse wave ultrasound, along with the evolution of the shape and location of the bubble cloud and thermal lesion during the following continuous wave exposure was obtained. The increase of bubble void fraction caused by continuous wave exposure was found to be consistent with the experimental observation. With the increase of droplet concentration, the predicted bubble cloud shapes vary from tadpole to triangular and double triangular, while the thermal lesions move toward the transducer. The results show that the assumptions used in this model increased the accuracy of the results. This model may be used for parametrical study of ADV enhanced HIFU treatment and be further used for treatment planning and optimization in the future.

AB  - Internal and external influences determine the work output that can be achieved on any given day. One factor is external temperature, with a significant effect on the ability of workers to work outdoors. If temperatures are too hot or cold, losses of productivity occur and the labor consumption rate increases. This paper presents a survey indicating the percentage labor consumption rate increase to be factored in as a result of suboptimal external temperatures during reinforced concrete works. An example demonstrates how much the selection of the construction start date influences construction costs if the survey findings are taken into account. Both deterministic and probabilistic calculations were performed to address the uncertainties included in the equations and to illustrate the results in histograms and curves. For this purpose, Monte -Carlo simulations made it possible to assign distribution functions to individual input parameters to carry out the calculations. Potential savings were identified that result from choosing a favorable construction start date. In the event of any disruptions or delays, the potential effects on the labor consumption rate can be assessed systematically with respect to chances and risks.

AB  - Some of the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) broodstock reproductive constraints are related to sperm quality. Although they present two defined spawning season (spring and autumn), males gave semen during all the year thus an exhaustive annual sperm analysis is important to determine the seasonal changes in semen quality. Sampling was performed monthly during one year, analyzing different cellular parameters to better understand sperm quality limitations obstructing sole mass production. The percentage of progressive motile cells and their linear velocity showed a decrease from March (beginning of the first spawning season) to July (when the highest temperatures were observed), followed by a slight increase in August and October (second spawning season). DNA fragmentation values showed highest values between the two spawning seasons and decreased to the end of the year. The percentage of apoptotic cells was lowest in March (beginning of the first spawning season) and the highest in November. The percentage of cells resistant to seawater exposure presented two peaks related with both spawning seasons. There was a tendency for the semen to attain a quality peak between the beginning and the middle of the first spawning season (March-May), followed by a pronounced decrease, achieving the lowest values during the months with the highest temperature. Also, the different males present in the broodstocks reach their sperm quality peak at different times, which will result in an unequal contribution for the next generation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Are the oceans turning into deserts? Rising temperature, increasing surface stratification, and decreasing vertical inputs of nutrients are expected to cause an expansion of warm, nutrient deplete ecosystems. Such an expansion is predicted to negatively affect a trio of key ocean biogeochemical features: phytoplankton biomass, primary productivity, and carbon export. However, phytoplankton communities are complex adaptive systems with immense diversity that could render them at least partially resilient to global changes. This can be illustrated by the biology of the Prochlorococcus "collective." Adaptations to counter stress, use of alternative nutrient sources, and frugal resource allocation can allow Prochlorococcus to buffer climate-driven changes in nutrient availability. In contrast, cell physiology is more sensitive to temperature changes. Here, we argue that biogeochemical models need to consider the adaptive potential of diverse phytoplankton communities. However, a full understanding of phytoplankton resilience to future ocean changes is hampered by a lack of global biogeographic observations to test theories. We propose that the resilience may in fact be greater in oligotrophic waters than currently considered with implications for future predictions of phytoplankton biomass, primary productivity, and carbon export.

AB  - Extrinsic estradiol-1713 (E2) is an environmental hormone. Female fish exposure to waterborne E2 might the development of craniofacial cartilage of its offspring. The present study investigates the effects of maternal on larval craniofacial cartilage development by administering oral feed containing E2 (F-E2) to female zebrafish, and examines whether the swimming behavior and their stress coping style are influenced by maternal E2. results showed that E2 contents responded to dosage and time in male fish after being fed with a diet containing E2. In addition, the E2 contents in female ovaries showed a significant increase after 250 mg of E2/kg treatment for 14 d. On the other hand, the fecundity rate of F-E2 group was lower around 2 folds than F-C (female mg of E2/kg) group. Craniofacial chondrogenesis on 72 hpf (hours of post fertilization) of F-E2 larvae abnormalities, and a recovery to a normal developmental pattern was observed at the 96 hpf stage. swimming speed was slower for F-E2 larvae compared to the F-C larvae; and the F-E2 juvenile seems to be responsive to cortisol (LRC) after cold stress. According to the results, we suggested that F-E2 larvae might worse environmental adaptability than F-C larvae.

AB  - In this paper, we report on results obtained both at CEA/LETI and SOFRADIR on p-on-n Infra-Red Focal Plane Arrays (IR FPAs) from the Short-Wave (SW) to the Very-Long-Wave (VLW) spectral range. For many years, p-on-n arsenic-ion implanted planar technology has been developed and improved within the framework of the joint laboratory DEFIR, a collaborative effort bringing together the expertise of both teams. Compared to n-on-p architecture, p-on-n technology allows to lower dark current density and series resistance by means of respectively long-lifetime minority carriers (hole) and high-mobility majority carriers (electrons). As a consequence, p-on-n photodiodes are well-adapted for very large FPAs operating either at high temperature or very low flux.
   The Mid-Wave (MW) and Long-Wave (LW) spectral ranges have been firstly addressed with TV/4 FPAs, 30 mu m pitch, principally for defence and security applications. Our results showed state-of-the-art detector performances, consistent with "Rule 07" model, a relevant indicator of the p-on-n technology maturity. The subsequent developments of p-on-n imagers have produced more compact, less energy consuming systems, with a substantial resolution enhancement. In this way, MW and LW FPAs, TV format, with 15 mu m pixel pitch have been designed. First results obtained in MW (lambda c=5.3 mu m @80 K) for High Operating Temperature (HOT) applications have showed highly promising Electro-Optical (EO) performances.
   Space applications are another exciting but challenging domains where p-on-n is a good candidate. In this way, imagers dedicated to low-flux detection have first been realized as TV/4 FPAs, with 15 mu m pitch in the SW spectral range (2 mu m). The dark currents obtained are coherent with those published in the literature. Finally, TV/4 arrays, 30 mu m pixel pitch, have been manufactured for the very long wave spectral range. For this detection range, the quality of material and reliability of technology are the most critical. The measured dark current fits "Rule 07" well, with homogeneous imagers. In conclusion, DEFIR team have developed, improved and characterized p-on-n IR FPAs from SW to VLW spectral range. In all spectral ranges, we have demonstrated state-of-the-art results, which highlight the quality of material and viability of our p-on-n technology. This technology, currently industrialized by SOFRADIR, opens new ways for next generation of imagers.

AB  - Agriculture in South Asia is highly vulnerable to climate change due to increasing variability in rainfall and rising temperatures leading to the incidence of extreme climatic events such as floods, droughts, heat/cold waves, and storms. Agriculture sector also contributes to the causes of climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Hence, adaptation-led mitigation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, farm income and reduce GHG emissions wherever possible. This study presents a systematic review of agriculture emission reduction opportunities with a particular focus on agricultural production systems in South Asia. Our review indicates that the adoption of better soil, water, nutrient management practices, and technologies has enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Many existing practices and technologies have the potential to improve both adaptation and mitigation in agriculture which can significantly contribute to complying with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of South Asian countries. However, barriers to the adoption of GHG mitigating agricultural practices, mainly the financial and institutional barriers, need to be appropriately addressed to achieve the desired level of mitigation.

TI  - Measures to reduce plastic deformation on static pressure plates of multi-disc brakes as a result of high frictional power applied on one side
T2  - FORSCHUNG IM INGENIEURWESEN-ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA  - German
KW  - CLUTCH
AB  - The thermally caused plastic deformation on static pressure plates of multi-disc brakes can permanently disturb their operating behavior and should therefore, be avoided. The plastic deformation of the pressure plate can, for example, lead to a reduction of the air gap and cause unwanted changes in the friction conditions. During the braking process, highly heated areas close to the friction surface expand whilst they are prevented from expanding by surrounding zones of lower temperature. If the resulting stresses exceed the yield point of the material, plastic deformation occurs. This article explains the physical deformation process in detail and, based on this, what measures can be taken to reduce the deformation. Hence, three approaches are first identified based on theoretical preliminary considerations. These approaches affect both the geometry and the materials of the pressure plates. Radial slits are designed to prevent the obstruction of thermal expansion and thereby reduce stresses; material selection based on thermal shock sensitivity reduces plastic deformation. Using a combined simulation of the thermal and mechanical behavior of a pressure plate, the effect of the measures is examined on four variants of the pressure plate. Experimental investigations on real prototypes of the pressure plate variants confirm the results of the simulation and demonstrate the effectiveness of the examined measures to reduce plastic deformation.

AB  - Swedish biomass production potential could be increased significantly if new production methods, such as optimised fertilisation, were to be used. Optimised fertilisation on 25% of Swedish forest and and the use of stem wood could almost double the biomass potential from forestry compared with no fertilisation, as both logging residues and large quantities of excess stem wood not needed for industrial purposes could be used for energy purposes. Together with energy crops and straw from agriculture, the total Swedish biomass potential would be about 230 TWh/yr or half the current Swedish energy supply if the demand for stem wood for building and industrial purposes were the same as today. The new production methods are assumed not to cause any significant negative impact on the local environment. The cost of utilising stem wood produced with optimised fertilisation for energy purposes has not been analysed and needs further investigation. Besides replacing fossil fuels and, thus, reducing current Swedish CO2 emissions by about 65%, this amount of biomass is enough to produce electricity equivalent to 20% of current power production. Biomass-based electricity is produced preferably through co-generation using district heating systems in densely populated regional and pulp industries in forest regions. Alcohols for transportation and stand-alone power production are preferably produced in less densely populated regions with excess biomass. A high intensity in biomass production would reduce biomass transportation demands. There are uncertainties regarding the future demand for stem wood for building and industrial purposes, the amount of arable land available for energy crop production and future yields. These factors will influence Swedish biomass potential and earlier estimates of the potential vary from 15 to 125 TWh/yr. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In the last few years, researchers have focused their attention on the synthesis of new catalyst structures based on or inspired by nature. Biotemplating involves the transfer of biological structures to inorganic materials through artificial mineralization processes. This approach offers the main advantage of allowing morphological control of the product, as a template with the desired morphology can be pre-determined, as long as it is found in nature. This way, natural evolution through millions of years can provide us with new synthetic pathways to develop some novel functional materials with advantageous properties, such as sophistication, miniaturization, hybridization, hierarchical organization, resistance, and adaptability to the required need. The field of application of these materials is very wide, covering nanomedicine, energy capture and storage, sensors, biocompatible materials, adsorbents, and catalysis. In the latter case, bio-inspired materials can be applied as catalysts requiring different types of active sites (i.e., redox, acidic, basic sites, or a combination of them) to a wide range of processes, including conventional thermal catalysis, photocatalysis, or electrocatalysis, among others. This review aims to cover current experimental studies in the field of biotemplating materials synthesis and their characterization, focusing on their application in heterogeneous catalysis.

Results were discussed in the framework of the evolution of thermal physiology and vulnerability to global climate change. Reproductive mode affects T-b but not T-pref. Whereas T-b and T-pref showed a significant association with T-air, there was no relationship with latitude or elevation.
   In most liolaemids, T-pref is significantly higher than T-air and T-b pointing to a primitive condition of T-pref, probably related to earlier Miocene environments. Phylogenetic trends in the evolution of liolaemid thermal physiology provide a physiological explanation for the lowest rates of observed contemporary climate-forced extinctions and those forecasted under climate warming scenarios up to 2080. Liolaemids have a much higher T-pref than is expected for their environments, especially for viviparous members of the genus, in contrast to other viviparous taxa in the sister family the Phrynosomatidae, which have evolved much lower T-b (and T-pref) and currently experience a much higher rate of climate-forced extinction.

AB  - As an important Tibetan medicine and a secondary protected plant in China, Pomatosace filicula is endemic to the country and is mainly distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, global climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions might lead to the extinction of P. filicula. To understand the potential spatial distribution of P. filicula in future global warming scenarios, we used the MaxEnt model to simulate changes in its suitable habitat that would occur by 2050 and 2070 using four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and five global climate models. The results showed that the QTP currently contains a suitable habitat for P. filicula and will continue to do so in the future. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, the suitable habitat area would increase by 2050 but shrink slightly by 2070, with an average reduction of 2.7%. However, under the RCP8.5 scenario, the area of unsuitable habitat would expand by an average of 54.65% and 68.20% by 2050 and 2070, respectively. The changes in the area of suitable habitat under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios were similar, with the unsuitable area increasing by approximately 20% by 2050 and 2070. Under these two moderate RCPs, the total suitable area in 2070 would be greater than that in 2050. The top three environmental factors impacting the habitat distribution were altitude, annual precipitation (BIO12) and annual temperature range (BIO7). The cumulative contribution rate of these three factors was as high as 82.8%, indicating that they were the key factors affecting the distribution and adaptability of P. filicula, P. filicula grows well in damp and cold environments. Due to global warming, the QTP will become warmer and drier; thus, the growing area of P. filicula will move toward higher elevations and areas that are humid and cold. These areas are mainly found near the Three-River Region. Future climate change will aggravate the deterioration of the P. filicula habitat and increase the species' survival risk. This study describes the distribution of P. filicula and provides a basis for the protection of endangered plants in the QTP.

AB  - A new concept for modelling habitat choice, called an adapted random walk, is presented. The concept is based on the evolution of threshold values for departures and destinations using a genetic algorithm. A habitat is departed if the fitness value associated with it is below the evolved threshold value. Movement is determined probabilistically using random numbers and adapted threshold values. Different versions of this concept were tested for the ability to model horizontal distribution of the Barents Sea capelin using two different fitness criteria. When adapting both departure and destination thresholds, the model performed better than a neural network model with the same number of adapted variables. The evolved threshold values can be used interchangeably with values estimated in the field, for example preferred temperature ranges or prey abundance. The adapted random walk concept functions intuitively, and can be useful for applied Purposes, such as extending models of fish distribution beyond the advected stages and studying the effects of climate change on the spatial distribution of fish.

AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) in subalpine zones of eastern California experienced significant mortality from 2007 to 2010. Dying stands were dense (mean basal area 47.5 m(2)/ha), young (mean 176 years), and even-age; mean stand mortality was 70%. Stands were at low elevations (mean 2993 m), on northerly aspects, and experienced warmer, drier climates relative to the regional species distribution. White pine blister rust was not observed; mountain pine beetle infestations were extensive. Ring widths were negatively correlated with climatic water deficit and positively correlated with water-year precipitation. Although trees that survived had greater growth during the 20th century than trees that died, in the 19th century trees that eventually died grew better than trees that survived, suggesting selection for genetic adaptation to current climates as a result of differential tree mortality. Air surveys (2006-2010) in the Sierra Nevada, Mt. Shasta, and Warner Mountains showed similar trends to the intensive studies. Observed mortality from air surveys was highest in the Warner Mountains (38%) and lowest in the Sierra Nevada (5%); northern aspects at lower elevations within each mountain region had the highest probabilities of mortality and dying stands had higher climatic water deficit. Scenarios for the future of whitebark pine in California are discussed.

AB  - With the growing adoption of intermittent renewable energy generation the role for energy storage to provide a number of service needs is being increasingly recognised. However, 'energy storage' encompasses a family of technologies, each with its own set of performance, cost and physical characteristics, at different stages of development. At the same time, each energy system however defined has specific needs; and energy systems are themselves part of a wider socio-technical system which has aims beyond the confines of the energy 'tri-lemma'. As energy storage technologies develop, funding is becoming available to demonstrate their application in realistic environments. However, with multiple technical and non-technical factors to consider, it is challenging for many decision makers who often have limited expertise and resources to select which projects to support.
   In this paper we first describe a novel framework for assessing the wider benefits that could come from deploying energy storage using Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT), a form of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. We then use the framework to assess six potential energy storage projects through a combination of technical analysis and stakeholder input in the county of Cornwall in the UK: a region that has good solar and wind resource with relatively low demand and constrained network infrastructure. The projects assessed were: power to gas, a distributed battery system, battery storage integrated with solar PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay, liquid air energy storage, battery storage integrated with wave energy, and thermal energy storage at a new residential development.
   We conclude that MAVT can provide a straightforward and user-friendly approach, which can be easily used by decision makers for assessing energy storage projects across a range of criteria and promoting engagement with stakeholders. This approach also allows the subjectivity of decision-making, a potential limitation, to be explored through a sensitivity analysis. The use of MAVT can lead to important insights for the development of energy systems, which in this study included the importance of local priorities to decision-making.
   In this case, battery storage with PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay was the top-ranking project, performing well across a range of attributes including the maturity of the technology, its ability to defer grid upgrades and economic viability.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze at the level of Spain's 52 provinces province level the temporal evolution of minimum mortality temperatures (MMT) from 1983 to 2018, in order to determine whether the increase in MMT would be sufficient to compensate for the increase in environmental temperatures in Spain for the period. It also aimed to analyze whether the rate of evolution of MMT would be sufficient, were it to remain constant, to compensate for the predicted increase in temperatures in an unfavorable (RCP 8.5) emissions scenario for the time horizon 2051-2100.
   The independent variable was made up of maximum daily temperature data (Tmax) for the summer months in the reference observatories of each province for the 1983-2018 period. The dependent variable was daily mortality rate due to natural causes (ICD 10: A00-R99). For each year and province, MMT was determined using a quadratic or cubic fit (p < 0.05). Based on the annual MMT values, a linear fit was carried out that allowed for determining the time evolution of MMT. These values were compared with the evolution of Tmax registered in each observatory during the 1983-2018 analyzed period and with the predicted values of Tmax obtained for an RCP8.5 scenario for the period 2051-2100.
   The rate of global variance in Tmax in the summer months in Spain during the 1983-2018 period was 0.41 degrees C/ decade, while MMT across the whole country increased at a rate of 0.64 degrees C/decade. Variations in the provinces were heterogeneous. For the 2051-2100 time horizon, there was predicted increase in Tmax values of 0.66 degrees C/decade, with marked geographical differences. Although at the global level it is possible to speak of adaptation, the

AB  - The hatchery program for chum salmon in Hokkaido, northern Japan, constitutes one of the largest salmon hatchery programs in the world. The hatchery program has been conducted for over 120years, and returns of chum salmon rapidly increased during the last quarter of the 20th century. Since the 1990s, chum salmon returns to Hokkaido have remained at a historically high level, although different fluctuation trends have been observed among regions within Hokkaido. Although such intensive hatchery programs have been conducted for more than 25 generations, there has been no evidence indicating any decline of genetic diversity. The hatchery program for chum salmon in Hokkaido is successful in increasing commercial catches and will likely be the main management tool in future. However, information on naturally spawning chum salmon in Hokkaido remains scarce. Assessment of naturally spawning populations recently commenced, and it has been revealed that naturally spawning chum salmon populations remain in many rivers in Hokkaido. For future management, monitoring chum salmon of both hatchery and natural origin is important, and a novel strategy that accounts for the enhancement of commercial stocks and the coexistence of hatchery programs and wild populations should be established in Japan.

AB  - Context. The elliptical galaxy NGC3923 is surrounded by numerous stellar shells that are concentric arcs centered on the Galactic core. They are very likely a result of a minor merger and they consist of stars in nearly radial orbits. For a given potential, the shell radii at a given time after the merger can be calculated and compared to observations. The MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a theory that aims to solve the missing mass problem by modifying the laws of classical dynamics in the limit of small accelerations. Hernquist & Quinn (1987b, ApJ, 312, 1) claimed that the shell distribution of NGC3923 contradicted MOND, but Milgrom (1988, ApJ, 332, 86) found several substantial insufficiencies in their work.
   Aims. We test whether the observed shell distribution in NGC3923 is consistent with MOND using the current observational knowledge of the shell number and positions and of the host galaxy surface brightness profile, which supersede the data available in the 1980s when the last (and negative) tests of MOND viability were performed on NGC3923.
   Methods. Using the 3.6 mu m bandpass image of NGC3923 from the Spitzer space telescope we construct the mass profile of the galaxy. The evolution of shell radii in MOND is then computed using analytical formulae. We use 27 currently observed shells and allow for their multi-generation formation, unlike the Hernquist & Quinn one-generation model that used the 18 shells known at the time.
   Results. Our model reproduces the observed shell radii with a maximum deviation of similar to 5% for 25 out of 27 known shells while keeping a reasonable formation scenario. A multi-generation nature of the shell system, resulting from successive passages of the surviving core of the tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy, is one of key ingredients of our scenario supported by the extreme shell radial range. The 25 reproduced shells are interpreted as belonging to three generations.

AB  - An assembly of gypsum boards fixed along their centre to a steel stud with a cavity between its two facings has been subjected to the standard fire of ISO 834. A model was developed to simulate the temperature evolution in the assembly measured at different distances from the fireside. Using measured thermal properties as functions of temperature, in combination with models taking into account radiation and convection in the wall cavity as well as mass transfer inside the gypsum boards led to a fairly good reproduction of the measured data.

AB  - Climate is a driver of biotic systems. It affects individual fitness, population dynamics, distribution and abundance of species, and ecosystem structure and function. Regional variation in climatic regimes creates selective pressures for the evolution of locally adapted physiologies, morphological adaptations (e.g., color patterns, surface textures, body shapes and sizes), and behavioral adaptations (e.g., foraging strategies and breeding systems). In the absence of humans, broad-scale, long-term consequences of climatic warming on wild organisms are generally predictable. Evidence from Pleistocene glaciations indicates that most species responded ecologically by shifting their ranges poleward and upward in elevation, rather than evolutionary through local adaptation (e.g., morphological changes). But these broad patterns tell us little about the relative importance of gradual climatic trends as compared to extreme weather events in shaping these processes. Here, evidence is brought forward that extreme weather events can be implicated as mechanistic drivers of broad ecological responses to climatic trends. They are, therefore, essential to include in predictive biological models, such as doubled CO2 scenarios.

AB  - We collected southern grass lizards, Takydromus sexlineatus, from a population in Shaoguan (Guangdong, southern China), and used adult males and non-reproductive females to study the thermal dependence of food assimilation and locomotor performance. We did not find sex differences in selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and critical thermal maximum (CTMax). Tsel measured on a laboratory thermal gradient was 31.5degreesC; CTMin and CTMax averaged 6.4degreesC and 42.2degreesC, respectively. Within the range from 24degreesC to 36degreesC, food passage time, daily food intake, daily production of faeces, apparent digestive coefficient (ADC) and assimilation efficiency (AE) were affected by body temperature, and daily production of urates was not. Food passage time decreased with increase in body temperature within the range from 24degreesC to 34degreesC, and then increased at higher body temperatures. Lizards at 32degreesC and 34degreesC took more food than did those at higher or lower body temperatures. When influence of variation in the total food intake was removed by an ANCOVA, lizards at 36degreesC produced faeces containing significantly higher energy as compared with those at body temperatures lower than 32degreesC. Energy in urates did not differ among lizards at different body temperatures, when removing the influence of variation in total food intake by an ANCOVA. Lizards at 36degreesC had apparently lower ADC and AE than did those at body temperatures lower than 34degreesC, mainly because they produced faeces with higher energy contents. Sprint speed increased with increase in body temperature within the range from 20degreesC to around 32degreesC, and then decreased at higher body temperatures. Inter-specific comparison among three species of Takydromus lizards occupying different latitudinal (climatic) ranges reveal that (1) the maximal sprint speed is greater in T wolteri and T sexlineatus than in T septentrionalis, (2) the optimal body temperature for sprint speed decreases with increase in latitude, and (3) the thermal sensitivity of sprint speed is more pronounced in species occupying lower and higher latitudinal ranges.

AB  - The mathematical model to compute the thermal evolution and solidification of thin slabs, previously presented in Part I of this article, was used in combination with a three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element thermomechanical model to analyze how actual operation conditions can lead to excessive deflection and jamming of the slab shell at the pinch rolls. The models suggest that these phenomena arise from a sudden loss of control of the metallurgical length stemming from the coupling of inappropriate steel superheats and casting velocities to deficient heat-extraction conditions at the mold or secondary cooling system. The bulging deformation was calculated with an elastic and creep model that takes, into account the temperature distribution across the shell thickness and the different times that shell elements have to creep exposure, i.e., according to the time that rows of elements require to reach their current position in the casting direction at a given casting speed. The last point was simulated[ by varying the duration of application of the ferrostatic load to the inside surface of each row of elements. The conditions forecast by the models as being responsible for excessive bulging agree very well with those present during the occurrence of these events in the plant. Since bulging after the last containment roll is a major limitation to productivity, this article also presents a parametric evaluation of the casting-speed limits that two compact-strip process (CSP) casters with different supported lengths may have as a function of steel superheat, mold heat-extraction level, water flow rate of the spray and air-mist nozzles, and slab thickness.

AB  - Objective: Numerous epidemiological studies have reported relevance of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases with short-term exposure to environmental temperature. In this study, we examined the hypothesis between temperature indices and hospital admission because of cardiovascular diseases. Methods: The daily number of CVDs was obtained from all hospitals of the Sabzevar city. A semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) following a quasi-Poisson distribution with distributed lag non-linear model (dlnm) was selected as a modeling framework for time-series analysis. Results: The overall CVD risk comparing the 1st percentile and the 99th percentile relative to the mean temperature (at lag 0) was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.11: 1.61), and 1.34 (95% CI, 1.10: 1.64), respectively. For all indicators, the extremely cold effects persisted for the initial 7 days. Conclusions: Our results suggest that extremely cold and extremely hot temperatures increase the relative risk of cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Although the strategies used by bacteria to adapt to specific environmental conditions are widely reported, fewer studies have addressed how microbes with a cosmopolitan distribution can survive in diverse ecosystems. Exiguobacterium is a versatile genus whose members are commonly found in various habitats. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the universality of Exiguobacterium, we collected 105 strains from diverse environments and performed large-scale metabolic and adaptive ability tests. We found that most Exiguobacterium members have the capacity to survive under wide ranges of temperature, salinity, and pH. According to phylogenetic and average nucleotide identity analyses, we identified 27 putative species and classified two genetic groups: groups I and II. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the Exiguobacterium members utilize a variety of complex polysaccharides and proteins to support survival in diverse environments and also employ a number of chaperonins and transporters for this purpose. We observed that the group I species can be found in more diverse terrestrial environments and have a larger genome size than the group II species. Our analyses revealed that the expansion of transporter families drove genomic expansion in group I strains, and we identified 25 transporter families, many of which are involved in the transport of important substrates and resistance to environmental stresses and are enriched in group I strains. This study provides important insights into both the overall general genetic basis for the cosmopolitan distribution of a bacterial genus and the evolutionary and adaptive strategies of Exiguobacterium.
   IMPORTANCE The wide distribution characteristics of Exiguobacterium make it a valuable model for studying the adaptive strategies of bacteria that can survive in multiple habitats. In this study, we reveal that members of the Exiguobacterium genus have a cosmopolitan distribution and share an extensive adaptability that enables them to survive in various environments. The capacities shared by Exiguobacterium members, such as their diverse means of polysaccharide utilization and environmental-stress resistance, provide an important basis for their cosmopolitan distribution. Furthermore, the selective expansion of transporter families has been a main driving force for genomic evolution in Exiguobacterium. Our findings improve our understanding of the adaptive and evolutionary mechanisms of cosmopolitan bacteria and the vital genomic traits that can facilitate niche adaptation.

AB  - The traditional view of habitat requirements for inland striped bass Morone saxatilis suggests that these fish need dissolved oxygen (DO) levels above 2-3 mg/L and temperatures below 25 degrees C to thrive. However, striped bass are found in reservoirs where hypolimnetic hypoxia forces them into warm temperatures (27-30 degrees C) for much of the summer, and contrary to expectations, these populations do not consistently experience poor growth or mortality. We used telemetry of adult striped bass in Badin Lake, North Carolina, to characterize habitat selection by striped bass in systems with unsuitable summer habitat. As summer stratification developed, striped bass selected preferred temperatures of 20-23 degrees C as long as the DO was at least 2 mg/L. Once hypoxia forced striped bass into warmer water, the fish concentrated at the top of the oxycline (defined as the depth just above the largest decline in DO occurring over a 1-m change in depth), which was 1-2 degrees C warmer but had greater DO levels (4-8 mg/L) than the coolest water, with DO of 2 mg/L. Striped bass remained at the top of the oxycline into the fall, even after deeper water with preferred temperatures and a DO level of 2 mg/L became available. We suggest that these patterns, supported by observations in the literature, represent summer habitat selection rules for striped bass in reservoirs where all oxygenated habitat exceeds temperatures traditionally considered suitable for striped bass. We also show that the depth distribution of Badin Lake striped bass in response to physical habitat constraints causes them to overlap spatially with warmwater prey inhabiting shallow, warmwater depths both in the summer and early fall. Badin Lake striped bass continue to feed and grow over the summer, providing evidence that the availability of adequate prey resources can offset the costs of poor summer habitat. Warm, productive reservoirs without permanent thermal refuges may therefore provide better habitat for maintaining quality growth and condition than those systems where occupation of cooler temperatures segregates striped bass from their prey.

AB  - This paper presents a case study of a locally adapted sustainable strategy of salinity reduction applied to the Saint Lawrence maritime ecosystem at the Biodome de Montreal. In conformity with the standards of the CAZA (Canadian Aquarium and Zoos Association), this procedure was implemented to reconcile animal well-being, ecosystem representativeness and control of costs under the operational environment of a cold seawater recirculation system featuring the Golfe du Saint Laurent Ecosystem (GSLE) and its associated live collection. A simple methodology to carry out safe salinity reduction procedures of artificial seawater environments (from 28 to 24 Practical Salinity Units) is proposed and detailed. Adapted salinity challenge tests at 14, 21 and 24 were conducted beforehand and simple adapted indicators were used on a selection of key species (thorny skate: Raja radiate; little skate: R. erinacea; barndoor skate: R. laevis; Atlantic cod: Gadus morhua; green urchins: Strongylocentrolus droebachien and American lobster: Homarus americanus) to evaluate the well-being and mortality risks associated with both a lower operational salinity (long-term exposure) and an unavoidable salinity drop (short-term exposure) observed during routine large-scale water renewal operations. Economic gains achieved through reduction in the use of costly synthetic salt formulation were calculated. The savings achieved during three years of operation at 24 PSU have been applied to the improvement of the water quality control management capacities of the GLSE exhibit such as a sulphur-based denitrification unit, additional ozonation and protein skimming capacities.

AB  - Highly silicic glass inclusions are commonly present in mafic minerals of xenolithic terrestrial upper mantle rocks (Schiano and Clocchiatti, 1994). They are believed to be the products of volatile-rich silicic melts for which several sources have been proposed (Francis, 1976; Frey and Green, 1974; Schiano et al., 1995), but their origin(s) and, consequently, that of the glasses, remains unknown. However, in situ formation by very low-degree partial melting seems to be possible as has been shown by experiments (e.g., Baker et al., 1995; Draper and Green, 1997).
   Glass inclusions of silicic chemical composition are also present in some mafic minerals of achondritic meteorites (e.g., Fuchs, 1974; Okada et al., 1988; Johnson et al., 1991). The enstatite achondrites (aubrites) Aubres and Norton County, which record early planetesimal and planet formation in the solar nebula, and the olivine achondrite (chassignite) Chassigny, a rock believed to originate from Mars, contain abundant glass inclusions in their main minerals enstatite and olivine, respectively. Glasses of glass-bearing inclusions have a highly silicic and volatile-rich chemical composition similar, but not identical, to that of glass inclusions in terrestrial upper mantle peridotite minerals. Furthermore, glass inclusions in olivines from the Moon (e.g., Roedder and Weiblen, 1977) are also silica-rich.
   Because different physicochemical conditions prevail in the source regions of these rocks, the process of melting is, perhaps, not generally applicable for the generation of silica-rich glasses. Alternatively, the glasses could have been formed via precipitation from silicate-loaded fluids (Schneider and Eggler, 1986) or vapors. Another possible mechanism, not previously identified, could be dehydrogenation of nominally nonhydrous mafic minerals by heating or depressurization that should be accompanied by expulsion of excess silica and incompatible elements. This process will mimic low-temperature, very low-degree partial melting. It could account also for the highly variable glass/bubble ratios observed in glass inclusions in aubrite enstatites. We suggest that such a process could have been operating in the solar nebula, the Moon and Mars, and could be operating still on Earth.

AB  - Warming rivers and an improved knowledge of thermal impacts on fish are fueling a need for simple tools to generate water temperature forecasts that aid in decision making for the management of aquatic resources. Although there is strong evidence for temperature-dependent mortality in freshwater fish populations, the application of water temperature models for in-season fisheries management is still limited due to a lack of appropriate temperature thresholds and due to uncertainty in forecasts. We evaluated the ability of statistical models based on seasonal trends, air temperature, and discharge to produce daily forecasts of water temperature in the Fraser River, British Columbia, including explicit quantification of uncertainty in predictor variables. For all models evaluated (with and without air temperature and/or discharge predictor variables), the top model choice varied as a function of environmental conditions, uncertainty in the air temperature forecasts used to predict water temperature, and the selection of quantitative performance criteria (i.e., defining the best model based on the smallest mean raw error or based on the ability to accurately forecast extreme water temperatures). Water temperature forecasts averaged across 10 d produced by simple models that were fitted only to historical seasonal water temperature trends were as accurate as forecasts generated from uncertain air temperature predictions. Models fitted to air temperature were critical for forecasting high temperature thresholds; even the use of uncertain air temperature forecasts predicted high water temperatures with greater accuracy than models that lacked an air temperature covariate. In contrast, models that were fitted to discharge variables lowered the rate of false-negative and false-positive errors associated with estimating below-average temperatures. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that fisheries managers should quantify the effect of uncertainties in model predictor variables when assessing water temperature models and should evaluate model performance in the context of system-specific conditions and management objectives.

AB  - Numerous studies have investigated the impacts of catch-and-release on the post-release behaviour of fish during periods characterized by warm air and water temperatures. Comparatively little is known about the post-release behaviour of fish caught while ice fishing. Largemouth bass (LMB), a popular sportfish in North America, is sometimes encountered during ice fishing and is often released due to angler conservation ethic or to comply with regulations. To examine the impacts of ice angling on the post-release behaviour of LMB, we exposed them to a range of handling practices and assessed their skin temperatures prior to release, as well as short-term postrelease swimming activity using biologgers equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer, temperature and pressure sensors. Skin temperature of LMB had a significant positive relationship with windchill temperature. Generally, the longer that LMB were exposed to air or placed on the ice, the colder their skin became. Overall, water depth and water temperature selected by LMB increased with time during the post-release period. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), a proxy for locomotory activity, decreased as time progressed in the release period, while ODBA decreased with increasing depth and water temperatures. LMB with warmer skin temperatures had lower locomotory activity compared to those with colder skin temperatures. Further, the effect of skin temperature on locomotory activity became more amplified with increasing depth and warming water temperatures selected by LMB post-release. Anglers practicing catch-and-release angling during the winter should adopt best handling practices by reducing the time fish are removed from the water when windchill temperatures are subfreezing to avoid alteration in post-release behaviour.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using 16S rRNA and elongation factor (tuf) mRNA as targets for selective detection of viable beer-spoilage lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). One-step real-time RT-PCR was applied to monitor the target transcripts in Lactobacillus brevis, L. lindneri, and Pediococcus damnosus. Three methods were compared for total RNA extraction. To study the correlation between viability and RNA detection, log-phase cultures were inactivated using brewery disinfectant or heating. RT-PCR, denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, and cultivation were performed before and at various times after the inactivation treatments. A method combining bead-beating with traditional RNA purification provided good RNA yield from LAB. The 16S rRNA and tuf mRNA targets were detected in inactivated cells by RT-PCR throughout a 21-day storage period. Cultivable cells could not be recovered at any postinactivation time. The 16S rRNA degraded with time, and its degradation appeared to be initially faster after disinfection than after heating. The overall degradation patterns between the strains were similar. Our results indicate that tuf mRNA and 16S rRNA can be stable in LAB cells inactivated under conditions they may encounter during the brewing process. Hence, the RT-PCR analysis of these target transcripts may not be a reliable technique for selective detection of viable LAB in brewery samples.

AB  - The formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between nucleic acid bases are dependent on temperature. The high G + C content of organisms was surmised to be an adaptation for high temperature survival because of the thermal stability of G:C pairs. However, a survey of genomic GC% and optimum growth temperature (OGT) of several prokaryotes revoked any direct relation between them. Significantly high purine (R=A or G) content in mRNAs is also seen as a selective response for survival among thermophiles. Nevertheless, the biological relevance of thermophiles loading their unstable mRNAs with excess purines (purine-loading or R-loading) is not persuasive. Here, we analysed the mRNA sequences from the genomes of 168 prokaryotes (as obtained from NCBI Genome database) with their OGTs ranging from -5 degrees C to 100 degrees C to verify the relation between R-loading and OCT. Our analysis fails to demonstrate any correlation between R-loading of the mRNA pool and OCT of a prokaryote. The percentage of purine-loaded mRNAs in prokaryotes is found to be in a rough negative correlation with the genomic GC% (r(2) = 0.655, slope = -1.478, P<000.1). We conclude that genomic GC% and bias against certain combinations of nucleotides drive the mRNA-synonymous (sense) strands of DNA towards variations in R-loading. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Winter recreation and tourism continue to expand worldwide, and where these activities overlap with valuable wildlife habitat, there is greater potential for conservation concerns. Wildlife populations can be particularly vulnerable to disturbance in alpine habitats as helicopters and snowmachines are increasingly used to access remote backcountry terrain. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) have adapted hibernation strategies to survive this period when resources and energy reserves are limited, and disturbance could negatively impact fitness and survival. To help identify areas of potential conflict between helicopter skiing and denning brown bears in Alaska, we developed a model to predict alpine denning habitat and an associated data-based framework for mitigating disturbance activities. Following den emergence in spring, we conducted three annual aerial surveys (2015-2017) and used locations from three GPS-collared bears (2008-2014) to identify 89 brown bear dens above the forest line. We evaluated brown bear den site selection of land cover, terrain, and climate factors using resource selection function (RSF) models. Our top model supported the hypothesis that bears selected dens based on terrain and climate factors that maximized thermal efficiency. Brown bears selected den sites characterized by steep slopes at moderate elevations in smooth, well-drained topographies that promoted vegetation and deep snow. We used the RSF model to map relative probability of den selection and found 85% of dens occurred within terrain predicted as prime denning habitat. Brown bear exposure to helicopter disturbance was evident as moderate to high intensities of helicopter flight tracking data overlapped prime denning habitat, and we quantified where the risk of these impact was greatest. We also documented evidence of late season den abandonment due to disturbance from helicopter skiing. The results from this study provide valuable insights into bear denning habitat requirements in subalpine and alpine landscapes. Our quantitative framework can be used to support conservation planning for winter recreation industries operating in habitats occupied by denning brown bears.

AB  - Purpose of review To summarize key studies in liver preservation published over the last 3 years and evaluate benefits and limitations of the different perfusion techniques. Selected experimental applications that may be translated to the clinical use will be also discussed. Recent findings Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has transitioned into clinical practice. Viability assessment is a reliable tool for clinical decision-making, and safety of the back-to-base approach has facilitated adoption of the technology. Data supporting well tolerated use of declined livers after NMP and new protocols selecting complex recipients aim to improve access to suitable organs. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is showing promising clinical results by decreasing biliary complications in recipients' receiving organs donated after circulatory death (DCD) and improving early graft function in extended criteria organs. Long-term data of HMP on DCD livers shows improved graft survival over standard SCS. Novel approaches utilizing sequential HMP--NMP or ischaemia-free preservation aim to improve outcomes of extended criteria organs. Machine perfusion for organ transplantation has become an established technique but the field is rapidly evolving. Ongoing research focuses on evaluation of the intervention efficacy and finding optimal indications to use each perfusion strategy according to graft type and clinical scenario.

AB  - This study evaluated the performance and cold tolerance of different Nile tilapia stocks, selected at suboptimal temperature and identified alleles of microsatellite markers associated with cold tolerance. After 67 days of rearing at average temperature of 22.4 degrees C, tilapia juveniles from different stocks were evaluated, tagged with a transponder and acclimated to 16 degrees C. Subsequently, the temperature was reduced 1 degrees C per day until 11 degrees C and from that temperature decreases of 0.5 degrees C per day were made until total mortality. A caudal fin sample was collected, and their genetic profile was characterized through the microsatellite markers UNH879, UNH916 and UNH999. Tilapias of stocks S3, S6 and S7 showed higher growth at suboptimal temperatures, 42 to 47% higher than base population. In the cold tolerance assay, tilapias from stocks S5 and S7 showed lower mean death temperature. Through molecular analysis, it is stated that allele 186 bp of UNH879 and 147 bp of UNH916 were more frequently found in animals cold-tolerant. Artificial selection for final weight during winter in southern Brazil can assist in the selection of tilapias improved to rearing in suboptimal temperatures. Finally, using microsatellite markers, it is possible to direct selective breeding to obtain tilapias more adapted to low temperatures.

AB  - Temperature and salinity shape the distribution and genetic structure of marine communities. Future warming and freshening will exert an additional stress to coastal marine systems. The extent to which organisms respond to these shifts will, however, be mediated by the tolerances of all life-stages and populations of species and their potential to adapt. We investigated nauplius and cypris larvae of the barnacle Balanus (Amphibalanus) improvisus from the Swedish west coast with respect to temperature (12, 20, and 28 degrees C) and salinity (5, 15, and 30) tolerances. Warming accelerated larval development and increased overall survival and subsequent settlement success. Nauplii developed and metamorphosed best at intermediate salinity. This was also observed in cypris larvae when the preceding nauplii stages had been reared at a salinity of 30. Direct comparisons of the present findings with those on a population from the more brackish Baltic Sea demonstrate contrasting patterns. We conclude that i) B. improvisus larvae within the Baltic region will be favoured by near-future seawater warming and freshening, that ii) salinity tolerances of larvae from the two different populations reflect salinities in their native habitats, but are nonetheless suboptimal and that iii) this species is generally highly plastic with regard to salinity.

AB  - Fabrication of shape memory alloys using wire electro discharge machining (WEDM) has gained popularity over the last few years. Most widely used machining parameters of WEDM process are pulse on time (oon), pulse off time (ooff), servo voltage (r) and wire feed (x). WEDM responses like material removal rate (MR), surface roughness (SR), kerf width (KW) and recast layer thickness (LT) have been evaluated by researchers to determine machining characteristics and are also considered for this study. These machining responses determine the quality of machining and are majorly influenced by thermal conductivity and melting temperature of the WEDM workpiece. Actuation behavior of shape memory alloys is a function of phase transformation characteristics which in turn depends on elemental composition of the selected alloys. Therefore, dissimilar machining responses of Ti50Ni40Cu10 and Ti50Ni25Cu25 have been observed even though similar machining input values were used. This study utilized artificial neural network (ANN) mapping to establish WEDM response function - which was used as fitness function to perform multi objective optimization using genetic algorithm (GA). It was found that ANN successfully predicted machining responses of selected homologous alloys and GA helped in identifying suitable input parameter values to optimize machining responses.

AB  - Large igneous provinces (LIPS) are generally considered to be related to mantle plumes and to have a great importance to the supercontinent break-up events, climate change and biological evolution over Earth's history. The high melt production rates of LIPs can be achieved under rigorous melting conditions: an abnormally high temperature, substantial decompression, addition of fusible components, or remarkable enrichment in water. Although it has been repeatedly noticed that water enrichment has occurred in many Phanerozoic LIPs, the significance of water enrichment in the mantle source for the generation of LIPs has not been explicitly highlighted. The southeastern Asian basalt province (SABP), which is thought to have formed by the Hainan mantle plume from a pyroxenite-bearing source, was emplaced over a small area of about 0.037 Mkm(2) over a long period of time from 28.5 Ma to Holocene, thus differing from a typical LIP (>0.1 Mkm(3) in volume emplaced in one or multiple pulses of less than 5 Ma). In this work, we measured H2O contents of high-Mg# clinopyroxene phenocrysts (12-179 ppm H2O) from Cenozoic basalts in the northern Hainan Island, which is part of the SABP. These data were utilized to estimate the water content of the mantle source of these basalts, yielding values in the range of 84-360 ppm H2O, which are significantly lower than those obtained for many Phanerozoic LIPs (thousands of ppm). After calculating the mantle potential temperature for the Hainan basalts about 170 degrees C higher than that for the MORB source mantle, we consider that the paucity of source water likely depressed the melt productivity and the velocity of plume upwelling, and induced the Hainan plume to stall at depths of 350-500 km, inhibiting the formation of a LIP by the Hainan plume, despite the occurrence of other favorable conditions. Hence, our results from the SABP provide evidence for the significance of water enrichment in the mantle source in the formation of LIPs. The low water content in the Hainan plume can be attributed to the incorporation of subducted slabs that had experienced significant dehydration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study we assessed the potential of woody biomass (short-rotation Mallee Eucalypts) for renewable energy generation as an economically viable way of motivating widespread natural resource management under climate change in the 11.9 million ha Lower Murray agricultural region in southern Australia. The spatial distribution of productivity of agricultural crops and pasture, and biomass was modelled. Average annual economic returns were calculated under historical mean (baseline) climate and three climate change scenarios. Economically viable areas of biomass production were identified where the profitability of biomass is greater than the profitability of agriculture under each scenario for three factory gate biomass prices. The benefits of biomass production for dryland salinisation, wind erosion, and carbon emissions reduction through biomass-based renewable energy production were also modelled. Depending on climate scenario, at the median price assessed ($40/tonne) biomass production can generate $51.4-$88M in annual net economic returns, address 41,226-165,577 ha at high risk of dryland salinisation and 228,000-1.4 million ha at high risk of wind erosion, and mitigate 10.4-12 million tonnes of carbon (CO2-e) emissions annually. Economically viable areas for biomass production expanded under climatic warming and drying especially in more marginal agricultural land. Under the baseline, the area at high risk of dryland salinisation was more than double that at high risk of wind erosion. However, under climatic warming and drying the relative importance of these two natural resource management objectives switched with the area at high risk of wind erosion becoming much larger. As biomass production can achieve multiple natural resource management objectives, it may provide a land use policy option that is adaptable to changing priorities and economically resilient given climatic uncertainties. For such a significant and enduring land use change policy it is prudent to assess both the economic and environmental potential under climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The CSP technology based on parabolic trough solar collector for large electricity generation purposes is currently the most mature of all CSP designs in terms of previous operation experience and scientific and technical research and development. The current parabolic trough design deals with a maximum operating temperature around 400 degrees C in the absorber collector tube but some recent designs are planned to increase the working temperature to 600 degrees C increasing the performance by 5-10% to attain the improved productivity that the market demands. These systems are expected to be working during 20-25 years.
   One of the key points of the receiver is the stack of layers forming the selective absorber coating. Typical optical values for this coating are >95% of absorbance and 10% of emittance at 400 degrees C. In the HITECO EU funded project a new modular concept of collector is being tested. With this new design the coating has to fulfill new requirements as the collector will be working at 600 degrees C and in a low vacuum of 10(-2) mbar. The authors from IK4-Tekniker have collaborated in the HITECO project building a sputtering system to upscale these new coatings to 4 meters long tubes for the application in a set of experimental collectors, being the project coordination done by ARIES Ingenieria y sistemas S.A.
   However, there is a great lack of knowledge about the performance of the absorber coatings during the whole life of the receiver. So, it is necessary to establish characterization methods and standards to guarantee the performance, durability and quality control of high temperature coatings. For this purpose, a new EU funded project called NECSO, aims to design accelerated ageing protocols to test the evolution of these coatings under more aggressive conditions in the new designs.

AB  - Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) and their cognates are primary mitigators of cell stress. With increasingly severe impacts of climate change and other human modifications of the biosphere, the ability of the heat-shock system to affect evolutionary fitness in environments outside the laboratory and to evolve in response is topic of growing importance. Since the last major reviews, several advances have occurred. First, demonstrations of the heat-shock response outside the laboratory now include many additional taxa and environments. Many of these demonstrations are only correlative, however. More importantly, technical advances in omic quantification of nucleic acids and proteins, genomewide association analysis, and manipulation of genes and their expression have enabled the field to move beyond correlation. Several consequent advances are already evident: The pathway from heat-shock gene expression to stress tolerance in nature can be extremely complex, mediated through multiple biological processes and systems, and even multiple species. The underlying genes are more numerous, diverse and variable than previously appreciated, especially with respect to their regulatory variation and epigenetic changes. The impacts and limitations (e.g., due to trade-offs) of natural selection on these genes have become more obvious and better established. At last, as evolutionary capacitors, Hsps may have distinctive impacts on the evolution of other genes and ecological consequences.

AB  - Generalists and specialists are types of strategies individuals can employ that can evolve in fluctuating environments depending on the extremity and periodicity of the fluctuation. To evaluate whether the evolution of specialists or generalists occurs under environmental fluctuation regimes with different levels of periodicity, 24 populations of Escherichia coli underwent laboratory evolution with temperatures alternating between 15 and 43 degrees C in three fluctuation regimes: two periodic regimes dependent on culture's cell density and one random (non-periodic) regime with no such dependency, serving as a control. To investigate contingencies on the genetic background, we seeded our experiment with two different strains. After the experiment, growth rate measurements at the two temperatures showed that the evolution of specialists was favored in the random regime, while generalists were favored in the periodic regimes. Whole genome sequencing demonstrated that several gene mutations were selected in parallel in the evolving populations with some dependency on the starting genetic background. Given the genes mutated, we hypothesized that the driving force behind the observed adaptations is the restoration of the internal physiology of the starting strains' unstressed states at 37 degrees C, which may be a means of improving fitness in the new environments. Phenotypic array measurements supported our hypothesis by demonstrating a tendency of the phenotypic response of the evolved strains to move closer to the starting strains' response at the optimum of 37 degrees C, especially for strains classified as generalists.

AB  - Ammonium nitrate (AN) is one of the main nitrogen fertilizers used in fertilization programs. However, AN has some serious disadvantages - being well soluble in water hardly 50% of the N-species contained are assimilated by plants. The second disadvantage of AN is associated with its explosive properties. The aim of this paper was to clarify the influence of different time-containing substances - mainly Estonian limestone and dolomite - as internal additives on thermal behaviour of AN.
   Commercial fertilizer grade AN was under investigation. The amount of additives used was 5, 10 or 20 mass%, or calculated on the mole ratio of AN/(CaO, MgO)=2:1 in the blends. Experiments were carried out under dynamic heating condition tip to 900 degrees C (10 degrees C min(-1)) in a stream of dry air or N-2 by using Setaram Labsys 2000 equipment coupled to Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR).
   The results of analyses of the gaseous compounds evolved at thermal treatment of neat AN indicated some differences in the decomposition of AN in air or in N-2. At the thermal treatment of AN's blends with CaCO3, MgCO3, limestone and dolomite samples the decomposition of AN proceeds through a completely different mechanism - depending on the origin and the content of additives, partially or completely, through the formation of Mg(NO3)(2) and Ca(NO3)(2).

AB  - Studying the geographic variation of phenotypic traits can provide key information about the potential adaptive function of alternative phenotypes. Gloger's rule posits that animals should be dark- vs. light-colored in warm and humid vs. cold and dry habitats, respectively. The rule is based on the assumption that melanin pigments and/or dark coloration confer selective advantages in warm and humid regions. This rule may not apply, however, if genes for color are acting on other traits conferring fitness benefits in specific climes. Covariation between coloration and climate will therefore depend on the relative importance of coloration or melanin pigments and the genetically correlated physiological and behavioral processes that enable an animal to deal with climatic factors. The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) displays three melanin-based plumage traits, and we tested whether geographic variation in these traits at the scale of the North American continent supported Gloger's rule. An analysis of variation of pheomelanin-based reddish coloration and of the number and size of black feather spots in 1,369 museum skin specimens showed that geographic variation was correlated with ambient temperature and precipitation. Owls were darker red in color and displayed larger but fewer black feather spots in colder regions. Owls also exhibited more and larger black spots in regions where the climate was dry in winter. We propose that the associations between pigmentation and ambient temperature are of opposite sign for reddish coloration and spot size vs. the number of spots because selection exerted by climate (or a correlated variable) is plumage trait-specific or because plumage traits are genetically correlated with different adaptations.

AB  - Cold active isolates #76, #102, and #D of Steinernema kraussei and the Czech isolate #B1 of S. feltiae preadapted for the parasitation of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, were used for the laboratory control of the European corn borer larvas and pupae at low temperature. The experiments performed in Petri dishes were divided into two alternatives, both at a constant temperature of 7 degrees C, exposition time 250 h with 200 infective juveniles and 10 insects per dish. In the first experiment the only non-ligatured Ostrinia larvae and Canadian isolates were tested, while in the second experiment the Canadian isolate #D and Czech isolate #B1 were compared when using against ligatured larvae of the pest. The average mortality of the pest larvae in the first experiment reached maximally 26% and the average number of adult nematodes recovered by dissection was 7.2 per insect in the best #D isolate. Low efficacy of steinernematids to pest larvae was probably significantly influenced by forming a cocoon by insect. In the second experiment the pest larvae were ligatured before nematode application and forming of the cocoon was blocked. Surprisingly, the #B1 isolate killed on average 88.3% of Ostrinia larvae while the cold active #D isolate killed only 48.3% of the pest larvae. Number of recovered adults per insect by dissection was 30.3 in the #B1 isolate and 10 in the #D isolate. The results were analysed by means of one-way analysis of variance and of t-test. The percentage of parasitation (P < 0.01) and number of recovered adults (P < 0.05) were statistically significant between S. kraussei #D and S. feltiae #B1. It is speculated that the adaptability of the #B1 isolate had more significant role for the parasitation than the cold activity of the #D isolate.

AB  - The use of enzymes in industrial catalysis continues to grow because of the considerable advantages of natural catalytic systems. The need for enantiomerically pure fine chemicals and the movement away from chemically burdened technologies will drive the acceptance of enzyme-assisted processes. New technologies for enzyme discovery and optimization have enabled the application of enzymes in harsh industrial conditions and in processes demanding stringent selectivity. These discovery and laboratory evolution methods entail genomic approaches that by their nature engender screening of extremely large numbers of gene types and variants. By extension, the fitness of an individual high-throughput screen requires an intelligent, process-targeted assay amenable to a chosen screening platform.

AB  - Climate change is altering patterns of seed production worldwide [1-4], but the potential for evolutionary responses to these changes is poorly understood. Masting (synchronous, annually variable seed production by plant populations) is selectively beneficial through economies of scale that decrease the cost of reproduction per surviving offspring [5-7]. Masting is particularly widespread in temperate trees [8, 9] impacting food webs, macronutrient cycling, carbon storage, and human disease risk [10-12], so understanding its response to climate change is important. Here, we analyze inter-individual variability in plant reproductive patterns and two economies of scale-predator satiation and pollination efficiency-and document how natural selection acting upon them favors masting. Four decades of observations for European beech (Fagus sylvatica) show that predator satiation and pollination efficiency select for individuals with higher inter-annual variability of reproduction and higher reproductive synchrony between individuals. This result confirms the long-standing theory that masting, a population-level phenomenon, is generated by selection on individuals. Furthermore, recent climate-driven increases in mean seed production have increased selection pressure from seed predators but not from pollination efficiency. Natural selection is thus acting to restore the fitness benefits of masting, which have previously decreased under a warming climate [13]. However, selection will likely take far longer (centuries) than climate warming (decades), so in the short-term, tree reproduction will be reduced because masting has become less effective at satiating seed predators. Over the long-term, evolutionary responses to climate change could potentially increase inter-annual variability of seed production of masting species.

AB  - This study was conducted in a real-scale iron ore sinter plant for reducing emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) from the iron ore sintering process via the adjustment of its sinter raw mix. Based on operating condition of the selected plant, four experimental campaigns of C-ref (currently used raw mix, served as the reference), C-H (modified from C-ref, with a 15% increase in hematite but 15% decrease in limonite), C-H,C-EP (modified from C-H, without electrostatic precipitator (EP) and blast furnace (BF) flue dusts), and C-H,C-EP,C-W (modified from C-H,C-EP, with a 0.5 wt% increase in water content) were chosen. For each experimental campaign, three replicate samples of PCDD/Fs were collected from the flue gases, and the sinter productivity and sinter strength were measured simultaneously. In comparison with C-ref, the most significant reductions in PCDD/F and I-TEQ emissions was found in C-H,C-EP (=68% and 76%, respectively), and the main reduction was found in PCDFs (54-76% decrease). C-H could reduce emissions of PCDD/Fs and I-TEQ by 47% and 51%, respectively. But the addition of water contents (i.e., C-H,C-EP,C-W) did not result in further reductions. Since sinter productivity and sinter strength of all experimental campaigns were quite similar, C-H,C-EP could be a promising raw mix for reducing PCDD/F emissions from the sintering process.

AB  - In this study, the cost-benefit analysis technique was developed and incorporated into the Taguchi experimental design to determine the optimal operation combination for the purpose of providing a technique solution for controlling both emissions of PCDD/Fs and PAHs, and increasing both the sinter productivity (SP) and sinter strength (SS) simultaneously. Four operating parameters, including the water content, suction pressure, bed height, and type of hearth layer, were selected and all experimental campaigns were conducted on a pilot-scale sinter pot to simulate various sintering operating conditions of a real-scale sinter plant. The resultant optimal combination could reduce the total carcinogenic emissions arising from both emissions of PCDD/Fs and PAHs by 49.8%, and increase the sinter benefit associated with the increase in both SP and SS by 10.1%, as in comparison with the operation condition currently used in the real plant. The ANOVA results indicate that the suction pressure was the most dominant parameter in determining the optimal operation combination. The above result was theoretically plausible since the higher suction pressure provided more oxygen contents leading to the decrease in both PCDD/F and PAH emissions. But it should be noted that the results obtained from the present study were based on pilot scale experiments, conducting confirmation tests in a real scale plant are still necessary in the future.

AB  - We report on industrial high-power lasers in the green wavelength regime. By means of a thin disk oscillator and a resonator-internal nonlinear crystal for second harmonic generation we provide 2000 W continuous-wave laser radiation at a wavelength of 515 nm, transported by a fiber with a 150 mu m core diameter and NA 0.1.
   Application tests show that this laser is perfectly suited for copper welding due to the superior absorption of the green wavelength compared to IR, which allows the production of spatter-free weld spots and seams with an unprecedented reproducibility in diameter and welding depth. Now with 2 kW available power in the green, the welding performance for high quality welds can be increased compared to the already available 1 kW green laser system. The higher power leads to a larger melt volume and higher process efficiency. It is also possible to weld other materials with high quality results, for example stainless steel or aluminum.
   A particular advantage compared to the common IR lasers is the ability of the green laser for heat conduction mode because of the higher absorption. But due to the high beam quality also high-quality deep penetration welding is applicable, with the comfort to use scanner optics with a big field of work. This offers a whole range of new applications, e.g. remote-deburring of copper parts or producing a shiny copper surface by using shielding gas in addition.
   A further significant benefit of the green wavelength is that the surface condition does not influence the welding process, which allows to skip many expensive preprocessing steps such as tin-coating. Especially for e-mobility tasks the green 2 kW laser source is a suitable option for increasing productivity and quality: One example are copper foil stacks for battery production, which can be welded with higher speed and reduced spatter formation without ultrasonic pre-welding.

AB  - The diel activity, microhabitat selection and thermobiology were investigated in Tarentola substituta, a gecko endemic to an arid Cape Verde island, S. Vicente. Standardized transects were performed recording the microhabitat availability and the body, soil, refuge, air temperatures, relative humidity, gecko category (juvenile, adult male or female) and activity status for each observation. Thermal conditions were monitored with data-loggers. The activity pattern of the species was strictly nocturnal, as desert geckos. All individuals selected rocks as diurnal refuges, but adults used more medium-sized rocks (scarce) and juveniles small rocks (abundant). Such selection was mostly attributable to the refuges thermal properties: small rocks attained higher temperatures due to their lower thermal inertia. Geckos behaved as tigmotherms when active by night and as thermoconformers with the substrate by day. Nocturnal body temperatures did not differ among gecko categories or microhabitats. However, since juveniles selected small rocks, their diurnal body temperatures became higher, sometimes possibly risking overheating. Territoriality, scarcity of optimal refuges, high conspecific densities and lack of ground-predators may explain why juveniles use thermally suboptimal microhabitats. Results suggest that ecological shifts (nocturnality, microhabitat selection) and lack of competitors allowed T substituta to adapt to the archipelago's demanding arid and hot conditions.

AB  - Laser Trackers (LTs) are useful metrology tools for quickly acquiring accurate 3D position measurements of a target over long ranges (e.g., up to 100 m). These tools often employ an Absolute Distance Meter (ADM) which is known to have a temporal measurement shift arising from the internal thermal effect. The measured radial distance of a regular target can be compensated by subtracting from it the ADM shift. However, for many LTs currently in service the ADM shift cannot be acquired when an LT is in Operation. In this work, an estimate of the ADM shift is adopted for radial distance compensation when an LT is in Operation. A Switched Estimation (SE) algorithm is proposed to evaluate the validity of the estimate. The SE algorithm leverages the estimation uncertainty given by a Modified Kalman Filter (MKF) and confines the estimation uncertainty within a pair of predefined boundaries. When the estimation uncertainty reaches the upper bound, a regular Kalman Filter (KF) is adopted to calibrate the ADM shift estimate, during which the LT is directed to measure the ADM shift. Once the uncertainty reaches a lower bound, the LT is redirected to be back in Operation. Obviously high estimation accuracy, consequently high compensation accuracy, conflicts with high operation productivity. A tradeoff can be made by selecting an appropriate pair of boundaries. A numerical method is given for the selection of proper boundaries by creating a selection map. Experimental results show that with the proposed SE algorithm, the maximum variation of the radial distance measurement is reduced by more than 70% while the operation productivity is kept at 93.02%.

AB  - The time dynamics of quantum correlations in the quantum transverse anisotropic XY spin chain of infinite length is studied at zero and finite temperatures. The evolution occurs due to the instantaneous quenching of the coupling constant between the nearest-neighbor spins of the model, which is performed either within the same phase or across the quantum phase-transition point connecting the order-disorder phases of the model. We characterize the time-evolved quantum correlations, viz., entanglement and quantum discord, which exhibit varying behavior depending on the initial state and the quenching scheme. We show that the system is endowed with enhanced nearest-neighbor bipartite quantum correlations compared to that of the initial state, when quenched from the ordered to the deep disordered phase. However, nearest-neighbor quantum correlations are almostwashed out when the system is quenched from the disordered to the ordered phase with the initial state being at the zero temperature. We also identify the condition for the occurrence of enhanced bipartite correlations when the system is quenched within the same phase. Moreover, we investigate the bipartite quantum correlations when the initial state is a thermal equilibrium state with finite temperature, which reveals the effects of thermal fluctuation on the phenomena observed at zero temperature. Finally, an analogous analysis is carried out for zero-temperature next-nearest-neighbor quantum correlations.

AB  - A temperature decrease usually induces an ordering effect in membrane phospholipids, which can lead to membrane dysfunction. Poikilotherms inhabiting eurythermal environments typically counteract this temperature effect by remodeling membrane lipids as stipulated in the homeoviscous adaptation theory (HVA). Hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, can suffer high overwintering mortalities in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada. The selectively bred M. mercenaria var. notata can have higher overwintering mortalities than the wild species, thus suggesting that the two varieties have different degrees of adaptation to low temperatures. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in lipid composition of soft tissues in wild and selected hard clams in relation to their metabolic and genetic characteristics. Clams were placed at the northern limit of their distribution from August 2003 to May 2004; they were exposed to a gradual temperature decrease and then maintained at < 0 degrees C for 3.5 months. This study is the first to report a major remodeling of lipids in this species as predicted by HVA; this remodeling involved a sequential response of the phospholipid to sterol ratio as well as in levels of 22:6n-3 and non-methylene interrupted dienoic fatty acids. Hard clams showed an increase in 20:5n-3 as temperature decreased, but this was not maintained during overwintering, which suggests that 20:5n-3 may have been used for eicosanoid biosynthesis as a stress response to environmental conditions. Selectively bred hard clams were characterized by a higher metabolic demand and a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at several genetic loci due to a deficit in heterozygote frequency compared with wild clams, which is believed to impose additional stress and render these animals more vulnerable to overwintering mortality. Finally, an intriguing finding is that the lower metabolic requirements of wild animals coincide with a lower unsaturation index of their lipids, as predicted by Hulbert's theory of membranes as pacemakers of metabolism.

AB  - Soil associated stages, pupae, and last-instar larvae of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (PBW), were evaluated for susceptibility to the entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Mexican strain, Kapow selection). Mean mortality responses of PBW larvae entering the soil naturally compared to larvae buried artificially (2.5 cm deep) are 99.5 and 73.4%, respectively, at 15 infective juveniles/larva. The time required for nematode infection of larvae (38.0/cm2 soil surface) was 24 h or less. Larval mortality was significantly reduced at 15.6-degrees-C compared with 21.1, 26.7, and 32.2-degrees-C. Live nematodes were found in PBW larvae at all temperatures tested except 32.2-degrees-C. Reproduction of juveniles was evident 3 days after exposure at 26.7-degrees-C. At 26.7-degrees-C, mortality of nondiapause larvae was not significantly different than diapause larvae. Pupae were not susceptible unless injured. Entomopathogenic nematodes have potential as a biological control agent for PBW when larvae enter the soil.

AB  - Pinewood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) is a highly destructive invasive species, causing extensive economic and ecological losses across Eurasia. It has recently invaded mid-temperate zone of northern China, threating large areas of coniferous forests. Herein, we evaluated the physiological and molecular basis of cold tolerance in pinewood nematode isolates from different temperature zones of China. After exposure to -5 degrees C and -10 degrees C, the survival rates of five pinewood nematode isolates from different temperature zones were 93.94%-94.77% and 43.26%-45.58% after 8 h, and 93.04%-94.85% and 9.93%-10.56% after 24 h, without significant differences among isolates. In a comparison of an isolate from a mid-temperate zone and an isolate from a subtropical zone under gradient cooling, the survival rates remained steady at nearly 95% when minimum temperature ranged from -5 degrees C to -15 degrees C, with no significant difference between isolates. In addition, phylogenetic and population structure analyses based on whole genome resequencing data suggested that isolates from mid-temperate and warm temperate zones are clustered with different isolates from subtropical zone, with no obvious geographic pattern. We did not detect significant variation in cold tolerance ability and selected gene among pinewood nematode isolates from different temperature zones. The recently invaded pinewood nematodes in the mid-temperate zone of northern China may spread by multiple invasion events from southern China, without adaptive revolution. Our research implies that it is important to reinforce quarantine inspection to control the rapid spread of pinewood nematode.

AB  - Species are typically comprised of a large number of genotypes, some of which are rare. Rare genotypes that are temperature-sensitive will predictably be impacted by climate change more profoundly than common genotypes for which gene expression does not depend on temperature. Computer simulations were used in this study to analyze the impact of changing temperatures on a very rare melanic morph that expresses a temperature-sensitive phenotype and is found in an abundant fish species (Gambusia holbrooki). This numerical model assesses the frequency of the two natural color morphs, silver and black-spotted, over time and iterates in each generation, incorporating survival estimates for different life stages based upon data collected during empirical experiments. Using the current projections for mean surface temperature increase, which are 2.5 degrees F to 10.4 degrees F by the year 2100, the impact of warming environment on the mosquitofish population was analyzed. Three different climate warming scenarios were used to address annual temperature fluctuations and incorporate predicted temperature rise at correspondingly minimal, mid, and maximum levels. Our results indicate that increasing temperatures will seriously affect the rare color morph and in some cases will result in extinction. The minimal climate-warming scenario produced lower extinction risks for the rare morph; however, it still decreased the frequency of the rare genotype to minimal values. The mid-range warming scenario produced a higher risk of extinction, while the maximum warming scenario resulted in the extinction of the rare color morph. The results of this study shed light on the possibility that the effects of climate change may have important ramifications for rare genotypes in nature and will likely drive some rare species genotypes to extinction.

AB  - This paper highlights and expands on the extensive work concerning extreme heat events, and the environmental and societal factors that affect human health. Selections of this work were presented originally in a Union of Concerned Scientists public report (Heat in the Heartland'). As humans respond concomitantly to a suite of meteorological variables, we accordingly aim to examine summertime frequencies and characteristics of select synoptic weather types in the Midwestern United States, particularly those associated with elevated health impacts risk. We analyse five major urban centres, paired with five nearby smaller cities, to investigate the potential relative differences due to urban form and size. In virtually all of these locales, the frequency of health-debilitating hot weather types has increased in the six most recent decades, with many of these also demonstrating statistically significant upward trends in air and dew point temperatures. This is most prevalent for overnight temperatures, where the hottest weather types display increasing overnight temperatures in both large and small cities, thus causing the diurnal temperature ranges to decrease. Furthermore, the prevalence of three or more consecutive runs of these days is on the rise, with all five large cities experiencing a higher number of heat waves today than in the late 1940s. We emphasize the importance of city-level efforts to assist in minimizing future climate-related health risks. Finally, we demonstrate the increasing human mortality response in one select city (Detroit, MI), which is estimated without the presence of city-level efforts, targeted interventions, adaptation strategies, or physiological acclimatization. This highlights the importance of providing accurate heat-health warnings to the public, and provides essential understanding of the Midwest US region's summertime climate trends.

AB  - In contrast to research on heat waves, there are no studies in recent years that analyze the temporal evolution of thresh-old temperatures (Tthreshold) for extremely cold days (ECD). It is unknown whether threshold temperatures have increased more quickly than the minimum daily temperature (Tmin) in recent years. The objective of this study was to analyze the temporal evolution of the minimum daily temperature (Tmin) in a group of Spanish provinces and compare it with the evolution of threshold temperatures.An ecological, retrospective time series study was carried out using daily observations between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2018 (36 years) in 10 provinces that are representative of the different climate territories in Spain. For each representative observatory in each province, the values of Tmin were obtained for the winter months (November-March). The value of Tthreshold was determined for each province and each year, using dispersion diagrams for the pre-whitened series, with daily mortality due to natural causes displayed on the Y axis (CIEX: A00-R99) and Tmin grouped by 10 degree intervals on the X axis. To determine the temporal evolution of Tmin and Tthreshold for each province, linear models were fitted, with time as the independent variable. During the winter months, Tmin increased at an average rate of 0.2 degrees C/decade (IC95: 0.1-0.3), while Tthreshold remained practically constant during the period, at 0.1 degrees C/decade (IC95%-0.1 0.3). These values are much lower than those obtained in the case of heat, both in terms of the evolution of maximum daily temperature and that of Tthreshold.In conclusion, the fact that this trend has been maintained across time in a scenario of climate change, with a slow increase in minimum daily temperatures and constant values of Threshold, suggests a decrease in the number of ECD.

AB  - We demonstrate a method to achieve local control of 3-dimensional thermal history in a metallic alloy, which resulted in designed spatial variations in its functional response. A nickel-titanium shape memory alloy part was created with multiple shape-recovery stages activated at different temperatures using the selective laser melting technique. The multi-stage transformation originates from differences in thermal history, and thus the precipitate structure, at various locations created from controlled variations in the hatch distance within the same part. This is a first example of precision location-dependent control of thermal history in alloys beyond the surface, and utilizes additive manufacturing techniques as a tool to create materials with novel functional response that is difficult to achieve through conventional methods.

AB  - The Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawns and rears in the cold, freshwater rivers and tributaries of California's Central Valley, with four separate seasonal runs including fall and late-fall runs, a winter run, and a spring run. Dams and reservoirs have blocked access to most of the Chinook's ancestral spawning areas in the upper reaches and tributaries. Consequently, the fish rely on the mainstem of the Sacramento River for spawning habitat. Future climatic warming could lead to alterations of the river's temperature regime, which could further reduce the already fragmented Chinook habitat. Specifically, increased water temperatures could result in spawning and rearing temperature exceedences, thereby jeopardizing productivity, particularly in drought years. Paradoxically, water management plays a key role in potential adaptation options by maintaining spawning and rearing habitat now and in the future, as reservoirs such as Shasta provide a cold water supply that will be increasingly needed to counter the effects of climate change. Results suggest that the available cold pool behind Shasta could be maintained throughout the summer assuming median projections of mid-21st century warming of 2C, but the maintenance of the cold pool with warming on the order of 4C could be very challenging. The winter and spring runs are shown to be most at risk because of the timing of their reproduction.

AB  - The relative importance of size-selective mortality, density-dependent growth, and temperature on growth of a commercial fish population was investigated using an integrated statistical analysis. Two indices of size-selective mortality were determined using otolith backcalculations. One index measured the direct effect on population mean growth increments in the year of the growth increment. The second index measured the cumulative effect on the growth potential of a cohort. Indices of population density, occupied temperature, and bottom temperature were developed from annual synoptic research vessel surveys of the population. We simultaneously tested effects of these factors using a modified von Bertalanffy growth model. The strongest effect was variation in size-selective mortality, followed by a negative effect of population density and a weak positive effect of occupied temperature. Effects of bottom temperature conditions were not significant. Failure to simultaneously consider alternative mechanisms, especially size-selective mortality, can lead to incorrect conclusions about the role of environmental factors in determining growth of fishes.

AB  - Scallops are one of the most heavily traded and widely consumed seafood in the world and the vast majority of production comes from aquaculture. In 2018, the global value of scallop aquaculture was over $5.8 billion USD with farms producing nearly three times the biomass as the entirety of the wild harvest. North American (specifically U.S. and Canadian) scallop aquaculture lags far behind the rest of the world. The U.S. is home to a valuable Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fishery. Yet demand for scallops far outstrips supply and the U.S. imports an almost equal amount, by value, of farmed scallop products. To capitalize on this trade imbalance, U.S. and Canadian aquaculturists have been developing a farmed sea scallop (hereafter scallop) industry, employing the Japanese practices of suspended net culture and the sale of whole and "roe-on" products. We examined the combined effects of culture method and environment on scallop shell growth and mortality. We compiled all published net cultured scallop shell growth and mortality rates recorded in the last 45 years in the Northwest Atlantic. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we identified significant nonlinear interactions between growth, mortality, environmental conditions, and culture methods applicable from Maine, USA to Newfoundland, Canada. Optimum shell growth occurs within a temperature window of 10-15 degrees C. Growth is higher in pearl nets than in lantern nets, and is also highly sensitive to stocking density, which has large implications for farm sizes and thinning practices. Maximum mortality occurs at the highest temperatures in our dataset (similar to 17 degrees C), while stocking density is only a significant predictor of product loss at high densities. Scallops are also more susceptible to mortality at shell heights under 25 mm. Both mortality rates and shell height growth rates were lower in the late spring and early summer after accounting for temperature effects. Careful temperature based site selection and proactive low density stocking can mitigate the effects of intraspecific competition and reduce handling related mortality. Identifying lease sites that provide both optimal environmental conditions and adequate space for low density net culture will be an important step in expanding scallop aquaculture in the Northwest Atlantic.

AB  - Behavioural fever has been reported in different species of mobile ectotherms including the zebrafish, Danio redo, in response to exogenous pyrogens. In this study we report, to our knowledge for the first time, upon the ontogenic onset of behavioural fever in zebrafish (Danio redo) larvae. For this, zebrafish larvae (from first feeding to juveniles) were placed in a continuous thermal gradient providing the opportunity to select their preferred temperature. The novel thermal preference aquarium was based upon a continuous vertical column system and allows for non-invasive observation of larvae vertical distribution under isothermal (T-R at 28 degrees C) and thermal gradient conditions (T-CH: 28-32 degrees C). Larval thermal preference was assessed under both conditions with or without an immersion challenge, in order to detect the onset of the behavioural fever response. Our results defined the onset of the dsRNA induced behavioural fever at 18-20 days post fertilization (dpf). Significant differences were observed in dsRNA challenged larvae, which prefer higher temperatures (1-4 degrees C increase) throughout the experimental period as compared to non-challenged larvae. In parallel we measured the abundance of antiviral transcripts; viperin, gig2, irf7, trim25 and Mxb mRNAs in dsRNA challenged larvae under both thermal regimes: T-R and T-Ch. Significant increases in the abundance of all measured transcripts were recorded under thermal choice conditions signifying that thereto-coupling and the resultant enhancement of the immune response to dsRNA challenge occurs from 18 dpf onwards in the zebrafish. The results are of importance as they identify a key developmental stage where the neuro-immune interface matures in the zebrafish likely providing increased resistance to viral infection.

AB  - Hyptis suaveolens is an exotic plant that has become established in Nigeria because it is grows vigorously and produces allelochemicals that adversely affect the growth of adjacent plants. In this study, we predict the distribution of Hyptis suaveolens in Nigeria using a Maximum Entropy modelling approach. Pearson correlations were used to select five bioclimatic variables to which type of soil and altitude were added to give a total of seven environmental variables that were then included in the MaxEnt model. This model predicts that Hyptis suaveolens can colonize 25%, 45% and 25% of the total land area in FCT, Nasarawa and the River States in Nigeria. In addition, Hyptis suaveolens in Nigeria grows mainly in sandy clay and sandy loam soils. Bioclimatic conditions most suitable for this species include temperatures between 26-30 degrees C, 9-10 hour photoperiod, low altitudes of around 200-800 m and rainfall within the range of 200-800mm. The MaxEnt model indicates that Hyptis suaveolens is currently a threat to the survival of native species of plants in the North Central part of Nigeria. The MaxEnt model further reveals that because of its high adaptability and tolerance of changes in abiotic factors, Hyptis suaveolens is likely to invade a new environment, the humid forest zone in Nigeria. As this species can become very abundant, we recommend that its spread is monitored and controlled, particularly in areas of high suitability.

AB  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are flexible tools which are being used increasingly to predict and forecast water resources variables. The human activities in areas surrounding enclosed and semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea always produce in the long term a strong environmental impact in the form of coastal and marine degradation. The presence of dissolved oxygen is essential for the survival of most organisms in the water bodies. This paper is concerned with the use of ANNs - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function neural networks for predicting the next fortnight's dissolved oxygen concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea water along Gaza. MLP and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks are trained and developed with reference to five important oceanographic variables including water temperature, wind velocity, turbidity, pH and conductivity. These variables are considered as inputs of the network. The data sets used in this study consist of four years and collected from nine locations along Gaza coast. The network performance has been tested with different data sets and the results show satisfactory performance. Prediction results prove that neural network approach has good adaptability and extensive applicability for modelling the dissolved oxygen in the Mediterranean Sea along Gaza. We hope that the established model will help in assisting the local authorities in developing plans and policies to reduce the pollution along Gaza coastal waters to acceptable levels.

AB  - Chromium contamination has been an increasing threat to the environment and to human health. Cr(VI) and Cr(III) are the most common states of chromium. However, compared with Cr(III), Cr(VI) is more toxic and more easily absorbed, therefore, it is more harmful to human beings. Thus, the conversion of toxic Cr(VI) into Cr(III) is an accepted strategy for chromium detoxification. Here, we isolated two Bacillus cereus strains with a high chromium tolerance and reduction ability, named B. cereus D and 332, respectively. Both strains demonstrated a strong pH and temperature adaptability and survival under 8 mM Cr(VI). B. cereus D achieved 87.8% Cr(VI) removal in 24 h with an initial 2 mM Cr(VI). Cu(II) was found to increase the removal rate of Cr(VI) significantly. With the addition of 0.4 mM Cu(II), 99.9% of Cr(VI) in the culture was removed by B. cereus 332 in 24 h. This is the highest removal efficiency in the literature that we have seen to date. The immobilization experiments found that sodium alginate with diatomite was the better method for immobilization and B. cereus 332 was more efficient in immobilized cells. Our research provided valuable information and new, highly effective strains for the bioremediation of chromium pollution.

AB  - 1. We examined the transmission biology of Plasmodium mexicanum, a parasite of the fence lizard Sceloporus occidentalis, and its vector, the sandfly Lutzomyia vexator. Female L. vexator produced a dutch of eggs after each blood meal taken from a lizard. Mortality was high after oviposition, so few sandflies were likely to take two blood meals and almost none took three. Therefore, to maximize its transmission success, the parasite must complete development in its insect host before the vector lays its eggs and takes another blood meal.
   2. Between 16 degrees C and 32 degrees C, temperature did not affect the longevity of female sandflies, but did affect the rate of parasite development in the insect, the rate of maturation of sandflies' eggs, and the probability of sandflies becoming infected.
   3. The above relationships with temperature were non-linear and differed in shape among the variables such that an increase in temperature between 22 degrees C and 32 degrees C benefited the parasite by shortening its development while not reducing the time until the sandfly's next blood meal.
   4. We measured the temperatures available to the vectors in nature (burrows of ground squirrels). Within this range, there was a window that allowed successful transmission of the parasite (based on laboratory studies).
   5. In a thermal gradient, unfed female sandflies selected mean temperatures approximately 4 degrees C below the minimum required for transmission. After a blood meal from a non-infected lizard, the insect's mean preferred temperature increased 1.6 degrees C, presumably to aid digestion, and ifa blood meal was taken from an infected lizard mean preferred body temperature increased by 3.6 degrees C.
   6. Compared with 10 other Plasmodium species, P. mexicanum has a very rapid rate of development in its vector.
   7. The results suggest P. mexicanum enhances its transmission success through a combination of rapid development in the insect host and manipulation of the vector's thermoregulatory behaviour.

AB  - Among all proxy archives, tree rings are highly promising indicator of ecological and environmental processes due to their high climatic sensitivity, better annual resolution, and large spatial coverage. Seasonal importance of soil moisture dynamics and impact of drought events on tree growth development and carbon sequestration potential in tropical moist forests was assessed using the teak tree ring width index and instrumental climate data from Aizawl, Mizoram. Present analysis suggests that soil moisture during months of the early growing season with low precipitation is crucial for determining the growth of teak trees in the Northeast region of India. Results of the present study reflected the impact of remote atmospheric climate regulation modes such as El Nin similar to oSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Sea surface temperature (SST) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) on site climate. Results indicate that the increasing moisture stresses in the region may cause the survival risk for the other forest vegetation having low adaptability to climate change stresses with the inability to make niche shifts. Increasing the number of tree ring studies linked with eco-physiological parameters of tree growth is recommended to better visualize the level of stresses on the trees in the moist tropical forests. This information will be useful in developing better management plans for biodiversity conservation in the tropical region.

AB  - Understanding pest evolution in agricultural systems is crucial for developing effective and innovative pest control strategies. Types of cultivation, such as crop mono-cultures versus polycultures or crop rotation, may act as a selective pressure on pests' capability to exploit the host's resources. In this study, we examined the herbivorous mite Aceria tosichella (commonly known as wheat curl mite), a widespread wheat pest, to understand how fluctuating versus stable environments influence its niche breadth and ability to utilize different host plant species. We subjected a wheat-bred mite population to replicated experimental evolution in a single-host environment (either wheat or barley), or in an alternation between these two plant species every three mite generations. Next, we tested the fitness of these evolving populations on wheat, barley, and on two other plant species not encountered during experimental evolution, namely rye and smooth brome. Our results revealed that the niche breadth of A. tosichella evolved in response to the level of environmental variability. The fluctuating environment expanded the niche breadth by increasing the mite's ability to utilize different plant species, including novel ones. Such an environment may thus promote flexible host-use generalist phenotypes. However, the niche expansion resulted in some costs expressed as reduced performances on both wheat and barley as compared to specialists. Stable host environments led to specialized phenotypes. The population that evolved in a constant environment consisting of barley increased its fitness on barley without the cost of utilizing wheat. However, the population evolving on wheat did not significantly increase its fitness on wheat, but decreased its performance on barley. Altogether, our results indicated that, depending on the degree of environmental heterogeneity, agricultural systems create different conditions that influence pests' niche breadth evolution, which may in turn affect the ability of pests to persist in such systems.

AB  - Stress in psychology and biology is defined as any pressure that elicits a response from an organism. Whether cells encounter stresses; the response can be very different from their environment, duration and type of stresses as well as kind of cell. Living organisms can respond to stresses by various mechanisms. There are often interactions between disparate responses that finally determine the destiny of the cell under stress from activating survival paths to starting damaged cell elimination progress. The most crucial roles in responding to stress are played by Signal Transduction Systems. Three domains of lives respond to different stresses and/or stressors include; DNA damage, the unfolded protein, mitochondria' signaling stress, proliferation or elimination of damaged cells responses.
   In general, there are levels for defending against stressors (1) plasma membrane and cell wall, (2) cytosolic and molecular adaptability such as salt-in, salt-out and Compatible solutes strategies and (3) finally gene regulation.
   In this review we are going to discuss stress in four aspects: (I) Principles of stress, (II) fundamental mechanisms of the stress response and (III) the relationship between response to stresses and defense mechanisms in three areas of life and (Iv) at the end using stress responses to ameliorate diseases and other applications.

AB  - Effective parasitoid production or mass-rearing is one of the key components in practicing biological control with parasitoids. Selection of host species for rearing parasitoids is a major approach to improve the production efficiency. The stone leek leafminer Liriomyza chinensis (Kato) is a destructive pest of onion crops in many Asian countries, which is difficult to control with chemicals. The present study examined whether the production of Neochrysocharis okazakii Kamijo, a promising native biological agent of L. chinensis, could be effective if kidney bean-Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) system was used as an alternative rearing procedure. The suitability of L. chinensis and L. trifolii as hosts of N. okazakii was investigated in the laboratory. Neochrysocharis okazakii completed its development on both two host species, and the total development time was similar on these hosts. Longevity of N. okazakii females provided with L. chinensis was longer than those on L. trifolii. There were no significant differences in fecundity and offspring sex ratio when females had been provided with these two host species. The adult parasitoids emerged from L. chinensis were significantly larger than those from L. trifolii. However, the intrinsic rate of increase was higher, and mean generation time was lower, for L. trifolii than L. chinensis. Thus, mean net reproductive rate (Ro) was higher when L. trifolii was used as host. Although the two host species were equally suitable as host for N. okazakii, our findings suggested that L. trifolii and kidney bean is an ideal system for N. okazakii production.

AB  - Annealing of flat cold rolled steel sheets is one of the critical operations, which significantly influences the final product quality and overall productivity of cold rolling mills. An integrated process model, with the capability of predicting spatial and temporal evolution of temperature, microstructure and mechanical properties in cold rolled coils during batch annealing, has been developed. The model is based on fundamental principles of heat transfer, microstructural evolution kinetics and microstructure-property correlation, The parameters for heat transfer are based on in plant experimentation, whereas the coefficients for microstructural kinetics and structure-property correlation were obtained from laboratory studies. The prediction capability of the model has been extensively validated through data collected from industrial operations. Details of the model formulation, its validation with the plant data and possible uses of such an integrated model are presented.

AB  - Background: Predicting effects of rapid climate change on populations depends on measuring the effects of climate stressors on performance, and potential for adaptation. Adaptation to stressful climatic conditions requires heritable genetic variance for stress tolerance present in populations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We quantified genetic variation in tolerance of early development of the ecologically important sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii to near-future (2100) ocean conditions projected for the southeast Australian global change hot spot. Multiple dam-sire crosses were used to quantify the interactive effects of warming (+2-4 degrees C) and acidification (-0.3-0.5 pH units) across twenty-seven family lines. Acidification, but not temperature, decreased the percentage of cleavage stage embryos. In contrast, temperature, but not acidification decreased the percentage of gastrulation. Cleavage success in response to both stressors was strongly affected by sire identity. Sire and dam identity significantly affected gastrulation and both interacted with temperature to determine developmental success. Positive genetic correlations for gastrulation indicated that genotypes that did well at lower pH also did well in higher temperatures.
   Conclusions/Significance: Significant genotype (sire) by environment interactions for both stressors at gastrulation indicated the presence of heritable variation in thermal tolerance and the ability of embryos to respond to changing environments. The significant influence of dam may be due to maternal provisioning (maternal genotype or environment) and/or offspring genotype. It appears that early development in this ecologically important sea urchin is not constrained in adapting to the multiple stressors of ocean warming and acidification. The presence of tolerant genotypes indicates the potential to adapt to concurrent warming and acidification, contributing to the resilience of C. rodgersii in a changing ocean.

AB  - We studied the effects of six constant temperatures (7.2, 10.0, 15.5, 21.1, 26.6, and 29.4-degrees-C) on developmental rates and developmental times in four parasites of Diuraphis noxia (Mordwilko) (Homoptera:Aphididae): Aphelinus asychis Walker from Chile, A. asychis W. from France, Aphidius matricariae Haliday from Iraq, and Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) from Pakistan. Differences were not detected in developmental time between sexes in D. rapae at any of the temperatures tested. Males developed faster than females in A. matricariae at 10 and 21.1-degrees-C, A. asychis Chile at 15.5 and 29.4-degrees-C, and A. asychis France at 10, 15.5, and 21.1-degrees-C (P < 0.05). Developmental thresholds (t), and times-to-adult in degree-days (K) of the four parasites are: 7.1-degrees-C and 248.8 for A. asychis Chile, 6.4-degrees-C and 246.7 for A. asychis France, 1.4-degrees-C and 311.4 for A. matricariae, and 2.1-degrees-C and 293.4 for D. rapae, respectively. Based on the predicted accumulation of degree-days and number of generations per year for the four parasites at three climatically distinct localities in California, we concluded that the parasite with the lowest developmental threshold (A. matricariae) may complete ca. 4.5, 3.6, and 2.1 more generations than the parasite with the highest developmental threshold (A. asychis from Chile) at the coldest, intermediate, and warmest localities, respectively. It was suggested that parasites with lower developmental thresholds, despite their generally greater time-to-adult, will have greater population densities following the winter season than parasites with higher developmental thresholds, they may appear earlier and thus have greater potential as effective biological control agents especially in annual crops such as small grains. When attempting to introduce parasites for biological control of a target host the developmental thresholds of both the parasite and the host should be considered in conjunction with other attributes such as searching efficiency, fecundity, host preference, and others.

AB  - We have studied seasonal and diurnal fluctuations of water temperature in bamboo stumps and the effect of temperature on the energy metabolism of arboreal, oophagous tadpoles of Chirixalus eiffingeri. We collected tadpoles (Gosner stage 28-29) in February and August from Chitou, Taiwan and acclimated them to 12 and 22 degreesC. Using a closed system, we measured tadpole oxygen consumption ((V)over dot O-2) at 12, 17 and 22 degreesC. The water temperature was lowest in February (11-13 degreesC), increased rapidly during March and April and was highest from May to August (20-24 degreesC). Diel fluctuations in the temperature of the pools of water in bamboo stumps mirrored fluctuations in air temperature. Tadpoles collected in February and August exhibited metabolic compensation in that tadpoles acclimated at 12 degreesC had significantly higher lie, than those acclimated at 22 degreesC. There are at least two possible explanations for the presence of metabolic compensation in C. eiffingeri tadpoles. Firstly, the larval period of C. eiffingeri ranges from 40 to 78 days, a tadpole could experience relatively large fluctuations in body temperature (up to 10 degreesC) during the development. As a result, C. eiffingeri tadpoles most likely evolved metabolic compensation to maintain activity levels under different thermal environments. Secondly, because arboreal pools are small, thermally unstratified, aquatic microhabitats, tadpoles are unable to behaviorally select preferred temperatures. As a result, metabolic compensation allows tadpoles to regulate their physiological functions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The thermal environment during development influences many aspects of the phenotype of hatchling reptiles. We hypothesized that temperature should differentially affect early incubation stages, in which differentiation dominates over growth, and late incubation stages, characterized by high growth rates. To test this idea, we incubated eggs of wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) under three regimes with the same mean temperature (29 degrees C), one constant and two variable with opposite sequences: first cold (25 degrees C) and then hot (32 degrees C), and vice versa. Hatchlings incubated at high temperature during the initial period had shorter hindlimbs and tails than those incubated under the other two temperature regimes and shorter heads than those incubated initially at low temperature. Thus, temperature experienced by embryos during the early external incubation period produced similar phenotypic responses compared to those reported in previous studies for the same constant temperature applied over the whole incubation period. Because female wall lizards select lower body temperatures during pregnancy, an increase of intrauterine retention would extend the time of exposure of developing embryos to suitable temperatures. Diminution of body temperature during pregnancy is contrary to the expected pattern under the hypothesis that egg retention has evolved to accelerate development, as proposed by the cold-climate model for evolution of viviparity in squamates, and the results of the present study support the alternative hypothesis of developmental optimization as a special case of the broader maternal manipulation view.

AB  - Cold tolerant polar terrestrial arthropods have evolved a range of survival strategies which enable them to survive the most extreme environmental conditions (cold and drought) they are likely to encounter. Some species are classified as being freeze tolerant but the majority of those found in the Antarctic survive sub-zero temperatures by avoiding freezing by supercooling. For many arthropods, not just polar species, survival of desiccating conditions is equally important to survival of low temperatures. At sub-zero temperatures freeze avoiding arthropods are susceptible to desiccation and may lose water due to a vapour diffusion gradient between their supercooled body fluids and ice in their surroundings. This process ceases once the body fluids are frozen and so is not a problem for freeze tolerant species. This paper compares five polar arthropods, which have evolved different low temperature survival strategies, and the effects of exposure to sub-zero temperatures on their supercooling points (SCP) and water contents. The Antarctic oribatid mite (Alaskozetes antarcticus) reduced its supercooling point temperature from -6 to -30 degreesC, when exposed to decreasing sub-zero temperatures (cooled from 5 to -10 degreesC over 42 days) with little loss of body water during that period. However, Cryptopygus antarcticus, a springtail which occupies similar habitats in the Antarctic, showed a decrease in both water content and supercooling ability when exposed to the same experimental protocol. Both these Antarctic arthropods have evolved a freeze avoiding survival strategy. The Arctic springtail (Onychiurus arcticus), which is also freeze avoiding, dehydrated (from 2.4 to 0.7 g water g(-1) dry weight) at sub-zero temperatures and its SCP was lowered from c. -3 to below - 15 degreesC in direct response to temperature (5 to -5.5 degreesC). In contrast, the freeze tolerant larvae of an Arctic fly (Heleomyza borealis) froze at c. -7 degreesC with little change in water content or SCP during further cold exposure and survived frozen to -60 degreesC. The partially freeze tolerant sub-Antarctic beetle Hydromedion sparsutum froze at c. -2 degreesC and is known to survive frozen to -8 degreesC. During the subzero temperature treatment, its water content reduced until it froze and then remained constant. The survival strategies of such freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding arthropods are discussed in relation to desiccation at sub-zero temperatures and the evolution of strategies of cold tolerance.

AB  - In recent years, one of the key postulates in the European Union's policy has become the development of renewable energy sources. In order to achieve the desired synergy effect, the idea of combining two selected sources of energy appeared. This article presents a technical and economic analysis of a hybrid connection of a ground source heat pump with a photovoltaic installation. Taking into account the heat demand of the building, a ground heat pump with a catalog nominal heating power of 25 kW was selected. This article presents the problem of the economic profitability of using a hybrid combination of a heat pump and photovoltaic panels in domestic hot water and central heating systems. The justification for the use of such heat sources in these installations is due to global trends and the gradual departure from conventional energy sources such as oil or gas boilers. This paper presents the economic and ecological results of using the pump heat connected together with photovoltaic panels. In the economic analysis, with the assumed installation costs related to the use of the considered heat pump and PV, two parameters commonly used in the investment analysis (static and dynamic) were used, namely, the simple payback period and the net present value of the investment. For the adopted assumptions, the usable area of the facility and the number of years of use were indicated, at which the investment in question is competitive with other alternative investment interest methods and will start to bring tangible benefits. The performed analysis also has measurable environmental benefits in the form of a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions at the level of 2893 kg/year into the atmosphere. The presented solution will help future investors understand the investment profitability mechanism for their households.

AB  - Understanding how entomopathogenic nematodes respond to temperature changes and have adapted to the local environment is crucial to improve their potential as biocontrol agents. In order to improve understanding of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora's potential adaptability to future climate changes, full-length cDNA and the corresponding gene of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) were isolated and fully characterized. The reproductive potential of the Apulian strain of H. bacteriophora increased when the temperature rose from 23 to 30 degrees C, but no reproduction was found at 12 degrees C. Expression analyses revealed that Hb-hsp90-1 was differentially expressed in Infective Juveniles (IJs) and adults (hermaphrodites, females and males). Up-regulation of Hb-hsp90-1 was higher during the recovery process in Galleria mellonella larvae than adults, thus confirming the protective role of Hb-hsp90-1 in coping with the host environment. Silencing of Hb-hsp90-1 resulted in a significant reduction (76%) in the expression level. Silenced IJs took longer than untreated nematodes to infect G. mellonella, showing that Hb-hsp90-1 could be also involved in chemosensation. Furthermore, the number of adults and IJs recovered from G. mellonella infected with silenced nematodes and incubated at 30 degrees C was higher than that obtained from G. mellonella infected with untreated nematodes. These data confirm the crucial role of Hb-hsp90-1 allowing acclimation to increased temperatures and modulation of the recovery process.

AB  - Hypoxia is a major stressor in coastal ecosystems, yet generalizing its impacts on fish and shellfish populations across hypoxic events is difficult due to variability among individuals in their history of exposure to hypoxia and related abiotic variables, and subsequent behavioral and survival responses. Although aquatic animals have diverse physiological responses to cope with hypoxia, we know little about how inter-individual variation in physiological state affects survival and behavioral decisions under hypoxic conditions. Laboratory experiments coupled with molecular techniques determined how extrinsic factors (e.g., water body and temperature) and respiratory physiology (hemocyanin concentration and structure) affected survival and behavior of adult blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) exposed to different levels of hypoxia over a 30-h time period. Nearly 100% of crabs survived the 1.3 mg dissolved oxygen (DO) l(-1) treatment (18.4% air saturation), suggesting that adult blue crabs are tolerant of severe hypoxia. Probability of survival decreased with increasing hypoxic exposure time, lower DO, and increasing temperature. Individual-level differences in survival correlated with water body and crab size. Crabs collected from the oligo/mesohaline and hypoxic Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA survived hypoxic exposures longer than crabs from the euhaline and normoxic Bogue and Back Sounds, North Carolina. Furthermore, small NRE crabs survived longer than large NRE crabs. Hemocyanin (Hcy) concentration did not explain these individual-level differences, however, hypoxia-tolerant crabs had Hcy structures indicative of a high-O(2)-affinity form of Hcy, suggesting Hcy "quality" (i.e., structure) may be more important for hypoxia survival than Hcy "quantity" (i.e., concentration). The geographic differences in survival we observed also highlight the importance of carefully selecting experimental animals when planning to extrapolate results to the population level.

AB  - Tc-99m-SnF2 colloid (Radpharm LLK) leucocyte labelling agent is used in whole blood, exploiting phagocytosis. The objectives of this work were to optimize leucocyte labelling in leucocyte-enriched plasma, and to investigate: (i) the effect of temperature and other factors on labelling efficiency; (ii) the selectivity for different leucocyte types; (iii) the viability of the labelled cells and efflux of the radiolabel; and (iv) the physical characteristics of the colloid. Density gradient centrifugation was used to investigate the labelling efficiency, cell selectivity and efflux, Trypan blue to study the viability, and laser scattering, electron microscopy and membrane filtration to investigate particle size and morphology. Particles appeared as loose, coiled, chain-like aggregates of much smaller particles (<0.05 mu m). The aggregate diameter ranged from < 0.1 to > 5 mum and increased with time. The distribution of radioactivity amongst the particle sizes varied widely. The labelling efficiency in leucocyte-rich plasma was enhanced at 37degreesC compared to room temperature, and by centrifuging during labelling. The selectivity for different leucocyte types varied markedly between batches and blood samples, in some cases showing preference for mononuclear cells and in others for granulocytes. Viability was excellent and comparable with Tc-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (Tc-99m-HMPAO)-labelled cells. A significant fraction of radiolabel, comparable to that observed with Tc-99m-HMPAO, was lost from leucocytes during incubation in vitro over 4 h. Thus, Tc-99m-SnF2 is a convenient, efficient labelling agent for leucocytes, but shows variable cell selectivity which may be linked to particle size variability, and there is significant efflux of radioactivity from labelled cells.

AB  - Complex systems, in many different scientific sectors, show coarse-grain properties with simple growth laws with respect to fundamental microscopic algorithms. The known classification schemes of the growth laws refer to time evolution of biological and technical systems. We propose to apply the previous classifications to phenomenological analysis of thermal systems with a cross-fertilization among different sectors. As an example, the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the electrical activation in implanted silicon carbide are discussed.

AB  - Self-righting, the capacity of an animal to self-turn after falling on its back, is a fitness-related trait. Delayed self-righting can result in loss of mating opportunities or death. Traits involved in self-righting may therefore be under selection. Galapagos giant tortoises have two main shell morphologies saddleback and domed - that have been proposed to be adaptive. The more sloped shape on the sides of the shell and the longer extension of neck and legs of the saddlebacks could have evolved to optimize self-righting. The drier environments with more uneven surfaces where the saddleback tortoises occur increases their risk to fall on their back while walking. The ability to fast overturn could reduce the danger of dying. To test this hypothesis, we used 3D shell reconstructions of 89 Galapagos giant tortoises from three domed and two saddleback species to compare self-righting potential of the two shell morphotypes. Our results indicate that saddleback shells require higher energy input to self-right than domed ones. This suggests that several traits associated with the saddleback shell morphology could have evolved to facilitate self-righting. Studying the functional performances of fitness-related traits, as in this work, could provide important insight into the adaptive value of traits.

AB  - As 2D materials are aggressively penetrating the arena of conventional metal oxides-based gas sensors, tungsten disulfide (WS2) as a 'beyond graphene and beyond MoS2 layered material' is appearing with shining visibility owing to its exquisite electronic, surface, optical, physicochemical and thermal properties. Micromechanically exfoliated or homogeneously/heterogeneously synthesized mono/few-layer(s) of this transition metal di-chalcogenide (TMDCs), with excellent tunability of almost all the properties, have intrigued worldwide gas sensor researchers to demonstrate various device configurations using WS2 leading to ultrahigh sensitivity with ppb level detection capacity even at room temperature. This review article presents a holistic overview of the WS2 based gas sensors encompassing the impact(s) of the different device architectures (viz. planar, Schottky, heterojunctions, field-effect, and heterojunction bipolar transistors) on the gas sensing performance indices (like sensitivity, selectivity, response/recovery time, humidity effect and baseline drift). Starting with the brief overview of the sensing mechanism of WS2, followed by elaborate discussions on the unique features/advantages and bottlenecks of each of the innovative device architecture investigated, this review concludes by focusing the possible direction to circumvent the most common challenges (like slow and incomplete recovery, vulnerability to humidity and oxidation), that slacken the commercial viability of such devices.

AB  - Tracks produced by swift heavy ions in ceramics are of interest for fundamental science as well as for applications covering different fields such as nanotechnology or fission-track dating of minerals. In the case of pyrochlores with general formula A(2)B(2)O(7), the track structure and radiation sensitivity show a clear dependence on the composition. Ion irradiated Gd2Zr2O7, e.g., retains its crystallinity while amorphous tracks are produced in Gd2Ti2O7. Tracks in Ti-containing compositions have a complex morphology consisting of an amorphous core surrounded by a shell of a disordered, defect-fluorite phase. The size of the amorphous core decreases with decreasing energy loss and with increasing Zr content, while the shell thickness seems to be similar over a wide range of energy loss values. The large data set and the complex track structure has made pyrochlore an interesting model system for a general theoretical description of track formation including thermal spike calculations (providing the spatial and temporal evolution of temperature around the ion trajectory) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (describing the response of the atomic system). Recent MD advances consider the sudden temperature increase by inserting data from the thermal spike. The combination allows the reproduction of the core-shell track characteristic and sheds light on the early stages of track formation including recrystallization of the molten material produced by the thermal spike.

AB  - In order to help the forging enterprise realize energy conservation and emission reduction, the scheduling problem of furnace heating was improved in this paper. Aiming at the charging problem of continuous heating furnace, a multi-objective furnace charging model with minimum capacity difference and waiting time was established in this paper. An improved strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) algorithm was designed to solve this problem. The original fitness assignment strategy, crossover operator and population selection mechanism of SPEA2 are replaced with DOPGA (Domination Power of an Individual Genetic Algorithm), adaptive cross operator, and elitist strategy. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the improved SPEA2 was verified by actual arithmetic example. The comparison of results gained from three methods shows the superiority of the improved SPEA2 in solving this problem. Compared with strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) and SPEA2, the improved SPEA2 can get a better solution without increasing time complexity, the heating time is reduced by total 93 min, and can save 7533GJ energy. The research in this paper can help the forging enterprise improve furnace utilization, reduce heating time and unnecessary heating preservation time, as well as achieve sustainable energy savings and emissions reduction.

AB  - In educational buildings, an efficient daylight design has significant influences on student's visual comfort, well-being and productivity while it offers significant benefits for reducing lighting energy consumption. Besides visual discomfort, the excess of daylight entry to space will cause disadvantages, including building overheat. Therefore, it is essential to define the optimal design for daylight control devices. In previous studies, daylight performance of light-shelf as a window-attached daylight control device has been studied. This paper aims to investigate the effect of sky cloudiness on the optimum light-shelf properties defined for typical classrooms. In addition, the optimum properties of the light shelf for classrooms in two cities have been defined, which had not been addressed in Iran's national codes and guidelines. The methodology used is based on three steps: daylight optimization of light shelf parameters, thermal comfort analysis for selected solutions, and choosing the best option. Four parameters of light-shelf, including height, length of the exterior part, length, and angle of inner part, have been considered as variables. Using Octopus optimization algorithm in Rhinoceros, Grasshopper simulation tool, a multi-objective algorithm has been applied to find the optimum combination of the parameters based on daylight performance indicators. Thermal comfort analysis has been conducted for selected solutions with optimized light shelves using Openstudio. The results indicated that applying light-shelf in Tehran with less sky cloudiness is more effective than Sari in terms of providing both daylight and thermal comfort, especially for cases with more window to wall ratio (WWR). Sari, the case with lower WWR, does not necessarily have less Annual Solar Exposure, even with an optimized light-shelf. Hence choosing the best option without comparing daylight metrics for optimized solutions of various WWR is misleading. According to the results, although the best options are different in the cities as the effect of sky cloud cover, the optimum light-shelf properties are the same in light-shelf height, exterior, and interior length, while the pivot angles vary. There is also a relation between rotation angle and daylight availability regarding WWR in each city. Considering daylight and comfort issues, WWR for the best option in Tehran is greater than Sari. The study results provide useful information for designers for choosing the optimal properties of light shelves and the best option for design in the two mentioned cities. @ 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, Sinervo et al. (2010, Science, 328: 894-899) reported declines of lizard biodiversity due to local warming trends and altered thermal niches. Herein, we applied the Sinervo et al. (2010) physiological model to predict the local extinction risk of three species of lizard from Patagonia. Whereas the previous model used a single equation (for the extinctions of Blue Spiny Lizard (Sceloporus serrifer Cope, 1866) in the Yucatan Peninsula) relating environmental temperatures (T-e) to hours of restriction (i. e., the period when lizards are forced into retreat sites because environmental temperatures are too high), we measured habitat-specific equations for the T-e values of each species. We analyzed the vulnerability of Darwin's Ground Gecko (Homonota darwinii Boulenger, 1885), Bariloche Lizard (Liolaemus pictus (Dumeril and Bibron, 1837)), and Mountain Slope Lizard (Liolaemus elongatus Koslowsky, 1896) to climate change considering thermal physiological constraints on activity during the reproductive period. While Sinervo et al. (2010) predicted that the Phyllodactylidae family will not suffer from impacts of climate change, our physiological model predicted that 20% of the H. darwinii populations could become extinct by 2080. The physiological model also predicted that 15% of L. pictus populations and 26.5% of L. elongatus populations could become extinct by 2080. The most vulnerable populations are those located near the northern and eastern boundaries of their distributions.

AB  - The continued existence of Plasmodium parasites in physiologically distinct environments during their transmission in mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts requires effector proteins encoded by parasite genes to provide adaptability. Parasites utilize their robust stress response system involving heat shock proteins for their survival. Molecular chaperones are involved in maintaining protein homeostasis within a cell during stress, protein biogenesis and the formation of protein complexes. Due to their critical role in parasite virulence, they are considered targets for therapeutic interventions. Our results identified a putative P. berghei heat shock protein (HSP) belonging to the HSP40 family (HspJ62), which is abundantly induced upon heat stress and expressed during all parasite stages. To determine the role HspJ62, a gene-disrupted P. berghei transgenic line was developed (Delta HspJ62), which resulted in disruption of gametocyte formation. Such parasites were unable to form subsequent sexual stages because of disrupted gametogenesis, indicating the essential role of HspJ62 in gametocyte formation. Transcriptomic analysis of the transgenic line showed downregulation of a number of genes, most of which were specific to male or female gametocytes. The transcription factor ApiAP2 was also downregulated in Delta HspJ62 parasites. Our findings suggest that the downregulation of ApiAP2 likely disrupts the transcriptional regulation of sexual stage genes, leading to impaired gametogenesis. This finding also highlights the critical role that HspJ62 indirectly plays in the development of P. berghei sexual stages and in facilitating the conversion from the asexual blood stage to the sexual stage. This study characterizes the HspJ62 protein as a fertility factor because parasites lacking it are unable to transmit to mosquitoes. This study adds an important contribution to ongoing research aimed at understanding gametocyte differentiation and formation in parasites. The molecule adds to the list of potential drug targets that can be targeted to inhibit parasite sexual development and consequently parasite transmission.

AB  - I combined data from the taxonomy, phylogeny, functional morphology, biogeography, and fossil record of gastropods to probe the origins, distribution, and fates of predatory gastropod clades characterized by the presence of a labral tooth, a downwardly projecting tooth or spine formed at the edge of the outer lip of the shell. A labral tooth occurs in at least 608 species, of which 251 are Recent. Studies of the type and position of the labral tooth, along with other characters, indicate that the labral tooth has evolved independently at least 58 times, beginning in the Campanian epoch of the late Cretaceous. The labral tooth plays a more or less active part in predation on relatively large prey animals that are protected by a hard skeleton. In the Recent fauna, tooth-bearing species are overwhelmingly warm-temperate to tropical in distribution (240 of 251 species; 96%. Within Muricidae (excluding Coralliophilinae), however, there is no discernible latitudinal gradient in the number of tooth-bearing species relative to total regional diversity. First appearances of clades with a labral tooth are overwhelmingly concentrated in the late Oligocene to Pleistocene interval, with the largest number appearing during the early Miocene (12 clades). The temporal pattern differs significantly from that expected on the basis of the number of faunas available per time interval, and is therefore not an artifact of sampling or fossil preservation. The most consistent factor associated with, and permitting the repeated evolution of, the labral tooth is high planktonic primary productivity. Two factors may account for the link between primary productivity and the evolution of labral teeth: (1) the general economic opportunity afforded by ready availability of an access to nutrients, and (2) the greater abundance and sizes range of available suspension-feeding prey animals. Incumbency-the presence of already well-adapted species-often controls evolutionary opportunity. The complementary distributions of major tooth-bearing clades in many parts of the world point to the role of well-adapted incumbents in limiting the adaptive exploration by other clades that could in principle evolve a labral tooth. The elimination of incumbents by extinction, however, does not provide opportunities for other clades to fill the adaptive void. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Starvation resistance (SR) is an important trait for survival of insects in the wild. We used recombinant inbred lines (RIL) to search for quantitative trait loci (QTL) in crosses between intercontinental inbred lines that were originally selected for heat-knockdown resistance. SR was measured as the time of survival under repeated events of starvation. SR was consistently higher in females than in males. Composite interval mapping identified one QTL region (cytological range 64D-66E2) on the left arm of chromosome 3 in males, and no QTL was found in females. Many candidate genes that were identified in previous studies of QTL for stress resistance are included within this QTL region. The QTL-allele that decreased SR was found in the line originating from the colder population (Denmark). We discuss our results with regard to multiple candidate genes, non-colocalization with thermotolerance QTL, and possible geographical variation.

AB  - Based on low-temperature thermochronological data (i.e., apatite fission-track (AFT) and (U-Th)/He (AHe)), structural evolution, burial and thermal history, this paper examines the relationship of multi-stage evolution between the upper Ordovician Wufeng and lower Silurian Longmaxi formations (i.e., the WL formation) and rapid exhumation at the Changning shale gas field in the southern Sichuan basin. AFT ages are generally young from southeast to northwest, decreasing from ca. 40 to 15 Ma while AHe single-grain ages range from -35 to-5 Ma. Inverse thermal histories show that a multi-stage cooling history with initial cooling began in the Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic (middle Eocene), followed by accelerated rapid cooling in the late Cenozoic, with cooling rates of 2-4 degrees C/Myr across the Changning shale gas field. In particular, thermal models of samples in the western Changning area show a substantial increase in the cooling rates, i.e., from less than 1 degrees C/Myr to 3-5 degrees C/Myr in the Miocene. Integrated with inverse T-t models of low-temperature thermochronological data, the burial history indicates a four-stage thermal evolution of the WL Formation in the Changning shale-gas field: Early Mature from the middle Silurian to middle Permian, Middle Mature from the late Permian to Late Triassic, Late Mature from the Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, and Over mature since the middle Cretaceous, reaching a maximum burial depth of-6000 m and maximum temperature of 190-200 degrees C at ca. 70-80 Ma. This evolution further suggests that a normal hydrostatic pressure index dominated the WL Formations in the Paleozoic. The gas generation and pressure index, however, have substantially increased since the Late Jurassic, particularly from the Early to middle Cretaceous, with a maximum pressure index of 2.1, which is indicative of the main shale gas accumulation and enrichment period in the WL Formation. Post-gas-generation structural deformation, uplift, and exhumation had a significant impact on shale gas enrichment, mainly through their influence on shale gas preservation. This suggests some relationships among the higher pressure coefficient of the WL Formation, the higher productivity and total gas content of the WL Formation, a weaker post-gas-generation structural deformation, and a weaker uplift, as indicated by the erosion and burial depth across the Changning shale gas field. Due to a significantly stronger cooling and uplift that occurred the in Late Cenozoic across the western Changning area, the pressure index decreased rapidly from similar to 2.0 to 1.0 with a normal pressure condition, indicating the destruction of the reservation condition in the WL Formation.

AB  - Until now, Quaternary paleoecologists have regarded evolution as a slow process relative to climate change, predicting that the primary biotic response to changing climate is not adaptation, but instead (1) persistence in situ if changing climate remains within the species' tolerance limits, (2) range shifts (migration) to regions where climate is currently within the species' tolerance limits, or (3) extinction. We argue here that all three of these outcomes involve evolutionary processes. Genetic differentiation within species is ubiquitous, commonly via adaptation of populations to differing environmental conditions. Detectable adaptive divergence evolves on a time scale comparable to change in climate, within decades for herbaceous plant species, and within centuries or millennia for longer-lived trees, implying that biologically significant evolutionary response can accompany temporal change in climate. Models and empirical studies suggest that the speed with which a population adapts to a changing environment affects invasion rate of new habitat and thus migration rate, population growth rate and thus probability of extinction, and growth and mortality of individual plants and thus productivity of regional vegetation. Recent models and experiments investigate the stability of species tolerance limits, the influence of environmental gradients on marginal populations, and the interplay of demography, gene flow, mutation rate, and other genetic processes on the rate of adaptation to changed environments. New techniques enable ecologists to document adaptation to changing conditions directly by resurrecting ancient populations from propagules buried in decades-old sediment. Improved taxonomic resolution from morphological studies of macrofossils and DNA recovered from pollen grains and macroremains provides additional information on range shifts, changes in population sizes, and extinctions. Collaboration between paleoecologists and evolutionary biologists can refine interpretations of paleorecords, and improve predictions of biotic response to anticipated climate change.

AB  - One of the most dramatic consequences of climate change will be the intensification and increased frequency of extreme events. I used numerical simulations to understand and predict the consequences of directional trend (i.e. mean state) and increased variability of a climate variable (e. g. temperature), increased probability of occurrence of point extreme events (e. g. floods), selection pressure and effect size of mutations on a quantitative trait determining individual fitness, as well as the their effects on the population and genetic dynamics of a population of moderate size. The interaction among climate trend, variability and probability of point extremes had a minor effect on risk of extinction, time to extinction and distribution of the trait after accounting for their independent effects. The survival chances of a population strongly and linearly decreased with increasing strength of selection, as well as with increasing climate trend and variability. Mutation amplitude had no effects on extinction risk, time to extinction or genetic adaptation to the new climate. Climate trend and strength of selection largely determined the shift of the mean phenotype in the population. The extinction or persistence of the populations in an 'extinction window' of 10 years was well predicted by a simple model including mean population size and mean genetic variance over a 10-year time frame preceding the 'extinction window', although genetic variance had a smaller role than population size in predicting contemporary risk of extinction.

AB  - The motivation for the reported research was to support NASA space nuclear power initiatives through the development of advanced fiber optic sensors for space-based nuclear power applications. The purpose of the high-neutron fluence testing was to demonstrate the survivability of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors in a fission reactor environment. 520 FBGs were installed in the Ford reactor at the University of Michigan. The reactor was operated for 1012 effective full power hours resulting in a maximum neutron fluence of approximately 5 x 10(19) n/cm(2), and a maximum gamma dose of 2 x 10(3) MGy gamma. This work is significant in that, to the knowledge of the authors, the exposure levels obtained are approximately 1000 times higher than for any previously published experiment. Four different fiber compositions were evaluated. An 87% survival rate was observed for fiber Bragg gratings located at the fuel centerline. Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR), originally developed at the NASA Langley Research Center, can be used to interrogate several thousand low-reflectivity FBG strain and/or temperature sensors along a single optical fiber. A key advantage of the OFDR sensor technology for space nuclear power is the extremely low mass of the sensor, which consists of only a silica fiber 125mum in diameter. The sensors produced using this technology will fill applications in nuclear power for current reactor plants, emerging Generation-IV reactors, and for space nuclear power. The reported research was conducted by Luna Innovations and was funded through a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract with the NASA Glenn Research Center.

AB  - The plate cooling model for the thermal evolution of the oceanic upper mantle has been widely accepted to explain observed variations of depth to oceanic basement and conductive heat flow with the age of the seafloor. Several estimates of ''best fitting'' plate model parameters, derived from depth, heat flow, and age data, have been proposed, but the viability of the plate model itself has not been rigorously evaluated. We have used published mean depths and depths to basement at Deep Sea Drilling Project/Ocean Drilling Program (DSDP/ODP) drilling sites to test the cooling model based on two criteria: First, viable plate models must have coefficients that are consistent with the slope of the corresponding root t line because the half-space (or root t) subsidence of young seafloor is implicit in the plate model (i.e., the slope of the root t line can be calculated directly from the coefficients of the plate subsidence model). Second, any viable physical model must fit the data with an acceptable degree of systematic misfit; large systematic misfits indicate that the model cannot explain the observations. Fits of half-space (root t) models to depth versus age data for young (< approximately 80 Ma) seafloor indicate basal temperatures in the range 1300 to 1370-degrees-C. Based on the age at which the depths deviate from the root t line, the minimum plate thickness that is compatible with the best fitting half-space models for young seafloor is 120 km. In contrast, all best fitting plate models yield systematically higher temperatures (1450 to 1470-degrees-C) and thinner plates (102-118 km). The plate model can explain the depth to basement at DSDP/ODP drill sites with a satisfactory degree of systematic misfit, but we find that there is no plate cooling model that can explain the variation of the mean depths (derived from the DBDB5 database) with age over the entire range of ages (0 to 165 Ma). Models that ''best fit'' the entire data set have unacceptably large systematic misfits over the entire range of seafloor age, whereas models that minimize the systematic misfit for young seafloor (0 to 81 Ma) fail for older seafloor. The plate model clearly fails to explain the observations. The cooling history of old seafloor is not simply an extension of the cooling history of young seafloor according to a simple plate cooling model. Previous studies have suggested, as an alterative to the plate model, that observed variations of basement depth with age are best explained by the combined effects of a ''normal' half-space cooling process and the dynamic and/or thermal effects of hot spots or mantle plumes. Our results are entirely consistent with the half-space cooling model, and we find that the best reference model for ''normal'' subsidence is d(t) = (2600 +/- 20) m + (345 +/- 3) m (m.y.)-1/2 t1/2. We also find that the heat flow predicted by this half-space model is consistent with the most reliable average heat flow values from the Pacific.

AB  - Proteins persist longer in the fossil record than DNA, but the longevity, survival mechanisms and substrates remain contested. Here, we demonstrate the role of mineral binding in preserving the protein sequence in ostrich (Struthionidae) eggshell, including from thepalaeontological sites of Laetoli (3.8 Ma) and Olduvai Gorge (1.3 Ma) in Tanzania. By tracking protein diagenesis back in time we find consistent patterns of preservation, demonstrating authenticity of the surviving sequences. Molecular dynamics simulations of struthiocalcin-1 and -2, the dominant proteins within the eggshell, reveal that distinct domains bind to the mineral surface. It is the domain with the strongest calculated binding energy to the calcite surface that is selectively preserved. Thermal age calculations demonstrate that the Laetoli and Olduvai peptides are 50 times older than any previously authenticated sequence (equivalent to similar to 16 Ma at a constant 10 degrees C).

AB  - We used more than 326 000 observations of temperature collected by radio telemetry from 38 individuals over three years to investigate thermoregulation and thermal relations of northern water snakes (Nerodia sipedon) near the northern limit of their distribution in Ontario, Canada. We tested hypotheses concerning the effects of feeding, season, sex, and reproductive condition on thermoregulation of individuals. The mean preferred body temperature (PBT) for captive snakes from the study population was 27.1 degrees C, similar to that reported for other populations, and PET range (defined as the 25th-75th percentiles of selected temperatures) was 25-30 degrees C. When environmental conditions allowed, the mean and range of body temperature (T-b) of free-living snakes were nearly identical to those observed in captivity. The typical daily pattern in snake T-b was an increase in late morning to a plateau temperature in the preferred range, followed by a decrease in the evening with a nightime plateau at approximately the temperature of the water. We calculated indices of thermoregulation to relate T-b data to available ambient temperatures. Despite the northern latitude of the study population, ambient conditions were favorable over much of the activity season and offered the potential for the snakes to maintain T-b within the PET range almost 24 h per day for much of the season. However, the thermoregulation indices indicated that N. sipedon are only moderate thermoregulators, and often do not exploit opportunities to achieve PET, particularly during the day. Variation in annual ambient temperatures affected growth rates of the snakes, and was sufficient to affect the age of maturity of females.
   Feeding did not elicit a thermophilic response under laboratory conditions or when snakes were fed experimentally in the field, suggesting that the benefits of increasing T-b after eating did not outweigh the costs. Reproductive females thermoregulated more carefully than nonreproductive females during the July-August gestation period. Pregnant females may increase thermoregulatory behavior to enhance the rate and efficiency of embryogenesis. Males thermoregulated less than both reproductive and nonreproductive females, particularly later in the activity season when thermoregulation by females increased. We hypothesized that males pursue a survival strategy following the spring mating season and thus remain cool and secretive during the later part of the activity season. This strategy by males clearly contributes to their slowed growth and smaller size relative to females.

AB  - A long-standing research goal has been to develop a self-sustained chemical system that is capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution. The notion of primitive RNA-based life suggests that this goal might be achieved by constructing an RNA enzyme that catalyzes the replication of RNA molecules, including the RNA enzyme itself. This reaction was demonstrated recently in a cross-catalytic system involving two RNA enzymes that catalyze each other's synthesis from a total of four component substrates. The cross-replicating RNA enzymes undergo self-sustained exponential amplification at a constant temperature in the absence of proteins or other biological materials. Amplification occurs with a doubling time of similar to 1 hour and can be continued indefinitely. Small populations of cross-replicating RNA enzymes can be made to compete for limited resources within a common environment. The molecules reproduce with high fidelity but occasionally give rise to recombinants that also can replicate. Over the course of many "generations" of selective amplification, novel variants arise and grow to dominate the population based on their relative fitness under the chosen reaction conditions. This is the first example, outside of biology, of evolutionary adaptation in a molecular genetic system.

AB  - Despite a significant progress in electrification over the last decade, more than 1 billion people have no access to electricity, and about 3 billion use solid fuel or kerosene for cooking and heating purposes. More than 95 % of them live in sub-Saharan Africa or developing Asia, and around 80 % are situated in rural areas. Conventional approach to power supply such as transmission grid extension is not economical due to high investment and connection costs. Technological progress has shifted down capital costs of renewable off-grid solutions. However, in the most cases, it is not enough to reach feasibility of these solutions due to weak investment conditions and weak purchasing power of the local population in these areas. The choice of business model can have a vital role in bringing electrification and connectivity to rural areas, providing flexibility and adaptability of the technology to the market conditions. Analysis of existing literature on business models for off-grid solutions concludes that the model for rural areas in developing countries should be more service oriented, be scalable to various use case scenarios, should provide good risk balance between customer and provider, and should enable transparency and quality of service. This paper analyses recent developments in off-grid system solutions for sub-Saharan Africa and provides classification of business model innovations. Based on the analysis, the paper proposes an innovative business model for Fusion Grid project, scalable mini-grid integrated with connectivity solution. Feasibility of the project is tested for three different cases, depending on the type of the rural community. Results suggests that combining micro-grid based power supply and internet connection as one service can contribute to a viability of the project, and, furthermore, can contribute to achieving global electrification goal.

AB  - The growth and thermo-mechanical stability of magma chambers in Earth's crust dictate the dynamics of volcanism at the surface, and the organization of volcanic plumbing at depth. We analyze a model of magma chamber evolution in which volumetric growth is governed by the mechanical focusing of rising dikes by the magma chamber, "magmatic lensing," as well as melting and assimilation of country rock. This modeling framework emphasizes the two-way coupling between chamber stresses and thermal evolution with specific compositions of intruding magma and country rock. We consider as end member compositional scenarios a "wet" environment magma chamber, in which basalt with 2 wt.% H2O intrudes an amphibolitic country rock, and a "dry" chamber consisting of anhydrous basalt intruding tonalitic country rocks. Magma chambers that erupt, freeze, or reach dynamic equilibrium in the crust occupy distinct regions of a parameter space that measures the relative importance of depth, chamber pressurization, Wall rock viscoelastic rheology, and thermal viability.
   Lower crustal melt flux is the most important factor controlling chamber stability, but chamber depth and composition also help determine long-term dynamical behavior. In general, interactions between thermal and mechanical processes exert first-order control on chamber stability, defining four distinct regimes of magma chamber dynamics. In addition to thermally and mechanically unstable (freezing and eruptive) chambers, we find steady-state thermally viable chamber volumes are possible as well as a range of parameters for which chamber growth is roughly exponential in time and mechanically stable (no eruption occurs). Long-lived (>1 Ma) chambers generally result from lower crustal melt flux values that range from similar to 10(-4) to similar to 10(-1) m(3)/m(2)/yr for 20 and 40 km deep chambers and both compositional end members used in this study. However chambers become considerably less stable in cool shallow environments, particularly with anhydrous compositions of magma and country rock. Model predictions in this framework suggest that a range of observed intrusive structures in Earth's crust may be the result of magma chambers in different, clearly defined dynamical regimes.

AB  - Lysozyme activity, haemolytic activity, total level of IgM, and levels of antibodies against A-layer from Aeromonas salmonicida and O-antigen from Vibrio salmonicida, respectively, were determined in 77 full-sib groups of Atlantic salmon in order to evaluate their possible use as immune parameters for indirect selection to improve disease resistance. Fish from parallel full-sib groups had previously been challenged with Aeromonas salmonicida (causing furunculosis), Renibacterium salmoninarum (causing bacterial kidney disease, BKD) and Vibrio salmonicida (causing cold-water vibriosis).  Heritabilities were estimated for each of the immune parameters and correlations between the least square means of the full-sib groups for the different immune parameters and survival rates in the parallel full-sib groups were determined.  A significant genetic variation in lysozyme activity was found, as well as an apparent genetic association between low lysozyme activity and high survival rates.  Low heritabilities and low univariate correlations with survival in the full-sib groups were estimated for all of the other immune parameters.  An analysis of the multivariate associations between the full-sib mean values of the complete set of immune parameters, and survival rates in the parallel full-sib groups in each of the challenge tests, revealed that, at low levels of lysozyme activity and with low antibody titres against V. salmonicida O-antigen, increased IgM levels seemed to increase survival from furunculosis.

AB  - Physiological acclimation has the potential to improve survival during climate change by reducing sensitivity to warming. However, acclimation can produce trade-offs due to links between related physiological traits. Water loss and gas exchange are intrinsically linked by the need for respiratory surfaces to remain moist. As climates warm and dry, organisms may attempt to lower desiccation risk by limiting water loss but at a cost of inhibiting their ability to breathe. Here we used laboratory experiments to evaluate the trade-off between water loss and gas exchange in a fully terrestrial, lungless salamander (Plethodon metcalfi). We measured acclimation of resistance to water loss and metabolic rates in response to long-term exposure to temperature and humidity treatments. We then integrated the trade-off into a simulation-based species distribution model to determine the consequences of ignoring physiological trade-offs on energy balance and aerobic scope under climate change. In the laboratory, we found a close association between acclimation of resistance to water loss and metabolic rates indicative of a trade-off. After incorporating the trade-off into our simulations, we found that energy balance and aerobic scope were reduced by 49.7% and 34.3%, respectively, under contemporary climates across their geographic range. Under future warming scenarios, incorporating the trade-off lowered the number of sites predicted to experience local extirpation by 52.2% relative to simulations without the trade-off; however, the number of sites capable of supporting the energetic requirements for reproduction declined from 44.6% to 32.6% across the species' geographic range. These experiments and simulations suggest that salamanders can maintain positive energy balance across their geographic range under climate change despite the costs associated with trade-offs between water loss and gas exchange.

AB  - Cassava is the main source of carbohydrate for over 70% of the people in Nigeria, the world's largest producer and consumer of the crop. The yields of cassava are, however, relatively low in Nigeria largely due to pests and disease infections that significantly lead to inconsistencies in productivity of cassava genotypes in various environments. Fifty-eight F(1)hybrid cassava genotypes plus their two parents which served as check varieties were evaluated in three locations for two years (that is six environments). The objectives of the study were to evaluate genotype by environment interactions (GEI) on resistance to cassava green mite [CGM,Mononychellus tanajoa(Bondar)] associated traits and effects on yield performance of cassava genotypes in Nigeria and to identify superior genotypes that exhibit high stability which combine CGM resistance and high fresh root yield with general and specific environmental adaptation using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype stability index (GSI). The combined analysis of variance based on AMMI revealed significant genotype, environment, and genotype by environment interactions (GEI) for all traits. The percentage variation due to environment was higher than the percentage variation due to genotype for cassava green mite severity (CGMS), leaf retention (LR), root dry matter content (RDMC), and fresh root yield (FRY) indicating that environment greatly influenced the expression of these traits. The percentage variation due to GEI accounted for higher percentage variation than that of genotype and environment separately for all traits, indicating the influence of genotype by environment interaction on expression of the traits. These findings reveal that screening/evaluating for these traits needs multi-environment trials. According to GSI ranking, genotypes G31 (IBA131794), G19 (IBA131762), the check variety G52 (TMEB778), and G11 (IBA131748) were identified as the most stable and most resistant to CGM which also combine high FRY and other useful agronomic traits, implying that these traits in cassava can even be incorporated as preferred by farmers. These genotypes can be tested in more environments to determine their adaptability and potential recommendation for release to farmers for growing.

AB  - A portable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system has been developed with Red Pitaya STEMlab for biomedical applications. The Red Pitaya STEMlab is a portable device to realize voltage generation and data acquisition for the EIT system. The EIT system includes a modified howland circuit as a voltage-controlled current source, a high-speed analogy multiplexer module, an 8-electrode array, and a personal computer. The generalized vector sampled pattern matching algorithm and the Tikhonov regularization algorithm are used to reconstruct the image generated by the EIT system. The reconstructed images by using Red Pitaya STEMlab are compared with a commercial impedance analyzer IM3570 within the frequencies of f = 100 KHz. The results show that the maximum difference of the image correlation between Red Pitaya STEMlab and IM3570 is 5.36%. Finally, the EIT system is used to image the conductivity of eggs during heating process. These results verified that the developed portable EIT system with Red Pitaya STEMlab could measure the biological tissue in a high accuracy at low cost.

AB  - Advocates of palliative care research have often described the cold and difficult environment that has constrained the development of research internationally. The development of palliative care research has been slow over the last few decades and has met with resistance and sometimes hostility to the idea of conducting research in 'vulnerable populations'. The seeds of advocacy for research can be found in palliative care literature from the 1980s and early 1990s. Although we have much to do, we need to recognize that palliative care research development has come a long way. Of particular note is the development of well-funded collaboratives that now exist in Europe, Canada, Australia and the USA. The European Association for Palliative Care and the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care has recognized the need to develop and promote global research initiatives, with a special focus on developing countries. Time is needed to develop good research evidence and in a more complex healthcare environment takes increasingly more resources to be productive. The increased support (global warming) evident in the increased funding opportunities available to palliative care researchers in a number of countries brings both benefits and challenges. There is evidence that the advocacy of individuals such as Kathleen Foley, Neil MacDonald, Balfour Mount, Vittorio Ventafridda, Robert Twycross and Geoff Hanks is now providing fertile ground and a much friendlier environment for a new generation of interdisciplinary palliative care research. We have achieved many of the goals necessary to avoid failure of the 'palliative care experiment', and need to accept the challenge of our present climate and adapt and take advantage of the change.

AB  - The present investigation assesses the influence of cultural attributes and heat and cold treatments on the behavior of native toxigenic L. monocytogenes CFR 1302 and non-toxigenic L. innocua CFR 1304 in selected medium. The growth responses of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua under the influencing factors of storage temperature (10-40 degrees C), pH level (5.5-7.5), and storage period (6-48 h) in brain heart infusion and nutrient broths revealed closeness between observed and predicted populations. Response surface plots were generated for the growth behavior of the two test cultures as a function of pH level. The toxigenic L. monocytogenes CFR 1302 could reach a higher viable population. The effect of heat treatment on Listeria spp. in selected five heating menstra showed the lowest D-value of 3.7 min at 60 degrees C for L. innocua CFR 1304 in Milli-Q water to the highest of 8.4 min at 56 degrees C for L. monocytogenes CFR 1302 in skim milk. The average z-value across the heating menstra for L. monocytogenes was 27.3 degrees C as against that of 22 degrees C for L. innocua. In the case of cold treatment, storage of 4 and 8 degrees C resulted in appreciable increase in counts of L. monocytogenes CFR 1302 from the initial inoculum introduced in selected media. At -20 degrees C, there was a slight decrease in the viable population. The research data helps to predict the viable populations of L. monocytogenes as a part of risk assessment in the food chain. This is of significance in providing safe and healthy food to human population.

AB  - Global climate change (GCC) increasingly threatens biodiversity through the loss of species, and the transformation of entire ecosystems. Many species are challenged by the pace of GCC because they might not be able to respond fast enough to changing biotic and abiotic conditions. Species can respond either by shifting their range, or by persisting in their local habitat. If populations persist, they can tolerate climatic changes through phenotypic plasticity, or genetically adapt to changing conditions depending on their genetic variability and census population size to allow for de novo mutations. Otherwise, populations will experience demographic collapses and species may go extinct. Current approaches to predicting species responses to GCC begin to combine ecological and evolutionary information for species distribution modelling. Including an evolutionary dimension will substantially improve species distribution projections which have not accounted for key processes such as dispersal, adaptive genetic change, demography, or species interactions. However, eco-evolutionary models require new data and methods for the estimation of a species' adaptive potential, which have so far only been available for a small number of model species. To represent global biodiversity, we need to devise large-scale data collection strategies to define the ecology and evolutionary potential of a broad range of species, especially of keystone species of ecosystems. We also need standardized and replicable modelling approaches that integrate these new data to account for eco-evolutionary processes when predicting the impact of GCC on species' survival. Here, we discuss different genomic approaches that can be used to investigate and predict species responses to GCC. This can serve as guidance for researchers looking for the appropriate experimental setup for their particular system. We furthermore highlight future directions for moving forward in the field and allocating available resources more effectively, to implement mitigation measures before species go extinct and ecosystems lose important functions.

AB  - Background: Staphylococcus aureus readily develops resistance to antibiotics and achieving effective therapies to overcome resistance requires in-depth understanding of S. aureus biology. High throughput, parallel-sequencing methods for analyzing transposon mutant libraries have the potential to revolutionize studies of S. aureus, but the genetic tools to take advantage of the power of next generation sequencing have not been fully developed.
   Results: Here we report a phage-based transposition system to make ultra-high density transposon libraries for genome-wide analysis of mutant fitness in any phi 11-transducible S. aureus strain. The high efficiency of the delivery system has made it possible to multiplex transposon cassettes containing different regulatory elements in order to make libraries in which genes are over- or under-expressed as well as deleted. By incorporating transposon-specific barcodes into the cassettes, we can evaluate how null mutations and changes in gene expression levels affect fitness in a single sequencing data set. Demonstrating the power of the system, we have prepared a library containing more than 690,000 unique insertions. Because one unique feature of the phage-based approach is that temperature-sensitive mutants are retained, we have carried out a genome-wide study of S. aureus genes involved in withstanding temperature stress. We find that many genes previously identified as essential are temperature sensitive and also identify a number of genes that, when disrupted, confer a growth advantage at elevated temperatures.
   Conclusions: The platform described here reliably provides mutant collections of unparalleled genotypic diversity and will enable a wide range of functional genomic studies in S. aureus.

AB  - Due to population growth and the subsequent increase in the demand for food, low carbon food chain production systems are a necessity to reduce the effects on climate change as much as possible. Urban agriculture is of great interest because of its potential in reducing the indirect CO2 emissions of a city's food supply by reducing transportation distances, the packaging required and the food losses that occur during transportation. However, intensive urban agriculture production, which often relies on the use of soilless substrates, requires synthetic fertilizers rich in nitrogen, resulting in N2O emissions. Presently, there is a lack of studies that determine the generation of N2O from soilless crops to properly account for their global warming potential. In this study, an open chamber system was used to quantify N2O emissions from lettuce crops with perlite bags as their substrate in a Mediterranean rooftop greenhouse located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain). N2O generation, through nitrifying and denitrifying reactions, was limited by assuring an aerobic environment, negligible water retention, the absence of NH3, and controlled dosage of NO3- in the most favorable pH conditions for plant assimilation. The emission factor (EF) measured for the soilless lettuce crop (0.0072-0.0085 kg N2O-1 per kg N-1) was half the EF of the IPCC method (0.0125 kg N2O-1 per kg N-1) for soil crops, which is commonly used in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to approximate direct N2O emissions, for lack of a better method. Using a more appropriate EF for an LCA study of a tomato crop grown under similar conditions to those used to generate the EF resulted in a 7.5% reduction (0.06 kg CO2 eq. per kilogram of tomato production) in total global warming potential. This study shows that soilless crops reduce N2O emissions when compared to conventional crops, making urban agriculture an attractive practice for reducing GHG emissions. The results highlight the need to determine a standard method for determining an EF applicable to soilless protected crops, which, based on the parameters described here, such as the type of substrate, fertilizers and irrigation system, would allow for a more accurate environmental evaluation of soilless conventional and urban crops.

AB  - A series of laboratory and field studies were conducted using three lines of navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), reared on wheat bran diet and almonds, Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A.Webb, at constant and fluctuating temperature. The duration of development on wheat bran diet at constant temperature differed significantly among the three lines. Development was as much as 40% faster at constant temperature than at fluctuating temperatures, consequently the developmental duration determined at constant temperature was not an absolute measure. When the maximum temperature in fluctuating regimes exceeded 43 degrees C, survival decreased by 50% compared with the constant temperature control. In almonds held at constant temperature, the developmental rate on new-crop nuts was variety-dependent and was fastest on 'Nonpareil' almonds and slowest on the experimental selection '23-122'. Development and survival were also variety-dependent on unharvested (mummy) almonds, and navel orangeworm average emergence was earliest from Nonpareil and latest from 'Carmel' nuts, differing by 529 degree-days, whereas survival was the highest on 'Butte', 35.7%, and the lowest on Carmel nuts, 7.2%. In our trials, both the speed of development and survival depended on host age, variety and quality, indicating that almonds were a dynamic rather than a static nutrient source for navel orangeworm. Identifying the factors responsible for variation in development and survival will give insight into improving control strategies.

AB  - Two-dimensional probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) define the probability that individuals mature as a function of age and size. PMRNs have recently been used to derive empirical support for the hypothesis that high fishing mortality has induced genetic change towards earlier maturation in exploited populations. However, the 2-dimensional PMRN method does not, strictly speaking, disentangle phenotypic plasticity from genetic change in maturation. Instead, it disentangles the contribution of variation in growth and mortality from other sources of variation contributing to changes in maturation. After removing the contribution of variation in growth and mortality, any remaining change is not necessarily purely genetic. Environmental factors may exist that directly affect the propensity to mature at a certain size and age. An observed trend in the size-age PMRN may therefore be partly or fully explained by a co-incidental trend in an (environmental) factor. As pointed out by Grift et al. (2007; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 334:213-224), such co-dependence is captured conceptually by multi-dimensional PMRNs, as opposed to 2-dimensional (size-age) PMRNs, where the higher dimensions represent the relevant variables. Dimensions that may partly or fully explain the observed trends in size-age PMRNs, other than evolution, include temperature, polluting endocrine -disrupting chemicals, the social structure of the population, and body condition; changes in the last two may be fisheries-induced. To illustrate these views, I re-analysed data on North Sea plaice, and demonstrated that temperature explains part of the shift in the size-age PMRN but that a residual shift remains. The latter finding supports the hypothesis of genetic change.

AB  - Background: The endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis infects a broad range of arthropod and filarial nematode hosts. These diverse associations form an attractive model for understanding host: symbiont coevolution. Wolbachia's ubiquity and ability to dramatically alter host reproductive biology also form the foundation of research strategies aimed at controlling insect pests and vector-borne disease. The Wolbachia strains that infect nematodes are phylogenetically distinct, strictly vertically transmitted, and required by their hosts for growth and reproduction. Insects in contrast form more fluid associations with Wolbachia. In these taxa, host populations are most often polymorphic for infection, horizontal transmission occurs between distantly related hosts, and direct fitness effects on hosts are mild. Despite extensive interest in the Wolbachia system for many years, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate its varied interactions with different hosts. We have compared the genomes of the Wolbachia that infect Drosophila melanogaster, wMel and the nematode Brugia malayi, wBm to that of an outgroup Anaplasma marginale to identify genes that have experienced diversifying selection in the Wolbachia lineages. The goal of the study was to identify likely molecular mechanisms of the symbiosis and to understand the nature of the diverse association across different hosts.
   Results: The prevalence of selection was far greater in wMel than wBm. Genes contributing to DNA metabolism, cofactor biosynthesis, and secretion were positively selected in both lineages. In wMel there was a greater emphasis on DNA repair, cell division, protein stability, and cell envelope synthesis.
   Conclusion: Secretion pathways and outer surface protein encoding genes are highly affected by selection in keeping with host: parasite theory. If evidence of selection on various cofactor molecules reflects possible provisioning, then both insect as well as nematode Wolbachia may be providing substances to hosts. Selection on cell envelope synthesis, DNA replication and repair machinery, heat shock, and two component switching suggest strategies insect Wolbachia may employ to cope with diverse host and intra-host environments.

AB  - Integrated pest management in Australian winter grain crops is challenging, partly because the timing and severity of pest outbreaks cannot currently be predicted, and this often results in prophylactic applications of broad spectrum pesticides. We developed a simple model to predict the median emergence in autumn of pest populations of the redlegged earth mite, Halotydeus destructor, a major field crop and pasture pest in southern Australia. Previous data and observations suggest that rainfall and temperature are critical for post-diapause egg hatch. We evaluated seven models that combined rainfall and temperature thresholds derived using three approaches against previously recorded hatch dates and 2013 field records. The performance of the models varied between Western Australia and south-eastern Australian States. In Western Australia, the key attributes of the best fitting model were more than 5 mm rain followed by mean day temperatures of below 20.5 A degrees C for 10 days. In south-eastern Australia, the most effective model involved a temperature threshold reduced to 16 A degrees C. These regional differences may reflect adaptation of H. destructor in south-eastern Australia to varied and uncertain temperature and rainfall regimes of late summer and autumn, relative to the hot and dry Mediterranean-type climate in Western Australia. Field sampling in 2013 revealed a spread of early hatch dates in isolated patches of habitat, ahead of predicted paddock scale hatchings. These regional models should assist in monitoring and subsequent management of H. destructor at the paddock scale.

AB  - Behavioral reactions of fishes are measureable, adaptive features which contribute to their evolutionary fitness and, hence, can serve as biomarkers of stress. For a behavior to serve as an efficacious biomarker, it should be important to an individual's survival, growth and/or reproduction, be relatively stable under control conditions, and have a "concentration-effect" relationship with the stressor. This review summarizes the influence of numerous environmental stimuli on seven different behaviors in fishes. Avoidance-attractance behavior does not assess for stress, but rather allows a fish to avoia stressful chemicals. Of the 75 chemicals surveyed, about 1/3 are avoided at threshold concentrations that should mitigate harm, while approximately 2/3 were either not actively avoided or produced inconsistent results. Temperature selection behavior meets several criteria of a good indicator of stress. Several stimuli produced significant changes in selected/avoidance temperatures of various fishes. While only a few stimuli caused an increase, several resulted in a decrease in selected temperatures. Although conditioned learning appears to be a sensitive measure of environmentally induced stress, few studies have been published, and direct field validations are not possible. A variety of stimuli can disrupt the components of feeding, often in the parts per billion range of concentrations. Predator-prey interactions are sensitive to a variety of stressors. In trials where only prey were exposed to a potential stressor, 94% of the stressors caused an increase in prey vulnerability, usually at levels less than 96-hour LC50S. Neither of the other social behaviors reviewed, intraspecific and reproductive, although promising, has received large research attention. Studies featuring several different methods demonstrate that there is no single best behavioral bioassay method. However, depending upon the expected effects and possible mode of action, there probably is a "best" behavioral bioassay to illustrate the effects of each potential stressor.

AB  - Temperature is one of the main factors influencing biological processes of ectothermic species. An optimum temperature of 16-18 degrees C has been suggested for the development of early life stages of temperate Australian abalone, yet there are little physiological or behavioral data to support this suggestion. This study examines the acute thermal preferences (Tpref), swimming speeds (U), and oxygen consumption rates (MO2) of veliger larvae of blacklip abalone [Haliotis rubra (Leach, 1814)], greenlip abalone [Haliotis laevigata (Donovan, 1808)], and their interspecies hybrid. Thermal preference and U were measured in a thermal gradient with temperatures ranging from 12 degrees C to 25 degrees C, and MO2 was measured at 4-7 temperatures between 12 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Thermal preference increased in all three groups of abalone during development from a Tpref of 16 degrees C in 1-day-old early veligers to a Tpref of 20 degrees C in 3-day-old late veligers. Swimming speed increased with temperature in all three groups of abalone and increased with age in H. rubra and hybrids but not in H. laevigata. Veliger MO2 increased throughout the ecologically relevant temperature range in all three abalone groups. Higher temperatures were examined in hybrids, and it was found that MO2 reached a peak at 25 degrees C and declined thereafter. These results align with the temperatures that veligers may experience in their natural habitat and provide support that current temperatures maintained at Australian aquaculture hatcheries are within optimal ranges for larval performance.

AB  - Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymeric networks with segments of hydrophilic groups. Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have played attractive role toward much research due to slight modification of environment by abrupt changes in swelling behavior. In this study, a series of pH-sensitive biocomposite hydrogels were acquired through solvent-free green approach by utilization of diethylene glycol (DEG), citric acid (CA), acrylic acid (AA) and hydroxyapatite (HA). Incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HA) prepared from waste eggshells with ACD resulted in the biocomposite hydrogel (ACD-HA). The synthesized biocomposite hydrogel was examined by various characterization techniques, viz., spectral (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, thermal (TGA and DTG), morphological (SEM) and swelling equilibrium studies. In addition, HA was surface treated with two different silane-based coupling agents, namely 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AMS) and vinyltriethoxysilane (VES) on the performance properties of biocomposite hydrogels. The results of the studies revealed that VES-treated ACD-HA had superior properties than AMS-treated ACD-HA and untreated ACD-HA on overall properties of biocomposite hydrogels. Hence, the decreasing order of swelling equilibrium behavior in various pH, viz., 4.0, 6.0, 7.4, 8.0, 10.0, has been listed as ACD-HA-VES > ACD-HA-AMS > ACD-HA > ACD. The observations indicated that hydrogels' adaptability with pH-tuned properties may have greater potential in eco-friendly approaches such as metal ion removal, dye removal and agrochemical release.

AB  - Rising temperatures can affect fish survival, especially from shallower waters, as temperatures increase faster and more intensively in these areas; thus, species-specific temperature tolerance can be exceeded. Additionally, the amounts of anthropogenic pollutants are higher in coastal waters. Although increasing metabolic activity at higher temperatures could lead to stronger effects of toxins, there are hardly any studies on this topic. Subsequently, the aim was to investigate the response of fish cells upon exposure to industrial solvents (ethanol, isopropanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) in relation to a temperature increase (20 & DEG;C and 25 & DEG;C). Concerning the 3Rs (the replacement, reduction and refinement of animal experiments), in vitro tests were used for two threatened, vulnerable fish species: maraena whitefish (Coregonus maraena) and Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus). Both cell lines exhibited higher proliferation at 25 & DEG;C. However, ecotoxicological results indicated significant differences regarding the cell line, toxin, temperature and exposure time. The evolutionarily older fish lineage, Atlantic sturgeon, demonstrated lower mortality rates in the presence of isopropanol and recovered better during long-term ethanol exposure than the maraena whitefish. Atlantic sturgeon cells have higher adaptation potential for these alcohols. In summary, fish species respond very specifically to toxins and changes in temperature, and new ecotoxicological questions arise with increasing water temperatures.

KW  - PRINCIPLE
AB  - As an instrument for the study of the early stages of evolution, we introduce evolutive systems, defined as systems that have the capacity to evolve given appropriate conditions in their environment. They consist of building blocks (e.g. monomers) that are either stable or in steady supply, and of transient assemblies (e.g. polymers) that are entities of great variety, some of which are capable of function. Evolution leads to the accumulation of structure within the transient assemblies during repeated cycles of disintegration (partial or total) and reassembly, on account of the selective advantages associated with transient assembly functions. Transient assemblies must be either inherently unstable or subject to disintegration by agents in their environment. Evolutive systems must have access to a negentropy input in the form of energy in packets larger than typical thermal energies. Reproduction, although not a prerequisite, greatly affects the capacity of evolutive systems to evolve, and thus can be expected to appear in an evolutive system if at all possible. Similarly, functions that require the expenditure of negentropy (for example mobility, breathing, circulation, sensing, communicating, etc.) are not prerequisites for evolution, but can be expected to become established in evolutive systems during evolution through the selective advantages that they confer.
   A computer-based evolutive automaton is used to explore possible evolutionary scenarios. In the presence of spatial and temporal inhomogeneities, one can construct a multitude of evolutionary scenarios through which various functions, such as the operation of a genetic code, can become established within the evolutive automaton. This variety of possible evolutionary scenarios is all the more remarkable because the automaton does not include many important physical processes that would be present in a real system and would greatly multiply the number of possible evolutionary mechanisms and scenarios. Some evolutionary mechanisms are based on survival related selection, while others are based on generation related selection. Previously explored scenarios for the initiation of life have been based mostly on generation related selection. In this paper, we give particular emphasis to survival related selection which is more general in that it does apply to structures and functions related to reproduction but, unlike generation related selection, it is not limited to them.
   Some of the most basic features of terrestrial living systems can be seen either as prerequisite features of an evolutive system (such as the mortality of living organisms, instability of biological polymers, imperfect reproduction caused by mutations, and the need for a negentropy input) or as features that one can reasonably expect to become established in an evolutive system (such as reproduction and the multitude of living functions that require expenditure of negentropy). This suggests the possibility that an independent definition of living systems may not be necessary if features of living systems substantially overlap with features that one may expect to find in evolutive systems.

AB  - Temperate bat species cope with environmental temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone through physiological responses, habitat selection, and social roosting. While there have been several studies examining these factors in bat species that form maternity colonies in tree cavities, underneath bark, or in manmade structures, such studies rarely focus on bats that roost solitarily in tree foliage. To better understand the thermal environment of a foliage-roosting bat and how they respond to thermal stimuli, we used temperature-sensitive radio-telemetry and environmental dataloggers to study the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) in southeast Ohio. We collected skin temperatures from eight male and nine reproductive female bats in combination with microclimate data from 25 bat roosts and 15 random trees. We found that elevation, minimum ambient temperature, and maximum ambient temperature best predicted bat skin temperatures, while sex had little effect. We also found that trees located at higher elevations had warmer canopy microclimates than those at lower elevations, but temperatures did not differ between roost and random trees. These results show that solitary, foliage-roosting species use torpor extensively in response to cool temperatures during summer. These results have conservation implications, indicating that areas on the landscape with warmer conditions are important for reducing the cost of maintaining euthermic body temperatures. In southeastern Ohio, this includes upland forests, but our data suggest that temperatures at slope positions, and not the elevation itself, are the important habitat feature for eastern red bats.

AB  - Rest raw materials as viscera, heads, and frames from farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were hydrolyzed with the use of endogenous enzymes and the commercial enzymes Protamex and a mixture of Papain and Bromelain. Composition of the prehydrolysis mixture clearly influenced the quality of final hydrolysate and process kinetics. An increased proportion of viscera increased the amount of endogenous enzymes, which influenced hydrolysis kinetics, the extent of hydrolysis, and increased bitterness. Commercial enzymes, in addition to endogenous enzymes, are not always more yield efficient or economically beneficial but can be used to improve the taste and to ease the separation of oil from the hydrolysate fraction. Hydrolysis of denatured proteins in rest raw materials was hardly detectable. Optimum temperature should therefore be selected to avoid protein denaturation and simultaneously maintain high enzymatic activity. Hydrolysates preferably contain a low concentration of oil, and this work shows that high-quality oil can be separated before hydrolysis by mild thermal treatment. The previous separation of oil did not influence hydrolysate yield and decreased the concentration of lipids in the final hydrolysate. The initial separation of oil also increased productivity of the hydrolysis reactor, due to the reduction of hydrolysis volume.

AB  - Worldwide variation in human stature and limb proportions is widely accepted to reflect thermal adaptation, but the contribution of population history to this variation is unknown. Furthermore, stature and relative lower limb length (LLL) show substantial plastic responses to environmental stressors, e.g., nutrition, pathogen load, which covary with climate. Thus ecogeographic patterns may go beyond temperature-based selection. We analysed global variation in stature, sitting height and absolute and relative LLL using large worldwide samples of published anthropometric data from adult male (n=571) and female (n=268) populations in relation to temperature, humidity, and net primary productivity (NPP). Population history was modeled using spatial eigenvector mapping based on geographic distances reflecting the hypothesized pattern for the spread of modern humans out of Africa. Regression models account for similar to 50% of variation in most morphological variables. Population history explains slightly more variation in stature, sitting height and LLL than the environmental/climatic variables. After adjusting for population history, associations between (usually maximum) temperature and LLL are consistent with Allen's "rule" and may drive similar relationships with stature. NPP is a consistent negative predictor of anthropometry, which may reflect the growth-limiting effects of lower environmental resource accessibility (inversely related to NPP) and/or pathogen load.

AB  - It has been documented in the many-lined sun skink (Mabuya multifasciata) that pregnant females select lower body temperatures (27.6-30.8 degrees C) than do nonpregnant females and adult males (29.7-35.7 degrees C). We therefore used the skink to test the hypothesis that the maximization of reproductive benefits should be achieved in pregnant females by shifting thermal preferences towards the levels optimal for embryonic development but entailing relatively small costs of reproduction. Data on adult males showed that temperatures maximizing swimming stamina (indicative of locomotor endurance) fell within the range of body temperatures selected by nonpregnant females and adult males. Data on swimming stamina and feeding performance of pregnant females, nonpregnant females and adult males measured at 26 and 30 degrees C showed that: (1) pregnancy impaired locomotor and feeding performances, but such impairments did not persist after parturition; (2) the degree of locomotor impairment during pregnancy was greater at 26 degrees C than at 30 degrees C, but the degree of feeding impairment during pregnancy was greater at 30 degrees C than at 26 degrees C. Pregnant females of M. multifasciata selecting body temperatures at about 29 degrees C could not only produce good-quality offspring in a relatively short gestation length but also reduce reproductive costs associated with locomotor and feeding impairments to some extent. Thus, data from M. multifasciata validate the above hypothesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - STUDIES ON THE CONTROL OF HETEROGONOUS REPRODUCTION IN ROTIFERS .4. THE REACTIVATION OF MICTIC POTENTIAL IN BRACHIONUS-URCEOLARIS
T2  - ZOOLOGISCHE JAHRBUCHER-ABTEILUNG FUR ALLGEMEINE ZOOLOGIE UND PHYSIOLOGIE DER TIERE
LA  - German
AB  - The mictic potential denotes the capacity of amictic eggs to react to mixis-inducing environmental conditions.  This potential of three clones (A1, W1, and W2) of Brachionus urceolaris was lost step by step when the animals kept in mixis-inducing conditions (20-degrees-C) for long time.  Finally, they were completely amictic.  But in a mixis-suppressing environment (10-degrees-C), they slowly regained their mictic potential.  It is the aim of this paper to describe the quantitative relations between the time of exposure to low temperature (10-degrees-C) and the reactivation of the mictic potential.
   The animals of clone A1 are almost completely amictic at 10-degrees-C.  A transfer to 20-degrees-C causes a mictic reaction:  After a short time, the percentage of mictic females increases to a maximum and then decreases again to lower values.  These percentages measure the mictic potential, which is determined by the time, they were kept at 10-degrees-C.  When the cultures were continued at 20-degrees-C, the mictic percentage reaches zero.  The time needed until this happens, is again determined by the duration of preceeding culture at 10-degrees-C.  But this relation is not very strict.  Therefore the time the animals were kept at 10-degrees-C cannot be attributed to definite percentages or definite rates of their decrease:  The process of reactivation is very variable.  So the different experiments agree only qualitatively, but not in the precise percentages and times.
   When the animals of the two W-clones were continuously cultivated at 20-degrees-C, they became purely amictic, too.  But here, contrary to A1, mictic females appeared immediately after the transfer of these amictic females to 10-degrees-C.  The percentage of mictic females stayed rather high for some years.  The physiological mechanism causing this mixis could not be clarified as yet.  In any case, it is not identical with the mictic potential, which admits mixis in warm environment.  For, if amictic females were transferred back to warm environment during the first 4 weeks of cold cultivation, then they and all their descendants were unable of mixis, although their sisters continuously produced mictic daughters at 10-degrees-C.  Only after 4 weeks of cold cultivation, the rise of temperature induced a weak reaction that increased with the duration of the cultivation at 10-degrees-C.  Also the time needed for the clones to become amictic after the first reaction, depends on the duration of the preceeding cold cultivation.  As for A1, the mictic potential was very variable.  So parallel experiments run under the same conditions gave quantitatively different results.
   A fourth clone A4 continuously produced mictic females although it was cultivated at 20-degrees-C for years.  So contrary to the other clones, it did not lose its mictic potential.  At 10-degrees-C, the animals became amictic and could produce mictic daughters immediately after they were put back into warm environment.
   The material basis of the mictic potential is not known.  Its variability is controlled by external conditions.  This shows that it is not located in the chromosomes, but in the plasma.  Each of its states may be transferred to the daughter cells.  Also at every mictic reaction, the mictic potential is changed, as two antagonistic processes occur and generate the sinuoidal shape of the reaction.
   The mictic determination is a process, which sets up the mictic inductor in several steps by means of the energy supplied by an external impulse.  The intermediate steps admit only ameiotic oogenesis.  Only the final step stimulates meiosis.  As the intermediate steps can be inherited, the determination may drag on over some generations even without a new impulse.  It seems that occasionally it can start also spontaneously, i.e. without an external impulse.

AB  - Optimizing the water bonding network in an evaporator is significant for efficient solar-driven vapor generation (SVG). Herein, we report a facile one-pot method to regulate the hydrated structure and wettability in a hierarchical porous hydrogel. An ovalbumin (OVA)-polyacrylamide hydrogel foam was fabricated in a cake-making fashion. Because of the enrichment of amphiphilic OVA at the interface, the hydrophobic walls of the air pores in the foam provide vaporization sites and help reduce parasitic heat loss, while the hydrophilic skeleton with the secondary pores effectively pumps capillary water. Notably, the proportion of intermediate water in the foam reaches 87.6% with the melting point as low as -10 degrees C. All these features contribute to an exceptional evaporation rate of 3.4-4.5 kg m(-2) h(-1) under 1 sun and robust SVG performances at high-humidity, weak sunlight, or cold weathers. The strategy of using amphiphilic molecules to optimize the hydrated structures both at the interface and in bulk promises the reasonable design of SVG materials with superior efficiency and weather adaptability.

AB  - We investigated the vertical transmission, reproductive phenotype, and infection density of a male-killing Spiroplasma symbiont in two Drosophila species under physiological high and low temperatures through successive host generations. In both the native host Drosophila nebulosa and the nonnative host Drosophila melanogaster, the symbiont infection and the male-killing phenotype were stably maintained at 25 degrees C, rapidly lost at 18 degrees C, and gradually lost at 28 degrees C. In the nonnative host, both the high and low temperatures significantly suppressed the infection density of the spiroplasma. In the native host, by contrast, the low temperature suppressed the infection density of the spiroplasma whereas the high temperature had little effect on the infection density. These results suggested that the low temperature suppresses both the infection density and the vertical transmission of the spiroplasma whereas the high temperature suppresses the vertical transmission preferentially. The spiroplasma density was consistently higher in the native host than in the nonnative host, suggesting that the host genotype may affect the infection density of the symbiont. The temperature- and genotype-dependent instability of the symbiont infection highlights a complex genotype-by-genotype-by-environment interaction and may be relevant to the low infection frequencies of the male-killing spiroplasmas in natural Drosophila populations.

AB  - When reared in the greenhouse, the rice skipper, Pelopidas mathias (F.) (Lepidoptera:  Hesperiidae), laid 2-3 times fewer eggs than field collected females held under the same conditions.  Adult-emergence and mating/oviposition cages may have to be placed in environmental chambers with controlled temperature and photoperiod to achieve normal mating and oviposition.  Rearing required a mating/oviposition-cage at least 3 m3 in volume and honey as sustenance.  Eggs and larvae were held in larval rearing cages and pupae were removed and held in adult emergence cages.  Maximum oviposition occurred at dawn.  The total developmental period from egg to adult was 34.7 days.  P. mathias demonstrated a greater oviposition preference for rice and Paspalum conjugatum Berg. than for Dactyloctenium aegyptium (L.) Willd. P. mathias successfully developed to adulthood on all 24 species of Poaceae tested, exclusive of rice, but did not survive on the six species of Cyperaceae tested.  Low populations of P. mathias in rice can be attributed to its low fecundity, wide host range, and equal adaptability to upland and lowland environments, thus diluting its number.

AB  - Microorganisms play a key role not only in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem energy flow but also in maintaining ecosystem environmental quality. In fact, natural microbial communities harbour an amazing physiological versatility and catabolic potential for the breakdown of an enormous number of organic molecules, including synthetic compounds, thanks to their great adaptability to different conditions. They are able to colonize contaminated sites and metabolize some recalcitrant xenobiotics, for example pesticides and pharmaceuticals. In this way, microbial communities represent an important key to understanding the impacts of environmental and anthropogenic factors on ecosystems.
   Pollution may influence soil and water quality and productivity, but little is known on the effects on microbial communities, and consequent impacts on its functioning.
   Miniaturized ecosystems (microcosms) provide the advantage of allowing researchers to investigate under controlled conditions the effects of selective pressures, such as xenobiotic occurrence, on natural microbial communities.
   In this work we report the results of several microcosm studies, using natural soil and water samples, in which the environmental fate of several pesticides and pharmaceuticals in soil and water ecosystems has been evaluated. The natural attenuation capability of autochthonous microbial communities versus chemical contamination was evaluated comparing microbiologically active microcosms treated with each chemical with others previously sterilized. The degradation experiments were conducted under different natural conditions (e.g. temperature, light, humidity, etc.), including the occurrence of more stressors (e.g. co-presence of excess of nutrients or of other contaminants) in order to evaluate the fate and the effects of the chemicals in different environmental scenarios.
   The disappearance time of 50 % of the parent compound applied (DT50) was assessed for each chemical and condition. The overall results show the key role of microorganisms in the degradation of all chemicals studied and encourage the use of the microcosm approach for assessing more realistic environmental exposure scenarios and establishing the casual relationship between degradation and the role of microbial communities in chemical disappearance from the environment.

AB  - Climate extremes will elicit responses from the individual to the ecosystem level. However, only recently have ecologists begun to synthetically assess responses to climate extremes across multiple levels of ecological organization. We review the literature to examine how plant responses vary and interact across levels of organization, focusing on how individual, population and community responses may inform ecosystem-level responses in herbaceous and forest plant communities. We report a high degree of variability at the individual level, and a consequential inconsistency in the translation of individual or population responses to directional changes in community-or ecosystem-level processes. The scaling of individual or population responses to community or ecosystem responses is often predicated upon the functional identity of the species in the community, in particular, the dominant species. Furthermore, the reported stability in plant community composition and functioning with respect to extremes is often driven by processes that operate at the community level, such as species niche partitioning and compensatory responses during or after the event. Future research efforts would benefit from assessing ecological responses across multiple levels of organization, as this will provide both a holistic and mechanistic understanding of ecosystem responses to increasing climatic variability.

AB  - The European squid Loligo vulgaris is an important target species of commercial and recreational fisheries in the NW Mediterranean. Handline jigging is one of the most common fishing gears used by both of these fisheries to catch squid, which are trapped when they try to seize the lure with their tentacles. An unknown but possibly significant number of squid are able to escape from this gear by losing one or both of their tentacles (drop off rate). Between April and July 2010, two sets of experiments under controlled laboratory conditions were carried out to test (n = 15 squid) the indirect effects of tentacle loss on predation success and predation behaviour. The first set of experiments consisted of estimating the number of attacks and time spent until a squid with no (n = 5), one (n 5) or two tentacles (n = 5) successfully caught a prey item. Independent trials were carried out with two prey types with very different swimming capabilities (fish and shrimp). The second set of experiments consisted of prey-selectivity trials to determine whether squid prefer fish or shrimp when both are available. The results obtained clearly demonstrate not only that squid missing tentacles have a reduced predation performance but also that they can change predation preferences and predation behaviour. These changes might negatively affect the condition of injured squid (reduced fitness). Consequently, the possibility of squid losing their tentacles deserves more attention in the management decisions for the squid fishery. This indirect handline jigging effect may imply unreported fishing mortality (ghost fishing) that should be considered when making management decisions for this important fishery.

AB  - Electronic sensors mimicking the function of human skin are promising for the next generation of bionic skin. In this paper, we present a facile and novel approach to prepare an electronic sensor using a physically crosslinked protein hydrogel from egg white with the capability of incorporating conductive nanomaterials. The current strategy led to the formation of extraordinarily stretchable hydrogels in which their shear-thinning and self-healing properties further enabled direct ink writing 3D printing at room temperature, providing novel insights into the biosensor fabrication process. Furthermore, we enhanced the mechanical properties of these hydrogels by introducing secondary physical crosslinking to better resemble human skin. For electronic skin demonstration, a directly 3D printed sensor (EW-CNT sensor) was fabricated with embedding of carbon nanotubes and utilized to capture the delicate wrist pulse, distant reflection of index finger flexion, and respiration as well as vigorous finger bending. Notably, the radial augmentation index and stiffness index of the cardiovascular system could be clearly revealed by the EW-CNT sensor recording. Moreover, the EW hydrogel can be used to fabricate a reversible humidity actuator through a porous gradient architecture. The advantages of the current hydrogel platform including low cost, easy handling, and ease of fabrication for scale-up may open new horizons in the field of epidermal sensors and actuators.

AB  - Monarch butterflies are best known from their migratory North American range, although many resident, year-round breeding populations are established throughout the world. Here, we evaluate two non-exclusive hypotheses for the loss of migration in resident monarch populations: (1) absence of cues that trigger migration; and (2) loss of sensory, neural or physiological systems required for migration. To evaluate the first hypothesis, we exposed resident monarchs from Queensland, Australia to decreasing larval photoperiod and observed reproductive development in resulting females to assess their propensity to show reduced reproductive development, a precursor for long-distance migration. To address the second hypothesis, we measured antennal circadian clock gene expression, a crucial element of the monarch's ability to orientate directionally, in a resident and a migratory population. We found that Australian resident monarchs show reduced reproductive development in response to decreasing photoperiod, consistent with the 'loss of cues' hypothesis. We found no differences in antennal clock gene expression between migratory and resident populations, inconsistent with the 'loss of mechanism' hypothesis. Together, these data indicate that even after hundreds of generations of non-migration, monarchs retain two crucial elements of their migratory repertoire: developmental plasticity associated with decreasing photoperiod and antennal circadian rhythms necessary for directional orientation.

AB  - Metabolic flexibility is an important component of adaptation to stressful environments, including thermal stress and latitudinal adaptation. A long history of population genetic studies suggest that selection on core metabolic enzymes may shape life histories by altering metabolic flux. However, the direct relationship between selection on thermal stress hardiness and metabolic flux has not previously been tested. We investigated flexibility of nutrient catabolism during cold stress in Drosophila melanogaster artificially selected for fast or slow recovery from chill coma (i.e. cold-hardy or-susceptible), specifically testing the hypothesis that stress adaptation increases metabolic turnover. Using C-13-labelled glucose, we first showed that cold-hardy flies more rapidly incorporate ingested carbon into amino acids and newly synthesized glucose, permitting rapid synthesis of proline, a compound shown elsewhere to improve survival of cold stress. Second, using glucose and leucine tracers we showed that cold-hardy flies had higher oxidation rates than cold susceptible flies before cold exposure, similar oxidation rates during cold exposure, and returned to higher oxidation rates during recovery. Additionally, cold-hardy flies transferred compounds among body pools more rapidly during cold exposure and recovery. Increased metabolic turnover may allow cold-adapted flies to better prepare for, resist and repair/tolerate cold damage. This work illustrates for the first time differences in nutrient fluxes associated with cold adaptation, suggesting that metabolic costs associated with cold hardiness could invoke resource-based trade-offs that shape life histories.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are strongly impacted by extreme climate, and the age effects of radial growth under drought can provide profound understanding of the adaptation strategy of a tree species to climate change. Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana Fisch. & C.A. Mey) trees of three age groups (young, middle-aged, and old) were collected to establish the tree-ring width chronologies in the eastern Tianshan Mountains of northwestern China. Meanwhile, we analyzed and compared the response and resistance disparities of radial growth to drought in trees of different age groups. The results showed that (1) drought stress caused by increasing temperatures was the main factor limiting the radial growth of Schrenk spruce, (2) the old and young trees were more susceptible to drought stress than the middle-aged trees, as suggested by the responses of Schrenk spruce trees and based on the SPEI (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index), and (3) the difference of the resistance indexes (resistance, recovery, resilience, and relative resilience) of three age groups to drought supported that the resistance values were in the order middle age > young age > old age, but the recovery, resilience, and relative resilience values were in the order old age > young age > middle age. These results will provide a basis for the ecological restoration and scientific management of dominant coniferous tree species of different age groups in the sub-alpine forest ecosystems of the arid regions under climate change scenarios.

AB  - Previous laboratory studies on the cyclic parthenogen, Daphnia magna Straus, demonstrated marked differences in the survivorship and fecundity of clones in response to temperature. Here, I examine the extent to which similar ecological differentiation exists within a natural population by using isozymes as genetic markers to distinguish clonal groups. The frequency and fecundity (parthenogenetic and sexual) of Daphnia magna genotypes that were electrophoretically marked at the phosphoglucose isomerase locus (PGI, E. C. 5.3.1.9) were recorded for 2 years (July 1981-July 1983) at six sites within a lake. Fecundity was estimated by determining the absolute fecundity (mean number of parthenogenetic eggs per adult female) and reproductive ratios (the proportion of adult females with eggs) of each PGI genotype. There were extensive fluctuations in genotype frequency during each year, but changes were remarkably uniform throughout the lake, suggesting selective responses to seasonal variables. Two of the PGI genotypes (Pgi(110/110) and Pgi(100/100)) exhibited seasonal succession over 2 years, predominating respectively in summer and winter, and changes in frequency were significantly correlated with genotypic differences in parthenogenetic egg production. At certain times of the year, up to 10-fold differences in the relative fecundity of genotypes were recorded, suggesting marked ecological differentiation between PGI genotypes. The persistence of PGI fitness differences was checked by re-sampling the population in January and July 1987. Genotype frequencies and fecundities were in keeping with predictions based on original samples: high fitnesses of Pgi(110/110) and Pgi(100/100) genotypes in summer and winter respectively. Findings demonstrate rapid responses to selection pressures, which in the present population were adaptively significant.

AB  - CONSPECTUS: In recent years, a steadily growing number of chemists, from both academia and industry, have dedicated their research to the development of continuous flow processes performed in milli- or microreactors. The common availability of continuous flow equipment at virtually all scales and affordable cost has additionally impacted this trend. Furthermore, regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration actively encourage continuous manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with the vision of quality and productivity improvements. That is why the pharmaceutical industry is progressively implementing continuous flow technologies. As a result of the exceptional characteristics of continuous flow reactors such as small reactor volumes and remarkably fast heat and mass transfer, process conditions which need to be avoided in conventional batch syntheses can be safely employed. Thus, continuous operation is particularly advantageous for reactions at high temperatures/pressures (novel process windows) and for ultrafast, exothermic reactions (flash chemistry).
   In addition to conditions that are outside of the operation range of conventional stirred tank reactors, reagents possessing a high hazard potential and therefore not amenable to batch processing can be safely utilized (forbidden chemistry). Because of the small reactor volumes, risks in case of a failure are minimized. Such hazardous reagents often are low molecular weight compounds, leading generally to the most atom-, time-, and cost-efficient route toward the desired product. Ideally, they are generated from benign, readily available and cheap precursors within the closed environment of the flow reactor on-site on-demand. By doing so, the transport, storage, and handling of those compounds, which impose a certain safety risk especially on a large scale, are circumvented. This strategy also positively impacts the global supply chain dependency, which can be a severe issue, particularly in times of stricter safety regulations or an epidemic. The concept of the in situ production of a hazardous material is generally referred to as the "generator" of the material. Importantly, in an integrated flow process, multiple modules can be assembled consecutively, allowing not only an in-line purification/separation and quenching of the reagent, but also its downstream conversion to a nonhazardous product.
   For the past decade, research in our group has focused on the continuous generation of hazardous reagents using a range of reactor designs and experimental techniques, particularly toward the synthesis of APIs. In this Account, we therefore introduce chemical generator concepts that have been developed in our laboratories for the production of toxic, explosive, and short-lived reagents. We have defined three different classes of generators depending on the reactivity/stability of the reagents, featuring reagents such as Br-2, HCN, peracids, diazomethane (CH2N2), or hydrazoic acid (HN3). The various reactor designs, including in-line membrane separation techniques and real-time process analytical technologies for the generation, purification, and monitoring of those hazardous reagents, and also their downstream transformations are presented. This Account should serve as food for thought to extend the scope of chemical generators for accomplishing more efficient and more economic processes.

AB  - Energy sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L). Moench] is potentially of great significance for bioethanol production because of its high biomass and wide adaptability. In this study, a field experiment was conducted on a semiarid marginal land in Inner Mongolia (39 degrees 10'N, 109 degrees 53'E), China, to assess the effects of genotypes with similar growth duration and biomass yield levels on chemical composition and theoretical ethanol yield (TEY) in both leaves and stems of four genotypes each of sweet and biomass sorghum in 2013 and 2014. Among all varieties, no significant variation was observed in the biomass yield of leaf (1.81-2.55 Mg ha(-1)) and stem (3.73-4.87 Mg ha(-1)), which was relatively low due to the marginal land with low temperature conditions. By contrast, considerable variation was detected in soluble sugars, ash and hexose contents of leaves and stems among the sweet sorghum varieties over two years. Compared with the sweet type, biomass sorghum varieties exhibited significantly lower soluble sugars content but higher cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents in both leaf and stem tissues, resulting in significantly lower hexose and higher pentose contents. Moreover, stems exhibited significantly higher total content of hexose and pentose (725.4 g kg(-1)) than leaves (642.3 g kg(-1)) across all varieties, leading to significantly higher TEY of stems than that of leaves. Despite the slightly higher TEY of sweet sorghum, biomass sorghum varieties exhibited particularly stable chemical components and TEY across both experimental years, resulting in greater potential for industrial bioethanol production in this study. Overall, varietal selection was effective in improving the biomass feedstock quality of energy sorghum for biochemical conversion. The findings of this study will help to facilitate industrial bioethanol production from dedicated bioenergy crops.

AB  - The use of nanoscaled materials is rapidly increasing, however, their possible ecotoxicological effects are still not precisely known. This work constitutes the first complex study focused on in vivo evaluation of the acute and chronic toxic effects and toxic limits of silver nanoparticles (NPs) on the eukaryotic organism Drosophila melanogaster. For the purpose of this study, silver NPs were prepared in the form of solid dispersion using microencapsulation method, where mannitol was used as an encapsulation agent. This newly prepared solid dispersion with a high concentration of silver NPs was exploited to prepare the standard Drosophila culture medium at a silver concentration range from 10 mg . L-1 to 100 mg . L-1 of Ag in the case of the acute toxicity testing and at a concentration equal to S mg . L in the case of the chronic toxicity testing. The acute toxic effect of silver NPs on Drosophila melanogaster was observed for the silver concentration equal to 20 mg . L-1. At this silver concentration, 50% of the tested flies were unable to leave the pupae, and they did not finish their developmental cycle. Chronic toxicity of silver NPs was assessed by a long-term exposure of overall eight filial generations of Drosophila melanogaster to silver NPs. The long-term exposure to silver NPs influenced the fertility of Drosophila during the first three filial generations, nevertheless the fecundity of flies in subsequent generations consequently increased up to the level of the flies from the control sample due to the adaptability of flies to the silver NPs exposure.

AB  - Background/Aim: Functional and quantitative Treg cell defects have been identified in a variety of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, Tregs are a major pharmaceutical target for these disorders. In the last decades, studies have been mainly focused on the identification and experimental understanding of the activity of Tregs and their mechanisms of action. Materials and methods: This study describes how overnight storage of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in different media (PBS pH 7.3, PBS pH 7.3 containing 0.5% BSA, RPMI 1640 and RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS) affects the viability and expression of the commonly used markers for Tregs identification: CD25, CD127, CTLA-4, GITR, PD-1, FoxP3 and Helios. Results: Incorrectly selected storage conditions (temperature, time, medium) may affect the expression of surface and intracellular markers, thus, compromising the quality of the obtained results. Conclusion: Appropriate protocols of cell isolation and storage are important for providing appropriate conditions for cell growth. This is crucial when analyzing small cell populations like Tregs.

AB  - Mass mortality events in wild fish due to infectious diseases are troubling, especially given the potential for long-term, population-level consequences. Evolutionary theory predicts that populations with sufficient genetic variation will adapt in response to pathogen pressure. Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were introduced into Lake Michigan in the late 1960s from a Washington State hatchery population. In the late 1980s, collapse of the forage base and nutritional stress in Lake Michigan were thought to contribute to die-offs of Chinook Salmon due to bacterial kidney disease (BKD). Previously, we demonstrated that Lake Michigan Chinook Salmon from a Wisconsin hatchery have greater survival following BKD challenge relative to their progenitor population. Here, we evaluated whether the phenotypic divergence of these populations in BKD susceptibility was due to selection rather than genetic drift. Comparison of the overall magnitude of quantitative trait to neutral marker divergence between the populations suggested selection had occurred but a direct test of quantitative trait divergence was not significant, preventing the rejection of the null hypothesis of differentiation through genetic drift. Estimates of phenotypic variation (V-P ), additive genetic variation (V-A ) and narrow-sense heritability (h (2)) were consistently higher in the Wisconsin relative to the Washington population. If selection had acted on the Wisconsin population there was no evidence of a concomitant loss of genetic variation in BKD susceptibility. The Renibacterium salmoninarum exposures were conducted at both 14 degrees C and 9 degrees C; the warmer temperature accelerated time to death in both populations and there was no evidence of phenotypic plasticity or a genotype-by-environment (G x E) interaction. High h (2) estimates for BKD susceptibility in the Wisconsin population, combined with a lack of phenotypic plasticity, predicts that future adaptive gains in BKD resistance are still possible and that these adaptive gains would be stable under the temperature range evaluated here.

AB  - Rocky retreats are limited and geologically constrained resources for rock-dwelling nocturnal lizards. Such lizards should seek retreats that offer thermoregulatory benefits without the risk of overheating during the day, and that protect from predation. For cold-adapted species where air temperature is frequently lower than optimum temperature for performance, factors influencing retreat-site selection and whether future warmer conditions will force superficial rock slabs to be abandoned on hot days remain poorly known. Here, we predicted that retreats selected by a nocturnally foraging, cool-temperate gecko from southern New Zealand would be thermally heterogeneous and that future warmer temperature will force lizards to abandon daytime retreats on hot days. We sampled loose rock slabs (potential retreats) in a tussock-grassland site in all seasons. We measured seasonal rock temperature profiles and field body temperature (Tb) of captured geckos using thermography and quantified the physical characteristics of each potential retreat. We found that both physical characteristics and rock temperatures determine choice of retreats. Field Tb of lizards positively correlated with retreat and air temperatures. Also, retreat temperatures, including those of the substrate below the rock slabs, showed complex heterogeneity enabling lizards to choose microsites within retreats to achieve preferred body temperatures intermittently. Observed seasonal shifts in characteristics of occupied rocks imply that lizards choose retreats to maximise warmth in spring, minimise risk of overheating (remain below voluntary thermal maximum, VTmax) in summer and avoid freezing over winter. Our study demonstrates the importance of microclimatic conditions in influencing retreat-site selection. Climate warming might lead to seasonal changes in use of rock slabs and possibly be beneficial initially, but longer-term implications need to be examined.

AB  - Three strains of Vibrio vulnificus were evaluated for their potential to become acid adapted in tryptic soy broth with 2% NaCl acidified using hydrochloric (pH 5.0), citric or acetic acids (pH 5.5). Control and adapted cells were subsequently evaluated for acid tolerance (pH 3.5) in broths acidified with each acid, respectively. Other cross-protective effects: heat tolerance, cold storage survival, and freeze-thaw resistance were evaluated with cells exposed to broths acidified with hydrochloric acid. Acid adaptation was observed with hydrochloric and citric acids (P < 0.05) and was dependent on strain, duration of adaptation time, and acid type. The most pronounced acid adaptation response was with hydrochloric acid, regardless of strain (P < 0.05). Treatment with chloramphenicol eliminated the acid tolerance response. The three strains were inactivated within 12 min at 47degreesC with or without acid adaptation. Acid adaptation increased freeze-thaw resistance and cold storage survival for one strain following 10h acid adaptation (P < 0.05). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current Venus tectonics suggests a stagnant lid mode of mantle convection. However, the planet is debated to enter an episodic regime after long quiescent periods, driven by resurfacing due to rapid subduction and global crustal recycling. Tessera regions that cover approximately 10% of Venus' surface appear to be strongly deformed, which suggests that they have survived at least the latest resurfacing event, although the composition and age of the tesserae are unknown. Based on mantle convection modeling, we studied the effects of anomalous crustal provinces (ACPs) on mantle dynamics and postoverturn lithospheric survival. As a hypothesis, we assume ACPs to be thick, compositionally anomalous, and rheologically strong units, similar to terrestrial cratons. We model Venus with a varying number of preimposed ACP units and differing lithospheric yield stress in 2-D and 3-D spherical geometry. The impact of ACPs on mantle dynamics and the survival of lithosphere is investigated by examining the thermal evolution, crustal thickness, and surface age distribution. We find that the number and timing of overturns are highly dependent on the yield stress and, to some degree, on the number and size of the preimposed ACPs. ACPs in particular affect the wavelength of convection and may foster the survival of lithosphere even of those portions not being part of an ACP. However, ACPs do not seem to be a good analog for tessera regions due to their exaggerated age and (likely) thickness, but-with appropriate density contrast-may be more useful representatives of Venus' highland plateaus.

AB  - In recent years, infectious disease caused by Streptococcus agalactiae has increased in aquaculture, threatening the healthy development of tilapia and resulting in substantial economic losses. Cultivating disease-resistant tilapia by transgenic technology is one strategy that has been developed to address this issue. Here, we used a transposon system to investigate gene expression and tissue lytic activity in transgenic zebrafish expressing the tilapia lysozyme. The transpose vector contained the Tgf2 transposon skeleton, tilapia heat shock protein 70 promoter (Hsp70) and two target genes (tilapia C-type lysozyme 3 [lysozyme-C3] and green fluorescent protein [GFP]). The transgenic zebrafish F-0 generation was obtained by microinjecting the donor vector and transposase mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs. There was 45% green fluorescence in the zebrafish F-0 generation, which was spread over the entire body based on microscope observation. The F-0 generation was reared to sexual maturity, at which point individuals were mated with wild-type zebrafish to produce the F-1 generation. Tilapia lysozyme-C3 expression was detected in the liver of F-1 generation by RT-PCR and western blotting, but was not detected in the skin, intestine, or muscle. Significantly higher liver bacteriolysis activity was detected in transgenic zebrafish compared with wild-type zebrafish. Therefore, transgenic zebrafish may have an increased potential for bacterial resistance.

AB  - This is the first study to evaluate the survival potential of cold-adapted Listeria monocytogenes in ice-cream. Cold adaptation enhances survival of this pathogen in ice-cream during the first period of storage compared to non-adapted cells. The viable population of cold-adapted and non-adapted cells was 3 log (36 days) and 4.3 log (27 days), respectively, lower than the initial population (6.3 log) in inoculated ice-cream. This behavior raises concerns for food safety. The viable population of both cold-and non-adapted cells displayed a slight statistical difference in the next period of frozen storage (0.29 and 0.75 log decline at 137 and 182 days, respectively). Significant numbers of L. monocytogenes cells survived for extended periods of time, irrespective of whether they were previously cold-or non-adapted (332 and 182 days respectively). The natural additives utilized (fructose syrup, corn syrup, sesame oil and sesame paste) did not have any significant effect on the response of non-adapted L. monocytogenes in ice-cream during 182 days of storage. On the other hand, the survival of cold-adapted L. monocytogenes is influenced by the ingredients utilized in the ice cream. Sesame paste and corn syrup had an inhibitory action on cold-adapted L. monocytogenes throughout the frozen storage (332 days) possibly as a consequence of lower water activity in samples with these additives.

AB  - The effect of protectant solids (lactose, sodium caseinate, and their mixture) on the survival of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris was studied in a convective-air-drying environment using single droplet drying. The effect of drying the bacteria in the presence or absence of sodium ascorbate was evaluated, and the evolution of glass transition temperature in the drying process was examined. It was found that the protective efficiency of lactose and sodium caseinate was comparable at the concentrations tested. A mixed protectant matrix (lactose:sodium caseinate, 3:1) gave higher survival than with lactose or sodium caseinate alone at the same total solids level. Protectants enhanced bacterial survival by moderating the drying rate and achieving dryness at lower temperatures, and by facilitating the formation of a glassy matrix earlier in the drying process. The addition of sodium ascorbate was also examined.

TI  - Continuous Synthesis of a High Energetic Substance Using Small Scale Reactors
T2  - ICHEAP-11: 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CHEMICAL AND PROCESS ENGINEERING, PTS 1-4
LA  - English
CP  - 11th International Conference on Chemical and Process Engineering (ICheaP)
AB  - For the industrial production of chemicals a safe process design is required to avoid harm to people and environment. It becomes tremendous important if one or more of the following points are characteristic for the synthesis: high heat release, explosive atmosphere, presence of toxic and/or of thermal unstable substances. One substance group, known for being unstable, is the group of organic peroxides. They are potential high energetic substances. Many syntheses of organic peroxides are carried out in semi-batch mode to control the heat release in a good manner. With the aim to increase process control, the advantages of continuous reaction mode, combined with micro reaction technology, are used for the synthesis of one specific organic peroxide in this work.
   This approach is not only characterised by shorter residence time, good heat transfer, but also by smaller quantities of managed chemicals, and, therefore, by a lower hazard potential. Often yield and selectivity can be improved additionally.
   For the study a peroxyester, namely tert-Butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate (TBPEH), with known thermal hazard potential was chosen. The two phase liquid/liquid reaction was carried out in three types of reactors. A small scale tubular reactor, stressed by ultrasound, and two different micro structured reactors were used. One of them had a meandering and the other a split-and-recombine channel structure. Synthesis temperature was also varied.
   From preliminary studies it was known that the side reaction of the involved carboxylic acid chloride to the corresponding acid can become more important in continuous mode compared to semi-batch mode. The effect of reactor type and temperature on selectivity and therefore yield of TBPEH was analysed and compared.
   In result the reaction could be carried out in a safe manner. The high heat-exchanging efficiency of the used reactors and the short residence time allowed synthesis temperature near the onset temperature of decomposition of TBPEH. In relation to the results of the capillary tube and of the reactor with meandering channel structure (MR), the results for the split-and-recombine reactor (SAR) showed the best trend line. Further studies have to underline the result. Compared to the traditional reaction path (the semi-batch mode), a higher space time yield could be achieved. This promising information is accompanied by the fact of low reaction volumes. In consequence the productivity is low without a numbering up of reaction channels or a scaling up of it. The nowadays existing philosophy of producing a specific quantity of product by a company, followed by the transport to the costumer may change. Just organic peroxides, used in small quantities, e. g. as initiators for polymerisation processes or as resin hardeners, provide the opportunity for an on-demand-production.

AB  - A laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of four constant temperatures (18, 22, 26, and 30-degrees-C) and three fluctuating temperatures (diel fluctuations of +/- 2.5-degrees-C around 18, 22, and 26-degrees-C) on early development and survival of Colorado squawfish Ptychocheilus lucius, which is listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Department of the interior. Average hatch in constant and fluctuating temperatures was 72% at 18-degrees-C, 67% at 22-degrees-C, 62% at 26-degrees-C, and 38% (constant temperature only) at 30-degrees-C. There was no significant difference in hatch between constant and fluctuating temperatures. Average survival of larvae to 7 d posthatch in constant and fluctuating temperatures was 68% at 18-degrees-C, 64% at 22-degrees-C, 83% at 26-degrees-C, and 13% (constant temperature only) at 30-degrees-C. Survival of larvae at 30-degrees-C may have been confounded by a relatively low hatch of embryos and poor condition of larvae. Survival of larvae was 10-31% higher in fluctuating than in constant temperatures. Incidence of abnormalities was 2-22% at 18-26-degrees-C and 100% al 30-degrees-C. Differences in abnormality rates were not detectable between constant and fluctuating temperatures. Times to start of hatch, swim bladder inflation, and exogenous feeding were shorter at higher temperatures. First feeding occurred about 31 h earlier in fluctuating temperatures than in constant temperatures. Differences in lengths of larvae at hatching and on day 7 posthatch at the various test temperatures were small and not considered ecologically significant. Tolerance of a relatively wide range of high water temperatures by Colorado squawfish embryos and larvae may reflect the historically variable Colorado River environments in which the species evolved. Low summer water temperatures caused by mainstream dams have eliminated Colorado squawfish from portions of its historic range in the Colorado River basin. Water temperatures that more closely reflect historic regimes are necessary to restore self-sustaining populations of Colorado squawfish in those areas.

AB  - Temperature variability is predicted to increase in the coming century due to climate change. However, the biological impact of increased temperature variability on animals remains largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally exposed gravid viviparous lizards (Eremias multiocellata) to two thermal environments [constant daily maximum (CDM) versus variable daily maximum (VDM) treatment with the same average temperature] to address maternal and offspring responses to increased variability in ambient temperature. Females from the VDM treatment delayed parturition, but produced similar litter sizes and litter masses as did CDM females. Offspring from the VDM treatment selected higher body temperatures, had higher metabolic rates and higher growth rates, and grew to a similar size as those from the CDM treatment despite having a shorter growth period prior to hibernation. Therefore, phenotypic plasticity may be critical for lizards to respond effectively to climate change, and its role in responding to increasingly variable temperatures warrants further attention.

AB  - Handling animals during experiments potentially affects the differential expression of genes chosen as biomarkers of sub-lethal stress. RNA sequencing was used to examine whole-transcriptome responses caused by laboratory handling of the calanoid copepod, Acartia tonsa. Salinity shock (S = 35 to S = 5) was used as positive stress control; individuals not exposed to handling or other stressors served as negative stress control. All copepods were grown from eggs to adults without being handled or exposed to any stressors prior the experiment. Survival of nauplii and adults was estimated for up to 10 min of exposure to handling stress and salinity shock. Only adults exhibited decreased survival (44 +/- 7% with 10 min of exposure) in response to handling stress and were selected for definitive experiments for RNA sequencing. After 10 min of experimental exposures to handling stress or salinity shock, adults were incubated for 15 min or 24 h at normal culture conditions. A small number of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed 15 min after exposure to handling stress (2 DEGs) or salinity shock (7 DEGs). However, 24 h after exposure, handling stress resulted in 276 DEGs and salinity shock resulted in 573 DEGs, of which 174 DEGs were overlapping between the treatments. Among the DEGs observed 24 h after exposure to handling stress or salinity shock, some commonly-used stress biomarkers appeared at low levels. This suggests that a stress-response was induced at the transcriptional level for these genes between 15 min and 24 h following exposure. Since handling stress clearly affects transcriptional patterns, it is important to consider handling when designing experiments, by either including additional controls or avoiding focus on impacted genes. Not considering handling in gene expression studies can lead to inaccurate conclusions. The present study provides a baseline for studying handling stress in future studies using this model organism and others.

AB  - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) are at a fraction of their historical abundance, creating economic hardships for fishermen and putting at risk the genetic diversity of the remaining populations. An understanding of the biocomplexity among GoM populations will allow for adaptive genetic diversity to be conserved to maximize the evolutionary potential and resilience of the fishery in a rapidly changing environment. We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to characterize the population structure and adaptive genetic diversity of five spawning aggregations from the western GoM and Georges Bank. We also analyzed cod caught in the eastern GoM, an under-sampled area where spawning aggregations have been extirpated. Using 3,128 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we confirmed the existence of three genetically separable spawning groups: (1) winter spawning cod from the western GoM, (2) spring spawning cod, also from the western GoM, and (3) Georges Bank cod. Non-spawning cod from the eastern GoM could not be decisively linked to either of the three spawning groups and may represent a unique component of the resource, a mixed sample, or cod from other unsampled source populations. The genetic differentiation among the three major spawning groups was primarily driven by loci putatively under selection, particularly loci in regions known to contain genomic inversions on linkage groups (LG) 7 and 12. These LGs have been found to be linked to thermal regime in cod across the Atlantic, and so it is possible that variation in timing of spawning in western GoM cod has resulted in temperature-driven adaptive divergence. This complex population structure and adaptive genetic differentiation could be crucial to ensuring the long-term productivity and resilience of the cod fishery, and so it should be considered in future management plans.

AB  - A 150 km length, 6-second deep, seismic line across the west central and north parts of the South Caspian Basin was used to construct quantitative dynamical, thermal and hydrocarbon evolution patterns. The depth of the west part of the 2-D section of the South Caspian Basin is almost 30 km. The computer program GEOPETII was used to provide quantitative evolution models. The procedure provided an opportunity to investigate the development dynamics of: excess fluid pressure, porosity retention, rock fracturing, compaction, heat transfer, maturity, generation pressure, kinetic hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation, together with solubility effects on hydrocarbon transport. The results suggest that: (i) Temperature is 350-400 degrees C in the deepest part of the section at a depth of 26-29 km; (ii) The highest values of excess pressure (nearly twice hydrostatic fluid pressure) are in Jurassic and Cretaceous formations in the west part of the section, which has now subsided to a depth of about 20-27 km; (iii) Major oil and gas generation began in the last 10-5 MYBP, the migration in free-phase and in water solution occurring dominantly in the last few million years; (iv) Trapping of hydrocarbons took place mainly, but not exclusively, in the 3-9 km depth interval in the sands of the Productive Series of the Pliocene, embedded in a shale sequence; (v) Oil and gas filling of the shallow reservoirs by oil and gas is on-going today, indicating an extremely high productivity for any reservoir found in the offshore area; (vi) There is overlap with depth of oil and gas reservoirs, and the total amount of hydrocarbons estimated to be trapped is considerable; (vii) The high overpressure expected makes for a drilling hazard, but one which it is worthwhile to overcome if the anticipated oil and gas accumulations are encountered.

AB  - A valid assessment of selective aerobic degradation on organic matter (OM) and its impact on OM-based proxies is vital to produce accurate environmental reconstructions. However, most studies investigating these effects suffer from inherent environmental heterogeneities. In this study, we used surface samples collected along two meter-scale transects and one longer transect in the northeastern Arabian Sea to constrain initial OM heterogeneity, in order to evaluate selective aerobic degradation on temperature, productivity and alteration indices at the sediment-water interface. All of the studied alteration indices, the higher plant alkane index, alcohol preservation index, and diol oxidation index, demonstrated that they are sensitive indicators for changes in the oxygen regime. Several export production indices, a cholesterol-based stanol/stenol index and dinoflagellate lipid- and cyst-based ratios, showed significant (more than 20%) change only over the lateral oxygen gradients. Therefore, these compounds do not exclusively reflect surface water productivity, but are significantly altered after deposition. Two of the proxies, glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether-based TEX86 sea surface temperature indices and indices based on phytol, phytane and pristane, did not show any trends related to oxygen. Nevertheless, unrealistic sea surface temperatures were obtained after application of the TEX86, TEX86L, and TEX86H proxies. The phytol-based ratios were likely affected by the sedimentary production of pristane. Our results demonstrate the selective impact of aerobic organic matter degradation on the lipid and palynomorph composition of surface sediments along a short lateral oxygen gradient and suggest that some of the investigated proxies may be useful tracers of changing redox conditions at the sediment-water interface.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in diatoms has been shown to play a key role in species' responses to several important environmental factors such as light, salinity, temperature and nutrients. Furthermore, modelling efforts indicate that this variation within species extends bloom periods, and likely provides sufficient variability in competitive interactions between species under hydrographically variable conditions. The intraspecific variation most likely corresponds to optimal fitness in temporary microhabitats and may help to explain the paradox of the plankton. Here, we examine the implications of intraspecific variation for the ecology and success of diatoms in general and emphasize the potential implications for our understanding of carbon metabolism in these important organisms. Additionally, data from palaeoecological studies have the potential for evaluating genetic variation through past climate changes, going thousands of years back in time. We suggest pathways for future research including the adoption of multiple strains of individual species into studies of diatom carbon metabolism, to refine our understanding of the variation within and between species, and the inclusion of experimental evolution as a tool for understanding potential evolutionary responses of diatom carbon metabolism to climate change.

AB  - I examined variation in the temperature distribution of American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence using data from bottom trawl surveys conducted each September since 1971. Plaice tended to select cold temperatures relative to those available. Temperature distribution was unrelated to age over the range 3-12(+)years. Females tended to occupy warmer water than males, although the extent of this difference between the sexes varied among years. Annual variation in plaice temperature distribution was positively correlated with variation in the temperatures available. After accounting for annual variation in available temperatures, female temperature distribution was density independent but males tended to occupy colder water at higher levels of abundance. The median temperature occupied by both sexes tended to be warmer at higher levels of abundance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a competitor of plaice. The difference between the sexes in temperature distribution increased as cod abundance decreased or as plaice abundance increased (depending on the measure of temperature distribution used). The observed difference between the sexes in temperature distribution and its density dependence may reflect differences in foraging rate associated with differences between the sexes in the fitness benefits of growth.

AB  - In response to climate change a species may move, adapt, or go extinct. For the adaptability of a population its genetic diversity is essential, but climate change-induced range shifts can cause a loss of genetic diversity. We investigated how landscape structure affects the level and distribution of genetic diversity in metapopulations subject to climate change-induced range shifts. For this we used the spatially explicit, individual-based model METAPHOR which simulates metapopulation demography and genetics under different temperature increase scenarios. The results indicated that increasing total habitat area may enhance the maintenance of the genetic diversity in metapopulations while they are shifting their range under climate change. However, the results also showed that a high level of total habitat area did not prevent the populations in the newly colonised habitat area of being depleted of much of the original genetic diversity. We therefore conclude that enhancing landscape connectivity may lead to a delayed loss of genetic diversity in metapopulations under climate change, but that additional measures would be necessary to ensure its long-term conservation. Importantly, our simulations also show that a landscape which could be regarded as well-structured under stable climatic conditions, may be inferior for the conservation of genetic diversity during a range shift. This is important information for landscape management when developing strategies for the in situ conservation of genetic variation in natural populations under climate change.

AB  - Extreme climatic events that are expected under global warming expose forest ecosystems to drought stress, which may affect the growth and productivity. We assessed intra-annual growth responses of trees to soil water content in species belonging to different functional groups of tree-ring porosity. We pose the hypothesis that species with contrasting carbon allocation strategies, which emerge from different relationships between wood traits and canopy architecture, display divergent growth responses to drought. We selected two diffuse-porous species (Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis) and two ring-porous species (Quercus rubra and Fraxinus americana) from the mixed forest of Quebec (Canada). We measured anatomical wood traits and canopy architecture in eight individuals per species and assessed tree growth sensitivity to water balance during 2008-2017 using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Stem elongation in diffuse-porous species mainly depended upon the total number of ramifications and hydraulic diameter of the tree-ring vessels. In ring-porous species, stem elongation mainly depended upon the productivity of the current year, i.e., number of vessels and basal area increment. Diffuse-porous and ring-porous species had similar responses to soil water balance. The effect of soil water balance on tree growth changed during the growing season. In April, decreasing soil temperature linked to wet conditions could explain the negative relationship between SPEI and tree growth. In late spring, greater water availability affected carbon partitioning, by promoting the formation of larger xylem vessels in both functional groups. Results suggest that timings and duration of drought events affect meristem growth and carbon allocation in both functional groups. Drought induces the formation of fewer xylem vessels in ring-porous species, and smaller xylem vessels in diffuse-porous species, the latter being also prone to a decline in stem elongation due to a reduced number of ramifications. Indeed, stem elongation of diffuse-porous species is influenced by environmental conditions of the previous year, which determine the total number of ramifications during the current year. Drought responses in different functional groups are thus characterized by different drivers, express contrasting levels of resistance or resilience, but finally result in an overall similar loss of productivity.

AB  - In a context of global change, climate impacts can trigger defoliation processes in different forest species. The ICP Forests network estimates the level of forest defoliation over time in different European countries. Those data are used to related defoliation with potential causal factors. In European Southwestern forests, climate change appears to be the detonating factor of generalized defoliation. The objectives of this study were: (i) identity defoliation trends in forest trees at network of Spanish ICP Forests monitoring plots and, (ii) find out if there are underlying climate factors that trigger defoliation process along the time.
   The spatiotemporal synchronization of the defoliation response was analyzed with cross-correlation using COFECHA software. The relationship between the 88 climatic variables proposed and defoliation was analyzed using Correlated Component Regression models (CCR models) and Discriminant Analysis (DA). The significance of the variables in each model was compared using contingency tables. A peak of defoliation was observed in the mid-1990s with no recovered to the initial values of the early 1990s. The behavior of the different tree species with respect to defoliation, synchronized both in time and space, involves one or several factors that have a general and similar effect on forests in Spain. The most significant factors related to defoliation were the thermal-related factors, particularly average temperatures in April and June and the thermal oscillation of both the current year and the previous year. Only one drought indicator as statistically significant was identified (A, duration of aridity in months) and suggests that it is of limited relevance in the Spanish forest defoliation conditions.

AB  - Background: Photobacteriosis is an infectious disease developed by a Gram-negative bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp), which may cause high mortalities (90-100%) in sea bream. Selection and breeding for resistance against infectious diseases is a highly valuable tool to help prevent or diminish disease outbreaks, and currently available advanced selection methods with the application of genomic information could improve the response to selection. An experimental group of sea bream juveniles was derived from a Ferme Marine de Douhet (FMD, Oleron Island, France) selected line using similar to 109 parents (similar to 25 females and 84 males). This group of 1187 individuals represented 177 full-sib families with 1-49 sibs per family, which were challenged with virulent Phdp for a duration of 18 days, and mortalities were recorded within this duration. Tissue samples were collected from the parents and the recorded offspring for DNA extraction, library preparation using 2b-RAD and genotyping by sequencing. Genotypic data was used to develop a linkage map, genome wide association analysis and for the estimation of breeding values.
   Results: The analysis of genetic variation for resistance against Phdp revealed moderate genomic heritability with estimates of similar to 0.32. A genome-wide association analysis revealed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) including 11 SNPs at linkage group 17 presenting significant association to the trait with p-value crossing genome-wide Bonferroni corrected threshold P <= 2.22e-06. The proportion total genetic variance explained by the single top most significant SNP was ranging from 13.28-16.14% depending on the method used to compute the variance. The accuracies of predicting breeding values obtained using genomic vs. pedigree information displayed 19-24% increase when using genomic information.
   Conclusion: The current study demonstrates that SNPs-based genotyping of a sea bream population with 2b-RAD approach is effective at capturing the genetic variation for resistance against Phdp. Prediction accuracies obtained using genomic information were significantly higher than the accuracies obtained using pedigree information which highlights the importance and potential of genomic selection in commercial breeding programs.

AB  - In the present study, FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the freeze-thaw cycle of two cellular lines (HuDe and Jurkat) suspended in three different media: phosphate buffer solution (PBS); dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/ PBS solution at 0.1 DMSO molar fraction; and CryoSure (0.1 DMSO molar fraction PBS solution + dextran 5% w/v) solution. The Trypan Blue test was also applied before freezing and after thawing each cell sample to estimate the recovery of membrane integrity after thermal treatment, and correlate this datum with spectroscopic results. By following the temperature evolution of two different spectral components (the libration and bending combination mode v(c)(H2O) at 2000-2500 cm(-1), and the methylene symmetric stretching vibration v(sym)(CH2) at about 2850 cm(-1)) in the -120 divided by 28 degrees C range, we evidenced the main transition of lipid membrane in connection with cell dehydration, as induced by ice formation in the extracellular medium. In particular, in DMSO/PBS and CryoSure samples we observed a transition to a more rigid state of the lipid membrane together with an increased amount of non-freezable water in the extracellular medium; these results are connected to the role of DMSO as a cryoprotective agent irrespective of the nature of cell type.

AB  - Nickel-based superalloys, used extensively in advanced gas turbine engines, exhibit complex microstructures that evolve during exposure to high temperatures (i.e., aging treatments). In this work, we examine critically if the principal component (PC) representation of rotationally invariant 2-point spatial correlations can adequately capture the salient features of the microstructure evolution in the thermal aging of the superalloys. For this purpose, an experimental study involving microstructure characterization of 27 differently aged (i.e., different combinations of temperature and time of exposure) samples was designed and conducted. Of these, 23 samples were employed for training a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model that took the aging temperature and the aging time as inputs, and predicted the microstructure statistics as output. The viability of the approach described above was evaluated critically by comparing the predictions for the four samples that were not used in the training of the GPR model. Furthermore, a new strategy was developed and implemented to generate digital microstructures corresponding to the predicted microstructure statistics. The predicted microstructures were found to be in good agreement with the experimentally measured one, validating the novel framework presented in this work. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB  - Hybrids have often been labelled evolutionary dead-ends due to their lower fertility and viability. However, there is growing awareness that hybridisation between different species may play a constructive role in animal evolution as a means to create variability. Thus, hybridisation and introgression may contribute to adaptive evolution, for example with regards to natural antagonists (parasites, predators, competitors) and adaptation to local environmental conditions. Here we investigated whether parasite intensity contributes to the continuous recreation of hybrids in 74 natural populations of Melanopsis, a complex of freshwater snails with three species. We also examined, under laboratory conditions, whether hybrids and their parental taxa differ in their tolerance of low and high temperatures and salinity levels. Infections were consistently less prevalent in males than in females, and lower in snails from deeper habitats. Infection prevalence in hybrids was significantly lower than in the parental taxa. Low hybrid infection rates could not be explained by sediment type, snail density or geographic distribution of the sampling sites. Interestingly, infected hybrid snails did not show signs of parasite-induced gigantism, whereas all parental taxa did. We found that hybrids mostly coped with extreme temperatures and salinity levels as well as their parental taxa did. Taken together, our results suggest that Melanopsis hybrids perform better in the presence of parasites and environmental stress. This may explain the widespread and long-term occurrence of Melanopsis hybrids as evidenced by paleontological and biogeographic data. Hybridisation may be an adaptive host strategy, reducing infection rates and resisting gigantism. (C) 2014 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Different thermotherapeutic modalities such as transurethral microwave therapy or transurethral needle ablation have been developed to provide effective alternatives to surgical management of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The mechanisms of thermotherapy, however, are not completely understood. We developed a model to investigate the effects of heat application on stromal cell viability and contractility.
   Methods: Cells isolated from prostatectomy and cystoprostatectomy specimens were cultured in a selective medium. Temperatures ranging from 37 to 50 degrees C were applied for 1 h. Cell contraction was visualized by means of a cell culture microscope equipped with a time-lapse video system. For quantitative analysis, the percentage of contracting cells was evaluated; 10 mu M of phenylepherine were applied for adrenergic stimulation of the eel Is.
   Results: On immunohistochemistry and phase-contrast microscopy, these cells were identified as prostatic myofibroblasts. Incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h in vitro induced immediate death of all cells, whereas at 45 degrees C a II cells survived. At 37 degrees C 55% of the cells were seen to contract after addition of phenylephrine. Immediately after incubation at 45 degrees C contraction rate decreased to 29%, but returned to 46% 1 day later.
   Conclusions: With this model, it is possible to study the mechanisms of thermotherapy in vitro. The results suggest that the effects of thermotherapy are due to the induction of cell death rather than to reduced stromal cell contractility. Furthermore, the data show that treatment is probably only successful if temperatures in excess of 50 degrees C are maintained. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Field body temperature records from seven species of Thamnophis were used to investigate intrageneric variation of body temperature selection under field conditions. There was no evidence for geographic or interspecific variation of thermal preferenda in Thamnophis. Major factors imposing constraints or influencing body temperature were found to be season, weather, macrohabitat, time of day, reproductive status, and activity type. After controlling for these factors, field-selected body temperatures converged on an apparent intragenerically stable preferendum near 30 C, with means ranging from 28.04-30.53 C for the study populations. Observations on thermoregulatory behavior suggest that behavioral adjustments compensate for thermal differences among habitats and across latitude.  Review of the literature revealed that intrageneric variation of PBT in snakes has yet to be demonstrated unequivocally. The potential significance of, and possible reasons for, the conservatism of PBT in snakes are discussed in terms of stabilizing selection and plasticity of activity timing in the diel cycle.

AB  - Low temperature influences multiple physiological processes in fish. To explore the adaptability of the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) to low temperature, the concentrations of glycerol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and triglycerides (TG) in plasma, as well as the expression levels of metabolism-related genes aqp7 and aqp10, were measured after exposure to low temperature stress and during subsequent rewarming. In addition, tissue samples from the intestine and liver were histologically analyzed. We found that the concentrations of plasma glycerol, BUN, and TG, decreased under low temperature stress, suggesting the metabolism of fat and protein slowed at low temperature. The expression levels of aqp7 and aqp10 mRNA were also downregulated under exposure to low temperature. Interestingly, above plasma indices and gene expression returned to basic levels within 24 h after rewarming. Furthermore, the liver and the intestine were damaged under continuous low temperature stress, whereas they were repaired upon rewarming. From the above results, we concluded that aqp7 and aqp10 genes were sensitive to low temperature, and that the decrease in their expression levels at low temperature might reduce energy consumption by L. crocea. However, the adaptation to low temperature was limited because the key metabolic tissues were damaged under continuous exposure to low temperature. Interestingly, the metabolism of L. crocea was basically back to normal within 24 h of rewarming, showing that it has high capacity of self-recovery.

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)) is an insect that can adapt to various challenges, including temperature fluctuations or select insecticide treatments. This pest is also an ongoing threat to the potato industry. Small noncoding RNAs such as miRNAs, which can control posttranscriptionally the expression of various genes, and piRNAs, which can notably impact mRNA turnover, are modulated in insects under different conditions. Unfortunately, information regarding the expression status of key players involved in their synthesis and function is for the most part lacking. The current study thus aims at assessing the levels of such targets in L. decemlineata exposed to hot and cold temperatures as well as treated to the insecticides chlorantraniliprole, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and spinosad. Transcript expression levels of Ago1, Ago2, Ago3, Dcr2a, Dcr2b, Expo-5, Siwi-1, and Siwi-2, components of pathways associated with small noncoding RNA production or function, were measured by qRT-PCR and revealed modulation of select transcripts in response to temperature challenges and to select insecticides. RNAi-mediated reduction of Ago2 transcript levels in L. decemlineata injected with Ago2-targeting dsRNA and exposed to cold and warm temperatures was also conducted. Changes in survival rates were observed for the latter condition in dsRNA- versus saline-injected insects. These results showcase the differential expression of select targets involved in small noncoding RNA homeostasis and provide leads for the subsequent assessment of their involvement during stress response in L. decemlineata using RNAi-based approaches.

AB  - Insects have evolved numerous adaptations and colonized diverse terrestrial environments. Several polyneopterans, including dictyopterans (cockroaches and mantids) and locusts, have developed oothecae, but little is known about the molecular mechanism, physiological function, and evolutionary significance of ootheca formation. Here, we demonstrate that the cockroach asymmetric colleterial glands produce vitellogenins, proline-rich protein, and glycine-rich protein as major ootheca structural proteins (OSPs) that undergo sclerotization and melanization for ootheca formation through the cooperative protocatechuic acid pathway and dopachrome and dopaminechrome subpathway. Functionally, OSP sclerotization and melanization prevent eggs from losing water at warm and dry conditions, and thus effectively maintain embryo viability. Dictyopterans and locusts convergently evolved vitellogenins, apolipoprotein D, and laminins as OSPs, whereas within Dictyoptera, cockroaches and mantids independently developed glycine-rich protein and fibroins as OSPs. Highlighting the ecological-evolutionary importance, convergent ootheca formation represents a successful reproductive strategy in Polyneoptera that promoted the radiation and establishment of cockroaches, mantids, and locusts.

AB  - A study of the experimental conditions to synthesize monodisperse iron oxide nanocrystals prepared from the thermal decomposition of iron(III) acetylacetonate was carried out in the presence of surfactants and a reducing agent. The influence of temperature, synthesis time and surfactant amounts on nanoparticle properties is reported. This investigation combines relaxometric characterization and size properties. The relaxometric behavior of the nanomaterials depends on the selected experimental parameters. The synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles with a high relaxivity and a high saturation magnetization can be obtained with a short reaction time at high temperature. Moreover, the influence of surfactant concentrations determines the optimal value in order to produce iron oxide nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. The optimized synthesis is rapid, robust and reproductive, and produces nearly monodisperse magnetic nanocrystals.

AB  - Comparing the responses of closely related species to environmental changes is an efficient method to explore adaptive divergence, for a better understanding of the adaptive evolution of marine species under rapidly changing climates. Oysters are keystone species thrive in intertidal and estuarine areas where frequent environmental disturbance occurs including fluctuant salinity. The evolutionary divergence of two sister species of sympatric estuarine oysters, Crassostrea hongkongensis and Crassostrea ariakensis, in response to euryhaline habitats on phenotypes and gene expression, and the relative contribution of species effect, environment effect, and their interaction to the divergence were explored. After a 2-month outplanting at high- and low-salinity locations in the same estuary, the high growth rate, percent survival, and high tolerance indicated by physiological parameters suggested that the fitness of C. ariakensis was higher under high-salinity conditions and that of C. hongkongensis was higher under low-salinity conditions. Moreover, a transcriptomic analysis showed the two species exhibited differentiated transcriptional expression in high- and low-salinity habitats, largely caused by the species effect. Several of the important pathways enriched in divergent genes between species were also salinity-responsive pathways. Specifically, the pyruvate and taurine metabolism pathway and several solute carriers may contribute to the hyperosmotic adaptation of C. ariakensis, and some solute carriers may contribute to the hypoosmotic adaptation of C. hongkongensis. Our findings provide insights into the phenotypic and molecular mechanisms underlying salinity adaptation in marine mollusks, which will facilitate the assessment of the adaptive capacity of marine species in the context of climate change and will also provide practical information for marine resource conservation and aquaculture.

AB  - Current silicon melt-infiltrated (SMI) ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are limited by the melting temperature of silicon (1414 A degrees C) and the volatility of the thermally grown SiO2 scale in high-temperature water vapor environments. Replacement of the melt-infiltrated (MI) silicon with a rare-earth silicide offers the potential to address both limitations of SMI CMCs. This study focuses on the ability of yttrium silicides to form yttrium silicates (phases with greater stability in high-temperature water vapor than SiO2) in high-temperature oxidizing environments. Yttrium silicides with compositions of 41, 67 and 95 at.% Si-Y were fabricated using arc melting and oxidized in air at 1000 and 1200 A degrees C for up to 24 h. Oxidation resulted in the rapid formation of a non-protective Y2O3 scale and rejected Si. Additional minor oxide phases of Y-Si-O, Y2SiO5, Y2Si2O7 and SiO2 were observed to form on and beneath the specimen surface. Characterization of the microstructural evolution with time and temperature helped elucidate the diffusion mechanisms that control oxide growth rates. Replacement of MI silicon with a MI yttrium silicide would significantly compromise the high-temperature performance of a CMC due to Y2O3 CTE mismatch with SiC, high oxygen permeability and the large volume change associated with its rapid subsurface formation. Results are utilized to examine the viability of other rare-earth silicides as MI materials for CMCs.

AB  - The fitness and survival of organisms ultimately depend on their feeding. Therefore, foraging behaviors should be selected to maximize cost-benefit ratio. Wind may restrict and modify animal movements increasing the cost of foraging, especially when the animal carries resources that intercept wind. We quantified the effect of wind on the foraging of leaf-cutting ants and evaluated whether this effect varies with 1) leaf fragment traits, such as area, mass, and shape, and 2) the characteristics of the foraging trail system. We also tested whether these ants show a short-term response to wind by selecting loads with characteristics that reduce wind interception, and a long-term response, by arranging the spatial design of the trail system in a way that reduces that effect. We found that in windy conditions, the speed of loaded ants was reduced by 55%, and ants were blown off the trail 28 times more than in windless conditions. However, wind only affected ants walking along trails that were perpendicular to wind direction or parallel upwind. Wind effect increased with area, mass, and shape of loads. At the short term, ants reduced the negative effect of wind by selecting smaller, lighter, or more elongated loads. However, trails showed no particular spatial distribution in relation to wind direction. This is the first study that quantifies the negative consequences of wind on leaf-cutting ants' foraging and reports behaviors that can reduce this effect. Our work illustrates how short-term behavioral responses can mitigate the negative effect of an understudied environmental factor on ant foraging.

AB  - The Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) is a viviparous rattlesnake that is a species of "special concern" in Michigan and listed as state-threatened or endangered throughout the rest of its range. Viviparous species typically have unique thermal needs associated with the internal development of young, and these needs can influence vegetation selection patterns. We investigated the thermal ecology and vegetation selection of female S. c. catenatus. We radio-tracked eight gravid and six non-gravid female S. c. catenatus implanted with temperature-sensitive transmitters in southwestern Michigan during May-August 2004 and 2005. Gravid S. c. catenatus generally maintained higher average body temperature (T-b; 29.1-34.1 degrees C) throughout the season than non-gravid females (22.2-30.8 degrees C), and also maintained plateau temperatures longer in the diel cycle. Gravid females maintained significantly higher (P < 0.01) mean temperatures above ambient compared with non-gravids early (i.e., May; gravid = 11.7 degrees C; non-gravid = 6.1 degrees C) and late (i.e., July and August; gravid = 7.1 degrees C; non-gravid = 4.9 degrees C) in the season. These results suggest gravid females were thermoregulating to facilitate embryogenesis. Gravid S. c. catenatus selected early/mid-successional deciduous upland vegetation, and these areas had significantly higher (P < 0.001) mean soil temperatures (19.9 degrees C) than early/mid-successional wetlands (17.4 degrees C). Therefore, we recommend that upland areas adjacent to wetlands supporting S. c. catenatus be maintained in early successional vegetation types with limited woody encroachment. This vegetation type provides gravid females with favorable thermal conditions to meet their reproductive requirements.

AB  - Growing evidence has suggested that ocean warming could cause a decline in marine phytoplankton productivity. However, studies in tropical waters have discovered that evolutionary adaptation of local species to warming and positive response to increasing rainfall could avoid the sharp decline in productivity. Here, the decadal trends of phytoplankton biomass, reconstructed using the biomarkers of brassicasterol (diatoms) and dinosterol (dinoflagellates), showed a 1.5-3 times increase since the 1950s along a large section of the Kimberley coast, north-western Australia. Principal component analysis found that 56% of the phytoplankton variance was linked with climate change-induced increases in sea surface temperature and rainfall associated with increased tropical cyclones, which can enhance nutrient supply favoring phytoplankton growth and production; 20.4% of the phytoplankton variance tended to be related to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation through a mechanism of ocean-coast interaction. We empirically predict that the negative impact of rising temperatures on phytoplankton in north-western Australia could be buffered by the increasing tropical cyclones and the coming warm phase of Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation.
   Key Points
   Phytoplankton biomass has increased in north-western Australia by 1.5-3 times since the 1950s Fifty-six percent of the phytoplankton variance was related to increases in SST and rainfall and 20.4% to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation We empirically predict a more productive coastal environment in north-western Australia in coming decades

AB  - Global vegetation has been reported to be turning greener, especially in China and India. The Yellow River Basin is one of the most prominent greening areas in China. While some studies have attributed vegetation greening to large-scale ecological restoration efforts, our study focuses on the role of climate change in vegetation greening. We selected a time series of annual vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and vegetation coverage from satellite data to quantify the vegetation greening trend. Annual temperature and precipitation were selected to examine the climate trend from 2000 to 2019. The results showed that the Yellow River Basin experienced a rapid increase in temperature and precipitation during this period. Annual temperature increased with an average speed of 0.905 degrees C per decade, approximately 4.5 times larger than that of global warming. Annual precipitation increased by 82.8%, with an average speed of 9.17 mm per year. There was widespread vegetation greening in the Yellow River Basin during 2000-2019. This was demonstrated by an increase in vegetation NPP and vegetation coverage in the Yellow River Basin. The increase of annual NPP and coverage from 2000 to 1019 was 26.6% and 30.8%, respectively. Even while considering the effects of conservation and restoration efforts, the rapid increases in temperature and precipitation allowed vegetation to flourish, as evidenced by significant positive correlations between climate variables and vegetation variables. Therefore, climate change played an important positive role in vegetation greening, rather than an undesirable disturbance.

AB  - Many risk factors such as smoking and change of life style have been shown to promote genetic and adaptive epigenetic changes responsible for tumorigenesis. This study brings environmental temperature as a cancer causing factor to light. The cancer mortality rate (CMR) of a country was correlated with 17 different variables. Multivariate analysis of a total of 188 countries found that the average annual temperature (AAT) of a country might have a significant contribution to cancer death when compared with other factors such as alcohol and meat consumption. Univariate analysis found a negative correlation between AAT and CMR. All these countries were categorized into three temperature zones (zone I, -2 to 11.5 A degrees C; number of countries, 38; zone II, 11.6 to 18.6 A degrees C; number of countries, 32; and zone III, 18.7 to 30 A degrees C; number of countries, 118). Out of the top-most 50 countries having the highest CMR, 26 (68.42 %), 10 (31.25 %), and 14 (11.66 %) belong to zone I, zone II, and zone III, respectively. Out of the least 50 countries having the lowest CMR, 1 (2.63 %), 4 (12.5 %), and 45 (37.5 %) belong to zone I, zone II, and zone III, respectively. CMR is low in those countries situated near to the Torrid zone (33(A degrees) N to 23.5(A degrees)S), but it is high for those countries situated away from these two latitudes. These data indicate that cold temperature may have a contribution in increasing tumorigenesis. High metabolic stress, which is the result of maintaining our body temperature against a cold environment, could be the possible cause for the higher cancer mortality.

AB  - Crop simulation models offer possibilities to evaluate and target agricultural information for sustainable intensification in countries like Ethiopia with inadequate resources for field research. The objectives of this research were to calibrate and evaluate the CERES-Maize, CROPGRO-Dry bean and CROPGRO-Soybean models for practices associated with conservation agriculture and fertilizer N, and to evaluate five generated weather datasets for Ethiopia. Data from multi-year field experiments and additional data obtained from previously conducted national variety trials were used for model evaluation. Generated weather datasets for six agroecologies were evaluated by comparison with observed data and by use of data in the models. Genetic coefficients used in the models for maize, dry bean and soybean were determined by model parametrization and calibration of phenology and yield. The models acceptably simulated the effects of N rate, maize-legume rotation, and crop residue retention plus tillage with average normalized deviation closer to zero, RMSE less or similar to standard deviation of observed data, and with normalized RMSE (nRMSE) < 15%. Both NASA and Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA) daily rainfall showed good agreement with observed weather data (RMSE < 9 mm). Daily maximum and minimum temperature of GYGA and WeatherMan datasets had the lowest RMSE of 1.99 and 3.06, and 2.5 and 3.1 degrees C, respectively. Between 85-100% of simulated grain yields of maize, dry bean and soybean with GYGA and WeatherMan datasets fell within +/- 10% deviation of mean simulated grain yields with observed weather data, and with the lowest inter-annual variability. It was concluded that model calibrations were satisfactory, and either GYGA or WeatherMan datasets alone or combined could be used to run the crop models in sites which lack observed daily weather data in Ethiopia.

AB  - Expected global changes in environmental conditions underline the need for a better understanding of genetic variation in ecological traits and their strategies of adaptation to the stresses. In this study, evolutionary mechanisms and processes of UV adaptation in plant pathogens were investigated by combining statistical genetics, physiological assays, and common garden experiment approaches in an assessment of the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, sampled from various geographic locations in China. We found spatial divergence caused by diversifying selection in UV tolerance among P. infestans populations. Local UV radiation was the driving force of selection as indicated by a positive correlation between UV tolerance in P. infestans populations and the altitude of collection sites. Plasticity accounted for 68% of population variation while heritability was negligible, suggesting temporary changes in gene expression and/or enzymatic activity play a more important role than permanent modification of gene structure in the evolution of UV adaptation. This adaptation strategy may explain the lack of fitness penalty observed in genotypes with higher UV tolerance.

AB  - Exposing organisms to a particular stressor may enhance tolerance to a subsequent stress, when protective mechanisms against the two stressors are shared. Such cross-tolerance is a common adaptive response in dynamic multivariate environments and often indicates potential co-evolution of stress traits. Many aquatic insects in inland saline waters from Mediterranean-climate regions are sequentially challenged with salinity and desiccation stress. Thus, cross-tolerance to these physiologically similar stressors could have been positively selected in insects of these regions. We used adults of the saline water beetles Enochrus jesusarribasi (Hydrophilidae) and Nebrioporus baeticus (Dytiscidae) to test cross-tolerance responses to desiccation and salinity. In independent laboratory experiments, we evaluated the effects of (i) salinity stress on the subsequent resistance to desiccation and (ii) desiccation stress (rapid and slow dehydration) on the subsequent tolerance to salinity. Survival, water loss and haemolymph osmolality were measured. Exposure to stressful salinity improved water control under subsequent desiccation stress in both species, with a clear cross-tolerance (enhanced performance) in N. baeticus. In contrast, general negative effects on performance were found under the inverse stress sequence. The rapid and slow dehydration produced different water loss and haemolymph osmolality dynamics that were reflected in different survival patterns. Our finding of cross-tolerance to salinity and desiccation in ecologically similar species from distant lineages, together with parallel responses between salinity and thermal stress previously found in several aquatic taxa, highlights the central role of adaption to salinity and co-occurring stressors in arid inland waters, having important implications for the species' persistence under climate change.

AB  - Microwave heating faces growing interest in many industries because of its large potential in increasing productivity and energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the main challenge of this heating method is to provide sufficient uniformity of the temperature distribution, in particular in industrial scale production. Several temperature maxima and minima typically occur in a sample because of the standing waves inside a cavity. An optimization-based approach is presented to increase the temperature homogeneity by exiting selected eigenmodes of the cavity. Results of a related experiment show the performance of the developed algorithm.

AB  - Specialty grades of stainless steel and other specialty alloys have been designed for virtually every cold heading, forming, upsetting, and extruding operation. They are necessary for the growing number of fastener components that must have the corrosion resistance and strength to withstand harsh environments, high operating temperatures, and great pressures, as well as requirements for special magnetic properties. For all such components, alloy selection has also been governed by the need to reduce part costs and secondary machining operations, thus improving productivity.
   This article discusses selection guidelines for High Temperature/Specialty Alloys, defines alloy classes, and describes the applications most suitable for each alloy class.

AB  - Crustaceans are amongst the most reported invaders of coastal habitats, and predatory brachyuran crabs one of the most successful marine invasive groups. They hold high tolerance to abiotic stress and their genetic, lifehistory, and behavioural adaptation mechanisms prompt their invasive conspicuousness. However, there is a generalized ambiguity on the specific processes that make these bioinvasions successful. No trait-related patterns have yet been found, mostly since traits attributed solely to non-indigenous crab species lack confirmation by comparison with their native counterparts and across each other. Therefore, this review discusses the available literature on fitness and plasticity of brachyuran crabs under global changes, and advances the increasing importance of addressing native versus non-native invasive species comparisons in the annals of brachyura invasion dynamics. Further on, integrative approaches are highlighted and proposed as innovative tools to disentangle trait-related tolerance, overall crab phenotypic plasticity and further adaptation. These indicator tools will advance the knowledge on crabs? invasive potential, which ultimately affects upcoming population dynamics and ecosystem services, adding value to an effective management of coastal bioinvasions.

AB  - Many of the physiological adaptations evolved in terrestrial invertebrates to resist desiccation have also been shown to enhance the survival of low temperatures. In this study we have examined temporal changes in the physiology of the collembolan Folsomia candida during acclimation to mild desiccation stress (98.2% RH), and how physiological changes correlate with resistance to subsequent cold shock. heat shock and acute desiccation stress. Drought-acclimation increased the resistance to cold and acute drought but reduced the resistance to heat shock. The composition of membrane phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) changed during acclimation resulting in a higher degree of unsaturation by the end of the 192-h acclimation period. This resembles typical membrane alterations seen in ectothermic animals exposed to cold. Only small changes were seen in the neutral lipid fraction. The temporal changes in cold resistance and drought resistance correlated well with changes in PLFA composition and accumulation of sugars and polyols ('cryoprotectives'). It is proposed that the drought-induced PLFA desaturation, combined with the membrane protecting accumulation of cryoprotectives, are important physiological adaptations providing tolerance to both desiccation and cold.

AB  - Phylosymbiosis is defined as microbial community relationships that recapitulate the phylogeny of hosts. As evidence for phylosymbiosis rapidly accumulates in different vertebrate and invertebrate holobionts, a central question is what evolutionary forces cause this pattern. We use intra- and interspecific gut microbiota transplants to test for evidence of selective pressures that contribute to phylosymbiosis. We leverage three closely related species of the parasitoid wasp model Nasonia that recently diverged between 0.4 and 1 million years ago: N. vitripennis, N. giraulti, and N. longicornis. Upon exposure of germfree larvae to heat-inactivated microbiota from intra- or interspecific larvae, we measure larval growth, pupation rate, and adult reproductive capacity. We report three key findings: (i) larval growth significantly slows when hosts receive an interspecific versus intraspecific gut microbiota, (ii) marked decreases in pupation and resulting adult survival occur from interspecific gut microbiota exposure, and (iii) adult reproductive capacities including male fertility and longevity are unaffected by early life exposure to an interspecific microbiota. Overall, these findings reveal developmental and survival costs to Nasonia upon larval exposures to interspecific microbiota and provide evidence that selective pressures on phenotypes produced by host-microbiota interactions may underpin phylosymbiosis.
   IMPORTANCE Phylosymbiosis is an ecoevolutionary hypothesis and emerging pattern in animal-microbiota studies whereby the host phylogenetic relationships parallel the community relationships of the host-associated microbiota. A central prediction of phylosymbiosis is that closely related hosts exhibit a lower microbiota beta diversity than distantly related hosts. While phylosymbiosis has emerged as a widespread trend in a field often challenged to find trends across systems, two critical and understudied questions are whether or not phylosymbiosis is consequential to host biology and if adaptive evolutionary forces underpin the pattern. Here, using germfree rearing in the phylosymbiosis model Nasonia, we demonstrate that early life exposure to heat-inactivated microbiota from more distantly related species poses more severe developmental and survival costs than microbiota from closely related or the same species. This study advances a functional understanding of the consequences and potential selective pressures underpinning phylosymbiosis.

AB  - The evolution of the atmospheres of low- and intermediate-mass planets is strongly connected to the physical properties of their host stars. The types and the past activities of planet-hosting stars can, therefore, affect the overall planetary population. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of sub-Neptune-like planets orbiting stars of different masses and different evolutionary histories. We discuss the general patterns of the evolved population as a function of parameters and environments of planets. As a model of the atmospheric evolution, we employ the own framework combining planetary evolution in Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (mesa) with the realistic prescription of the escape of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We find that the final populations look qualitatively similar in terms of the atmospheres survival around different stars, but qualitatively different, with this difference accentuated for planets orbiting more massive stars. We show that a planet has larger chances of keeping its primordial atmosphere in the habitable zone of a solar-mass star compared to M or K dwarfs and if it starts the evolution having a relatively compact envelope. We also address the problem of the uncertain initial temperatures (luminosities) of planets and show that this issue is only of particular importance for planets exposed to extreme atmospheric mass losses.

AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are evolutionary conserved 'stress-response' proteins that facilitate cell survival against various adverse conditions. HSP-mediated cytoprotection was hitherto reported to occur principally in two ways. Firstly, HSPs interact directly or indirectly with apoptosis signaling components and suppress apoptosis. Secondly, through chaperon activity, HSPs suppress proteotoxicity and maintain protein-homeostasis. Recent studies highlight the interaction of HSPs with cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). SGs are conserved cytoplasmic mRNPs granules that aid in cell survival under stressful conditions. We primarily aim to describe the distinct cell survival strategy mediated by HSPs as the crucial regulators of SGs assembly and disassembly. Based on the growing evidence, HSPs and associated co-chaperones act as important determinants of SG assembly, composition and dissolution. Under cellular stress, as a 'stress-coping mechanism', the formation of SGs reprograms protein translation machinery and modulates signaling pathways indispensable for cell survival. Besides their role in suppressing apoptosis, HSPs also regulate protein-homeostasis by their chaperone activity as well as by their tight regulation of SG dynamics. The intricate molecular signaling in and around the nexus of HSPs-SGs and its importance in diseases has to be unearthed. These studies have significant implications in the management of chronic diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases where SGs possess pathological functions.

AB  - 1. The braconid Asobara tabida is a widespread parasitoid of Drosophila larvae in fermenting substrates.
   2. Across its geographic range, survival probability in D. subobscura larvae is high and fairly constant; survival probability in D. melanogaster larvae shows much variation.
   3. When females of different strains are offered a choice between larvae of the two host species, the degree of preference for D. subobscura larvae is linked to the difference in survival probability in the two host species.
   4. Host selection behaviour of the females matches the predictions made by an optimal foraging model.
   5. Survival probability in D. melanogaster also depends on temperature and host selection behaviour appears to be influenced by temperature as well.
   6. It is concluded that host selection behaviour of A. tabida is a trait with phenotypic plasticity on top of genetic differences.

AB  - Two experiments were performed. The first tested the hypothesis that the toad, Bufo marinus, will select a lower ambient temperature under dry environmental conditions. This behavioral response would reduce evaporative water loss and facilitate survival on land. The second experiment measured the effects of temperature on evaporative water loss. In the first experiment, toads were placed in a thermal gradient (11-40-degrees-C) for 3 days. On days 1 and 3, water-filled dishes were placed along the temperature gradient and humid air was circulated through the chamber. On day 2, water dishes were removed, and dry air was circulated through the chamber. Body temperature (T(b)) was recorded with a cloacal thermistor. Selected T(b) was approximately 8.6-degrees-C lower during the dry conditions than during the humid conditions. The behavioral hypothermia took about 6 h to develop. In the second experiment, a reduction in T(b) from 17.7 to 12.-degrees-C reduced evaporative water loss by 42%. Consequently, behavioral hypothermia of the toad is an important adaptation to dry environmental conditions.

AB  - Mortality of two size classes (<35 and >35 mm) of eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica when exposed to combinations of low salinity (1, 2, 3, and 4) for extended periods (up to 30 days) at summer water temperatures typical of the Virginia Chesapeake Bay subestuaries was examined. A critical salinity-temperature combination of less than two at greater than 28 degrees C for more than 1 wk exposure for oyster mortality is suggested. A review of limited historical salinity-temperature tolerance data suggest selection of local populations of oysters having differing salinity tolerances. Such selection may prove critical to persistence of low-salinity populations in the Chesapeake Bay subestuaries with projected climate change.

AB  - We developed and tested a combined foraging and bioenergetics model for predicting growth over the lifetime of drift-feeding brown trout. The foraging component estimates gross energy intake within a fish- and prey size-dependent semicircular foraging area that is perpendicular to the flow, with options for fish feeding across velocity differentials. The bioenergetics component predicts how energy is allocated to growth, reproduction, foraging costs,nd basal metabolism. The model can reveal the degree to which growth is limited by the density and size structure of invertebrate drift within the physiological constraints set by water temperature. We tested the model by predicting growth based on water temperature and on drift density and size structure data from postemergence to age 12, and we compared the predictions with observed size at age as determined from otoliths and scales for a New Zealand river brown trout population. The model produced realistically shaped growth curves in relation to the observed data, accurately predicting mean size at age over the lifetime of the trout, assuming 24-h maximum rations and including diurnal drift-foraging costs (predicted versus observed weight r(2) = 0.94; length r(2) = 0.97). The model predicted that, within a given water-temperature regime, growth is limited primarily by reproduction costs but also by increasing foraging costs as trout grow (a phenomenon that is associated with the increasing foraging time that is required in order to feed to satiation on small invertebrate drift prey). Invertebrate drift size structure significantly influenced predicted growth, especially maximum size, through its effect on foraging time. The model has potential in terms of the exploration of growth-limiting factors and has associated use as an environmental-impact tool and as an aid for hypothesis generation in studies of salmonid growth processes.

AB  - Electronic systems are not widely used for measuring biological variables in beehives despite the importance that honeybees have for both the environment and humans. A better understanding of bee colonies is needed in order to prevent certain dangers that threaten the bee population. In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

AB  - The thermal preferences of Alaskozetes antarcticus (Acari, Cryptostigmata) and Cryptopygus antarcticus (Collembola, Isotomidae) were investigated over 6 h within a temperature gradient (-3 to +13 degreesC), under 100% relative humidity (RH) conditions. After 10 days of acclimation at -2 or +11 degreesC, individual supercooling points (SCP) and thermopreferences were assessed, and compared with animals maintained for 10 days under fluctuating field conditions (-6 to +7 degreesC). Acclimation at -2 degreesC lowered the mean SCP of both A. antarcticus (-24.2 +/- 9.1) and C. antarcticus (-14.7 +/- 7.7) compared to field samples (-19.0 +/- 9.0 and -10.7 +/- 5.2, respectively). Acclimation at +11 degreesC increased A. antarcticus mean SCP values (-13.0 +/- 8.5) relative to field samples, whereas those of C. antarcticus again decreased (-16.7 +/- 9.1). Mites acclimated under field conditions or at +11 degreesC selected temperatures between -3 and +1 degreesC. After acclimation at -2 degreesC, both species preferred +1 to +5 degreesC. Cryptopygus antarcticus maintained under field conditions preferred +5 to +9 degreesC, whereas individuals acclimated at +11 degreesC selected +9 to +13 degreesC. For A. antarcticus , thermopreference was not influenced by its cold hardened state. The distribution of field specimens was further assessed within two combined temperature and humidity gradient systems: (i) 0-3 degreesC/12% RH, 3-6 degreesC/33% RH, 6-9 degreesC/75% RH and 9-12 degreesC/100% RH and (ii) 0-3 degreesC/100% RH, 3-6 degreesC/75% RH, 6-9 degreesC/33% RH and 9-12 degreesC/12% RH. In gradient (i), C. antarcticus distributed homogeneously, but, in gradient (ii), C. antarcticus preferred 0-3 degreesC/100% RH. Alaskozetes antarcticus selected temperatures between 0 and +6 degreesC regardless of RH conditions. Cryptopygus antarcticus appears better able than A. antarcticus to opportunistically utilize developmentally favourable thermal microclimates, when moisture availability is not restricted. The distribution of A. antarcticus appears more influenced by temperature, especially during regular freeze-thaw transitions, when this species may select low temperature microhabitats to maintain a cold-hardened state.

AB  - This study is the first one using the Taguchi experimental design to identify the optimal operating condition for reducing polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs)formations during the iron ore sintering process. Four operating parameters, including the water content (Wc; range = 6.0-7.0 wt %), suction pressure (Ps; range = 1000-1400 mmH(2)O), bed height (Hb; range = 500-600 mm), and type of hearth layer (including sinter,hemate,and limonite), were selected for conducting experiments in a pilot scale sinter pot to simulate various sintering operating conditions of a real-scale sinter plant. We found that the resultant optimal combination (Wc = 6.5 wt%, Hb = 500 mm, Ps = 1000 mmH(2)O, and hearth layer hematite) could decrease the emission factor of total PCDD/Fs (total EF(PCDD/Fs)) up to 62.8% by reference to the current operating condition of the real-scale sinter plant (Wc 6.5 wt %, Hb = 550 mm, Ps = 1200 mmH(2)O, and hearth layer = sinter). Through the ANOVA analysis, we found that Wc was the most significant parameter in determining total EF(PCDD/Fs) (accounting for 74.7% of the total contribution of the four selected parameters). The resultant optimal combination could also enhance slightly in both sinter productivity and sinter strength (30.3 t/m(2)/day and 72.4%, respectively) by reference to those obtained from the reference operating condition (29.9 t/m (2)/day and 72.2%, respectively). The above results further ensure the applicability of the obtained optimal combination for the real-scale sinter production without interfering its sinter productivity and sinter strength.

AB  - This study presents a novel method for estimating the heat-attributable fractions (HAF) based on the cross-validated best temperature metric. We analyzed the association of eight temperature metrics (mean, maximum, minimum temperature, maximum temperature during daytime, minimum temperature during nighttime, and mean, maximum, and minimum apparent temperature) with mortality and performed the cross-validation method to select the best model in selected cities of Switzerland and South Korea from May to September of 1995-2015. It was observed that HAF estimated using different metrics varied by 2.69-4.09% in eight cities of Switzerland and by 0.61-0.90% in six cities of South Korea. Based on the cross-validation method, mean temperature was estimated to be the best metric, and it revealed that the HAF of Switzerland and South Korea were 3.29% and 0.72%, respectively. Furthermore, estimates of HAF were improved by selecting the best city-specific model for each city, that is, 3.34% for Switzerland and 0.78% for South Korea. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to observe the uncertainty of HAF estimation originated from the selection of temperature metric and to present the HAF estimation based on the cross-validation method.

AB  - Background: It is anticipated that malaria elimination efforts in Africa will be hampered by increasing resistance to the limited arsenal of insecticides approved for use in public health. However, insecticide susceptibility status of vector populations evaluated under standard insectary test conditions can give a false picture of the threat, as the thermal environment in which the insect and insecticide interact plays a significant role in insecticide toxicity.
   Methods: The effect of temperature on the expression of the standard WHO insecticide resistance phenotype was examined using Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus strains: a susceptible strain and the derived resistant strain, selected in the laboratory for resistance to DDT or pyrethroids. The susceptibility of mosquitoes to the pyrethroid deltamethrin or the carbamate bendiocarb was assessed at 18, 25 or 30 degrees C. The ability of the pyrethroid synergist piperonyl-butoxide (PBO) to restore pyrethroid susceptibility was also assessed at these temperatures.
   Results: Temperature impacted the toxicity of deltamethrin and bendiocarb. Although the resistant An. funestus strain was uniformly resistant to deltamethrin across temperatures, increasing temperature increased the resistance of the susceptible An. arabiensis strain. Against susceptible An. funestus and resistant An. arabiensis females, deltamethrin exposure at temperatures both lower and higher than standard insectary conditions increased mortality. PBO exposure completely restored deltamethrin susceptibility at all temperatures. Bendiocarb displayed a consistently positive temperature coefficient against both susceptible and resistant An. funestus strains, with survival increasing as temperature increased.
   Conclusions: Environmental temperature has a marked effect on the efficacy of insecticides used in public health against important African malaria vectors. Caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions about a chemical's efficacy from laboratory assays performed at only one temperature, as phenotypic resistance can vary significantly even over a temperature range that could be experienced by mosquitoes in the field during a single day. Similarly, it might be inappropriate to assume equal efficacy of a control tool over a geographic area where local conditions vary drastically. Additional studies into the effects of temperature on the efficacy of insecticide-based interventions under field conditions are warranted.

AB  - Problem: For temperature-dependent sex determination to respond to selection, there should be genetic variance underlying the threshold that switches development from a male-producing program to a female-producing program. Genetic variance for this threshold in reptiles has never been estimated under field conditions.
   Methods: We estimated variance components of the thermal sensitivity of the sex determination threshold under field conditions for the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, a species that has temperature-dependent sex determination. Multiple paternity within clutches was identified by genotyping females and their offspring. We endeavoured to statistically account for common nest and maternal effects and estimated the genetic variance underlying the sex determination threshold under field conditions by isolating the contribution of sires within a single clutch.
   Results: With 51 clutches containing 393 offspring, we estimated significant heritability for the sex determination threshold (h(2) = 0.351, 95% CI = [0.164, 0.8321). Using a more restrictive dataset, which included only those clutches where each sire was represented by at least two offspring (34 nests, 273 hatchlings), heritability was not significantly different from zero (h(2) = 0.173, 95% CI = [0.000, 0.628]). Paternal siring success did not influence hatchling sex; thus, we have no evidence to support differential sex allocation across different sires within the same nest.
   Conclusion: We used a natural 'breeding design' under field conditions to show that the threshold of temperature-dependent sex determination may have a heritable genetic basis.

AB  - Arrhenotokous and thelytokous populations of Thrips tabaci from tobacco or leek plants were evaluated for their ability to transmit Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and for their host preference. Transmission efficiencies were comparatively studied using leaf disks of Petunia hybrida, Datura stramonium, and Nicotiana tabacum cv. Basmas. Adults of arrhenotokous populations collected on infected tobacco plants in the field were efficient transmitters (up to 48.5% transmission) and remained so when maintained on tobacco for several generations. Arrhenotokous T tabaci populations from leek plants were poor transmitters (up to 3.1% transmission), whereas no transmission was obtained with thelytokous populations from leek. All populations could infest leek, however none of the arrhenotokous and thelytokous populations from leek plants was able to infest tobacco. TSWV could be acquired by both first and second larval instars of a T tabaci population from tobacco. However, the transmission by adults decreased with the age at which the virus was acquired by larvae. The highest efficiencies (61% of males and 51% of females transmitted) were obtained when newborn (0- to 24-h old) larvae acquired the virus. The majority of thrips started to transmit after becoming adult and rates were positively correlated with the temperature at which the thrips were kept, The median latent period values found for adults decreased with increasing temperature. The median acquisition access period (AAP(50)) of the population was 41 min, whereas the AAP(50) was 65 min for males and 35 min for females. The median inoculation access period of males was 246 and 365 min on tobacco and petunia, respectively, and 96 and 345 min for females. The results show that T tabaci forms a complex in terms of host preference, reproductive strategy, and ability to transmit TSWV. The transmission parameters show that the thrips of arrhenotokous populations infesting tobacco are highly efficient vectors.

AB  - Synthetic pheromone trap captures of Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lep., Arctiidae) males were compared with those of virgin female-baited traps and with visual observations. Delta-traps with females and Uni-traps with synthetic pheromone (1Z,3Z,6Z-9, 10-epoxyheneicosatriene, 3Z,6Z-9, 10-epoxyheneicosadiene, and 9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienal; total, 2-6 mg/dispenser) and visual observation at a fixed point were used. The diurnal rhythm of activity in the little studied first (spring) generation showed a bread peak (3 h) after sunset. The second (summer) generation showed a short (1.5 h) but intense peak of attraction before sunrise, both to natural and to synthetic pheromones. A second small peak, just after sunset, was detected only in traps with the synthetic bait. Males started to be attracted to females about 1 h later than to synthetics in both generations. The main flight of males (mid-50% of cumulative male catches) was longer (8-11 days) in the first than in the second generation (5-7 days). The catches of males were increased by high daily maximum temperatures in the spring generation, while rain suppressed activity (phenology was delayed) in both generations. The total period of activity detectable by visual observations was about 6 days shorter than by pheromone traps. Population trends were recorded over four generations 1992-94 in two sites by trappings of moths and counting of larval webs. The second (summer) generation was two to six times larger than the spring generation. There was a correlation between the log-transformed catch of males and larval webs (r = 0.92 for proportions of both infested trees and web density) of the same period. This allows prediction of the subsequent larval abundance (offspring) based on adult (parent) pheromone trapping in preceding weeks.

AB  - In the Ivory Coast, grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) have been integrated in the tilapia-based polyculture in order to increase pond productivity. In the tropical conditions prevailing there, female cycles seemed disrupted. We describe oogenesis in these conditions using histological observations, monitoring of individual cycles with intraovarian biopsies, endocrinal monitoring (development of a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for vitellogenin (Vg), measurement of plasma oestradiol-17beta (E2) and testosterone (T)) and comparison with grass carp raised in Poland. We noted that oogenesis was blocked in all females at the migrating germinal vesicle stage, precluding ovulation or spawning without artificial induction. High rates of atypical post-vitellogenic oocytes (translucent, not filled with yolk granules) were observed in many females. Female individual cycles also displayed atypical features: cycles were sometimes (10% of females) blocked at the beginning of vitellogenesis (BV), for females displaying abnormally low E2 (0.5 ng/ml) and Vg (30 mug/ml) levels compared to "normal" females (1.4 ng/ml and 223 mug/ml, respectively). The duration of the cycles was highly variable among females (a few days to several weeks). Sexual cycles were unsynchronised (all the ovarian stages could be found for all seasons) and the number of females at the end of vitellogenesis (EV) was low (<40% most of the year). These characteristics raise problems for artificial induction of spawning in small-scale hatcheries: a large stock of broodfish is required as is regular checking of female broodstock with intraovarian biopsies to select responsive females.

AB  - EOLE is a hydrodynamic thermal model (one-dimensional vertical model) which simulates the evolution of the seasonal thermal stratification of a reservoir. It is a model based on representation of individual physical mechanisms, which takes into account the bathymetry of the reservoir, surface energy exchanges, and throughflow in the reservoir (rivers, pumping, turbining, residual stream flow, etc.). EOLE was applied to two reservoirs with extremely different characteristics: Pareloup Lake, a hydroelectric reservoir with a long residence time (1 year), and Rochebut, a reservoir, with a short residence time (1 month). The good agreement between the calculated and measured thermal profiles in both cases indicates that the model enables very good reproduction of the thermal stratification in each reservoir, the vertical dynamics of water masses, the thermal regime of water restituted downstream, and year-to-year fluctuations over extended periods (12 consecutive 1 year cycles for Pareloup). The model was applied using the same set of coefficients in both studies, demonstrating that the predominant hydrodynamic phenomena in both reservoirs are well taken into account, providing the input data are sufficiently representative of the site under study. The precision of the results obtained and the relative simplicity of the EOLE representation have enabled us to use the model as a basic structure for modeling of an ecosystem.

AB  - Winter air temperatures are projected to increase in the temperate zone, whereas snow cover is projected to decrease, leading to increased soil temperature variability, and potentially to changes in nutrient cycling. Here, we experimentally evaluated the effects of increased winter soil temperature variability on selected aspects of the N-cycle in mesocosms containing different plant community compositions. The experiment was replicated at two sites, a colder mountainous upland site with high snow accumulation and a warmer and drier lowland site.
   Increased soil temperature variability enhanced soil biotic activity for both sites during winter, as indicated by 35% higher nitrogen (N) availability in the soil solution, 40% higher belowground decomposition and a 25% increase in the potential activity of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase. The mobilization of N differed between sites, and the N-15 signal in leaves was reduced by 31% in response to winter warming pulses, but only at the cold site, with significant reductions occurring for three of four tested plant species at this site. Furthermore, there was a trend of increased N leaching in response to the recurrent winter warming pulses.
   Overall, projected winter climate change in the temperate zone, with less snow and more variable soil temperatures, appears important for shifts in ecosystem functioning (i.e. nutrient cycling). While the effects of warming pulses on plant N mobilization did not differ among sites, reduced plant N-15 incorporation at the colder temperate site suggests that frost damage may reduce plant N uptake in a warmer world, with important implications for nitrogen cycling and nitrogen losses from ecosystems.

AB  - Despite our extensive knowledge of the genetic regulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), the evolutionary routes that allow bacteria to adaptively tune their HSP levels and corresponding proteostatic robustness have been explored less. In this report, directed evolution experiments using the Escherichia coli model system unexpectedly revealed that seemingly random single mutations in its tnaA gene can confer significant heat resistance. Closer examination, however, indicated that these mutations create folding-deficient and aggregation-prone TnaA variants that in turn can endogenously and preemptively trigger HSP expression to cause heat resistance. These findings, importantly, demonstrate that even erosive mutations with disruptive effects on protein structure and functionality can still yield true gain-of-function alleles with a selective advantage in adaptive evolution.

AB  - Thermal tolerance and the respiratory properties of isolated red muscle mitochondria were investigated in Oreochromis alcalicus grahami from the alkaline hot-springs, Lake Magadi, Kenya. Populations of O. a. grahami were resident in pools at 42.8 degrees C and migrated into water reaching temperatures of 44.8 degrees C for short periods. The maximum respiration rates of mitochondria with pyruvate as substrate were 217 and 284natom0 mg(-1) mitochondrial proteinmin-l at 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C, respectively (Q(10) = 1.71). Fatty acyl carnitines (chain lengths C8, C12 and C16), malate and glutamate were oxidised at 70-80 % of the rate for pyruvate. In order to assess evolutionary temperature adaptation of maximum mitochondrial oxidative capacities, the rates of pyruvate and palmitoyl carnitine utilisation in red muscle mitochondria were measured from species living at other temperatures: Notothenia coriiceps from Antarctica(-1.5 to +1 degrees C); summer-caught Myoxocephalus scorpius from the North Sea (10-15 degrees C); and Oreochromis andersoni from African lakes and rivers (22-30 degrees C). State 3 respiration rates had Q(10) values in the range 1.8-2.7. At the lower lethal temperature of O. andersoni (12.5 degrees C), isolated mitochondria utilised pyruvate at a similar rate to mitochondria from N. coriiceps at 2.5 degrees C (30 natom O mg(-1) mitochondrial protein min(-1)). Rates of pyruvate oxidation by mitochondria from M. scorpius and N. coriiceps were similar and were higher at a given temperature than far O. andersoni. At their normal body temperature (-1.2 degrees C), mitochondria from the Antarctic fish oxidised pyruvate at 5.5% and palmitoyl-DL-carnitine at 8.8% of the rates of mitochondria from the hot-spring species at 42 degrees C. The results indicate only modest evolutionary adjustments in the maximal rates of mitochondrial respiration in fish living at different temperatures.

AB  - Hydrogen has been considered one of the most promising materials for energy storage during the last decade with considerable research having been undertaken to demonstrate the use of the molecule in power production systems. However, hydrogen presents drawbacks in terms of global commercialisation and deployment since its distribution is only feasible with significant dedicated infrastructure investment including liquefaction or if it is combined with other gases such as methane. The latter will still produce carbon emissions, whilst the former is not economically viable with current technologies. Therefore, an alternative is to use ammonia as a hydrogen storage vector. Ammonia, a molecule that has been used for more than a century, is a well-known material distributed across the world. Moreover, its properties allow its liquefaction at a relatively low pressure under atmospheric temperature compared to hydrogen, serving as a compound that can be used from fertilising to industrial processes. For power generation, ammonia has demonstrated to have a very slow reaction hence flame speeds, thus one option is to dope the fuel with a more reactive molecule such as hydrogen, which conveniently can be obtained from cracking ammonia. Hence, this paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental campaign where a 50:50 (vol%) ammonia-hydrogen blend was used for lean premixed combustion in a generic swirl combustor used in gas turbine studies. The results show that whilst the mixture can produce a good flame velocity similar to methane with the mixture having near equivalent laminar flame speed characteristics, the high diffusivity of hydrogen under these conditions leads to a narrow operational envelope with the potential for boundary layer flashback. High NO. emissions are produced due to the excess production of OH and O radicals. Recommendations for further studies and future developments are also discussed.

AB  - Autoclaving of food wastes (FW) for the resource recovery and reutilization was studied using the pilot plant scale. Experiments were conducted at various temperatures of 408, 428, and 438 K and times of 15 and 60 min. The in-filled steam to the autoclave was supplied by the incineration plant with a gauge pressure of 7 kg/cm(2) and a temperature of 443 K or above. The results obtained from the experiments show that the less energy- and time-consuming autoclaving conditions (408 K and 15 min, denoted as Case A408-15) are effective. Comparisons of the properties and characteristics of autoclaved FW (FWA) of Case A408-15 with those of FW are made. The wet bulk volume and wet bulk density of FW (A) are dramatically reduced to 15.64% and increased to 313.37% relative to those of FW, respectively. This makes the subsequent processing and reuse for FWA more convenient than FW. The autoclaving results in an increase of carbon content and a decrease of nitrogen content, and thus an increase of the C/N ratio of FWA. The contents of sulfur, hemi-cellulose, and cellulose of FWA are also reduced. All these fluctuations are beneficial for making compost or other usages from FWA than FW. The autoclaved liquid product (LA) separated from FWA and liquid condensate (LC) from the released gas possess high COD and TOC. These two liquids can be mixed for use as liquid fertilizers with proper conditioning. Alternatively, further anaerobic digestion of the mixture of FWA, LA, and LC can offer enhanced biogas production for power generation. All these thus match the appeal of sustainable materials management and circular economy. The emitted gas from autoclaving contains no CO and some hydrocarbons. Suitable air pollution control is needed. The results and information obtained are useful for the proper recovery and reuse of abundant food wastes from domestic households and food industries.

AB  - The results support the hypothesis that the commencement of smolting can occur during the decreasing phase of the annual photoperiod cycle, and sexual maturation during the increasing phase of the cycle, provided individuals have attained certain (unknown) growth thresholds. Thereafter the completion of smolting is entrained by the increasing phase of the photoperiod cycle, and sexual maturation by the decreasing phase. Three groups of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were raised in freshwater for over 2 yr from the eyed egg stage under photoperiod cycles of either 6-, 12- (control), or 18-mo periodicity and an ambient 12-mo temperature cycle. Smolting was judged by changes in salinity tolerance and condition factor. All groups developed bimodal length-frequency distributions by December following hatch. Fish continued to be recruited into the upper modal group (UMG) beyond the shortest day of the photoperiod cycle, providing temperature was not limiting growth. The 6-, 1 2-, and 18-mo photoperiod cycles resulted in approximately 50, 60, and 100% of the populations being recruited into the UMG. Sexually mature male parr (1 + yr old) occurred only in the lower modal group of the 6- and 12-mo groups.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are often preserved as starter cultures by freezing to extend shelf stability as well as maintain cell viability and acidification activity. Previous studies showed that the endocyte extracted from gradient-freezing pretreated cells could act as lyoprotectant in the lyophilization process of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of L. lactis in response to gradient freezing exposure are described using high-throughput sequencing. Nineteen of 56 genes were upregulated after gradient freezing, whereas 37 genes were downregulated. Further validation results of quantitative real-time PCR experiments were consistent with the RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org/) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathway were used to analyze the differentially expressed genes. Several pathways, such as glutathione metabolism, ATP-binding cassette transport, metabolism of cell wall and cell membrane components, and stress response-related pathways, were affected by gradient freezing. Six genes relevant to freezing stress response were selected for quantitative real-time PCR, including 3 upregulated genes (hisK, eutD, dukA) and 3 downregulated genes (als, yedF, pepN). The Gene Ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses showed these genes may influence stress response-related pathways, improving the survival of the L. lactis under freezing stress. The identification of these genes deepened an understanding about their response under freezing stress, helping us find potential genes or pathways related to gradient freezing for further research on lyoprotectants.

AB  - Standing genetic variation represents a genetic load on population fitness but can also support a rapid response to short-term environmental change, and the greatest potential source of such standing genetic variation typically exists among locally adapted populations living along an environmental gradient. Here, we develop a spatially explicit simulation model to quantify the contribution of existing genetic variation arising from migration-mutation-selection-drift balance to time to extinction under environmental change. Simulations reveal that local adaptation across a species range associated with an underlying environmental gradient could extend time to extinction by nearly threefold irrespective of the rate of environmental change. The potential for preadapted alleles to increase the rate of adaptation changes the relative importance of established extinction risk factors; in particular, it reduced the importance of the breadth of environmental tolerance and it increased the relative importance of fecundity. Although migration of preadapted alleles generally increased persistence time, it decreased it at rates of environmental change close to the critical rate of change by creating a population bottleneck, which ultimately limited the rate at which de novo mutations could arise. An analysis of the extinction dynamics further revealed that one consequence of gene flow is the potential to maximize population growth rate in at least part of the species range, which is likely to have consequences for forecasting the consequences of ecological interactions. Our study shows that predictions of persistence time change fundamentally when existing local adaptations are explicitly taken into account, underscoring the need to preserve and manage genetic diversity.

AB  - Marine microorganisms are a potential source of enzymes with structural stability, high activity at low temperature and unique substrate selectivity. Thraustochytrids are marine heterotrophic microbes, well known for the production of omega-3 fatty acids. In this study the effect of Tween 80 as a carbon source was investigated with regard to biomass, lipase and lipid productivity in Schizochytrium sp. S31. Tween 80 (1%) and 120 h of incubation were the optimum condition period for biomass, lipid and lipase productivity in a stirred tank reactor. The yields obtained were 0.9 g L-1 of biomass, 300 mgg(-1) of lipid and 39 U/g of lipase activity. Sonication was optimised in terms of time and acoustic power to maximise the yield of extracted lipase. The extracted lipase from Schizochytrium S31 was observed to hydrolyse long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and EPA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Assortative mating and reduced hybrid fitness are typically invoked to explain the stability of hybrid zones and the specification of two closely related taxa. Such examples of mate preferences in nature, especially for broadcast free-spawning marine invertebrates, and the understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for this positive selection are still lacking. This study documents another example of assortative fertilization by genome in situ hybridization in reciprocal crosses of scallops Chlanlysfarreri and Patinopecten yessoensis. Females produced eggs selected sperm nonrandomly but showed significant gamete preference of conspecifics over heterospecifics, with Chlamys farrei females using average 89.1% of conspecific sperms and the Patinopecten yessoensis using average 94.3% in natural spawning conditions (temperature 17 degrees C, salinity 31.5 parts per thousand). This conspecific gamete advantage may be related to the coordinated communication between interacting gametes, and the conspecific bindin genotype selection during the communicational process may also be involved. Two environmental factors, temperature and salinity were also tested to determinate to what extent they affect the patterns of assortative fertilization between these two species. The result showed that temperature seemed to have more influence on assortative fertilization than salinity did. At the temperatures of 11 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 22 degrees C and 26 degrees C, the average conspecific sperms preference of Chlamys farreri eggs was 80.0%, 89.1%, 95.1% and 95.5% respectively, whereas at the salinity of 24 parts per thousand, 28 parts per thousand, 31.5 parts per thousand and 35.5 parts per thousand, the average mating preference was 97.2%, 91.2%, 89.1% and 99.5% respectively. These results may have some bearings on the condition dependent alteration in the inter gamete recognition system. Alternatively, it may be simply the byproduct of different sperm tolerance ability under different conditions. The implication it may provide to hybrid production was also discussed.

AB  - A combination of selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacture and subtractive process was explored to produce maraging steel copper bimetal. Relationships among laser parameter, interfacial characteristic and mechanical performance are elucidated. A metallurgical bonded interface with a 30-40 mu m inter-diffusion region is formed. Gradient submicro grains with strong < 111 > orientation exhibit at the interface, which owe to high cooling rate and temperature gradient caused by high thermal conductive copper. A selected region of the interface was extracted by focused ion beam(FIB) for interfacial bonding analysis. The bonding mechanism is revealed and illustrated in detail. Interfacial intense Marangoni flows pull the copper toward the molten pool of maraging steel and the liquid maraging steel penetrates into the melting copper, which contributes to interfacial bonding. The bonding strength of hybrid processed bimetals are evaluated. Fracture in tensile is not present at the interface but on the copper side. The highest flexural strength reaches 557 MPa, which is slightly higher than that of the copper. Effects of parameter on fracture behaviors are also elucidated. This hybrid manufacture increases the productivity and functionality of the direct SLM-produced part, and provides a new approach for producing high-performance functional dissimilar bimetals based on laser additive manufacture.

AB  - Dispersal is a key biological process serving several functions including connectivity among populations. Habitat fragmentation caused by natural or anthropogenic structures may hamper dispersal, thereby disrupting genetic connectivity. Investigating factors affecting dispersal and gene flow is important in the current era of anthropogenic global change, as dispersal comprises a vital part of a species' resilience to environmental change. Using finescale landscape genomics, we investigated gene flow and genetic structure of the Sooty Copper butterfly (Lycaena tityrus) in the Alpine otz valley system in Austria. We found surprisingly high levels of gene flow in L. tityrus across the region. Nevertheless, ravines, forests, and roads had effects on genetic structure, while rivers did not. The latter is surprising as roads and rivers have a similar width and run largely in parallel in our study area, pointing towards a higher impact of anthropogenic compared with natural linear structures. Additionally, we detected eleven loci potentially under thermal selection, including ones related to membranes, metabolism, and immune function. This study demonstrates the usefulness of molecular approaches in obtaining estimates of dispersal and population processes in the wild. Our results suggest that, despite high gene flow in the Alpine valley system investigated, L. tityrus nevertheless seems to be vulnerable to anthropogenically-driven habitat fragmentation. With anthropogenic rather than natural linear structures affecting gene flow, this may have important consequences for the persistence of species such as the butterfly studied here in altered landscapes.

AB  - Strong mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) can result in the formation of extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars. The EHB stars spend most of their He core and shell-burning phase at high temperatures and produce copious ultraviolet flux. They have very small hydrogen envelopes and occupy a small range in mass. It has been suggested that the ''ultraviolet excess phenomenon,'' seen in elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges, is largely due to the ultraviolet flux from EHB stars and their progeny. The main motivation behind this work is to understand how EHB stars can be produced over a wide range of metallicities without fine-tuning the mass-loss process.
   We have computed evolutionary RGB models with mass loss for stars with main-sequence ages between 12.5 and 14.5 Gyr, initial masses less than 1.1 M., and metallicities of [Fe/H] = -2.26, -1.48, -0.78, 0.0, and 0.37. We used the Reimers formula to characterize mass loss, but investigated a larger range of the mass-loss efficiency parameter, eta(R), than is common. We adopted values of eta(R) from 0 to 1.2 for the compositions considered. Sufficiently rapid RGB mass loss causes stars to ''peel-off'' the giant branch, evolve to high temperatures, and settle on the white dwarf cooling curve. Some such stars have adequate helium core mass to undergo the helium flash, but only later at high temperatures: we call these ''hot He-flashers.'' After helium ignition, the hot-flashers lie at the very blue end of the horizontal branch, forming a ''blue hook.'' The blue-hook stars are a part of the EHB population and evolve into AGB-manque: stars. The rest of the peel-off stars form helium white dwarfs, which we call ''flash-manque'' stars. To understand how the number of EHB stars varies with metallicity in a stellar population we considered how the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) is populated. We assumed the distribution of ZAHB stars to be driven by a distribution in the mass-loss efficiency (parameterized by eta(R)) rather than by a distribution in mass. Our results show that at low metallicity, EHB stars are produced if eta(R) is 2-3 times larger than the value producing normal ''mid-HB stars.'' However, the range in eta(R). producing EHB stars is comparable to that producing mid-HB stars. Somewhat surprisingly, neither the range nor magnitude of eta(R) producing EHB stars varies much with metallicity. In contrast, the range of eta(R) producing mid-HB stars decreases with increasing metallicity. Hence, the HB of populations with solar metallicity and higher, such as those expected in elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges, will be bimodal if the distribution covers a sufficiently large range in eta(R).

AB  - (1) Hoplodactylus maculatus, is a nocturnal, viviparous gecko that inhabits a cool-temperate region. (2) To determine if pregnant females expend more effort thermoregulating than non-pregnant females or males, we compared field body temperature (T-b) with microhabitat thermal maxima (T-top), thermal minima (T-bot) and selected temperature (T-sel) among males, non-pregnant females and pregnant females. (3) An index of hermoregulatory effectiveness that incorporated diurnal variation in T-sel was used to compare among reproductive conditions. (4) Relationships between T-b, T-top and T-bot varied between reproductive conditions and seasons, suggesting complex diurnal thermoregulatory strategies in this nocturnal species. (5) Pregnant females achieved higher indices of thermoregulatory effort than males in both seasons, with the highest value in late spring and a slightly lower index similar to that of non-pregnant females in summer.

AB  - The alternative sigma factor B (sigma(B)) contributes to the stress tolerance of the foodbome pathogen Listeria monocytogenes by upregulating the general stress response. We previously showed that sigma(B) loss-of-function mutations arise frequently in strains of L. monocytogenes and suggested that mild stresses might favor the selection of such mutations. In this study, we performed in vitro evolution experiments (IVEE) where L. monocytogenes was allowed to evolve over 30 days at elevated (42 degrees C) or lower (30 degrees C) incubation temperatures. Isolates purified throughout the IVEE revealed the emergence of sigB operon mutations at 42 degrees C. However, at 30 degrees C, independent alleles in the agr locus arose, resulting in the inactivation of Agr quorum sensing. Colonies of both sigB mutants and agr mutants exhibited a greyer coloration on 7-days-old agar plates than those of the parental strain. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a more complex colony architecture in the wild type than in the mutant strains. sigB mutant strains outcompeted the parental strain at 42 degrees C but not at 30 degrees C, while agr mutant strains showed a small increase in competitive fitness at 30 degrees C. Analysis of 40,080 L. monocytogenes publicly available genome sequences revealed a high occurrence rate of premature stop codons in both the sigB and agrCA loci. An analysis of a local L. monocytogenes strain collection revealed 5 out of 168 strains carrying agrfA alleles. Our results suggest that the loss of sigma(B) or Agr confer an increased competitive fitness in some specific conditions and this likely contributes to the emergence of these alleles in strains of L monocytogenes.
   IMPORTANCE To withstand environmental aggressions, L. monocytogenes upregulates a large regulon through the action of the alternative sigma factor B (sigma(B)). However, sigma(B) becomes detrimental for L. monocytogenes growth under mild stresses, which confer a competitive advantage to sigma(B) loss-of-function alleles. Temperatures of 42 degrees C, a mild stress, are often employed in mutagenesis protocols of L. monocytogenes and promote the emergence of sigma(B) loss-of-function alleles in the sigB operon. In contrast, lower temperatures of 30 degrees C promote the emergence of Agr loss-of-function alleles, a cell-cell communication mechanism in L. monocytogenes. Our findings demonstrate that loss-of-function alleles emerge spontaneously in laboratory-grown strains. These alleles rise in the population as a consequence of the trade-off between growth and survival imposed by the activation of sigma(B) in L monocytogenes. Additionally, our results demonstrate the importance of identifying unwanted hitchhiker mutations in newly constructed mutant strains.

AB  - Groups of Arctic charr (150 g) were abruptly transferred from freshwater to water of salinities ranging from 10 to 35 ppt in April. Feed intake, growth and the ability of the fish to osmoregulate were then investigated on day 3 and day 30 following salt water transfer. Water temperature was kept at 8-degrees-C. No mortality occurred during the entire experimental period. Three days after transfer there were significant differences in feed intake, plasma osmolality and Cl- concentrations among fish exposed to the different salinity treatments. Feed intake was found to decrease and plasma electrolyte levels to increase with increasing salinity. At the termination of the experiment (30 days after transfer) no significant differences were found in feed intake, but plasma electrolyte levels were highest in fish held in water of the highest salinity. All plasma values were, however, within the normal range, indicating that osmo- and ionoregulatory homeostasis was achieved in all groups of fish. Increased salinity appeared to have an acute, but short lived appetite depressive effect in the experimental groups. Despite reduced feed intake in these groups on day 3, growth rates were high in all groups and there were no significant differences among salinity treatments. Thus, all groups of chaff appear to have adapted quickly to the new salinity conditions. The results indicate that Arctic charr can rapidly adapt to salinities up to 35 ppt in April, and that they may then have potentials for growth comparable to those of fish reared in freshwater. The results are discussed in relation to seasonal changes in seawater adaptability in salmonids.

AB  - The pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is recognized as a major invasive species in many countries and causes widespread mortality in pine trees. Pine wood nematode disease (PWD) has spread northward from southern China to several areas of Liaoning Province, which has temperatures outside of the optimal range for this disease. To determine whether obvious variations in the population adaptability of PWN are involved in its rapid spread from southern to northern China, this study compared the differences in morphology of eight southern strains and eight northern strains and the pathogenicity of the 16 strains to Pinus thunbergii, the pine species that is the most susceptible to PWD in China, and to P. tabuliformis, the main PWN host in northern Liaoning Province. The southern-strain females were smaller than the northern-strain females, except for strain GD32. The size differences between the males of the different strains were not significant. The difference in pathogenicity between the northern and southern strains to P. tabuliformis was more significant than the difference in their pathogenicity to P. thunbergii. The pathogenicity differentiation among northern strains was lower than that among southern strains, and the northern strains showed stronger pathogenicity to P. tabuliformis. The P. tabuliformis inoculation experiment showed that the pathogenicity of GD32, JS27, FJ14, LN13, and LN06 was significantly higher than that of FJ13. The results suggest that some PWN populations in the southern region, which are better adapted to P. tabuliformis, were likely directly transmitted to the northern region, resulting in the spread of PWD in the northern region. The spread of PWN from the south did not necessarily require a process of adaptation to the host or to the northern climate.

AB  - A gate-tunable synaptic device controlling dynamically reconfigurable excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses, which can emulate the fundamental synaptic responses for developing diverse functionalities of the biological nervous system, was developed using ambipolar oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs). Since the balanced ambipolarity is significant, a boron-incorporated SnO (SnO:B) oxide semiconductor channel was newly developed to improve the ambipolar charge transports by reducing the subgap defect density, which was reduced to less than 10(17) cm(-3). The ambipolar SnO:B-TFT could be fabricated with a good reproductivity at the maximum process temperature of 250 degrees C and exhibited good TFT performances, such as a nearly zero switching voltage, the saturation mobility of similar to 1.3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), s-value of similar to 1.1 V decade(-1), and an on/off-current ratio of similar to 8 x 10(3) for the p-channel mode, while similar to 0.14 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), similar to 2.2 V decade(-1) and similar to 1 x 10(3) for n-channel modes, respectively. The ambipolar device imitated potentiation/depression behaviors in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses by using the p- and n-channel transports by tuning a gate bias. The low-power consumptions of <20 and <2 nJ per pulse for the excitatory and inhibitory operations, respectively, were also achieved. The presented device operated under an ambient atmosphere and confirmed a good operation reliability over 5000 pulses and a long-term air environmental stability. The study presents the high potential of an ambipolar oxide-TFT-based synaptic device with a good manufacturability to develop emerging neuromorphic perception and computing hardware for next-generation artificial intelligence systems.

AB  - The ability of Paederus beetles to resist desiccation stress is vital to their adaptability in various ecological niches. How water relations and their response to desiccation vary among adult beetles of different age, sex, and mating status is unclear. We examined the water relations of adult Paederus fuscipes Curtis and the mechanisms used to reduce desiccation stress. One-day-old beetles had an exceptionally high percent total body water (%TBW) content and tolerated a high level of %TBW loss. Newly emerged beetles contained a high level of trehalose and 40 to 60% lipid content of their total dry mass, which allowed them to endure desiccation. Beetles that were 10 wk old and older exhibited reduced cuticular permeability. Glucose, glycogen, and lipid contents were crucial throughout most of the adult life span, as they helped compensate for water loss via increased water vapor absorption and metabolic water. In particular, the accumulation of lipid after mating was significant and may further confer tolerance to water loss. The effect of melanization on the desiccation tolerance of beetles was not significant. Females had better tolerance in response to desiccation stress compared with males. We suggest that the observed differences between sexes likely were a function of water relations and an effect of energy metabolite reserves. However, the mortality of females at 24-h postdesiccating stage was marginally significant compared with males.These results demonstrate that P. fuscipes adults prevent dehydration using multiple mechanisms that collectively reduce desiccation stress and increase dehydration tolerance.

AB  - An increase in resistance to one natural enemy may result in no correlated change, a positive correlated change, or a negative correlated change in the ability of the host or prey to resist other natural enemies. The type of specificity is important in understanding the evolutionary response to natural enemies and was studied here in a Drosaphila-parasitoid system. Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased larval resistance to the endoparasitoid wasps Asobara tabida or Leptopilina boulardi were exposed to attack by A. tabida, L. boulardi and Leptopilina heterotama at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C. In general, encapsulation ability increased with temperature, with the exception of the lines selected against L. boulardi, which showed the opposite trend. Lines selected against L, boulardi showed large increases in resistance against all three parasitoid species, and showed similar levels of defense against A. tabida to the lines selected against that parasitoid. In contrast, lines selected against A. tabida showed a large increase in resistance to A. tabida and generally to L. heterotoma, but displayed only a small change in their ability to survive attack by L. boulardi. Such asymmetries in correlated responses to selection for increased resistance to natural enemies may influence host-parasitoid community structure.

AB  - Coral cover on tropical reefs has declined during the last three decades due to the combined effects of climate change, destructive fishing, pollution, and land use change. Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions combined with effective coastal management and conservation strategies are essential to slow this decline. Innovative approaches, such as selective breeding for adaptive traits combined with large-scale sexual propagation, are being developed with the aim of pre-adapting reefs to increased ocean warming. However, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the technical and methodological constraints to producing corals for such restoration interventions. Here we propose a framework for selectively breeding corals and rearing them from eggs to 2.5-year old colonies using the coral Acropora digitifera as a model species. We present methods for choosing colonies for selective crossing, enhancing early survivorship in ex situ and in situ nurseries, and outplanting and monitoring colonies on natal reefs. We used a short-term (7-day) temperature stress assay to select parental colonies based on heat tolerance of excised branches. From six parental colonies, we produced 12 distinct crosses, and compared survivorship and growth of colonies transferred to in situ nurseries or outplanted to the reef at different ages. We demonstrate that selectively breeding and rearing coral colonies is technically feasible at small scales and could be upscaled as part of restorative assisted evolution initiatives. Nonetheless, there are still challenges to overcome before selective breeding can be implemented as a viable conservation tool, especially at the post-settlement and outplanting phases. Although interdisciplinary approaches will be needed to overcome many of the challenges identified in this study, selective breeding has the potential to be a viable tool within a reef managers toolbox to support the persistence of selected reefs in the face of climate change.

AB  - Bioenergy use is expected to increase significantly to support energy strategies and to meet climate targets in a large number of countries. Agricultural residues as an energy resource have attracted a lot of interest, as the use of residue biomass is perceived as beneficial to mitigate greenhouse gas emission and to be less harmful to the environment than other biomass resources. Here we present a holistic sustainability assessment of the use of cereal straw for heat and electricity production in Denmark. The assessment applies a methodology and framework developed by the Global Bioenergy Partnership. Sixteen sustainability indicators within the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) are quantified or assessed qualitatively together with their development over time from year 2000-2014/2015. The assessment points to a number of benefits of straw based bioenergy as reductions in GHG emissions, income generation and jobs for a rural population, reduced use of fossil fuels and increased diversity of the national energy supply. These benefits come at a risk of soil degradation and soil organic matter mining, of increased emissions of non-greenhouse gases. The assessment shows that land allocation to straw harvest for energy has increased over time together with land productivity. The diversity of the national energy supply has increased over time just as the infrastructure required to support straw to energy supply chains. Ecologically there is a potential for further use of agricultural residue biomass for energy. To realise the potential sustainably, attention should be put on developing guidelines or regulation on biomass harvest, on avoidance of environmental burden shifting, on logistics and efficient conversion to energy services, and on maintaining a suitable organisational and policy framework. The framework of the Global Bioenergy Partnership proved to be a versatile tool for the assessment of bioenergy sustainability, also in a developed country. It is, however, relying on specific data sources and formats, which in many cases are not readily available. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose California is the largest US producer of processing tomatoes, generating 96% of all domestic production and nearly 30% of global supply. Processing tomatoes are mostly processed into diced and paste products. Consumers and actors along their supply chains are increasingly interested in understanding their environmental burdens and identifying opportunities for improvements. This study applies life cycle assessment (LCA) to California diced and paste products over a 10-year timeframe to characterize current impacts and historical trends. Methods The LCA considers a scope from cradle-to-processing facility gate and accords with relevant Product Category Rules as published by the International EPD (R) System. Extensive primary data were collected for tomato cultivation for the years 2005 and 2015, and from processing facilities for 2005, 2010, and 2015 to understand the effects of evolving practices and technologies. We estimate crop and regional specific nitrous oxide and nitrate leaching emissions using a biogeochemical model, and the USES-LCA model is used to determine potential impacts from pesticide application. A suite of impact assessment categories is included based on the CML method (only global warming potential and freshwater consumption values are in the abstract). Results and discussion The 2015 results of the study indicate that diced tomatoes are responsible for 0.16 kg CO(2)e and 71 L of freshwater per kg, and paste is responsible for 0.83 kg CO(2)e and 328 L of freshwater per kg. The main opportunities for improvement include natural gas use in the greenhouse phase, energy for irrigation pumping and fertilizer type in the cultivation phase, and natural gas and electricity use in the facility processing phase. These hotspots are consistent with studies of processing tomato in other parts of the world. Evaluating trends over time showed that technological improvements in the industry had reduced life cycle impacts; for example, global warming potential decreased by 12% for paste and 26% for diced products between 2005 and 2015. Conclusions Trends over time show increasing efficiency at the cultivation and processing facility stages that have led to reductions in all impact categories evaluated. However, additional opportunities exist beyond efficiency improvements. Fertilizer and pesticide choice are potential opportunities for further reducing impacts. Also, the introduction of renewables in each phase of the supply chain (solar-powered irrigation pumps and onsite solar energy generation for facilities) could reduce the overall supply chain GWP(100) impacts by 9-10%.

AB  - As global environmental conditions continue to change at an unprecedented rate, many species will experience increases in natural and anthropogenic stress. Generally speaking, selection is expected to favor adaptations that reduce the negative impact of environmental stress (i.e., stress tolerance). However, natural environmental variables typically fluctuate, exhibiting various degrees of temporal autocorrelation, known as environmental colors, which may complicate evolutionary responses to stress. Here we combine experiments and theory to show that temporal environmental autocorrelation can determine long-term evolutionary responses to stress without affecting the total amount of stress experienced over time. Experimental evolution of RNA virus lineages in differing environmental autocorrelation treatments agreed closely with predictions from our theoretical models that stress tolerance is favored in less autocorrelated (whiter) environments but disfavored in more autocorrelated (redder) environments. This is explained by an interaction between environmental autocorrelation and a phenotypic trade-off between stress tolerance and reproductive ability. The degree to which environmental autocorrelation influences evolutionary trajectories depends on the shape of this trade-off as well as the relative level of tolerance exhibited by novel mutants. These results suggest that long-term evolutionary dynamics depend not only on the overall strength of selection but also on the way that selection is distributed over time.

AB  - The expected increase in drought severity and frequency as a result of anthropogenic climate change leads to concerns about the ability of native tree species to cope with these changes. To determine the susceptibility of Fagus sylvatica (European beech) and Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) - the two dominant deciduous tree species in Central Europe - to drought, we quantified the climate sensitivity and drought-response of radial growth for both species using an array of dendroecological methods. Tree-ring data were collected from a site east of Coburg, Bavaria which had shown pronounced stress-symptoms (early leaf coloration) during the record drought of 2018. Climate-growth relationships were used to establish the sensitivity of radial growth to multiple climatic variables. The impact of specific drought events on tree growth was quantified using tolerance indices. In addition, we employed a Principal Component Gradient Analysis (PCGA) and remote sensing data (MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) to delineate the species specific drought responses. Using these methods we were able to show a clear difference in drought susceptibility between beech and oak. Beech dis played a higher sensitivity to temperature and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and showed lower resistance and resilience to drought events than oak. In particular, beech was unable to fully recover from the 2003 drought, after which it expressed a stark growth decline, i.e. drought legacies, which was not observed for oak. The PCGA revealed a clear differentiation in the grouping of drought responses between beech and oak, supporting the findings of the climate-growth analysis and the tolerance indices. Correlations of NDVI and ring-width indices (RWI) indicated that under normal climatic conditions NDVI variability is linked to the start of the growing season. This is in contrast to drought years, such as 2003, where summer NDVI mirrored the drought response of beech and oak. These results reveal beech to have both a higher sensitivity to summer temperature and SPEI and a higher susceptibility to drought events. Although, in the past high plasticity and adaptability to drought have been attributed to both beech and oak, our study assigns beech a higher risk than oak to suffer from anticipated increases in drought frequency and intensity as a consequence of climate change.

AB  - Small lizards can accommodate to constraints imposed by temporal changes in ambient temperature through a combination of adaptive evolution and behavioral and physiological plasticity. Thermal physiology plasticity may compensate for climate variation and favor performance while minimizing behavioral costs in sub-optimal conditions. The Tandilia's lizard, Liolaemus tandiliensis, occurs in an isolated mountain range of the Argentinean temperate Pampas. In this study, we compared the thermal biology of L. tandiliensis between late spring (December) and mid-summer (February). The habitats' thermal quality was lower in late spring than in mid-summer. The lizard's field-body temperature (Tb) was 2-3 degrees C higher than the operative temperature (Te). Overall, the mean preferred temperature (Tsel) was 37.4 degrees C [preferred range (Tset): 36.2-38.7 degrees C], and was similar to other Liolaemus species. The Tset and Tsel of females in late spring were 1.8 degrees C lower than in mid-summer. In the case of males, the Tsel did not vary among seasons, while the Tset had a difference of 2.5 degrees C between seasons. Adults were moderate thermoregulators, but females were more efficient only in late spring (E-males = 0.69; E-females = 0.58), compared to mid-summer (E-males = 0.68; E-females = 0.50). Juveniles did not show temporal differences in temperature preferences and had a relatively higher efficiency in late spring (E = 0.38) compared to mid-summer (E = 0.28). An increased proportion of juveniles and adults shifted their Tb near to the Tset in late spring respect to mid-summer. The adults also matched their preferred temperatures to their current body temperature. These results suggest that seasonal shifts in the thermoregulatory parameters of L. tandiliensis may improve their thermoregulatory efficiency. Although temporal variation in ambient temperatures might influence the thermal biology of the studied lizards, other factors such as changes in the reproductive status may have also interfered.

AB  - The influenza A virus is a notorious pathogen that causes high morbidity, high mortality, and even severe global pandemics. Early and rapid diagnosis of the virus is therefore crucial in preventing and controlling any influenza outbreaks. Recently, novel nucleic acid-based affinity reagents called aptamers have emerged as promising candidates for diagnostic assays as they offer several advantages over antibodies, including in vitro selection, chemical synthesis, thermal stability and relatively low costs. Aptamers with high sensitivity and specificity are generated via Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), a process that is currently time-consuming, as well as labor- and resource-intensive. In this study, an integrated microfluidic system was developed and was successfully applied to screen a specific aptamer for the influenza A/H1N1 (InfA/H1N1) virus in an automated and highly efficient manner. The selected aptamer was implemented in a magnetic-bead assay, which demonstrated specific and sensitive detection of the InfA/H1N1 virus, even in biological samples such as throat swabs. Consequently, this specific aptamer presents a promising affinity reagent for clinical diagnosis of InfA/H1N1. This is the first demonstration of screening influenza virus-specific aptamers using the microfluidic SELEX technology, which may be expanded for the rapid screening of aptamers against other pathogens for future biomedical applications.

AB  - The tropical crab Armases miersii breeds in supratidal rock pools, where great salinity variations occur. In laboratory experiments, all larval stages (zoea I-III, megalopa) and the first juvenile were studied as to their tolerance of acute salinity changes (5-55 parts per thousand, intervals of 10 parts per thousand) after preceding adaptation to ambient sea water (32-33 parts per thousand). Our observations suggest that some osmoregulatory capability exists from hatching. Survival was frequently higher and development faster at 15-25 parts per thousand than in sea water (35 parts per thousand), possibly indicating a phylogenetic adaptation of A. miersii to brackish water. Extremely low and high salinities (5, 45-55 parts per thousand) caused prolonged development durations and increased mortality rates. Tolerance of very low salinity, but not that of hypersaline conditions tended to increase during development. This suggests that late stages attain an increasing capability for hyper-osmoregulation in dilute media, but probably remain poor regulators in concentrated media. The megalopa and crab I were, in some experiments, less affected by chronic than by acute exposure to unfavourable salinities, suggesting that non-genetic resistance adaptation (acclimatization) had taken place during earlier development. During continual exposure to extreme salinities, however, effects of severe osmotic stress outweighed those of acclimatization. The range which allowed for successful development through metamorphosis widened with consecutively later change of salinity: 15-35 parts per thousand (exposure from hatching), 15-45 parts per thousand (from zoea II), 5-45 parts per thousand (from zoea III), 5-55 parts per thousand (from megalopa or crab I). It is concluded that tolerance of variable, predominantly low salinities in larval and early juvenile A. miersii has evolved as an adaptation to breeding in a physically unstable environment, where rapidly decreasing or continually low salinities are more likely to occur than hypersaline conditions. The degree of salinity tolerance in its early life-cycle stages shows that this species has reached, within the Grapsidae, a phylogenetically intermediate stage of adaptation to conditions in freshwater and terrestrial environments.

AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae, SKUSE), is an important threat to public health due to its rapid spread and its potential as a vector. The eggs of Ae. albopictus are the most cold resistant life stage and thus, the cold hardiness of eggs is used to predict the future occurrence of the species in distribution models. However, the mechanism of cold hardiness has yet to be revealed. To address this question, we analyzed the layers of diapausing and cold acclimatized eggs of a temperate population of Ae. albopictus in a full factorial test design using transmission electron microscopy. We reviewed the hypotheses that a thickened wax layer or chorion is the cause of cold hardiness but found no evidence. As a result of the induced diapause, the thickness of the dark endochorion as a layer of high electron density and thus an assumed location for waxes was decreasing. We therefore hypothesized a qualitative alteration of the wax layer due to compaction. Cold acclimation was causing an increase in the thickness of the middle serosa cuticle indicating a detachment of serosa membrane from the endochorion as a potential adaptation strategy to isolate inoculating ice formations in the inter-membranous space.

AB  - Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) is considered as a viable option for low emission power generation and carbon dioxide sequestration. As a part of the process of IGCC plant design and development, modelling and simulation study of the whole IGCC process is important for thermodynamic performance evaluation, study of carbon capture readiness and economic analysis. The work presented in the paper is to develop such a whole system model and simulation platform. A simplified dynamic model for the IGCC process is developed, in which Texaco gasifier is chosen to give the basic representation for the IGCC process. The chemical equilibriums principle is used to predict the syngas contents in the modelling procedure. The influences of key parameters to regulate the input such as oxygen/coal ratio and water/coal ratio to syngas generation are studied. The simulation results are validated by comparing with the industry data provided by the Lu-nan fertilizer factory. Water-shift reactor, gas turbine and heat recovery steam-generation modules are modelled to study the dynamic performance with respect to the variation from the input of syngas stream. The simulation results reveal the dynamic changes in the plant outputs, including gas temperature, power output and mole percentages of hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the syngas. The process dynamic responses with three types of coal inputs are studied in the paper and their dynamic variation trends are presented via the simulation results.

AB  - The urban environs are a complex constructed interface that significantly alters rainfall-runoff relationships, and through the generation of anthropogenic and biogenic constituents results in significant transport of chemical, thermal, microbiological and. particulate matter (PM) loads. These loads are largely coupled with the altered rainfall-runoff relationship. In North American cities with municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) the load of volumetric runoff, chemicals and PM are equal to or greater than the untreated influent loads to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) yet the management of urban runoff loads is at least a half century behind municipal wastewater management yet is greater in scale and cost. Urban runoff management is very challenging; in part due to PM hetero-dispersivity, interactions between aqueous and PM phases, stochastic hydrology and highly unsteady hydrodynamics. Such challenges and associated costs with resolving such challenges have led to the relatively common historical. examination of a spectrum of urban constituent control systems as black-box systems and rainfall-runoff chemistry utilizing lumped measurements; and many indices and measurement methods adopted from wastewater treatment.
   Experience over the last several decades has demonstrated that there continues to be a gap in knowledge transfer between the design, analysis and monitoring of what are nominally called "Best Management Practices" (BMPs), fundamental unit operations and processes (UOP) concepts, sustainability requirements for BMPs, as well as new developments in the behavior of green urban infrastructure. Despite such disparity, tools such as UOP concepts, monitoring tools such as laser diffraction, and continuous simulation modeling are removing stormwater controls from the category of "black-boxes". With such tools we can now demonstrate treatment viability as a function of the hydrologic, physical, chemical, biological and thermal phenomena for rainfall-runoff or snowmelt. Stormwater systems that do not provide some level of hydrologic restoration, for example through "green" infrastructure materials; are not sustainable. Additionally given the particulate matter, gross solids and pollutant load inventories that build up in urban areas, source control practices and load credits must be an integral part of any management plan that includes restoration, treatment, control and reuse. Stormwater treatment, urban maintenance and green infrastructure will play an increasingly critical role in the entire urban water cycle and therefore we must develop maintenance practices such as pavement cleaning, source control and near-Source control. Further advances with respect to sustainability of urban water require tools such as continuous simulation models, smart sensors and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a focus on fundamental UOP concepts. This,paper examines the role of our constructed environs and activities therein on-the urban water cycle and coupled delivery of constituent loads that impact the environment and ecology including human ecology.
   This paper examines these constituent loads fundamentally and recommends management tools such as continuous simulation of hydrologic restoration to restore sustainability of the urban water cycle. Results illustrate the current practice of MS4s with thousands of BMPs is not sustainable. The future will require these advanced management tools, centralized treatment and frequent maintenance practices. Sustainability will ultimately require source control of loads, green infrastructure and hydrologic restoration. An emerging challenge in North America is the use of reclaimed wastewater back onto the urban interface with commensurate volumetric benefits yet chemical legacy concerns. State of the art tools, specifically computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are introduced to illustrate the role of CFD in examining treatment of urban water.

AB  - Pacific salmon migration timing can drive population productivity, ecosystem dynamics, and human harvest. Nevertheless, little is known about long-term variation in salmon migration timing for multiple species across broad regions. We used long-term data for five Pacific salmon species throughout rapidly warming southeast Alaska to describe long-term changes in salmon migration timing, interannual phenological synchrony, relationships between climatic variation and migratory timing, and to test whether long-term changes in migration timing are related to glaciation in headwater streams. Temporal changes in the median date of salmon migration timing varied widely across species. Most sockeye populations are migrating later over time (11 of 14), but pink, chum, and especially coho populations are migrating earlier than they did historically (16 of 19 combined). Temporal trends in duration and interannual variation in migration timing were highly variable across species and populations. The greatest temporal shifts in the median date of migration timing were correlated with decreases in the duration of migration timing, suggestive of a loss of phenotypic variation due to natural selection. Pairwise interannual correlations in migration timing varied widely but were generally positive, providing evidence for weak region-wide phenological synchrony. This synchrony is likely a function of climatic variation, as interannual variation in migration timing was related to climatic phenomenon operating at large- (Pacific decadal oscillation), moderate- (sea surface temperature), and local-scales (precipitation). Surprisingly, the presence or the absence of glaciers within a watershed was unrelated to long-term shifts in phenology. Overall, there was extensive heterogeneity in long-term patterns of migration timing throughout this climatically and geographically complex region, highlighting that future climatic change will likely have widely divergent impacts on salmon migration timing. Although salmon phenological diversity will complicate future predictions of migration timing, this variation likely acts as a major contributor to population and ecosystem resiliency in southeast Alaska.

AB  - Coral reefs are facing unprecedented mass bleaching and mortality events due to marine heatwaves and climate change. To avoid extirpation, corals must adapt. Individual variation in heat tolerance and its heritability underpin the potential for coral adaptation. However, the magnitude of heat tolerance variability within coral populations is largely unresolved. We address this knowledge gap by exposing corals from a single reef to an experimental marine heatwave. We found that double the heat stress dosage was required to induce bleaching in the most-tolerant 10%, compared to the least-tolerant 10% of the population. By the end of the heat stress exposure, all of the least-tolerant corals were dead, whereas the most-tolerant remained alive. To contextualize the scale of this result over the coming century, we show that under an ambitious future emissions scenario, such differences in coral heat tolerance thresholds equate to up to 17 years delay until the onset of annual bleaching and mortality conditions. However, this delay is limited to only 10 years under a high emissions scenario. Our results show substantial variability in coral heat tolerance which suggests scope for natural or assisted evolution to limit the impacts of climate change in the short-term. For coral reefs to persist through the coming century, coral adaptation must keep pace with ocean warming, and ambitious emissions reductions must be realized.

AB  - Hylobius abietis develop in conifer root-stumps and emerging adults attack replanted trees. Development is largely semi-voltine and this is an important determinant of economic impact, influencing the length of a fallow period or the frequency of chemical control.
   A simulation model followed a generation of weevils through the life cycle to predict voltinism based on temperature in the root-stump microhabitat modelled from air temperature. Daily air temperatures for representative U.K. locations simulated from the U.K. Climate Projections 2009 Weather Generator for the 2030-2070s were used to predict the potential effect of climate change on voltinism.
   The life cycle currently takes 2-3 years in the north and west (N&W) of the U.K. but, in the south and east (S&E), a 2-year cycle predominates. From the 2030s onwards, a predominant 2-year life cycle in the N&W was predicted to reduce economic impact in this region. In the S&E, however, the predicted 1-2-year cycle would be unlikely to reduced the period over which pest management was required.
   Changes in voltinism to the 2070s revealed different temporal patterns, emphasizing the importance for management of modelling local, as well as regional scale variation in the effects of climate change in Europe.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel-diesel-n-pentanol and biodiesel-diesel-n-hexanol blends without engine modification. The fuel constituents were varied between 0 and 100% in the range of 5%. In this, above 75% of biodiesel content, 5% of diesel and less than 20% of n-pentanol and n-hexanol content were selected. Based on the fuel characterization, B90-D5-P5, B85-D5-P10, B90-D5-H5 and B85-D5-H10 were selected for further experimental investigation. The lowest brake specific energy consumption of 12.64 MJ/kWh was obtained for B90-D5-H5 blend at full load condition. The maximum brake thermal efficiency of 31.0% was obtained in B90-D5-H5 blend. The B85-D5-H10 fuel has a maximum heat release rate of 44.53 J/degrees CA. The lowest carbon monoxide emission of 0.74% vol. was obtained from B85-D5-P10. At 100% load, least unburned hydrocarbons emission of 74 ppm was obtained in B85-D5-P10 blend. The maximum nitric oxide emission of 910 ppm was obtained in B85-D5-H10. Among the above mentioned blends B85-D5-P10 blend has the minimum emission of CO, UBHC and FSN. Thus, this paper discusses the viability of recommending biodiesel-diesel-alcohol blends to fulfill the future energy demands of the world. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We compare the predictions of Horizon-AGN, a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation that uses an adaptive mesh refinement code, to observational data in the redshift range 0 < z < 6. We study the reproduction, by the simulation, of quantities that trace the aggregate stellar-mass growth of galaxies over cosmic time: luminosity and stellar-mass functions, the star formation main sequence, rest-frame UV-optical-near-infrared colours and the cosmic star formation history. We show that Horizon-AGN, which is not tuned to reproduce the local Universe, produces good overall agreement with these quantities, from the present day to the epoch when the Universe was 5 per cent of its current age. By comparison to Horizon-noAGN, a twin simulation without active galactic nuclei feedback, we quantify how feedback from black holes is likely to help shape galaxy stellar-mass growth in the redshift range 0 < z < 6, particularly in the most massive galaxies. Our results demonstrate that Horizon-AGN successfully captures the evolutionary trends of observed galaxies over the lifetime of the Universe, making it an excellent tool for studying the processes that drive galaxy evolution and making predictions for the next generation of galaxy surveys.

AB  - Antarctic soils represent a unique environment characterised by extremes of temperature, salinity, elevated UV radiation, low nutrient and low water content. Despite the harshness of this environment, members of 15 bacterial phyla have been identified in soils of the Ross Sea Region (RSR). However, the survival mechanisms and ecological roles of these phyla are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether strains of Paenibacillus darwinianus owe their resilience to substantial genomic changes. For this, genome-based comparative analyses were performed on three P. darwinianus strains, isolated from gamma-irradiated RSR soils, together with nine temperate, soil-dwelling Paenibacillus spp. The genome of each strain was sequenced to over 1,000-fold coverage, then assembled into contigs totalling approximately 3 Mbp per genome. Based on the occurrence of essential, single-copy genes, genome completeness was estimated at approximately 88%. Genome analysis revealed between 3,043-3,091 protein-coding sequences (CDSs), primarily associated with two-component systems, sigma factors, transporters, sporulation and genes induced by cold-shock, oxidative and osmotic stresses. These comparative analyses provide an insight into the metabolic potential of P. darwinianus, revealing potential adaptive mechanisms for survival in Antarctic soils. However, a large proportion of these mechanisms were also identified in temperate Paenibacillus spp., suggesting that these mechanisms are beneficial for growth and survival in a range of soil environments. These analyses have also revealed that the P. darwinianus genomes contain significantly fewer CDSs and have a lower paralogous content. Notwithstanding the incompleteness of the assemblies, the large differences in genome sizes, determined by the number of genes in paralogous clusters and the CDS content, are indicative of genome content scaling. Finally, these sequences are a resource for further investigations into the expression of physiological attributes that enable survival under extreme conditions and selection processes that affect prokaryotic genome evolution.

AB  - Coral reefs are considered one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to ongoing global climate change. However, geographic and taxonomic responses to climate change are highly variable, and fundamental aspects of key research approaches remain unresolved, leaving substantial uncertainty in our ability to predict the future of coral reefs. I review the ecological and evolutionary. response of coral reefs to climate change in a broad temporal context, primarily focusing on tropical reef corals. I show critical gaps in our understanding that impede accurate prediction of future responses. These gaps include the response of past reefs to global change, the interpretation of coral response to thermal stress and ocean acidification, how corals and other reef organisms might respond evolutionarily, and our approach to evaluating response to climate in the context of multiple stressors. Reducing uncertainty by filling these gaps and by incorporating variation in geographic and taxonomic response will substantially improve our ability to model coral reef futures and manage coral reefs.

AB  - Background: Global warming has a marked influence on the life cycle of epidemic vectors as well as their interactions with human beings. The Aedes albopictus mosquito as the vector of dengue fever surged exponentially in the last decade, raising ecological and epistemological concerns of how climate change altered its growth rate and population dynamics. As the global warming pattern is considerably uneven across four seasons, with a confirmed stronger effect in winter, an emerging need arises as to exploring how the seasonal warming effects influence the annual development of Ae. albopictus.
   Methods: The model consolidates a 35-year climate dataset and designs fifteen warming patterns that increase the temperature of selected seasons. Based on a recently developed mechanistic population model of Ae. albopictus, the model simulates the thermal reaction of blood-fed adults by systematically increasing the temperature from 0.5 to 5 degrees C at an interval of 0.5 degrees C in each warming pattern.
   Results: The results show the warming effects are different across seasons. The warming effects in spring and winter facilitate the development of the species by shortening the diapause period. The warming effect in summer is primarily negative by inhibiting mosquito development. The warming effect in autumn is considerably mixed. However, these warming effects cannot carry over to the following year, possibly due to the fact that under the extreme weather in winter the mosquito fully ceases from development and survives in terms of diapause eggs.
   Conclusions: As the historical pattern of global warming manifests seasonal fluctuations, this study provides corroborating and previously ignored evidence of how such seasonality affects the mosquito development. Understanding this short-term temperature-driven mechanism as one chain of the transmission events is critical to refining the thermal reaction norms of the epidemic vector under global warming as well as developing effective mosquito prevention and control strategies.

AB  - The age of high-elevation planation surfaces in Corsica is constrained using new apatite (U-Th)/He data, field observations, and published work (zircon fission track, apatite fission track [AFT] data and landform/stratigraphical analysis). Thermal modeling results based on AFT and (U-Th)/He data, and the Eocene sediments uncomformably overlapping the Variscan crystalline basement indicate that present-day elevated planation surfaces in Corsica are the remnants of an erosion surface formed on the basement between similar to 120 and similar to 60 Ma. During the Alpine collision in the Paleocene-Eocene, the Variscan crystalline basement was buried beneath a westward-thinning wedge of flysch, and the eastern portion was overridden by the Alpine nappes. Resetting of the apatite fission track thermochronometer suggests an overburden thickness of >4 km covering Variscan Corsica. Protected by soft sediment, the planation surface was preserved. In the latest Oligocene to Miocene times, the surface was re-exposed and offset by reactivated faults, with individual basement blocks differentially uplifted in several phases to elevations of, in some cases, 12 km. Currently the planation surface remnants occur at different altitudes and with variable tilt. This Corsican example demonstrates that under favorable conditions, paleolandforms typical of tectonically inactive areas can survive in tectonically active settings such as at collisional plate margins. The results of some samples also reveal some discrepancies in thermal histories modeled from combined AFT and (U-Th)/He data. In some cases, models could not find a cooling path that fit both data sets, while in other instances, the modeled cooling paths suggest isothermal holding at temperature levels just below the apatite partial annealing zone followed by final late Neogene cooling. This result appears to be an artifact of the modeling algorithm as it is in conflict with independent geological constraints. Caution should be used when cross-validating the AFT and (U-Th)/He systems both in the case extremely old terrains and in the case of rocks with a relatively simple, young cooling history.

AB  - The consequences of climate change for biogeographic range dynamics depend on the spatial scales at which climate influences focal species directly and indirectly via biotic interactions. An overlooked question concerns the extent to which microclimates modify specialist biotic interactions, with emergent properties for communities and range dynamics. Here, we use an in-field experiment to assess egg-laying behaviour of a range-expanding herbivore across a range of natural microclimatic conditions. We show that variation in microclimate, resource condition and individual fecundity can generate differences in egg-laying rates of almost two orders of magnitude in an exemplar species, the brown argus butterfly (Aricia agestis). This within-site variation in fecundity dwarfs variation resulting from differences in average ambient temperatures among populations. Although higher temperatures did not reduce female selection for host plants in good condition, the thermal sensitivities of egg-laying behaviours have the potential to accelerate climate-driven range expansion by increasing egg-laying encounters with novel hosts in increasingly suitable microclimates. Understanding the sensitivity of specialist biotic interactions to microclimatic variation is, therefore, critical to predict the outcomes of climate change across species' geographical ranges, and the resilience of ecological communities.

AB  - Spatio-temporally continuous surface air temperature (SAT) is a valuable input for many research fields such as environmental studies and hydrological models. Substantial efforts have been focused on mapping daily SAT using land surface temperature (LST) derived from polar-orbiting satellites such as NASA's Terra and Aqua. However, reconstruction of SAT at very high temporal scales such as sub-daily or hourly was carried out in very few studies, most of which are based on the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites for small-scale areas with limited stations. In this study, we developed estimation schemes based on random forest for mapping hourly SAT over a large-scale region (CONUS) by blending LST datasets from the two-satellite system of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Series with the aim of reconstructing the hourly SAT maps with spatially uniform resolutions of about 2 km over CONUS. Estimation schemes with different variables were compared to evaluate the contributions of reanalysis variables and the hour of day (HOD) variable to model predicative performance, and the impacts of station density on model performance were also explored. We found that the model scheme with reanalysis variables and the scheme with HOD achieved higher predicative performance with the mean RMSE of 2.0 K and 2.5 K, respectively. Systematic predictive errors across the synoptic hours of a diurnal cycle are significantly reduced when considering HOD in the modeling of hourly SAT. The model scheme considering both reanalysis variables and HOD achieved the highest performance with a mean RMSE of 1.9 K. We observed that the influence of station density on model performance is related to types of cross-validation and model schemes, and that the uncertainty levels associated with the evaluation of predicative performance for the model schemes decrease with station density, which increases our confidence in the evaluation results for the schemes. Therefore, the mapping accuracy of hourly SAT over the large-scale area CONUS could be conservatively estimated to be 1.9-2.5 K using site-based cross-validation. We expect that this study will facilitate the further mapping of SAT at high-temporal scales over large-scale areas based on abundant and sustained observations from global systems of meteorological geostationary satellites.

AB  - Using the Integrated Biosphere Simulator, a dynamic vegetation model, this study initially simulated the net primary productivity (NPP) dynamics of China's potential vegetation in the past 55 years (1961-2015) and in the future 35 years (2016-2050). Then, taking the NPP of the potential vegetation in average climate conditions during 1986-2005 as the basis for evaluation, this study examined whether the potential vegetation adapts to climate change or not. Meanwhile, the degree of inadaptability was evaluated. Finally, the NPP vulnerability of the potential vegetation was evaluated by synthesizing the frequency and degrees of inadaptability to climate change. In the past 55 years, the NPP of desert ecosystems in the south of the Tianshan Mountains and grassland ecosystems in the north of China and in western Tibetan Plateau was prone to the effect of climate change. The NPP of most forest ecosystems was not prone to the influence of climate change. The low NPP vulnerability to climate change of the evergreen broad-leaved and coniferous forests was observed. Furthermore, the NPP of the desert ecosystems in the north of the Tianshan Mountains and grassland ecosystems in the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau also had low vulnerability to climate change. In the next 35 years, the NPP vulnerability to climate change would reduce the forest-steppe in the Songliao Plain, the deciduous broad-leaved forests in the warm temperate zone, and the alpine steppe in the central and western Tibetan Plateau. The NPP vulnerability would significantly increase of the temperate desert in the Junggar Basin and the alpine desert in the Kunlun Mountains. The NPP vulnerability of the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests would also increase. The area of the regions with increased vulnerability would account for 27.5% of China.

AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is one of the most ecologically and economically important forest-forming tree species in the Northern Hemisphere. Because of value, numerous genetic studies have been conducted since the 19th century to develop or improve the breeding and conservation programs of the species. Current studies are motivated by growing concerns about the survival and productivity of Scots pine populations, especially in the face of long-term environmental change predictions. In this article, we review major questions in the population genetics of Scots pine and show how previous studies advance current research approaches. We refer to major outcomes of the research describing the genetic variation and postglacial history of Scots pine compared with those of other cold-tolerant tree species such as Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver birch (Betula pendula). We present results from studies of quantitative trait variation and local adaptation across the Scots pine distribution. We focus on the main research directions in dissection of the genetic basis of adaptive traits and the search for signatures of selection using quantitative trait locus mapping, candidate genes, association genetics, and genome scanning approaches. Finally, we highlight novel approaches in molecular breeding and point out new research prospects in genomic studies of Scots pine and other forest tree species in the face of rapid developments in next-generation sequencing and genoiyping methods.

AB  - Advanced colorectal cancer is a common disease with an high mortality rate. For four decades, pharmacological treatment of the advanced disease was based on the use of 5-fluorouracil alone or in combination with biomodulators such as folinic acid and intereferon alpha. In the last 5 years, response to therapy has been considerably ameliorated thanks to the discovery of new drugs such as oxaliplatin and CPT-11. These agents, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, according to various schedules of treatment, have reached a significant improvement of palliation, response rate and survival. Immunotherapy is an uprising modality of treatment for human cancer including colorectal carcinoma. Its rationale is based on the knowledge that tumour cells are genetically unstable and produce molecular structures which allow their recognition and destruction by the immune-surveillance system. Therefore, humoral as well as cellular compartments of the immune system can be utilized according to a "passive" strategy (e.g. monoclonal antibody administration and adoptive immunotherapy) or an "active" approach, by using different modalities of vaccine therapy. In this context, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and cancer vaccines are being tested for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Due to their genetic instability and extraordinary adaptative potential, tumour cells may acquire resistance to the immune effectors and mAbs exactly as they do for cytotoxic drugs. To improve the results of both immunological and chemical modality of cancer treatment, an increasing number of authors is starting to combine chemo and immunotherapy in the attempt to circumvent the limitations of both strategies.

AB  - A full-scale multi-disc clutch test bench was set up and some sliding experiments were conducted to investigate the temperature evolution processes in low and high lubrication regimes. Friction discs with single friction lining were used and arranged back-to-back in order to preserve possible evidences of buckling. Temperatures were measured with thermocouples from four different radii on the mid-plane of the separator disc. Two different kinds of temperature variation processes with obvious critical points of cone shape buckling were obtained. These temperatures can be divided into three effective stages that represent different deformation status of the discs in these experiments. The temperature fields in the contacting separator disc and friction disc were studied through a transient heat conduction model, and the results show that the temperatures measured by the thermocouples from the separator disc can represent the average temperatures in both of the separator disc and friction disc for a long sliding time. By comparing the computational critical moments of the friction components with the experimental results, the capability of the curved beam model for predicting the critical moments of cone buckling was validated.

AB  - 1. Adaptation to cold environments of ectotherm populations is expected to result in increased standard metabolic rates if resources are not limiting. However, it is still unclear how the maintenance of high standard metabolic rates would affect locomotor performance and its impact at the population level.
   2. We compared standard metabolic rate and swimming performance of Brown Trout populations inhabiting rivers with contrasting thermal conditions. To avoid environmental confounding effects, we tested offspring raised in controlled conditions. There were significant differences among populations and families for both traits, suggesting that the observed differentiation pattern has a genetic basis.
   3. We found a significant negative relationship between standard metabolic rate and swimming performance at the population level. On the other hand, standard metabolic rates tended to be negatively related to the temperature in the rivers of origin, whereas swimming performance was positively related to river temperature, but these trends were not significant.
   4. These results suggest that selection for traits positively linked with standard metabolic rates may result in lower relative prolonged swimming performance. The potential evolutionary consequences of the observed negative relationship are discussed.

AB  - Amphibians are in decline principally due to the reduction of wetlands, yet no studies of their population trends have been published. Survival rates in the different stages of frog life may be considered as indicators of population dynamics and habitat suitability, thus permitting evaluation of the efficiency of newly constructed wetlands. Sessions of mark-release-recapture of tadpoles, froglets and adults of the Sahara Frog (Pelophylax saharicus) were thus undertaken in four Tunisian hill lakes over a two-year period (three months per year), to estimate efficiency rates between stages. No difference in tadpole densities was detected between lakes and years, though froglet densities in two of the lakes were always higher than in the other two. Similarly, adult densities were higher in the first two lakes. In August, survival between eggs and tadpoles ranged from 1.9 to 4.7%, in September, between tadpoles and froglets, from 14.8 to 28.5%, and between froglets and subadults (one year old) from 16.4 to 18.8%. Survival from the egg to the subadult stage therefore ranged from 0.7 to 1.3%.. These results show that the creation of small hill lakes provides for stable and structured populations of the Sahara Frog and that the smaller lakes are more favourable than the larger ones, in relation with a shore effect proportionally higher due to vegetation. These artificial wetlands increase the number of suitable habitats for pond-spawning species (frogs, toads), provide good compensation for the reduction of natural wetlands and may be adopted by managers as a new function (species conservation) for hill lakes.

AB  - Lizards that inhabit high-latitude alpine zones are exposed to extreme temperatures and long winters and most are diurnal heliotherms. Yet some poorly known nocturnal species exist in such locations, including several viviparous geckos from New Zealand. We studied the orange-spotted gecko (Mokopirirakau 'Roy's Peak'), a cryptic, nocturnal and viviparous lizard known only from the alpine zone (1150-1800 m a.s.l.) in the South Island (-44 degrees S). Our field study investigated (1) the influence of female reproductive condition and sex on daytime body temperatures, including relationships with microhabitat rock temperatures, (2) the influence of temperature and other weather conditions on gecko emergence by night and day, and (3) the thermal microclimates available year-round to orange-spotted geckos. Building a better understanding of these lizards aids in species conservation efforts, for example in developing monitoring programmes, and provides insights into the evolution of thermal mechanisms in cold environments. Reproductive females maintained higher daytime body temperatures than non-reproductive females and males, suggesting pregnancy-related thermophily. On summer days, all reproductive groups reached similar body temperatures to New Zealand geckos from lower elevations, suggesting similar thermal preferences. Using trail cameras, we obtained evidence of geckos openly basking during the day (previously undocumented for this species) when temperatures of exposed lizard models (=Texp) were 3.2-39.3 degrees C. We also observed emergence at night at low Texp (-0.8-14.6 degrees C), when some Tbs were probably 0-6 degrees C. Diurnal activity increased as Texp rose to peak at -30 degrees C before dropping again at higher temperatures, whereas nocturnal activity unexpectedly decreased with increasing Texp. Our study provides evidence of diurnal activity in a 'nocturnal' gecko that may be essential to squamate viviparity at high-latitude, high-elevation sites. It also suggests remarkable capacity for locomotor activity at extremely low Tb.

AB  - The thermal structure of Archean and Proterozoic lithospheric terranes in southern Africa during the Mesozoic was evaluated by thermobarometry of mantle peridotite xenoliths erupted in alkaline magmas between 180 and 60 Ma. For cratonic xenoliths, the presence of a 150-200 degreesC isobaric temperature range at 5-6 GPa confirms original interpretations of a conductive geotherm, which is perturbed at depth, and therefore does not record steady state lithospheric mantle structure.
   Xenoliths from both Archean and Proterozoic terranes record conductive limb temperatures characteristic of a "cratonic" geotherm similar to 40 mW m(-2)), indicating cooling of Proterozoic mantle following the last major tectonothermal event in the region at similar to1 Ga and the probability of thick off-craton lithosphere capable of hosting diamond. This inference is supported by U-Pb thermochronology of lower crustal xenoliths [Schmitz and Bowring, 2003. Contrib. Mineral. Petrol. 144, 592-618].
   The entire region then suffered a protracted regional heating event in the Mesozoic, affecting both mantle and lower crust. In the mantle, the event is recorded at similar to 150 Mato the southeast of the craton, propagating to the west by 108-74 Ma, the craton interior by 85-90 Ma and the far southwest and northwest by 65-70 Ma. The heating penetrated to shallower levels in the off-craton areas than on the craton, and is more apparent on the southern margin of the craton than in its western interior. The focus and spatial progression mimic inferred patterns of plume activity and supercontinent breakup 30-100 Ma earlier and are probably connected.
   Contrasting thermal profiles from Archean and Proterozoic mantle result from penetration to shallower levels of the Proterozoic lithosphere by heat transporting magmas. Extent of penetration is related not to original lithospheric thickness, but to its more fertile character and the presence of structurally weak zones of old tectonism. The present day distribution of surface heat flow in southern Africa is related to this dynamic event and is not a direct reflection of the pre-existing lithospheric architecture.

AB  - Aims We aimed to evaluate how climatic fluctuations influence the plasticity of anatomical vessel traits and the width of annual tree-rings of two relict-endemic Mexican Magnolia species. Notwithstanding, few studies have assessed the drought effect on vessel traits in tropical montane cloud trees of eastern Mexico.
   Methods Through digital images of growth rings, we assessed the tree radial growth rate, age of the trees and plasticity in vessel traits regarding climatic fluctuations of the Mexican Magnolia species studied. We compared vessel density, hydraulic diameter and percentage of conductive area in drought years (DY) and non-drought years (NDY) in two Mexican Magnolia species.
   Important Findings For the first time, the plasticity that occurs in porous wood vessel traits to long-term climatic fluctuations was analysed for two endangered Magnolia species (Magnolia vovidesii and M. schiedeana) from two tropical montane cloud forests in Mexico. We found that temperature and precipitation were strongly associated with differences in tree-ring width when DY and NDY were compared. Our analyses revealed that a high plasticity in vessel anatomy of diffuse-porous wood was related to temperature and/or water availability for both Magnolia species studied. We concluded that anatomical adaptations to DY resulted in a substantial reduction in vessel traits when compared with NDY, and that the plastic adaptations played an essential role in water transport and safety for the survival of the studied species during stressful long periods.

AB  - We examine the radius evolution of close in giant planets with a planet evolution model that couples the orbital-tidal and thermal evolution. For 45 transiting systems, we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths forward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semimajor axes and eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a given planet (semimajor axis, eccentricity, and system age), we find possible evolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated radii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First, planets start their evolution at larger semimajor axis, allowing them to contract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can significantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this effect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the orbit is proceeded by a long period while the semimajor axis slowly decreases. Some systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with our coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the number of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many as 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to be viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation. This is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism to explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have to be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on the eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber. In this scenario, we match the extremely large radius of WASP-12b. This work may cast some doubt on our ability to accurately determine the interior heavy element enrichment of normal, noninflated close in planets, because of our dearth of knowledge about these planets' previous orbital-tidal histories. Finally, we find that the end state of most close in planetary systems is disruption of the planet as it moves ever closer to its parent star.

AB  - Population-scale responses of key ecological traits to local environmental conditions provide insight into their adaptive potential. In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), short-term, individual developmental responses to the incubation environment have long-term consequences for populations. We took a model-based approach to study within- and among-population variation in the physiological components of TSD in 12 populations of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We used laboratory and field incubation data to quantify variation in thermal reaction norms at both population and clutch scales, focusing on the pivotal temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio (P) and the transitional range of incubation temperatures (TRTs) that produce mixed sex ratios. Defying theoretical expectations, among-population variation in P was not convincingly explained by geography or local thermal conditions. However, within some populations, P varied by >5 degrees C at the clutch scale, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of gonadal differentiation can vary substantially among individual nesting females. In addition, the TRT was wider at lower latitudes, suggesting responsiveness to local incubation conditions. Our results provide a potential explanation for discrepancies observed between constant-temperature experimental results and outcomes of fluctuating incubation conditions experienced in natural nests, exposing important knowledge gaps in our understanding of local adaptation in TSD and identifying shortcomings of traditional laboratory studies. Understanding individual variation and the timing of gonadal differentiation is likely to be far more useful in understanding local adaptation than previously acknowledged.

AB  - The motion and temperature evolution of beryllium droplets produced by first wall surface melting after ITER major disruptions and vertical displacement events mitigated during the current quench are simulated by the MIGRAINe dust dynamics code. These simulations employ an updated physical model which addresses droplet-plasma interaction in ITER-relevant regimes characterized by magnetized electron collection and thin-sheath ion collection, as well as electron emission processes induced by electron and high-Z ion impacts. The disruption scenarios have been implemented from DINA simulations of the time-evolving plasma parameters, while the droplet injection points are set to the first-wall locations expected to receive the highest thermal quench heat flux according to field line tracing studies. The droplet size, speed and ejection angle are varied within the range of currently available experimental and theoretical constraints, and the final quantities of interest are obtained by weighting single-trajectory output with different size and speed distributions. Detailed estimates of droplet solidification into dust grains and their subsequent deposition in the vessel are obtained. For representative distributions of the droplet injection parameters, the results indicate that at most a few percents of the beryllium mass initially injected is converted into solid dust, while the remaining mass either vaporizes or forms liquid splashes on the wall. Simulated in-vessel spatial distributions are also provided for the surviving dust, with the aim of providing guidance for planned dust diagnostic, retrieval and clean-up systems on ITER.

AB  - Invasion by nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) often results in replacement of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) in the-inland western United States, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We conducted a four-year removal experiment to test for population-level mechanisms (i.e., changes in recruitment, survival, emigration, and immigration) promoting invasion success of brook trout and causing decline of native Colorado River cutthroat trout (O. c. pleuriticus). We chose 700-1200 in segments of four small mountain streams where brook trout had recently invaded cutthroat trout populations, two each at mid elevation (2500-2700 m) and high elevation (3150-3250 m), and annually removed brook trout from two streams (treatments), but not the other two (controls). We used depletion electrofishing, two-way fish weirs, and mark-recapture methods to estimate abundance, movement, and survival of trout. At mid elevation, age-0 and age-1 cutthroat trout survived at 13 times and two times higher rates on average, respectively, where brook trout were removed. At high-elevation sites, recruitment of cutthroat trout failed despite brook trout removals, apparently because of cold water temperatures. In contrast, age-2 and older cutthroat trout survived at similar rates, whether brook trout were removed or not and regardless of elevation. Summer movement by cutthroat trout was unaffected by removal of brook trout. We conclude that brook trout depress cutthroat trout populations at mid elevation through age-specific biotic interactions that reduce juvenile cutthroat trout survival, whereas populations restricted to high-elevation sites by invasion continue to decline because an abiotic factor (low temperature) causes recruitment failure. In comparison, brook trout survived at the same or higher rates than same-aged cutthroat trout. High immigration by brook trout recolonized depleted segments, and may help sustain invasions in sink habitats where environmental conditions limit recruitment. In streams similar to those we studied, eradication of brook trout is likely necessary to eliminate the threat to native cutthroat,trout, but selective removal regimes that capture a high percentage of the brook trout population for least three consecutive years, repeated periodically, may permit cutthroat trout populations to persist with brook trout. To identify underlying mechanisms responsible for successful invasion by mobile, age-structured vertebrates such as stream fishes, experiments conducted at realistic spatial and temporal scales and including multiple age classes will be required.

AB  - The role of high temperature resistance in the world-wide cline of Adh and alpha-Gpdh allele frequencies of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. Experimental strains were used with different combinations of Adh and alpha-Gpdh alleles but with similar genetic background. The survival time of adult males, reared at different pre-adult temperatures, was measured at 35-degrees-C. To investigate the relationship between survival and protein content, triglycerides content and ADH and alpha-GPDH enzyme activity, the latter characters were measured before and after 12 h exposure to 35-degrees-C. Three-way ANOVA of survival at 35-degrees-C showed significant effects of rearing temperature and Adh genotype, interaction between Adh and alpha-Cpdh, interaction between Adh and rearing temperature and interaction between Adh, alpha-Gpdh and rearing temperature, alpha-GPDH enzyme activity did not change significantly. Although protein content, triglycerides content and ADH enzyme activity decreased significantly at 35-degrees-C, no correlation was observed between survival and these traits. It is concluded that the world-wide cline of Adh and alpha-Gpdh allele frequencies cannot simply be explained by the genotypic differences in resistance to high temperature of adult Drosophila melanogaster.

AB  - 1 Endangered plant species may be particularly vulnerable to global change. We investigated differences in the behaviour of the rare calcareous grassland species Gentiana cruciata and Gentianella germanica under ambient (360 mu l l(-1)) and elevated CO2 (600 mu l l(-1)) in a field experiment.
   2 Rosettes of G. germanica and C. cruciata were planted into grassland plots with 29 other plant species. Each of the 30 rosettes of G. germanica in a plot represented a different maternal seed family, whereas G. cruciata was grown from a mixture of seeds from one field site. After overwintering, eight of the 12 plots were equipped with open-top chambers, four of which were run at ambient and four at elevated CO2 concentrations; the remaining four plots were left without chambers.
   3 CO2 concentration did not significantly affect growth and survival of G. cruciata. Rosette diameter increased by 70% over 1 year.
   4 Overall only 13.6% of transplanted G. germanica survived for 1 year. Elevated CO2 reduced survival by 57% (this reduction was only marginally significant due to large variation between plots) and seed set by 46%. Both these effects appeared to be mediated by competition from other species since survival and seed set were negatively correlated with total plot biomass at the time of fastest growth in June 1994 and at the time of fruit set in October, respectively. Compared with plots under ambient CO2, population growth rate (based on survival and reproduction) was reduced by 56% under elevated CO2.
   5 There were no significant effects of elevated CO2 on leaf characters in either species.
   6 The sugar concentration of the nectar of G. germanica was increased by 36% under elevated CO2 but its composition remained unchanged.
   7 Significant interactions between the effects of seed family and CO2 concentration on demographic parameters in G. germanica indicated large genetic variation in the response to elevated CO2, which represents evolutionary potential. Although predictions based on mean responses are therefore unreliable, the majority of genotypes reacted negatively to elevated CO2, suggesting that competitive exclusion and extinction of G. germanica would occur at many sites before populations could adapt to increased concentrations of CO2.

AB  - In natural field conditions Rana pipiens is an aquatic hibernator and Rana sylvatica a terrestrial hibernator.  Habitat selection in the laboratory at low temperatures was similar to hibernating habitat in the field.  Habitat preference tests were conducted in warm (15 C) and near-freezing (1.5 C) air temperatures.  Rana pipiens shows no preference for either water or land at 15 C, but prefers water to land at 1.5 C.  When given a choice between bare moist soil or moist soil covered by leaf litter, R. pipiens remains on the uncovered surface in both warm and cold conditions.  Rana sylvatica prefers land to water at both 15 C and 1.5 C.  At 1.5 C R. sylvatica burrows into soil and seeks cover beneath leaf litter; it also selects moist soil rather than wet mud during exposure to cold.  Rana sylvatica can survive prolonged submergence in ice-covered water.  Physiological adaptations such as cryoprotectants and the geographic distribution of R. sylvatica are discussed in relation to habitat selection at low temperatures.

AB  - Light-responsive soft actuators have recently drawn attention as the need for lightweight remotely controlled actuator systems with high environmental adaptability and safe human-robot interaction interface characteristics has increased. In this study, we focused on a near-infrared (NIR) light-tunable hydrogel soft actuator system capable of fast and precisely controllable mechanical actuation even under the irradiation of NIR light with low intensity. We designed a bilayer type hydrogel soft actuator consisting of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) active layer containing gold nanorods (AuNRs) as a photothermal agent and poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) passive layer. AuNRs with an aspect ratio of 4.12 showed the largest longitudinal plasmon resonance absorption peak in the NIR 880 nm range, which was used as a photothermal agent. The AuNR-incorporated PNIPAAm/PAAm hydrogel with a bilayer structure (PNIPAAm-AuNR/PAAm) exhibited more than 70% gel fraction and temperature-sensitive swelling behaviors. In particular, rod-shaped PNIPAAm-AuNR/PAAm hydrogels showed rapid bending deformation by a photothermally induced phase transition of PNIPAAm upon 880 nm laser irradiation, but a PNIPAAm/PAAm bilayer hydrogel without AuNRs did not show a light-induced bending movement. The NIRresponsive bending actuation of the hydrogel can be precisely controlled by cross-linking density, content of photothermal agent, NIR laser intensity, and thickness ratio of the active/passive layer. It was observed that the full bending deformations of the hydrogel into a ring shape through an arc occurred within a minute under NIR irradiation with a lower intensity of less than 1.0 W/cm(2) . Hydrogels showed a cell viability of more than 95% in the biocompatibility test, indicating no significant cytotoxicity. Therefore, these PNIPAAm-AuNR/PAAm hydrogels are promising soft actuator materials that can be controlled by low-intensity NIR irradiation for remotely controlled humanerobot interaction interface applications.

AB  - The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is one of the major insect pests of mature Norway spruce forests. In this study, a model describing the temperature-dependent thresholds for swarming activity and temperature requirement for development from egg to adult was driven by transient regional climate scenario data for Sweden, covering the period of 1961-2100 for three future climate change scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B2). During the 20th century, the weather supported the production of one bark beetle generation per year, except in the north-western mountainous parts of Sweden where the climate conditions were too harsh. A warmer climate may sustain a viable population also in the mountainous part; however, the distributional range of I. typographus may be restricted by the migration speed of Norway spruce. Modelling suggests that an earlier timing of spring swarming and fulfilled development of the first generation will significantly increase the frequency of summer swarming. Model calculations suggest that the spruce bark beetle will be able to initiate a second generation in South Sweden during 50% of the years around the mid century. By the end of the century, when temperatures during the bark beetle activity period are projected to have increased by 2.4-3.8 degrees C, a second generation will be initiated in South Sweden in 63-81% of the years. The corresponding figures are 16-33% for Mid Sweden, and 1-6% for North Sweden. During the next decades, one to two generations per year are predicted in response to temperature, and the northern distribution limit for the second generation will vary. Our study addresses questions applicable to sustainable forest management, suggesting that adequate countermeasures require monitoring of regional differences in timing of swarming and development of I. typographus, and planning of control operations during summer periods with large populations of bark beetles.

AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), can cause direct damage to citrus trees and is the main vector for the devastating disease, citrus greening disease or huanglongbing. Most molecular studies on this important insect pest use real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to quantify gene expression, including analyzing molecular basis for insecticide resistance in field populations. One critical factor to cause inaccuracy in RT-qPCR results is the lack of appropriate internal reference genes for optimal data normalization. In this study, the expression levels of 10 selected reference genes were evaluated in different tissue samples of psyllid adults and in the insects treated with different temperatures and insecticides. Data were analyzed using different computational algorithms, including Delta Ct, BestKeeper, NormFinder, geNorm, and RefFinder. According to our results, at least two reference genes should be used for the normalization of RT-qPCR data in this insect. The best choices of reference genes for different samples are as follows: ACT1 and Ferritin for different tissue samples, RPS20 and Ferritin for samples treated with different temperatures, TBP and EF1 for samples treated with imidacloprid, and Ferritin and TBP for samples treated with beta-cypermethrin. The reference genes identified in this study should be useful for future studies to analyze the expression patterns of target genes, especially for genes linked with temperature adaptability and insecticide resistance in this insect species in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global public health crisis with social, psychological and long-lasting economical damages. Weather-related dynamics have an impact on the pattern of human health and disease. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of heat and humidity on daily basis incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 pandemic in ten of the world's hottest countries compared to ten of the coldest ones.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Worldwide, we selected 20 countries; 10 hottest countries with the highest temperatures and 10 coldest countries with the lowest temperature. The selection of the countries was based on the daily basis mean temperature from the date of appearance of the initial cases of COVID-19, Dec 29, 2019 to May 12, 2020. In the world's 10 hottest countries, the mean temperature was (26.31 +/- 1.51) and humidity (44.67 +/- 4.97). However, in the world's 10 coldest countries the mean temperature was (6.19 1.61) and humidity (57.26 +/- 2.35). The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization, and daily information on temperature and humidity was obtained from metrological web "Time and Date".
   RESULTS: In countries with high temperatures and low humidity, the mean daily cases incidence were (407.12 +/- 24.33); cumulative cases (9094.341 +/- 708.29); and cumulative deaths (452.84 43.30) were significantly low compared to countries with low temperatures and high humidity: daily cases (1876.72 +/- 207.37); cumulative cases (44232.381 +/- 5875.11); and cumulative deaths (2008.29 +/- 310.13). Moreover, COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population were significantly low in countries with high temperatures (cases 711.23, and deaths 16.27) compared to countries with low temperatures (cases 1685.99; and deaths 86.40). Furthermore, in hottest countries, a 1% increase in humidity reduced number of cases and deaths by (beta= -5.40, p<0.001) and (beta = -0.187, p=0.004) respectively. A similar trend was seen with a 1 degrees C increase in temperature, reducing the number of deaths by (beta = -1.35. p<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed a significant decrease in incidence of daily cases and deaths in countries with high temperatures and low humidity (warmest countries), compared to those countries with low temperatures and high humidity (coldest countries). The findings could be of interest to the policymakers and the health officials on the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 pandemic and weather changes.

AB  - This study experimentally investigates the generation of polyelectrolyte droplets, and subsequently, cured microcarriers for application in microorganism cultivation. Microcarriers containing an mature microorganism culture can replace in situ biofilms in microfluidic bioprocesses to reduce the startup duration and facilitate the replenishment of functional microorganisms. This study examines the effects of particulate solutes (polystyrene (PS) microparticles, Chlorella vulgaris, and Escherichia coli) on polyelectrolyte solution properties (zeta potential, contact angle, and interfacial tension) and droplet/microcarrier formation. The results indicated that, except for interfacial tension and shear stress, the colloidal stability and morphology of particulate solutes should also be considered when generating droplets. A particulate solute resulting in a dispersed phase with colloidal stability was beneficial for the predictable droplet generation. A particulate solute increasing the affinity between the disperse phase and the channel wall hastened the droplet generation to shift from the dripping region to the jetting region. Adding particulate solutes with consistent size and morphology into the dispersed phase was less likely to affect the droplet formation and the droplet size. In this study, adding PS microparticles and C. vulgaris into a diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DDA) solution resulted in a more hydrophilic solution and higher interfacial tension compared with adding DDA solution alone. These particulate solutes also tended to cause incipient colloidal instability. The incipient instability of the C. vulgaris solution led to various droplet sizes. However, the droplet sizes of the PS microparticle solution, which had solution properties similar to those of the C. vulgaris solution, were more uniform because of the consistent size and morphology of PS microparticles. Adding moderate amounts of E. coli resulted in a more hydrophobic solution, lower interfacial tension, and satisfactory colloidal stability. The droplets containing microorganisms were cured to generate poly-DDA (PDDA) microcarriers, and E. coli cultivated in PDDA microcarriers had the same viability as those cultivated in suspension. However, C. vulgaris cultivated in PDDA microcarriers failed to proliferate possibly due to the blockage of the nutrient intake by the quaternary ammonium cation of DDA. (c) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - Aquaculture of red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852), has developed rapidly worldwide in recent years with promising prospects. However, limited knowledge about temperature effects on reproductive performance and embryonic development has hindered the development of crayfish aquaculture. The two present studies were conducted to identify optimal water temperatures (17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C) for reproductive performance (experiment 1) and embryonic development (experiment 2) of P. clarkii. Totally, there were 12 replicates, with 480 adults and embryos from 60 ovigerous crayfish selected for experiment 1 and 2, respectively. In the first experiment, the survival of adult crayfish was not significantly affected by the temperatures tested. However, significantly higher feeding rates, spawning rates, and fecundity were obtained at 21 degrees C and 25 degrees C when compared to those at 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C. Polynomial models and loess regression fitted to the experimental data showed that highest spawning rates and fecundity occurred at 21 degrees C while shortest duration from mating to spawning was found at 33 degrees C. In the second experiment, we found that optimal embryonic development was at 25 degrees C with shorter hatching time and no abnormalities observed. However, while embryos showed abnormalities and subsequently died at 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C. We further built a temperature-dependent developmental model for P. clarkii embryos: D (developmental time, days) = 3,140,837(T-2.03)(-3.76). Based on these results, the temperature range 21 degrees C - 25 degrees C was recommended for adult crayfish reproduction and 25 degrees C was recommended for embryonic development. This study indicates that manipulating water temperature is an effective alternative to current artificial reproduction techniques (e.g. eyestalk ablation and injection hormones) to induce spawning and embryonic development and thus provides mass production of juvenile P. clarkii for aquaculture.

AB  - High DHA production cost caused by low DHA titer and productivity of the current Schizochytrium strains is a bottleneck for its application in competition with traditional fish-oil based approach. In this study, atmospheric and room-temperature plasma with iodoacetic acid and dehydroepiandrosterone screening led to three mutants, 6-8, 6-16 and 6-23 all with increased growth and DHA accumulations. A LC/MS metabolomic analysis revealed the increased metabolism in PPP and EMP as well as the decreased TCA cycle might be relevant to the increased growth and DHA biosynthesis in the mutants. Finally, the mutant 6-23, which achieved the highest growth and DHA accumulation among all mutants, was evaluated in a 5 L fermentor. The results showed that the DHA concentration and productivity in mutant 6-23 were 41.4 g/L and 430.7 mg/L/h in fermentation for 96 h, respectively, which is the highest reported so far in literature. The study provides a novel strain improvement strategy for DHA-producing Schizochytrium.

AB  - Studying how genetic diversity is transmitted between generations is critical for assessing the survival prospects of fragmented forest tree populations. This is especially urgent in the case of rare, endangered species that are at high risk of extinction and/or exceptionally susceptible to climate change, and are thus to be prioritised for conservation initiatives. We performed the first assessment of gene flow patterns by parentage analysis in the IUCN red-listed Serbian spruce [Picea omorika (Pan.c.) Purk.], within a Genetic Conservation Unit (GCU) which was exposed to fire disturbance 30 years ago. Parentage analysis was based on assigning the parentage of 104 juveniles to all the adult trees (48) present in the 2.8 ha population. All individuals were genotyped at 11 highly informative nuclear microsatellite markers.
   We found that fire disturbance triggered natural regeneration, usually poor to absent in Serbian spruce, and boosted pollen immigration (66%), which is reported as rather modest among undisturbed populations of this species. Seed immigration was absent, coherently with what was previously hypothesised for natural, undisturbed populations. Thus, the immigration of new gametes into the studied Serbian spruce population was accomplished exclusively through pollen gene flow, at a rate sufficient to counteract, at least in the short term, genetic drift. Furthermore, the abundant post-disturbance pollen immigration most likely accounts for the lack of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) in the juvenile cohort, contrary to the SGS observed in the adult cohort which is amongst the strongest ever recorded in anemophilous forest tree species. Finally, as generally found in forest trees, individual reproductive success was uneven among individuals, with 25% of local adults siring 70% of the sampled juveniles.
   Our results on post-disturbance gene flow patterns in the only Serbian spruce population with reportedly abundant regeneration complement the outcomes of previous genetic studies while providing essential information for the dynamic management and conservation of this rare and endangered species severely threatened by climate warming. Tracking the temporal development of gene flow parameters and the consequences of gene flow on genetic diversity are two cornerstones of future forest genetic monitoring programs, which are particularly important for GCUs. In particular, monitoring the genetic diversity of forest regeneration is deemed as the key for understanding changes that otherwise would remain mostly untraceable in long-lived organisms such as forest trees.

AB  - Synthetic fertilizers have low uptake efficiency by crops, it can be less than 50% of the applied fertilizer, the not incorporated fertilizer brings an adverse environmental impact, such as groundwater, contamination with NO3-, eutrophication, acid rain and global warming. An alternative to use bio-fertilizers, are microorganisms preparations applied to the soil and or plant, to replace partially or totally synthetic fertilizer. The responses to biofertilizers vary considerably, depending on kind of microorganisms, soil type, plant species and environmental conditions. Applied microorganisms must compete with native soil microflora which might be better adapted to adverse environmental conditions (lack of soil moisture, predation, high salinity and extremes pH); these factors can quickly diminish the population of any microbial species introduced into the soil. The results of this research indicate that the use of native strains in the development of biofertilizers, have a greater opportunity of effectiveness use in the field due to their adaptability to the soil conditions of each region.

AB  - Altering one's temperature preference (e.g. behavioral fever or behavioral chill) is a common immune defense among ectotherms that is likely to be evolutionarily conserved. However, the temperature chosen by an infected host may not be optimal for pathogen defense, causing preference to be inefficient. Here we examined the efficiency of temperature preference in Drosophila melanogaster infected with an LD50 of the gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To this end, we estimated the host's uninfected and infected temperature preferences as well as their optimal survival temperature. We found that flies decreased their preference from 26.3 degrees C to 25.2 degrees C when infected, and this preference was stable over 48 h. Furthermore, the decrease in temperature preference was associated with an increased chance of surviving the infection. Nevertheless, the infected temperature preference did not coincide with the optimum temperature for infection survival, which lies at or below 21.4 degrees C. These data suggest that the behavioral response to P. aeruginosa infection is considerably inefficient, and the mechanisms that may account for this pattern are discussed. Future studies of infected temperature preferences should document its efficiency, as this understudied aspect of behavioral immunity can provide important insight into preference evolution.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture is the only solution to both meet human needs and conserve natural resources to maintain and improve the environment. To achieve all this, however, requires greater research into cereal production the economic efficiency of this sector. The research over the period 2007-2009 was designed to establish the adaptability on various systems of soil mechanic works and different doses of fertilizer of maize hybrids by applying classical and conservative technologies, agricultural technologies less pollutant in the Big Island of Braila, agricultural technologies what can ameliorate physical, chemical and biological parameters of soil. The poly-factorial type 2x2x3 experiment used two hybrids of maize (PR36R10 and PR36R11), two tillage systems (traditional and conservative) and 3 doses of fertilizer (unfertilized, N50P0, N100P0); the experiment was done on a eutric gleiosol, soil characteristic of the analyzed ecosystem. By introducing averages obtained during the three study years in the analysis of production variance, statistical interpretation was concluded that the production fluctuations from year to year were high, and the combination of factors is significant. Following statistical interpretation of results, the evolution of the average productions, average quantity of grain maize obtained were shown to have a significant decreased in 2007, due to drought and high temperatures during pollination. This had led to the disruption of the grain formation process. From the analysis of the influence of the tillage system on production, significant increases between the PR36R10 hybrid and the control variant (0.48 - 0.68 t/ha,). Comparison of the classic system and the conservative system showed one influenced less the grain production, both for PR36R10 hybrid and the PR36R11 hybrid. Following the productions in terms of N dose application, in comparison to the dose of fertilization which took effect obviously on production, the system of mechanical work of the soil influenced insignificant production of grain maize obtained it was found that production increased by up to 1320 kg/ha in comparison with the control variant, without fertilization, liming on the basis of nitrogen have led to advancements in production. Variants treated with fertilizer 100 kg N active substance have had increase in higher production with 583 kg/ha, compared with variants treated with fertilizer - 50 kg active substance N.

AB  - Sexual conflicts are ubiquitous in nature and are expected to lead to an antagonistic coevolution between the sexes. This coevolutionary process is driven by selection on sexually antagonistic traits that can either be directional or fluctuating. In this study, we used dormant cysts of Artemia franciscana, collected in the same population in three different years over a 23-year period ( corresponding to similar to 160 generations in this system), to investigate male-female coevolution in natural conditions over time. We performed a cross experiment study where reproduction of females mated to males from the past, present, or future was monitored until death. In agreement with a model of "fluctuating selection," we found that females survived better and had longer interbrood intervals when mated with their contemporary males compared to when mated with males from the future or the past. However, female weekly and lifetime reproductive successes displayed no differences between contemporary and noncontemporary matings. Finally, the coevolutionary patterns ("arms race dynamics" or "fluctuating selection dynamics") possibly acting on female relative fitness could not be discriminated. This study is the first direct demonstration that the process of male-female coevolution, previously revealed by experimental evolution in laboratory artificial conditions, can occur in nature on a short evolutionary time scale.

AB  - Flexibility of gene expression in bacteria permits its survival in varied environments. The genetic adaptation of bacteria through systematized gene expression is not only important, but also clinically relevant in their ability to grow biofilms in stress environments. Stress responses enable their survival under more severe conditions, enhanced resistance and/or virulence. In Escherichia coli (E. coli), two of the possible important genes for biofilm growth are rpoS and bolA gene. RpoS is also called as a master regulator of general stress response. Even though many studies have revealed the importance of rpoS in planktonic cells, little is known about the functions of rpoS in biofilms. In contrast, bolA which is a morphogene in E. coli is overexpressed under stressed environments resulting in round morphology. The hypothesis is that bolA could be implicated in biofilm development. This study reviewed the literature with the aim of understanding the stress tolerance response of E. coli in relation with rpoS and bolA genes in different environmental conditions including heat shock, cold shock, and stress in response to oxidation, acidic condition and in presence of cadmium. Knowledge of the genetic regulation of biofilm formation may lead to the understanding of the factors that drive the bacteria to switch to the biofilm mode of growth.

AB  - The paper by Battaglia and Protopapas (Stat Method Appl 2012) is stimulating. It gives an elegant mathematical generalization of autoregressive models (the nine types). It explains state-of-the-art model fitting techniques (genetic algorithm combined with fitness function and least squares). It is written in a fluent and authoritative manner. Important for having a wider impact: it is accessible to non-statisticians. Finally, it has interesting results on the temperature evolution over the instrumental period (roughly the past 200 years). These merits make this paper an important contribution to applied statistics as well as climatology. As a climate researcher, coming from Physics and having had an affiliation with a statistical institute only as postdoc, I re-analyse here three data series with the aim of providing motivation for model selection and interpreting the results from the climatological perspective.

AB  - Engagement control of an automatic mechanical transmission clutch during vehicle start-up has important influences on the safety, comfort, service life, energy consumption, and emissions of the vehicle. However, all existing control strategies use single-layer control, which leads to poor temperature adaptability. This paper develops a double-layer control strategy based on an automatic actuator to improve vehicle start-up performance. The governing characteristics of a diesel engine with a variable-speed governor are studied. The working principles and a model of the automatic actuator are described. A simulation of vehicle start-up is constructed and tested. Finally, the double-layer control strategy is verified in an experimental vehicle. The experimental and simulation results show that the double-layer control strategy provides shorter start times, less jerking, and lower friction, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and practicability.

AB  - An integrated approach through coupling response surface method (RSM) and genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to optimize the spray dryer operational condition for production of fish oil microcapsules. The inlet drying air temperature, aspirator rate, and peristaltic pump rate were independent and encapsulation efficiency (EE) and exergy efficiency were dependent variables. RSM was applied to establish the relationship between the independent and dependent variables followed by integrating the developed models using three mathematical approaches and measure the fitness value of GA. Consequently, the optimal drying condition for microencapsulation of fish oil was: inlet drying air temperature = 177.23 degrees C, aspirator rate = 63.93%, and peristaltic pump rate = 14.04% yielding exergy efficiency of 8.10% and EE of 79.14%. The results of confirmation experiments for selected drying condition proved the capability of utilized approach for determination of sustainable and qualified process in fish oil microencapsulation by spray drying.

AB  - Prey animals avoid and survive encounters with predators through morphological and behavioral mechanisms, but these defenses can negatively affect fitness when individuals forgo foraging and reproductive opportunities. Although many studies have focused on the costs associated with antipredator behavior, few have evaluated how that behavior changes immediately following a nonlethal interaction with a predator. Understanding how differences in species ecology (i.e., autotomy and regeneration capabilities) influence antipredator behaviors prior to and following a predation attempt could provide insight into how animals cope with living among predators. In this study, we evaluated the antipredator and compensatory behaviors of Northern Zigzag Salamanders (Plethodon dorsalis) to determine how attempted predation affects behavioral responses to perceived predation risk. In a laboratory setting, we performed behavioral assays evaluating escape distance, exploratory movements, cover use, eating habits, and temperature preferences on individuals assigned to attacked (tail autotomy) and control treatments. We found differences in antipredator and compensatory responses between the two treatments, indicating that responses change relative to previous experiences with predators and present risk of predation. Our results indicate that attacked individuals had lower thresholds to elicit a behavioral response relative to control individuals and compensated for loss of resources and decreased locomotive ability by selecting warmer-temperature microhabitats. This study provides insight into how individuals cope with living amongst predators and emphasizes the need to explore behavioral changes following predation.

AB  - Due to geographically variable species interactions, plants may become locally adapted to their sympatric herbivores and pollinators. However, adaptation to the abiotic environment may significantly affect plant interactions with herbivores and pollinators. Local adaptation to the abiotic environment may constrain local adaptation to herbivores and pollinators under contrasting selection pressures, resulting in trade-offs in local adaptation. We studied local adaptation of a perennial herb, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria, in a reciprocal transplant experiment among four populations and measured plant fitness, pollination success and resistance to two specialist herbivores. We also estimated local adaptation of these two herbivores and generalist pollinators to their sympatric plant populations. Local adaptation was compared with within-population genetic variation, genetic and geographical divergence, and with divergence in terms of population size, environmental conditions and plant secondary chemistry. We further compared local adaptation to the environment, to local adaptation to herbivores and pollinators to detect possible trade-offs in local adaptation. The existence and degree of local adaptation varied among the plant populations. Plants from two populations were locally adapted to their sympatric leaf herbivores and plants from two populations were locally adapted to their abiotic environment. Herbivores from one population were locally adapted to their sympatric plant population. Local adaptation of V. hirundinaria to the seed predator increased with increasing among-population divergence in precipitation and temperature. Local adaptation to the seed predator and the environment increased with increasing population genetic variation. Local adaptation of V. hirundinaria in fitness and in herbivore resistance also correlated positively, suggesting lack of trade-offs in local adaptation. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that species interactions can lead to a mosaic of locally adapted plant, herbivore and pollinator populations. In addition to natural enemies, genetic variation, the abiotic environment and mutualistic interactions contribute to the evolution of local adaptation in long-lived plants. These results provide new insights into the patterns and causes of variation in local adaptation and are among the first to demonstrate that conflicting selection pressures within a population do not constrain local adaptation in multiple traits.

AB  - Previous research has suggested that arctic populations have elevated metabolic rates in response to their cold, marginal climate. Recent studies of indigenous Siberian groups have confirmed these earlier findings and have shed light on the mechanisms through which northern populations adapt to their environments. Indigenous Siberians show significant elevations in basal metabolic rate compared with reference values. Total energy expenditure is variable across Siberian groups and is correlated with levels of acculturation. Siberian populations appear to have adapted to cold stress through both short-term acclimatization and genetic adaptations, with thyroid hormones playing an important role in shaping metabolic responses. Elevated metabolic rates also have important consequences for health and may contribute to the low serum lipid levels observed in Siberian groups. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of metabolic adaptation and their implications for ongoing health changes among indigenous Siberians.

AB  - Reactions of the invasive alien species Achatina fulica to abiotic factors: perspectives for the management. Achatina fulica Bowdich, 1822 is an african snail that is invasive in different parts of the world, being characterized mainly by its high adaptability. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of abiotic factors, such as temperature and substrate, on the egg eclosion, adult and juvenile reaction to different abiotics factors, and the resistance of A. fulica to popular methods of control. Three studies were made, including 19 laboratory experiments and observations of free animals in the municipal district of Guaraquecaba, southern Brazil. Eggs were characterized as the most fragile phase, whereas the juveniles and adults were resistant to the immersion in fresh and salt water and little resistant to temperature variation and salt, using burying, aestivation, and muscular force as defense strategies. Those strategies should be considered in management actions and in orientating popular methods of control.

AB  - Outdoor workers may need to adapt to warming by moving labor from midday to cooler hours. Here the authors find this adaptation strategy loses efficacy under additional climate change due to increased heat exposure in the coolest hours of the day.
   Working in hot and potentially humid conditions creates health and well-being risks that will increase as the planet warms. It has been proposed that workers could adapt to increasing temperatures by moving labor from midday to cooler hours. Here, we use reanalysis data to show that in the current climate approximately 30% of global heavy labor losses in the workday could be recovered by moving labor from the hottest hours of the day. However, we show that this particular workshift adaptation potential is lost at a rate of about 2% per degree of global warming as early morning heat exposure rises to unsafe levels for continuous work, with worker productivity losses accelerating under higher warming levels. These findings emphasize the importance of finding alternative adaptation mechanisms to keep workers safe, as well as the importance of limiting global warming.

AB  - Low build time in Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MatEx) is key to economic printing of large parts and bigger batch sizes on an industrial scale. A prevalent solution is to print large roads at the cost of reduced geometric resolution and greater post-processing waste. The alternative of parallelization, i.e., using multiple printheads to concurrently print distinct sections of a part, suffers from limited geometric complexity, high cost, and complex machine design. We create a new paradigm for parallelized MatEx of thermoplastics called Mul-tiplexed Fused Filament Fabrication (MF3). MF3 prints concurrently with multiple FFF extruders without con-trolling each extruder motion's individually by using a new toolpath strategy that is rooted in our discovery of continuous filament retraction and advancement. MF3 can print non-periodic 3D structures, larger contiguous parts or multiple smaller distinct parts or a mixture of both, on the same machine, at an unprecedented throughput-resolution combination, without the limitations of state-of-the-art parallelization methods. MF3 also enables a form of hardware-fault-tolerance that is lacking in conventional single-nozzle printing by allowing printing to continue despite extruder failure. We reveal key parametric effects in continuous retraction/ advancement and uncover new insight into the corresponding extrudate behavior. We also develop a unique thermal model which shows the impact of the extruder array's configuration and the inter-section interface type on part-scale temperature evolution. Finally, we discuss how MF3 will realize new economies of scale and productivity in MatEx.

AB  - Climate change is emerging as one of the greatest threats to coral reef ecosystems. Climate-induced warming events trigger coral bleaching and mortality, which can indirectly affect coral reef fishes. Managing fisheries across coral mortality events is expected to influence the persistence of species and reef recovery potential. The most common management recommendation has been to prohibit fishing using fisheries closures, but this response often has limited support from resource users.
   Here, we explore an alternative of managing fishing gear commonly used in artisanal coral reef fisheries. We examined fisheries landing data from 15 sites in Papua New Guinea and Kenya to explore whether or how specific gears select for: (i) species that depend on coral reefs for feeding or habitat and are likely to be susceptible to the loss of coral, and (ii) different functional groups of fishes.
   Only 6% of the fishes targeted by fishers were susceptible to the immediate effects of coral mortality; however, loss of habitat structure following coral mortality is expected to affect 56% of targeted species.
   Importantly, 25% of target species had feeding characteristics (i.e. reef scrapers/excavators and grazers) that contribute to the recovery of coral reef ecosystems, and gears differed considerably in catches of these species.
   Spear guns and traps target a high proportion of species likely to be affected by bleaching and key for the recovery of corals. These gears are strong candidates for management restrictions in reefs with high coral mortality. In contrast, line fishing catches the lowest proportion of susceptible and recovery-enabling species and is preferential for increasing recovery rates on coral reefs.
   Synthesis and applications. Fisheries managers will require a range of tools to meet the novel challenges posed by climate change. This study presents a way to help reduce the negative impacts of climate change and potentially increase resilience of marine ecosystems by managing fishing gear. Specific gears used by artisanal fishers differentially target fish functional groups. In the coral reefs that we studied, traps and spear guns targeted a high proportion of species highly susceptible to coral mortality and critical to coral reef resilience through their top-down control. Given that full fisheries closures are not always practical, selectively banning or restricting fishing gears is a potentially powerful tool for reducing the detrimental ecosystem effects of climate change disturbances.

AB  - An increasing number of studies have reported on forest declines and vegetation shifts triggered by drought. In the Swiss Rhone valley (Valais), one of the driest inner-Alpine regions, the species composition in low elevation forests is changing: The sub-boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominating the dry forests is showing high mortality rates. Concurrently the sub-Mediterranean pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) has locally increased in abundance. However, it remains unclear whether this local change in species composition is part of a larger-scale vegetation shift. To study variability in mortality and regeneration in these dry forests we analysed data from the Swiss national forest inventory (NFI) on a regular grid between 1983 and 2003, and combined it with annual mortality data from a monitoring site. Pine mortality was found to be highest at low elevation (below 1000 m a.s.l.). Annual variation in pine mortality was correlated with a drought index computed for the summer months prior to observed tree death. A generalized linear mixed-effects model indicated for the NFI data increased pine mortality on dryer sites with high stand competition, particularly for small-diameter trees. Pine regeneration was low in comparison to its occurrence in the overstorey, whereas oak regeneration was comparably abundant. Although both species regenerated well at dry sites, pine regeneration was favoured at cooler sites at higher altitude and oak regeneration was more frequent at warmer sites, indicating a higher adaptation potential of oaks under future warming. Our results thus suggest that an extended shift in species composition is actually occurring in the pine forests in the Valais. The main driving factors are found to be climatic variability, particularly drought, and variability in stand structure and topography. Thus, pine forests at low elevations are developing into oak forests with unknown consequences for these ecosystems and their goods and services.

AB  - The Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai is one of the most economically important mollusks in China. Even though it has been farmed in southern China for almost 20 years, summer mortality remains the most challengeable problem for Pacific abalone aquaculture recently. Here, we determined the different heat tolerance ability for five selective lines of H. discus hannai by measuring the cardiac performance and Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT). The Red line (RL) and Yangxia line (YL) were determined as the most heat-sensitive and most heat-tolerant line, respectively. Heart rates for RL were significantly lower than those of the YL at the same temperature (p < 0.05). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were enriched in several pathways including cardiac muscle contraction, glutathione metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, were identified between RL and YL at control temperature (20 degrees C) and heat stress temperature (28.5 degrees C, the ABT of the RL) by RNA-seq method. In the RL, 3370 DEGs were identified between the control and the heat-stress temperature, while only 1351 DEGs were identified in YL between these two temperature tests. Most of these DEGs were enriched in the pathways such as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptor signaling, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. Notably, the most heat-tolerant line YL used an effective heat-protection strategy based on moderate transcriptional changes and regulation on the expression of key genes.

AB  - Most recent mechanistic crop models are based on source-sink relationships. To build a conceptual framework for achene quality traits in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L), source-sink relationships were investigated in contrasting environments. Two experiments were performed under field conditions in 2011 and 2012. Oil, protein, hull (sink), leaves, receptacles and stems (source) were measured weekly under contrasting nitrogen (N : no fertilization; N+: 150 kg N per ha), plant density (3 and 4.5 plants per m(2)) and genotype (cv. Kerbel, cv. LG5451 HO and cv. Olledy) treatments. A bi-linear model was fitted to source and sink component dry weight (DW) dynamics per m(2). Nitrogen and plant density influenced rates and duration of all source and sink dynamics, while genotype had a significant influence on timing parameters. More significant factor interactions were found in 2011 than in 2012, probably because of other factors that occurred or interacted during grain filling (water stress and/or thermal stress). We constructed a robust source-sink framework for oil and protein accumulation in relation to remobilization processes. The observed "source" chronology was receptacles, stems and green leaves, and we confirmed the "sink" chronology of receptacles, hulls, protein and oil. Chronologies were influenced mostly by genotype. Such a framework is highly useful for dynamic modeling of sunflower. We also discuss the relevance and adaptability of the bi-linear model.

AB  - 1. The ranges of many species have expanded in cool regions but contracted at warm margins in response to recent climate warming, but the mechanisms behind such changes remain unclear. Particular debate concerns the roles of direct climatic limitation vs. the effects of interacting species in explaining the location of low latitude or low elevation range margins.
   2. The mountains of the Sierra de Guadarrama (central Spain) include both cool and warm range margins for the black-veined white butterfly, Aporia crataegi, which has disappeared from low elevations since the 1970s without colonizing the highest elevations.
   3. We found that the current upper elevation limit to A. crataegi's distribution coincided closely with that of its host plants, but that the species was absent from elevations below 900 m, even where host plants were present. The density of A. crataegi per host plant increased with elevation, but overall abundance of the species declined at high elevations where host plants were rare.
   4. The flight period of A. crataegi was later at higher elevations, meaning that butterflies in higher populations flew at hotter times of year; nevertheless, daytime temperatures for the month of peak flight decreased by 6.2 degrees C per 1 km increase in elevation.
   5. At higher elevations A. crataegi eggs were laid on the south side of host plants (expected to correspond to hotter microclimates), whereas at lower sites the (cooler) north side of plants was selected. Field transplant experiments showed that egg survival increased with elevation.
   6. Climatic limitation is the most likely explanation for the low elevation range margin of A. crataegi, whereas the absence of host plants from high elevations sets the upper limit. This contrasts with the frequent assumption that biotic interactions typically determine warm range margins, and thermal limitation cool margins.
   7. Studies that have modelled distribution changes in response to climate change may have underestimated declines for many specialist species, because range contractions will be exacerbated by mismatch between the future distribution of suitable climate space and the availability of resources such as host plants.

AB  - The distribution of egg strands of perch Perca fluviatilis and factors affecting this distribution, in terms of spawning sites and spawning depths used, was studied in spring 2010 in Chabarovice Lake, Czech Republic, using areas with an artificial spawning substrate (ASS.) and control areas outside the ASS. Perch significantly preferred a calm shore instead of a windward shore for spawning. The depths at which perch egg strands were found increased significantly during the spawning period in both A.S.S. areas and in areas outside the A.S.S. (on average from 4.9 m at the beginning to 12.3 m at the end of the spawning period). With increasing depth of deposition the size of the egg strands decreased significantly. The mean depth of egg strands on individual dates corresponded to the position of 10-12 degrees C water layers. From the third week onward, however, egg strands were deposited in much deeper and colder water A strong relationship was found between the depth at which egg strands were deposited and the duration of the daylight period, indicating that, at the end of the spawning season, perch do not react to the actual temperature of the water column but that they follow their inner clock, assuming that "normally" the shallower depth layers are too warm for successful embryo development. Factors influencing the depth distribution of egg strands were identified as waves, temperature and duration of the daylight period. Factors influencing the selection of spawning sites were identified as wind inducing current, internal seiches and temperature instability of the water column. The first perch larvae were present in the open water of Chabarovice Lake before mid-May, and the latest larvae not earlier than the beginning of July since warming of the water in deeper layers was very slow It appears that with prolonged spawning and hatching periods and with spawning occurring at various depths and temperatures, perch have evolved a powerful mechanism to protect their population against the vagaries of the weather and temporary bad biological conditions in the lake.

AB  - Two source rocks were deposited in the Lower Cretaceous Shahai Formation (K1sh) in the Fuxin Basin (NE China): the third Member (K1sh3) coal?bearing and the fourth Member (K1sh4) oil?bearing source rock. However, the differences between the two Fuxin Basin source rocks remain poorly constrained. This study systematically reveals the formation and evolution of these source rocks through sedimentological and geochemical analyses. During the K1sh3 deposition, the intermittently warm?humid climate promoted organic matter (OM) input from terrestrial plants. Meanwhile, the restricted swamp with suboxic water conditions enhanced OM preservation and reduced OM dilution. Thus, warm?humid climate, suboxic water conditions of swamp controlled the formation of excellent coal?bearing source rock with highest total organic carbon (TOC) content (avg. 28.68 wt%) and Type III kerogen (perhydrous). The post?mature maturity (avg. 484 ?C Tmax) indicates that the K1sh3 coal?bearing source rocks have reached the wet to dry gas generation stage. During the K1sh4 deposition, rapid basin subsidence and a humid?prone climate resulted in lake expansion, enhancing the dysoxic bottom water conditions. Moreover, the rapid basin subsidence triggered frequent gravity flows. The turbidity flows delivered terrestrial OM fragments and nutrients, promoting the lacustrine productivity and producing OM dominated by aquatic organisms with some terrestrial plants. However, hyperconcentrated density flows disturbed the dysoxic bottom water conditions and strongly diluted the OM. Hence, the humid?prone climate, dysoxic bottom water conditions and gravity flows have controlled the formation of the K1sh4 oil?bearing source rock with high TOC contents (avg. 2.73 wt%). The oil?bearing source rocks show good hydrocarbon potential (avg. 6.17 mg HC/g rock S2) and Type II to III kerogen (perhydrous). The mature oil?bearing source rocks (avg. 443 ?C Tmax) in the lower K1sh4 were at the oil generation peak and may be the chief source rock in the Fuxin Basin. During the Early Cretaceous, similar rift basins were developed in Northeast China, so this study provides a typical sample for source rock prediction in other adjoining rift basins.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest terrestrial carbon pool and sensitive to land use and cover change; its dynamics are critical for carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. In this study, we combined a modeling approach and field measurements to examine the temporal dynamics of SOC following afforestation (Robinia pseudoacacia) of former arable land at six sites under different climatic conditions in the Loess Plateau during 19802010, where the annual mean precipitation ranging from 450 mm to 600 mm. The results showed that the measured mean SOC increased to levels higher than before afforestation when taking the last measurements (i.e., at age 25 to 30 yr) at all the sites, although it decreased at the wetter sites in the first few years. The accumulation rates of SOC were 1.58 to 6.22% yr(-1) in the upper 20 cm and 1.62 to 5.15% yr(-1) in the upper 40 cm of soil. The simulations reproduced the basic characteristics of measured SOC dynamics, suggesting that litter input and climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) were the major causes for SOC dynamics and the differences among the sites. They explained 88-96, 48-86 and 57-74% of the variations in annual SOC changes at the soil depths of 0-20, 0-40, and 0-100 cm, respectively. Notably, the simulated SOC decreased during the first few years at all the sites, although the magnitudes of decreases were smaller at the drier sites. This suggested that the modeling may be advantageous in capturing SOC changes at finer timescale. The discrepancy between the simulation and measurement was a result of uncertainties in model structure, data input, and sampling design. Our findings indicated that afforestation promoted soil carbon sequestration at the study sites during 1980-2010. Afforestation activities should decrease soil disturbances to reduce carbon release in the early stage. The long-term strategy for carbon fixation capability of the plantations should also consider the climate and site conditions, species adaptability, and successional stage of recovery.

AB  - Arthropods cope with reduced oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide atmospheres with a reduction in metabolic rate, also called metabolic arrest. The reduction in metabolism lessens the pressure on the organism to initiate anaerobic metabolism, but also leads to a reduction in ATP production. The natural permeability of cellular membranes appears to be important for the survival of the arthropod under low oxygen or high carbon dioxide atmospheres. Despite the similarities in response, arthropod mortality is generally greater in response to high carbon dioxide as apposed to low oxygen atmospheres. There appears to be a greater decrease in ATP and energy charge in arthropods exposed to high carbon dioxide as compared with low oxygen atmospheres, and this may be due to greater membrane permeability under carbon dioxide leading to an inefficient production of ATP. Reduced oxygen and elevated carbon dioxide atmospheres can have an additive effect in some cases, depending on the concentrations used. The effect of these atmospheres on arthropods depends also on temperature, species and life stage. Additional work is needed to fully understand the mode of action of controlled atmospheres on arthropod pests.

AB  - A series of inactivation curves for Salmonella enteritidis were determined for boiling eggs using different conditions of time and temperature. No significant influence of egg weight could be found on the temperature evolution in the yolk. The inactivation curves consistently showed an initial slow decline in bacterial number at lower temperatures, after which a very rapid inactivation took place. It was not possible to reproduce this behavior using a traditional inactivation model. A pragmatic model existing in two parts was therefore constructed. When the temperature is below a certain threshold, the inactivation follows a second order temperature dependence. Above the temperature threshold, standard Bigelow inactivation kinetics are assumed. This model could describe the data reasonably well, provided that the decimal reduction time in the Bigelow model was assumed to be different for a fast or slow heating process, respectively. The results suggest that the bacteria are more resistant towards a slower heating process, which is confirmed by analyzing the raw data. A fail-safe model can be obtained by using the parameters associated with the slow heating process. The statistical properties of the calibrated model are satisfactory, and a cross-validation shows that it can be used for egg boiling conditions outside its calibration range.

AB  - This contribution focuses on the presentation of GInaFiT (Geeraerd et al. Inactivation Model Fitting Tool), a freeware Add-inn for Microsoft (R) Excel aiming at bridging the gap between people developing predictive modeling approaches and end-users in the food industry not disposing over advanced non-linear regression analysis tools. More precisely, the tool is useful for testing eight different types of microbial survival models on user-specific experimental data relating the evolution of the microbial population with time. The eight model types are: (i) classical log-linear curves, (ii) curves displaying a so-called shoulder before a log-linear decrease is apparent, (iii) curves displaying a so-called tail after a log-linear decrease, (iv) survival curves displaying both shoulder and tailing behavior, (v) concave curves, (vi) convex curves, (vii) convex/concave curves followed by tailing, and (viii) biphasic inactivation kinetics. Next to the obtained parameter values, the following statistical measures are automatically reported: standard errors of the parameter values, the Sum of Squared Errors, the Mean Sum of Squared Errors, the R 2 and the adjusted R-2. The tool is downloadable via the KULeuven/BioTeC-homepage http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/cit/biotec/index.htm at the topic "Downloads" (Version 1.3, Release date July 2004).

AB  - In this study, MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), TRMM3B43 precipitation, and MOD11A2 land-surface temperature (LST) data were used as data sources in an analysis of temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation changes and ecological environmental quality in the Huaihe River basin, China, from 2003 to 2018. The Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test and the Theil-Sen slope test were combined for this analysis; then, when combined with the results of the MK mutation test and two introduced indexes, the kurtosis coefficient (KU) and skewness (SK) and correlations between NDVI, precipitation (TRMM), and land-surface temperature (LST) in different time scales were revealed. The results illustrate that the mean NDVI in the Huaihe River basin was 0.54. The annual NDVImax curve fluctuations for different land cover types were almost the same. The main reasons for the decrease in or disappearance of vegetation cover in the Huaihe River basin were the expansion of towns and impact of human activities. Furthermore, vegetation cover around water areas was obviously degraded and wetland protections need to be strengthened urgently. On the same time scale, change trends of NDVI, TRMM, and LST after abrupt changes became consistent within a short time period. Vegetation growth was favored when the KU and SK of TRMM had a close to normal distribution within one year. Monthly TRMM and LST can better reflect NDVI fluctuations compared with seasonal and annual scales. When the precipitation (TRMM) is less than 767 mm, the average annual NDVI of different land cover types is not ideal. Compared with other land cover types, dry land has stronger adaptability to changes in the LST when the LST is between 19 and 22.6 degrees C. These trends can serve as scientific reference for protecting and managing the ecological environment in the Huaihe River basin.

AB  - Many features of the development of reptiles are affected by temperature, but very little is known about how incubation temperature affects gene expression. Here, we provide a detailed case study of gene expression profiles in common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) embryos developing at stressfully low (15 degrees C) versus benign (24 degrees C) temperature. For maximum comparability between the two temperature regimes, we selected a precise developmental stage early in embryogenesis defined by the number of somites. We used a split-clutch design and lizards from four different populations to evaluate the robustness of temperature-responsive gene expression profiles. Embryos incubated at stressfully low incubation temperature expressed on average 20% less total RNA than those incubated at benign temperatures, presumably reflecting lower rates of transcription at cool temperature. After normalizing for differences in total amounts of input RNA, we find that approximately 50% of all transcripts show significant expression differences between the two incubation temperatures. Transcripts with the most extreme changes in expression profiles are associated with transcriptional and translational regulation and chromatin remodeling, suggesting possible epigenetic mechanisms underlying acclimation of early embryos to cool temperature. We discuss our findings in light of current advances in the use of transcriptomic data to study how individuals acclimatize and populations adapt to thermal stress.

AB  - The striped flea beetle, Phyllotreta striolata (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an economically important pest on crucifer vegetables worldwide. Twenty isolates of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) were evaluated against soil-dwelling stages of the flea beetle in the laboratory. The corrected mortalities and reproduction rates at a concentration of 36 infective juveniles (IJs) cm(-2) surface area of sand against third instars of the pest greatly differed among the tested isolates, ranging from 6.7% to 100%. When tested over a range of temperatures from 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C, 25 degrees C was found to be the optimal temperature for four selected nematode isolates (Steinernema carpocapsae All, Steinernema pakistanense 94-1, Heterorhabditis indica LN2 and H. indica 212-2) to infect the third instar and reproduce in the cadavers. S. pakistanense 94-1 and H. indica 212-2 showed markedly greater heat-tolerance compared to S. carpocapsae All and H. indica LN2. Corrected mortalities and reproduction rates increased as the concentration of IJs increased from 4 to 36 IJs cm(-2). The LC50 values of S. carpocapsae All, S. pakistanense 94-1, H. indica LN2 and 212-2 were 17.1, 15.5, 6.5 and 5.9 IJs cm(-2), respectively. The third instars larvae and pupae of P. striolata were more susceptible to the four nematode isolates than the first and second instars. Higher pathogenicity and greater heat tolerance and reproduction potential makes H. indica 212-2 the most promising candidate for the biological control of P. striolata under the field conditions of South China.

AB  - Colouration may endorse thermoregulatory and antipredatory functions in snakes. The thermal melanism hypothesis predicts that dark-coloured individuals are ecologically favoured in cool climates. However, the loss of aposematic and cryptic colourations may imply high predation for melanistic snakes. Here, we used the monophyletic group of Eurasian vipers (subfamily Viperinae) to test whether an increase in the extent of dark area inside the characteristic zigzag dorsal pattern is associated to colder environments. We measured two colouration traits in zigzag-patterned individuals (number of dorsal marks and weighted pigmentation index) and used a phylogenetic comparative approach to explore macroevolutionary patterns of dorsal pigmentation and test whether its extent is associated to ecogeographic characteristics of lineages' ranges. Phylogenetically-naive and phylogenetically-informed analyses yielded a significant association between the degree of pigmentation of the zigzag pattern and environmental variables such as solar radiation, elevation and latitude. The degree of pigmentation of the zigzag pattern is highlighted as an adaptive trait that matches range attributes mirroring cold environments irrespective of the phylogeny. These results constitute the first large-scale evidence supporting the thermal melanism hypothesis in snakes, opening new avenues of inquiry for the mechanisms that shape the evolution of colour phenotypes.

AB  - The paper provides a review on solid biofuel usage in Lithuania after decommission of Ignalina NPP and cover the period 2007-2012. Lithuania has limited quantity of indigenous energy resources and is depended upon the import of energy resources, such as natural gas, petroleum and hard coal. Up to the year 2009 about 70-80% of electricity was produced from NPP. Lithuanian energy dependence from energy resources in 2009 was about 50.3%. At the end of 2009, NPP was decommissioned and the structure of gross inland fuel and energy consumption changed radically. Lithuania's energy dependence on the imports of fuel increased to about 82% and considerably exceeded the EU average 54%. The share of indigenous and renewable energy sources (RES) in gross inland fuel and energy consumption increased from 14.7% in 2009 to 21.4% in 2013 from which about 86% of RES belonged to solid biofuels. The RES became one of the main driving forces of the country's economy.
   In this paper, the Lithuanian solid biofuel resources and energy production up to the 2013 are presented. Growing stock volume, forest coverage, productivity of stands and consumption for energy production in Lithuania and its counties are defined. Fuels and energy flows diagram and distribution of solid biofiiels by economy sectors and consumer groups are shown. Solid biofuels usage impact to gross inland and final energy consumption was studied. Implementation of solid biofuels for heat and electricity generation in Lithuania was researched. Solid biofuel prices were examined and comparison with prices of natural gas and fuel oil was done. Principles and criteria for sustainable solid biofuels production and usage were disclosed. The reduction of total greenhouse gases emissions in Lithuania and other EU countries were shown. Strategic initiatives to increase the RES share in electricity and heating sectors till 2020 were highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The introduction of allochthonous species often represents a serious problem for ecosystems and native species. Usually, these cases involve common widespread species that show high adaptability and strong competitiveness against local species. Within amphibians, the introduction of allochthonous species mainly deals with anurans, while cases involving caudata are few and poorly studied. We report the first assessment of an introduced population of European plethodontid salamanders. This population is located in the French Pyrenees and represents the oldest allochthonous Hydromantes population. We reconstructed the history of its introduction and collected data on the ecology and feeding habits of this population. Our results show that this population is stable and reproductive, showing strong similarities to Italian mainland species of Hydromantes. This study provided the base for further studies focused on this allochthonous population of European cave salamanders.

AB  - Animals with overlapping generations may be selected to change their sex ratios after perturbation of the stable age distribution. Specifically, Werren and Taylor have shown that in a tightly regulated population with normally constant recruitment, sex ratios are biased at times of exceptional recruitment towards the sex with the most even distribution of reproductive value over its adult life. It is shown that an episode of exceptional recruitment also affects the optimal sex ratios of cohorts born subsequently, although the sex ratio adjustment is typically in the opposite direction. It is also shown that the expected sex ratio depends critically on female mating behaviour: whether females mate throughout their reproductive life or, as in many insects, once after emergence. Perturbation of the stable age distribution by an episode of exceptional mortality may also lead to selection for biased sex ratios, even if the mortality affects both sexes equally.

AB  - To limit warming to well below 2 degrees C, most scenario projections rely on greenhouse gas removal technologies (GGRTs); one such GGRT uses soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in agricultural land. In addition to their role in mitigating climate change, SCS practices play a role in delivering agroecosystem resilience, climate change adaptability and food security. Environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices challenge the practical implementation of SCS, and our analysis addresses the associated knowledge gap. Previous assessments have focused on global potentials, but there is a need among policymakers to operationalise SCS. Here, we assess a range of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and distil these into a subset of specific measures. We provide a multidisciplinary summary of the barriers and potential incentives towards practical implementation of these measures. First, we identify specific practices with potential for both a positive impact on SCS at farm level and an uptake rate compatible with global impact. These focus on: (a) optimising crop primary productivity (e.g. nutrient optimisation, pH management, irrigation); (b) reducing soil disturbance and managing soil physical properties (e.g. improved rotations, minimum till); (c) minimising deliberate removal of C or lateral transport via erosion processes (e.g. support measures, bare fallow reduction); (d) addition of C produced outside the system (e.g. organic manure amendments, biochar addition); (e) provision of additional C inputs within the cropping system (e.g. agroforestry, cover cropping). We then consider economic and non-cost barriers and incentives for land managers implementing these measures, along with the potential externalised impacts of implementation. This offers a framework and reference point for holistic assessment of the impacts of SCS. Finally, we summarise and discuss the ability of extant scientific approaches to quantify the technical potential and externalities of SCS measures, and the barriers and incentives to their implementation in global agricultural systems.

AB  - Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is a cereal well known for its ability to be successfully grown under drought and intense heat conditions, thus sustaining food security in arid regions. Considering that a trend of increasing drought severity is expected in the future in Southern Europe, solutions need to be found to enhance the resilience of agroecosystems to the effects of climate change. From this perspective, proso millet re-introduction could represent an interesting tool in reducing water consumption for grain production and in providing a new resource to farmers. The aim of this study was to characterize proso millet adaptability to drought and low-input field conditions in the Mediterranean environment, especially considering water-related traits, such as water use efficiency. Limited water-demanding crops and yield stability can contribute to the resilience of agroecosystems and their adaptation to climate change. A three-year field crop experiment was conducted in northern Italy to assess proso millet's performance in terms of productivity and water status in rainfed agriculture conditions. It was compared to a conventional irrigated corn, a typical summer cereal of the area. All years of experimentation were characterized by adverse meteorological trends, in the full manifestation of the uncertainties of climate change. Despite such different conditions from an agro-meteorological point of view, proso millet showed, in non-irrigated conditions, stable yield and water use efficiency (on average 0.30 kg/m(2) and 1.83 kg /m(3), respectively), and good agronomic performance. Proso millet, therefore, seems to offer interesting traits for reintroduction on the European side of the Mediterranean Basin, representing a resource for farmers. Moreover, the shortness of the proso millet life cycle (on average 108 days) allows it to be used as a catch crop in the event of major crop failure, an event becoming more likely in the climate change scenario. Furthermore, the possibility of producing grain while saving water (and other production inputs), even in very hot and dry years, increases the sustainability of agricultural production and the resilience of agroecosystems.

AB  - The biological and physicochemical properties of cultures of two isogenic recombinant variants of Y. pseudotuberculosis were studied. The cell genomes of the studied cultures differed only with respect to the presence or absence of the fra operon responsible for capsule formation in Y. pestis. The expression of the above-mentioned trait is amplified by an increase in the cultivation temperature of microbial biomass and stimulates a decrease in the viability and adaptation potential of bacteria in vitro. In a warm-blooded host organism, the capsule-forming recombinant variant is characterized by greater residual pathogenicity and immunogenicity to the experimental plague strains of laboratory animals as compared to the reference variant cells. These differences can be attributed to the more increased colonizing ability of the capsule-forming microbes caused by the resistance of the host cells to phagocytosis.

AB  - The 70 kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp70) exhibits a broad range of chaperone functions that respond both to internal and external stresses, and its heat-induced expression both declines with age and reduces age-specific mortality rates. Here we test for changes in both longevity and the level of Hsp70-induced expression as correlated responses to selection on both heat-stress resistance and longevity in D. melanogaster. Three replicated H lines were heat-stress selected and compared to their respective non-selected controls (C lines) in the 25th generation of heat-stress selection. The direct response in heat-stress resistance was 56% in males and 38% in females. Heat-stress selection improved longevity in males at normal temperatures. All lines were subsequently subjected to one generation of truncation selection on longevity (selection intensity, i = 1.28 for H lines and 1.36 for C lines). The heat-induced Hsp70 expression seems to increase very weakly by heat-stress selection but shows a dramatic and persistent decline by selecting for long-lived flies. A mechanism of longevity selection, involving changes in Hsp70 regulation, is suggested. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to improve the acid tolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus by combining atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutation with adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). To achieve a high mutation efficiency, 60 s was determined as the ideal exposure time for ARTP mutation of L. acidophilus with a survival rate of 5.91%. The ARTP-ALE mutant strain LAartp-ale2 displayed increased lactic acid stress tolerance with survival rates of 75.67% and 25.78% when cultured in pH 3.0 and 2.5, respectively, for 3 h. Physiological analysis revealed that the ARTP-ALE mutant exhibited a lower inner membrane permeability than that of the parental strain during acid stress. Furthermore, the mutant LAartp-ale2 produced more biofilm in response to lactic acid-induced acid stress and showed an increased hydrophobicity (87.2%) when compared to the parent strain (76.2%) at pH 2.5. LAartp-ale2 exhibited a higher unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) to saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio that affected the physical state of the cell membrane for increased survival in pH 3.0 and 2.5. The mutation with ARTP coupled with ALE in the present study proved to be effective in enhancing the acid tolerance of L. acidophilus for potential industrial use.

AB  - This paper presents experimental and numerical investigations about the fire behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) beams flexurally strengthened with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. The main objective was to assess the efficacy of different fire protection systems and to evaluate the viability of their use in floors of buildings. Fire resistance tests were conducted on an intermediate scale oven to investigate the behaviour under fire (ISO 834) of loaded CFRP-strengthened RC beams. The fire protection systems comprised calcium silicate boards and layers of vermiculite/perlite cement based mortar, with thicknesses of 25 mm and 40 mm, applied along the bottom soffit of the beams that was directly exposed to fire. In addition, the anchorage zones of the CFRP laminates were highly thermally insulated in order to evaluate the benefits of this particular constructive detail. Member deflection and temperatures throughout the midspan section were measured and recorded during the tests. When the strengthening system was left unprotected in the exposed length of the beam, the CFRP laminate anchorage debonded after about 23 min. When the above mentioned fire protection materials were applied in the exposed length of the beams, the strengthening system debonded after between 60-89 min (25 mm thickness) and 137-167 min (40 mm). Two-dimensional finite element thermal models of all beams tested were also developed in order to predict the evolution of temperatures in the materials. The calculated temperatures compared reasonably well with those measured in the tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
