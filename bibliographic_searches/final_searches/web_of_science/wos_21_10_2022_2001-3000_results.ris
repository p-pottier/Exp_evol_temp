AB  - Drosophila melanogaster is frequently used in ageing studies to elucidate which mechanisms determine the onset and progress of senescence. Lines selected for increased longevity have often been shown to perform as well as or superior to control lines in life history, stress resistance and behavioural traits when tested in the laboratory. Functional senescence in longevity selected lines has also been shown to occur at a slower rate. However, it is known that performance in a controlled laboratory setting is not necessarily representative of performance in nature. In this study the effect of ageing, environmental temperature and longevity selection on performance in the field was tested. Flies from longevity selected and control lines of different ages (2, 5, 10 and 15 days) were released in an environment free of natural food sources. Control flies were tested at low, intermediate and high temperatures, while longevity selected flies were tested at the intermediate temperature only. The ability of flies to locate and reach a food source was tested. Flies of intermediate age were generally better at locating resources than both younger and older flies, where hot and cold environments accelerate the senescent decline in performance. Control lines were better able to locate a resource compared to longevity selected lines of the same age, suggesting that longevity comes at a cost in early life field fitness, supporting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of ageing.

AB  - Fertility schedules of Unaspis yanonensis on citrus leaves were investigated from 1962 to 1971 for the first generation and from 1964 to 1971 for the second generation, at the Okitsu Branch of the Fruit Tree Research Station in Shizuoka Prefecture.  The fertility curves were commonly characterized by a first major peak and a few subsequent minor peaks, although their shapes differed from year to year.  Models estimating these fertility curves of each generation were constructed in relation to the fluctuations in average daily temperature, on the assumption that the curve was composed of two peaks, i.e., bimodal.  Estimated curves were well fitted to observed ones.

AB  - To cope with the increasing and less-predictable temperature forecasts under climate change, many terrestrial ectotherms will have to migrate or rely on adaptation through plastic or evolutionary means. Studies suggest that some ectotherms have a limited potential to change their upper thermal limits via evolutionary shifts, but research has mostly focused on adult life stages under laboratory conditions. Here we use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a nested half-sib/full-sib quantitative genetic design to estimate heritabilities and genetic variance components for egg-to-adult viability under both laboratory and seminatural field conditions, encompassing cold, benign, and hot temperatures in two separate populations. The results demonstrated temperature-specific heritabilities and additive genetic variances for egg-to-adult viability. Heritabilities and genetic variances were higher under cold and benign compared to hot temperatures when tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Tendencies toward lower evolutionary potential at higher temperatures were also observed under seminatural conditions although the results were less clear in the field setting. Overall the results suggest that ectotherms that already experience temperatures close to their upper thermal tolerance limits have a restricted capacity to adapt to higher temperatures by evolutionary means.

AB  - Many species with broad distributions are exposed to different thermal regimes which often select for varied phenotypes. This intraspecific variation is often overlooked but may be critical in dictating the vulnerability of different populations to environmental change. We reared Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) eggs from two thermally discrete populations (i.e. Jervis Bay and Adelaide) under each location's present-day mean temperatures, predicted end-of-century temperatures and under reciprocal-cross conditions to establish intraspecific thermal sensitivity. Rearing temperatures strongly influenced O-2(Max) and critical thermal limits, regardless of population, indicative of acclimation processes. However, there were significant population-level effects, such that Jervis Bay sharks, regardless of rearing temperature, did not exhibit differences in O-2(Rest), but under elevated temperatures exhibited reduced maximum swimming activity with step-wise increases in temperature. In contrast, Adelaide sharks reared under elevated temperatures doubled their O-2(Rest), relative to their present-day temperature counterparts; however, maximum swimming activity was not influenced. With respect to reciprocal-cross comparisons, few differences were detected between Jervis Bay and Adelaide sharks reared under ambient Jervis Bay temperatures. Similarly, juveniles (from both populations) reared under Adelaide conditions had similar thermal limits and swimming activity (maximum volitional velocity and distance) to each other, indicative of conserved acclimation capacity. However, under Adelaide temperatures, the O-2(Rest) of Jervis Bay sharks was greater than that of Adelaide sharks. This indicates that the energetics of cooler water population (Adelaide) is likely more thermally sensitive than that of the warmer population (Jervis Bay). While unique to elasmobranchs, these data provide further support that by treating species as static, homogeneous populations, we ignore the impacts of thermal history and intraspecific variation on thermal sensitivity. With climate change, intraspecific variation will manifest as populations move, demographics change or extirpations occur, starting with the most sensitive populations.

AB  - We describe an experimental protocol for measuring the response of spruce budworm postdiapause larval development to temperature. This protocol is specifically designed to include measurements of development near their upper and lower thermal thresholds. The application of this protocol to a laboratory colony allowed for the first experimental evidence that spruce budworm larval development occurs at temperatures as low as 5 degrees C and as high as 35 degrees C, and it provides data to fit stage-specific development models. Our protocol is also designed to minimise mortality near the thermal development thresholds, thus allowing for multigenerational studies. We observed developmental plasticity in larvae reared at constant temperatures, particularly the occurrence of up to 42% of some individuals requiring only five instars to complete development compared to the expected six instars. The occurrence exhibited no clear relation to temperature. Although this protocol is specifically designed for spruce budworm, it provides a template for the study of other species' developmental responses to temperature.

AB  - In this study, we used a comparative transcriptomic approach using 35nt paired-end reads from three individuals each from two highly divergent lineages of the Australian freshwater shrimp, Paratya australiensis. The two lineages are widespread and largely sympatric in many regions; however, they occupy slightly differing habitats within respective river systems. From BLAST searches, we were able to identify 50 genes, based on gene ontology, involved in temperature tolerance, egg size control and more broadly osmoregulation, as well as genes associated with reproduction and life history characteristics predicted to be associated with adaptation to local aquatic environments. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 660 highly differentially expressed transcripts between the populations. Divergence in SNPs detected in the two lineages was consistent with the level of neutral divergence found in previous studies, but they appear not to correlate with differentially expressed candidate genes. However, we hypothesise that the 2554 filtered SNPs identified in this study will continue to further our understanding of how these lineages have evolved and adapted to their respective habitats and will contribute to further our interpretation of the enigmatic biogeographical history of the species.

AB  - The objective of this work was to establish, under experimental laboratory conditions, a colony of Lucilia sericata, Bogota-Colombia strain, to build life tables and evaluate two artificial diets. This blowfly is frequently used in postmortem interval studies and in injury treatment. The parental adult insects collected in Bogota were maintained in cages at 22 degrees C +/- 1 average temperature, 60%+/- 5 relative humidity and 12 h photoperiodicity. The blowflies were fed on two artificial diets that were evaluated over seven continuous generations. Reproductive and population parameters were assessed. The life cycle of the species was expressed in the number of days of the different stages: egg = 0.8 +/- 0.1, larvae I = 1.1 +/- 0.02, larvae II = 1.94 +/- 0.16, larvae III = 3.5 +/- 1.54, pupae = 6.55 +/- 0.47, male adult = 28.7 +/- 0.83 and female adult = 33.5 +/- 1.0. Total survival from egg stage to adult stage was 91.2% for diet 1, while for diet 2 this parameter was 40.5%. The lifetime reproductive output was 184.51 +/- 11.2 eggs per female. The population parameters, as well as the reproductive output of the blowflies that were assessed, showed relatively high values, giving evidence of the continuous increase of the strain over the different generations and making possible its maintenance as a stable colony that has lasted for more than two years.

AB  - Many insect species undergo multiple generations each year. They are found across biomes that vary in their strength of seasonality and, depending on location and species, can display a wide range of population dynamics. Some species exhibit cycles with distinct generations (developmental synchrony/generation separation), some exhibit overlapping generations with multiple life stages present simultaneously (generation smearing), while others have intermediate dynamics with early season separation followed by late season smearing. There are two main hypotheses to explain these dynamics. The first is the 'seasonal disturbance' hypothesis where winter synchronizes the developmental clock among individuals, which causes transient generation separation early in the season that erodes through the summer. The second is the 'temperature destabilization' hypothesis where warm temperatures during the summer cause population dynamics to become unstable giving rise to single generation cycles. Both hypotheses are supported by detailed mathematical theory incorporating mechanisms that are likely to drive dynamics in nature. In this review, we synthesize the theory and propose a conceptual framework-where each mechanism may be seen as an independent axis shaping the developmental (a)synchrony-that allows us to predict dynamic patterns from insect life-history characteristics. High fecundity, short adult life-span and strong seasonality enhance synchrony, while developmental plasticity and environmental heterogeneity erode synchrony. We further review current mathematical and statistical tools to study multi-generational dynamics and illustrate using case studies of multivoltine tortrix moths. By integrating two disparate bodies of theory, we articulate a deep connection among temperature, stability, developmental synchrony and inter-generational dynamics of multivoltine insects that is missing in current literature.

AB  - Genetic mechanisms of increase, persistence, decrease and decline of major acaricide resistance in citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McG.), were studied. Dicofol resistance in P. citri was mainly due to a single, incompletely recessive major gene. The result of the experiments on fitness indicated that the reproduction rate of the resistant strain was lower than that of the susceptible one, in particular under a high temperature condition (30-degrees-C) or under a special feeding condition such as seriously damaged leaves of host trees. This was caused by a lower rate of egg production in the resistant mites. The dicofol susceptibility in a mite population originally composed of a 1:1 mixture of resistant and susceptible strains from the same origin was examined in 17 generations at 25-degrees-C. After 13 generations, susceptibility of the mixed population increased remarkably. The result indicates that the resistant mites (RR) have lower fitness values than the susceptible mites (SS, RS) under either favorable (25-degrees-C) or unfavorable conditions for reproduction of the spider mites in an acaricide-free environment. Amitraz resistance was due to a single, incompletely dominant major gene. The values of fitness of benzomate and amitraz resistant mites were almost equal to those of susceptible mites in an acaricide-free environment.

AB  - Six cohorts of the silver-stripe round herring Spratelloides gracilis, a fast-growing and short-lived tropical clupeid, were collected as juveniles and then as adults during austral summers from November to February in 1998-1999 and 1999-2000, using light traps in the Dampier Archipelago, Western Australia. Otolith analysis allowed backcalculation of size and growth rate at age to examine the relative influences of selective mortality and water temperature on early growth. Negative size-selective mortality and growth-selective mortality between the juvenile and the adult stages was found only in the cohort that was the smallest and slowest growing in the period immediately following hatching. Selective mortality preferentially removed members of this cohort that were smaller from age 0 to 15 days, and slower growing from 0 to 10 days, resulting in an elevation of size at age to, or even above, that of cohorts that had not undergone this process. Size and growth rate at 5 day age intervals in the first 20 days after hatching differed among cohorts within and between summers and were strongly and positively correlated (r(2) = 0.61-0.83) with water temperature.

AB  - The proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most preferred and efficient energy conversion devices for automotive applications but demand high purity hydrogen which comes at a premium price. The currently pursued hydrogen generation methods suffer from issues such as, low efficiency, high cost, environmental non-benignity, and, in some cases, commercial non-viability. Many of these drawbacks can be overcome by resorting to metal-steam reforming using iron from steel industry's mill-scale waste. A novel solution-based room temperature technique using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the reducing agent has been developed that produces highly active nanoscale (30-40nm) iron particles. A slightly modified version of this technique using a surfactant and water-oil microemulsion resulted in the formation of 5 nm spherical Fe particles. By using hydrazine as an inexpensive and more stable (compared to NaBH4) reductant, body centered cubic iron particles with edge dimensions similar to 5nm were obtained under mild solvothermal conditions in ethanol. The nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) powder showed improved kinetics and greater propensity for hydrogen generation. (C) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Presently lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is the dominant Li-salt used in commercial rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on a graphite anode and a 3-4 V cathode material. While LiPF6 is not the ideal Li-salt for every important electrolyte property, it has a uniquely suitable combination of properties (temperature range, passivation, conductivity, etc.) rendering it the overall best Li-salt for LIBs. However, this may not necessarily be true for other types of Li-based batteries. Indeed, next generation batteries, for example lithium-metal (Li-metal), lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2), and lithium-sulfur (Li-S), require a re-evaluation of Li-salts due to the different electrochemical and chemical reactions and conditions within such cells. This review explores the critical role Li-salts play in ensuring in these batteries viability.

AB  - Accurate calculation of convective heat transfer coefficients (CHTCs) is the premise to obtain accurate results of finite element thermal analysis (FETA). This paper presents an optimization method of CHTCs in steady state FETA of a spindle system using genetic algorithm (GA), which is especially suitable for complicated FETA with many CHTCs, such as 10 CHTCs. Firstly, the temperature values at thermal critical points, the temperature field, and the thermal fluctuations of a spindle system were obtained by experiment. Secondly, based on similarity theory, the initial values of CHTCs, which are inaccurate but close to real ones, were calculated by empirical formulas, and then, the FETA of the spindle system was conducted. The inaccurate initial CHTCs lead to inaccurate FETA results, so the optimal CHTCs closer to real ones were searched by GA automatically. The CHTCs were regarded as the target values of interest, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the experimental temperature values and the simulation temperature values was regarded as the fitness function. After 200 generations, the optimal CHTCs were searched with which the RMSE was the lowest. Finally, by conducting the FETA of the spindle system with the searched optimal CHTCs and comparing with the experimental results, the effectiveness of the proposed method was proved.

AB  - Green lacewings (Neuroptera: Chryspidae) are insects broadly distributed worldwide that are associated with various crops and pests and an important group of predators, therefore, mass rearing of these insects for subsequent release in the field depends on a better understanding on the biological cycle and behavior of the predators. This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of population development and oviposition of Ceraeochrysa cincta (Schneider, 1851) in successive generations. Three generations of C. cincta, comprising 15 random couples maintained under stable conditions of temperature (25 +/- 1celcius), relative humidity (70 +/- 10%), and photoperiod (12 L:12D), were used. The period of pre-oviposition and the number and viability of the eggs were evaluated every 24 h throughout the lifespan of the females and the biological characteristics were evaluated using fertility life table. The results revealed that oviposition of eggs without peduncle occurs in C. cincta species tend to start earlier as the generations increases and that these non-pedunculated eggs are infertility. The fertility life table demonstrated higher R-0, r(m) and lambda values and lower T and TD values for the first generation. It can be concluded that as the number of generations increases the oviposition behavior and the development of the C. cincta population is affected.

AB  - In most temperate insects, diapause strategies and voltinism generally exhibit latitudinal clines, supporting the concept that they represent adaptations to climate. In contrast, in the satyrine butterfly Ypthima multistriata Butler, local populations with different voltinism patterns are geographically intermingled, suggesting that life-history traits related to diapause may differ even between geographically and phylogenetically close populations. In this study, we experimentally examined the critical photoperiod for diapause induction and the larval developmental period in two univoltine and two bivoltine populations of Y. multistriata, all of which inhabit virtually the same latitude ( 34.652-34.750 degrees N). We found that the critical photoperiod for diapause induction was longer in the univoltine populations than in the bivoltine populations. Moreover, the larval period under the long day length treatment was different among populations in both sexes, although significant differences were also detected between populations with the same voltinism. These results indicate that in Y. multistriata, life-history traits related to diapause can not be attributed merely to climatic conditions such as temperature or day length, which depend largely on latitude. Therefore, we suggest that biotic elements, such as leaf toughness, as well as abiotic elements should be taken into account in attempts to explain the enigmatic pattern of geographic variation in the diapause strategies of Y. multistriata.

AB  - Elucidating the genetic basis of adaptation on a genomewide scale has evaded biologists, but complete genome sequences and DNA high-density array technology make genomewide surveys more tractable. Six lines of Escherichia coli adapted for 2,000 generations to a stressful high temperature of 41.5 degreesC were examined on a genomewide scale for duplication/deletion events by using DNA high-density arrays. A total of five duplication and deletion events were detected. These five events occurred in three of the six lines, whereas the remaining three lines contained no detectable events. Three of the duplications were at 2.85 Mb of the E. coli chromosome, providing evidence for the replicability of the adaptation to high temperature. Four candidate genes previously shown to play roles in stress and starvation survival were identified in the region of common duplication. Expression of the two candidate genes examined is elevated over expression levels in the ancestral lines or the lines without the duplication. In the two cases where the duplication at 2.85 Mb has been further characterized, the timing of the genome reorganization is coincident with significant increases in relative fitness. In both of these cases, the model for the origin of the duplication is a complex recombination event involving insertion sequences and repeat sequences. These results provide additional evidence for the idea that gene duplication plays an integral role in adaptation, specifically as a means for gene amplification.

AB  - Pesticide-induced effects in non-target organisms are a worldwide environmental problem and cladocerans have been used as test organisms to quantify the toxicity effects. However, little is known about the true risks of acceptable levels, when non-traditional end points such as sex determination, egg maturation, and teratogenesis are considered. Aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of sublethal concentrations of the fungicide carbendazim taking into account the above-mentioned endpoints and to evaluate their sensitivity to an environmental factor such as temperature, known to influence growth rates and sex determination in cladocerans. We quantified the effect on the life history variables of Moina micrura at two different temperatures using the life table demographic approach, starting with neonates. The median lethal concentration of carbendazim for M. micrura was 0.12 +/- A 0.01 mg l(-1). The impacts of carbendazim were assessed in experiments conducted at 20A degrees C (experiment 1) and 30A degrees C (experiment 3) using four sublethal concentrations of carbendazim (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04) and controls. An additional experiment (experiment 2) on the next generation (F1) was conducted at 20A degrees C, using the offspring of the second clutches of M. micrura from each of the corresponding treatments of the experiment 1. The increase in temperature from 20 to 30A degrees C significantly reduced always the average lifespan and life expectancy at birth, while raised the rate of population increase, net reproductive rate, and reproductive effort, in controls but not in carbendazim treatments. Higher temperature also increased male/female ratio. The patterns of survivorship curves were weakly affected by carbendazim exposure, but increase in concentration of this fungicide reduced offspring production, reproductive rates, and the rate of population increase, more noticeable at the higher temperature. These detrimental effects were much more striking in the F1 experiment, in which females were unable to produce viable offspring in the two highest carbendazim concentrations, although survival and swimming behavior were not significantly affected. This indicates that sensitivity to the toxicant is greater during egg development and that the fungicide acts as an endocrine disruptor. The presence of carbendazim in the medium resulted in higher male production as compared with controls, indicating also its effect on egg development. We also encountered a few individuals, with abnormal sexual secondary characters (males with reduced antennule length, similar to female antennules) at the highest carbendazim concentration. The role of carbendazim on the demography of cladocerans in natural systems, subject to temperature increase, is discussed taking into account the persistence of this chemical and its elevated impact in the successive generations (through the higher sensitivity of the developing eggs to the chemical at high temperatures). Cladoceran bioassays starting with neonates, which usually utilize offspring as sublethal endpoints should include the first generation to evaluate fecundity responses.

AB  - Although acclaimed as a biofuel crop with high potential to sustainably replace fossil fuels, Jatropha curcas L. remains a poorly studied plant. Reliable yield assessments with conventional methods require agroclimatic and physiological knowledge, which is not yet available for Jatropha. To fill this gap, we tested a novel two-step approach integrating knowledge from biogeography and population biology with available Jatropha field data. In the first step, using MaxEnt, a widely implemented model in biogeography, we predicted Jatropha fitness in response to climate by relating natural occurrence recorded in herbaria with bioclimatic geodatasets. In the second step, we relied on population biology principles supported by seed mass addition experiments to relate fitness to reproductive potential, hence seed yield. Jatropha seed yield in response to climate was mapped worldwide for actual (1950-2000 average) and future (2020) climate conditions. The modelled Jatropha seed yield was validated against a set of on-field yield assessments (R2=0.67, P < 0.001). The discrepancies between estimated and measured yields were partially explained by model uncertainties, as quantified by the sensitivity analysis of our modelling (R2=0.57, P=0.001). Jatropha has a pan-tropical distribution, plus specific adaptability to hot temperate areas. Climate variables most significantly affecting modelled yield response were annual average temperature, minimum temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality.

AB  - Mahanarva finibriolata (Stal) (Hemiptera: Cercopidae) is the most important pest of sugarcane harvested without the use of fire to burn leaf trash. Its biology was studied for three generations in order to obtain basic information about its life cycle. A fertility life table was used to evaluate the quality of laboratory-reared insects. Data were obtained at a temperature of 25 +/- 1 degrees C, RH of 70 +/- 10%, and a 14-hour photophase. The incubation period lasted 21 days with a viability of 81%; the nymph,stage had a duration of 37 days, with a 94% viability; the male and female longevities were 18 and 23 days, respectively, with a pre-oviposition period of 5 days and an oviposition period of 16 days, with a fecundity of 342 eggs, with a life-cycle (egg-adult) of 60 days. A net reproductive rate (Ro) of 131 females produced per female per generation was measured, with a finite rate of increase (lambda) of 1.085. The fertility life table proved to be adequate to be evaluate the quality of laboratory-reared M. fimbriolata populations.

AB  - Insects can increase their resistance to cold stress when they are exposed to non-lethal conditions prior to the stress; these plastic responses are normally described only in terms of immediate effects on mortality. Here we examine in Drosophila melanogaster the short-and longer-term effects of different conditions on several measures of cold resistance, but particularly chill coma recovery. Short-term exposure to sublethal temperature (cold hardening) did not decrease chill coma recovery times even though it decreased mortality. Exposure to 12 degrees C for 2 days (acclimation) decreased chill coma recovery times for a range of stressful temperatures when flies were cultured at 25 degrees C, but did not usually affect recovery times when flies were cultured at 19 degrees C. In contrast, 2-day exposure to 12 degrees C decreased mortality regardless of rearing temperature. Rearing at 19 degrees C decreased mortality and chill coma recovery time relative to rearing at 25 degrees C. Acclimation increased the eclosion rate of eggs from stressed females, but did not affect development time or size of the offspring. These results indicate that plastic responses to cold in D. melanogaster are complex when resistance is scored in different ways, and that effects can extend across generations.

AB  - Femtosecond laser processing is a non-thermal process with less heat effect on a target material and is applied to dielectric and difficult-to-machine materials, such as titanium alloy and diamond. Femtosecond laser processing has been used for 3-dimensional shape generation in recent years, and increasing accuracy and productivity are required for such generation by femtosecond lasers. However, a 2.5-dimensional computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system, which is mainly used in femtosecond laser processing, does not satisfy the requirement for complicated 3-dimensional shape generation. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a 3-dimensional CAM system for high-precision and productive 3-dimensional processing. Furthermore, for the 3-dimensional CAM system, quantitative identification of a 3-dimensional removal shape through ablation is necessary. This study proposes the development of a simulation method to accurately predict the 3-dimensional removal shape through femtosecond laser processing, including the piecewise approximation of the ablation rate and absorptance correction. At the same time, a similar 3-dimensional shape as that found through the experimental results was obtained during the simulation by considering the mechanical errors of the laser processing machine in the simulation model. Furthermore, an on-machine measurement system was developed to efficiently identify the ablation parameters.

AB  - Responses to temperature of a population of Meloidogyne javanica from Tanzania were examined. The minimum time for development from J2 to first J2 of the next generation was determined over a temperature range from 18-30-degrees-C. The rate of development increased linearly between 18-degrees-C and 27-degrees-C and, on a thermal time basis, the threshold or base temperature for development was estimated by extrapolation to be 12.9-degrees-C and the requirement for development c. 350-degrees-C days above base. These values are compared with those for M. hapla, a temperate species, and their effects on development time in relation to temperature are discussed. The effect of higher temperatures on egg viability was also tested. Short exposures to 70-degrees-C were lethal and exposure to 45-degrees-C and above killed a progressively increasing proportion of eggs. Exposure in the field in Tanzania of egg masses buried at different depths to solarization under clear polythene sheeting showed that at 15 cm depth all eggs were dead after 2-3 weeks with an average and a maximum soil temperature at 16.00 h of 43-degrees-C and 45-degrees-C respectively for the covered and 40-degrees-C and 42-degrees-C for the uncovered plots. Irrigating the plots before covering slightly decreased mean soil temperatures compared with the covered, dry plots and greatly increased egg survival.

AB  - Ni and Co as active metals, supported on Al2O3, ZnO and AlZnOx were tested in partial oxidation and the steam reforming processes. The effect of catalysts for syngas production by catalytic reforming of bioethanol and acetic acid for power generation of SOFC was studied. Single supported Ni or Co catalysts, showed high activity but different product distribution. The Al2O3 supported catalysts were quickly deactivated by carbon deposition because of ethylene and acetone formation over the strong acidic sites of alumina. The ZnO supported catalysts showed a remarkable higher syngas productivity compared to the Al2O3 supported samples. The catalysts supported over mixed oxide, showed higher activity in partial oxidation and the steam reforming in comparison to single oxide samples. In partial oxidation of ethanol NiAlZnOx sample was more active, however in steam reforming of acetic acid CoAlZnOx sample showed better performance. In situ XRD study of ZnO and AlZnOx supported samples showed that both series have similar phase composition, which is determined by the properties of ZnO, especially its oxygen mobility at high temperature. Alloy structure formation and the reduction of active metals under the reaction conditions provided high performance of these catalysts in partial oxidation and steam reforming with high production to syngas.

AB  - The physical and chemical properties of sinter feed are important factors that determine the productivity and quality of sinter product. In this study the feasibility of treating sinter feed by high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) is investigated for selective cracks generation exploiting weak zones along grain boundaries of poor quality iron ores without generating much fines. The pre-treated sinter feed was characterized for size distribution, surface area, contact angle, and SEM analyses. The characterization results indicated that surface area of the pre-treated sinter feed sample increased about 20%. Pot-grate sintering tests results also indicated improvement on cold permeability, sintering yield and productivity, sinter Tumbler index, and low temperature degradation index (LTD) after HPGR pre-treatment.

AB  - Environmental temperature variation generates adaptive phenotypic differentiation in widespread populations. We used a common garden experiment to determine whether offspring with varying parental origins display adaptive phenotypic variation related to different thermal conditions experienced in parental environments. We compared burst swimming performance and critical thermal limits of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles bred from adults captured at high (similar to 2000 m above sea level) and low (similar to 5 m above sea level) altitudes. Maternal origin significantly affected swimming performance. Optimal swimming performance temperature (T-opt) had a >9 degrees C difference between tadpoles with low altitude maternal origins (pure- and cross-bred, 35.0 degrees C) and high-altitude maternal origins (pure-bred, 25.5 degrees C; cross-bred, 25.9 degrees C). Parental origin significantly affected critical thermal (CT) limits. Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins had higher CTmax (37.8 +/- 0.8 degrees C) than pure-bred tadpoles with high-altitude parental origins and all crossbred tadpoles (37.0 +/- 0.8 and 37.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C). Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins and all cross-bred tadpoles had higher CTmin (4.2 +/- 0.7 and 4.2 +/- 0.7 degrees C) than pure-bred tadpoles with high-altitude parental origins (2.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C). Our study shows that the varying thermal physiological traits of Xenopus laevis tadpoles are the result of adaptive responses to their parental thermal environments. This study is one of few demonstrating potential intraspecific evolution of critical thermal limits in a vertebrate species. Multi-generation common garden experiments and genetic analyses would be required to further tease apart the relative contribution of plastic and genetic effects to the adaptive phenotypic variation observed in these tadpoles.

AB  - Strawberries are produced in Belgium with different cultivation methods (glasshouse/plastic tunnel/open field, June/ever bearing varieties, early/retarded,...). In each cultivation system different climatological conditions like temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and duration of the light period (L) occur. These climatological differences have important influences on the fitness and success of beneficial fauna which is introduced in strawberry fields to control phytophageous pests. So far, too many failures have occurred in biological or integrated pest management due to inappropriate development of the beneficial fauna followed by an insufficient control of the pest. For two beneficial species Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) that control the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), predation and reproduction parameters were studied under different T-RH-L combinations. Predation success was recorded as the amount of consumed eggs. The studied reproduction parameters included fecundity, egg hatch, larval and nymphal survival, sex ratio and generation time. For each condition, an eventual preference (or the absence of a preference) for a beneficial species was determined. Moreover, 'in crop' climatological conditions were followed using 15 minute recordings of T and RH in the most important strawberry culture systems from planting till harvest.

AB  - Aquatic ectotherms face a challenge of obtaining sufficient oxygen, and it is commonly claimed that this challenge increases with increasing environmental temperature, causing concerns about the fate of aquatic ecosystems under climate change. However, the oxygen challenge hypothesis often ignores the effect of known phenotypic plastic responses. These can occur on either a within- or multigenerational scale, where multiple reactions act in concert to increase oxygen supply in response to increased temperature in a wide range of traits (molecular, egg content, behavioural, cell structure, morphological). Here, we combine a novel modelling approach with empirical measurements that enable quantification of how both the oxygen supply (maximum oxygen diffusion rate) and demand (metabolic rate) are affected by temperature while allowing for phenotypic plasticity. We exposed the aquatic ectotherm Daphnia magna to a range of temperatures (17-28 degrees C) over several asexual generations and confirm that phenotypic plasticity contributes to an increased ability to obtain oxygen on the whole-organism level at high temperatures. This response is strongest within the highest temperature range (22-28 degrees C), where the change in oxygen challenge is expected to be most pronounced. However, the observed thermal plasticity in oxygen supply failed to compensate for the increased demand. Thus, we provide empirical evidence that the oxygen challenge in aquatic ectotherms increases with increasing temperature, even in the presence of phenotypic plasticity in oxygen supply.

AB  - Despite their promise for simulating natural complexity, individual-based models (IBMs) are rarely used for ecological research or resource management. Few IBMs have been shown to reproduce realistic patterns of behavior by individual organisms. To test our IBM of stream salmonids and draw conclusions about foraging theory, we analyzed the IBM's ability to reproduce six patterns of habitat selection by real trout in simulations contrasting three alternative habitat-selection objectives: maximizing current growth rate, Current probability, or "expected maturity" (EM). EM is the product of (1) predicted survival of starvation and other mortality risks over a future time horizon, and (2) the fraction of reproductive size attained over the time horizon. Minimizing the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate was not tested as a habitat-selection rule because it produces nonsensical results when any habitat yields negative growth rates. The IBM simulates habitat selection in response to spatial and temporal variation in mortality risks and food availability as fish compete for food. The model fish move each daily time step to maximize their habitat-selection objective with no other restrictions (e.g., territoriality) imposed.
   Simulations with habitat selected to maximize growth reproduced three of the six habitat-selection patterns; maximizing survival reproduced two patterns; and maximizing EM reproduced all six patterns. Two patterns (shifts in habitat with Changes in temperature and food availability) were not reproduced by the objectives that consider only current growth and risk but were explained by the EM objective that considers how future starvation risk depends on current energy reserves and energy intake. In 75-d simulations, population-level survival and biomass accumulation were hi-hest for fish moving to maximize EM. These results support the basic assumptions of state-based dynamic-model in g approaches to habitat selection. Our IBM appears successful because it avoids restrictive assumptions, incorporates competition for food, assumes salmonids make good habitat-selection decisions at a daily time step, and uses a habitat objective (EM) that provides reasonable trade-offs between growth and mortality risks.

AB  - This study examines micro-evolutionary aspects of a natural Daphnia magna population exposed to Cd. To this end, a set of hypotheses related to micro-evolutionary responses and to how these are influenced by temperature and Cd stress, were tested. Life-table experiments were conducted with 14 D. magna clones collected from an unpolluted lake following a 2 x 2 design with Cd concentration and temperature as the factors (control vs. 5 mu g/L cadmium, 20 vs. 24 degrees C). Several fitness traits were monitored during 21 days. Our results demonstrate (1) that chemicals can have effects on key population genetic characteristics such as genetic variation and between-trait correlations and (2) that these effects may differ depending on temperature. Their findings also suggests that further research is needed to understand the importance of combined chemical-global warming stress for micro-evolutionary responses of organisms. These aspects are currently not accounted for in any regulatory environmental risk assessment procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rising temperatures associated with global climatic change threaten the persistence of species. Determining how species adapt to environmental change is paramount. Much work has shown that environmental stressors have the potential to induce phenotypic changes that span multiple generations. Such transgenerational plasticity (TGP) represents a mechanism that may allow for rapid responses to global climatic change. Yet, our understanding of thermal TGP beyond the relationship between parent and offspring is limited. We evaluated thermal TGP in development across three generations (i.e., F-0, F-1, and F-2) in zooplankton (Daphnia ambigua) from lakes in Connecticut. We found that the temperatures at which parents and grandparents were reared significantly influenced age at maturation in the grand-offspring. Comparisons between the F-0 and F-1 generation show that the offspring of parents reared at low temperatures matured significantly faster than the offspring of parents reared at a higher temperature. However, age at maturation in the grand-offspring was influenced by the interactive effects of parents and grandparents. Such an effect yielded trends that were not readily predicted from the previous generations and whose adaptive significance is unclear. Our results thus call for additional theoretical and empirical work to better understand the transgenerational effects of temperature.

AB  - Cooling systems and refrigerators based on adsorption heat transformation processes (AHT) are a green alter -native to compression cooling systems. Considering the increasing demand for human comfort, there is a crucial need for next-generation energy-efficient technologies, where the modeling and understanding of all parameters is a milestone. The viability and performance of the technology rely on the selected pair adsorbent/working fluid, but further from their pure thermodynamic performance, processing, and its derivates kinetic factors are depicted high relevant. In this work, ethanol adsorption kinetics on classic commercial adsorbents (activated carbon, AC) are predicted and further determined. The adsorptive phenomenon was investigated by means of computational simulation based on implemented Linear Driving Force (LDF) and the results were compared with experimental adsorption isotherms modeled by using Dubinin-Astakhov equation. The specific cooling effect (SCE) was studied by temperature monitoring during ethanol vapor adsorption experiments in a transient regime.

AB  - Synopsis
   Coal is used to generate more than three-quarters of South Africa's electricity, while numerous coal-fired boilers are employed for steam generation in industrial processes. However, coal-fired power generation is responsible for the release of the largest quantities of SO2 emissions to the atmosphere and leads to detrimental health and welfare effects in communities in the proximity of coal-fired plants. The classical industrial SO2 abatement solution for the coal-fired power generation industry is wet flue gas desulphurization, which uses a limestone adsorbent and produces a gypsum by-product (WFGD L/G). In South Africa, due to the poor quality of the limestone the gypsum product is unsaleable and is co-disposed with coal ash. In comparison, the Sulfacid (R) process technology converts SO2 contained in industrial flue gas into saleable sulphuric acid using a catalytic process requiring only water and air. This process does not require limestone. The scale of the latest commercial applications of the Sulfacid (R) SO2 abatement technology in the chemical, fertilizer, and copper mining industries demonstrates the potential and readiness of this technology to be employed in the coal-fired electricity and steam production sectors. This paper provides a first-order direct comparison between the techno-economic aspects of the WFGD (L/G) and Sulfacid (R) technologies using the requirements specified for the 6 x 800 MWe Eskom coal-fired Medupi power station. The results indicate that affordable flue gas desulphurization technology exists that could be adopted by the South African industry to reduce SO2 emissions to legislative limits and beyond.

AB  - During biotic and abiotic stress in plants, reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play two very different roles: high ROS concentrations can exacerbate damage, whereas low concentrations can activate defense responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ROS generation and pollen viability after cryopreservation. ROS generation was detected from 'Siberia' (Lilium x siberia) pollen using flow cytometry with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate as a fluorescent probe. Pollen viability was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. ROS generation was slightly increased by rapid cooling (26.13 +/- 4.74 vs. 15.80 +/- 2.30 for fresh pollen) and significantly increased by vitrification (49.74 +/- 1.43; P < 0.01). Pollen viabilities after rapid cooling and vitrification were significantly increased (58.88 +/- 3.76% and 70.35 +/- 2.90%, respectively) over that of fresh pollen (46.65 +/- 1.61%; P < 0.01). No significant differences in ROS generation were associated with cold acclimation at different temperatures before rapid cooling. However, sharp decreases in viability were observed with cold acclimation at 4A degrees C and -20A degrees C relative to rapid cooling without acclimation (P < 0.01). We observed nonsignificant decreases in ROS generation among vitrification treatments that omitted different steps and a significant decrease when the unloading step was omitted (P < 0.05). Pollen viabilities were significantly reduced when the loading or dehydration steps were omitted (P < 0.01). No significant differences were observed in ROS generation or pollen viability among the treatments when 200 U/ml catalase was added to different solutions used in the vitrification process. Comprehensive analysis of all data indicated a positive correlation between ROS generation and pollen viability (r = 0.651, P < 0.001). Therefore, increasing ROS generation during cryopreservation may improve the viability of 'Siberia' pollen.

AB  - In nature, evolution occurs through the continuous adaptation of a population to its environment. At the molecular level, adaptive changes in protein sequence and expression impact organismal fitness and, consequently, dictate population dynamics. Here, we have used a "weak link" method to favor variations in one gene, allowing adaptation to thermostability to be studied in molecular detail as bacteria were grown continuously for similar to 1500 generations. Surprisingly, only six mutant alleles, representing less than 1% of the possible missense mutations, were observed, suggesting a highly constrained molecular landscape during protein evolution. The changes in organismal fitness were linked directly to incremental increases in enzyme stability and activity maxima and corresponded to the narrow temperature ranges where each mutant enjoyed success within the overall population. Thus, continuous evolution of a single gene permits a quantitative approach that extends from the phenotypes of the microbial populations to their underlying biophysical basis.

AB  - The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), exists with holocyclic life cycle in Tacheng, Xinjiang in Northwest China. It produces males and oviparae to mate and oviposit for overwintering by eggs. Under laboratory conditions with 14 h/d photophase and temperature not lower than 15 degreesC, RWA occurred in parthenogenesis and produced no males. The laboratory populations of Russian wheat aphid, which were kept under natural conditions in fall by 15th, 49th and 81st generation while wild populations produced males and oviparae for mating, produced males and oviparae with their number decreased gradually, but viviparae and nymphs increased sequentially. As a result, it produced a small amount of oviparae and no males emerged in fields by 49 generations' reproduction in laboratory. After development of 81 generations, oviparae happened occasionally and no eggs occurred for overwintering instead of viviparae and nymphs. A hypothesis of RWA disastrous process was proposed. The life cycle of RWA can be changed from holocycly to anholocycly in its long-term spread and evolution. Anholocycly is more dangerous than holocycly to small grains for its strong adaptability and dispersal ability.

AB  - Disentangling the responses of insects to variations in their thermal environment is central to our understanding of the evolution of temperature-dependent performance in these species. Here, we report results of experiments examining the effects of high (upper lethal temperature = ULT) and low (lower lethal temperature = LLT) temperature and exposure time on the survival of larvae and adults of a multivoltine, nocturnal moth species, Pareuchaetes insulata, a biological control agent whose impact on an invasive weed, Chromolaena odorata has been variable in South Africa. The influence of temperature and acclimation on locomotion performance of the moth was also investigated. Temperature and duration of exposure significantly affected survival of both adults and larvae of P. insulata with more extreme temperatures and/or longer durations proving to be more lethal. Third instar larvae and adults are both freeze intolerant and had LT50 of -5.9 and -4.7 degrees C, respectively, after a 2 h exposure. Although cold acclimation was beneficial to the nocturnal larvae, temperatures below 10 degrees C significantly reduce their locomotion activities. The average daily minimum temperatures in the coldest months at three locations in South Africa are over 5 degrees C lower than those of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, where P. insulata was originally collected. Our results suggest that lethal high or low temperatures at short timescales are trivial in explaining the variable performance of P. insulata, but reduced locomotion at sub-lethal temperatures may be an important driver of the population dynamics of the biocontrol agent (especially in winter months) and may consequently explain the low population levels of the moth because of possible reduced feeding by larvae during night-time low temperatures.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the emergence and development of low-to-medium-grade thermal-energy-conversion systems for distributed power generation based on thermodynamic vapor-phase heat-engine cycles undergone by organic working fluids, namely organic Rankine cycles (ORCs). ORC power systems are, to some extent, a relatively established and mature technology that is well-suited to converting low/medium-grade heat (at temperatures up to similar to 300-400 degrees C) to useful work, at an output power scale from a few kilowatts to 10s of megawatts. Thermal efficiencies in excess of 25% are achievable at higher temperatures and larger scales, and efforts are currently in progress to improve the overall economic viability and thus uptake of ORC power systems, by focusing on advanced architectures, working-fluid selection, heat exchangers and expansion machines. Solar-power systems based on ORC technology have a significant potential to be used for distributed power generation, by converting thermal energy from simple and low-cost non-concentrated or low-concentration collectors to mechanical, hydraulic, or electrical energy. Current fields of use include mainly geothermal and biomass/biogas, as well as the recovery and conversion of waste heat, leading to improved energy efficiency, primary energy (i.e., fuel) use and emission minimization, yet the technology is highly transferable to solar-power generation as an affordable alternative to small-to-medium-scale photovoltaic systems. Solar-ORC systems offer naturally the advantages of providing a simultaneous thermal-energy output for hot water provision and/or space heating, and the particularly interesting possibility of relatively straightforward onsite (thermal) energy storage. Key performance characteristics are presented, and important heat transfer effects that act to limit performance are identified as noteworthy directions of future research for the further development of this technology.

AB  - The thermal environment of ectotherms affects every aspect of their life history and many ectotherms must keep their body near an optimal temperature range through some form of thermoregulation. Because of the small size of geckos in the genus Sphaerodactylus, they are highly susceptible to overheating and desiccation. Also, because of their small size, they are assumed to conform quickly to environmental temperatures, leaving them no option but to exploit microhabitats with temperatures as close as possible to their optimal range. We used a thermal gradient to find the preferred temperature of S. macrolepis in the lab and thermal imaging and data loggers in the field to explore their thermal ecology and microhabitat selection. Our data suggest that all of the microhabitats available within our study sites are outside of the preferred temperature range of S. macrolepis during the hottest parts of the day. The layer of leaf litter closest to the ground had the highest humidity and lowest, most stable temperatures. However, geckos ranged into a nearby grassy field where temperatures and humidity were sub-optimal. Although these geckos quickly conform to the temperature of their microhabitat, they appear to adjust activity periods to exploit suitable environmental temperatures when they are available.

AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, andmarine-based farming in particular is growing the fastest. With the ever-increasing demand for seafood, marine aquaculture (mariculture) has great potential to help meet this demand. Due to the highly diverse and variable nature of marine environments, it is critical to understand species-level trade-offs that can influence the suitability of a species or species groups for certain ocean conditions. Particularly for mariculture, physiological tolerance of a species to temperature fluctuations and low dissolved oxygen (DO) and its capacity to grow quickly are important attributes. Although there has been extensive research pertaining to the respective fields of tolerance and growth of marine organisms, there has been little overlap between the seemingly separate, yet related fields. More specifically, a relationship between traits of tolerance and growth is not well understood - especially across multiple taxonomic groups. In order to explore and compare possible tolerance and life-history relationships of mariculture species, we complied information on temperature tolerance range, minimum dissolved oxygen observations, growth parameters (asymptotic size and rate), trophic level (TL), taxon, region, and market value for 178 distinct marine farmed species, which included finfish (n= 101), crustaceans (n= 20), molluscs ( n= 52), and other aquatic invertebrates (n = 5), including a cephalopod, a cordate, and three echinoderms. Using descriptive statistics and regression modelling, we found a significant inverse relationship between temperature tolerance range and minimum DO observations (i.e., a positive trend between thermal and hypoxia tolerance, as defined). We also found evidence of a possible trade-off between overall tolerance ability and growth. Specifically, larger, slower growing species tend to have wider temperature ranges and lower minimum DO levels, but potentially at the cost of being less ecologically sustainable (as measured by TL). In addition, tropical species appear less resilient when accounting for both thermal extremes and lower observed DO levels compared to subtropical and temperate species. These patterns highlight associations and uncertainties of traits important for mariculture practices, including species and trait selection, as well as adaptive capacity of regional ventures relative to climate change.

AB  - A derivative of the Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pAM401 was isolated by mutagenesis in an E. coli mutator strain. This plasmid, designated pAM40lts, was more than an order of magnitude less stable at 38 degrees C than at 30 degrees C in the E. faecalis host strain JH2-2. The E. faecalis plasmid pAD1-encoded par stability locus was cloned onto pAM40lts, and its effects on plasmid stability and host cell viability were assessed. It was found that par stabilized pAM40lts at 38 degrees C but also caused a substantial drop in cell viability three to four generations after a temperature shift from 30 to 38 degrees C. After a maximum viability drop of 94%, culture growth recovered as plasmid-free cells began to accumulate. Provision of excess RNAII, the putative par antidote, in trans attenuated cell killing. These characteristics support a postsegregational killing mechanism for par-mediated plasmid stabilization. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - In the present study a comprehensive thermodynamic model and degradation based optimization framework for energy management of anode supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks are carried out. The optimization framework determines optimum operating conditions to maximize system productivity (energy generation over system lifetime) considering degradation mechanisms. The main degradation mechanisms in anode supported SOFCs are nickel coarsening and oxidation. In this study, the optimum operating conditions regarding these degradation mechanisms to achieve maximum productivity at different target lifetimes are derived. The results show that target lifetime has a significant impact on system productivity and optimum operating temperature and current density. Furthermore, SOFC optimum operating conditions as a function of target lifetime are derived. To show the effectiveness of the developed framework, model outputs are compared with two other operating strategies; a base case strategy that optimizes system operating conditions without considering degradation mechanisms and a strategy based on Department of Energy's (DOE) 2016 fuel cell report. Results illustrated that degradation based optimization is more beneficial for improving the entire performance in long-term operation:For instance, system productivity is 7.4% higher in comparison with DOE strategy during 40,000 h operating lifetime. It is expected that the proposed methodology will lead to more rapid commercialization of SOFC technology.

AB  - The Brassica coenospeceis have treasure troves of genes that could be beneficial if introgressed into cultivated Brassicas to combat the current conditions of climate change. Introducing genetic variability through plant speciation with polyploidization is well documented, where ploidy augmentation of inter-generic allohexaploids using somatic hybridization has significantly contributed to genetic base broadening. Sinapis alba is a member of the Brassicaceae family that possesses valuable genes, including genes conferring resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Alternaria brassicae, pod shattering, heat, and drought stress. This work aimed to synthesize stable allohexaploid (AABBSS) Brassica while incorporating the yellow-seed trait and resistance to S. sclerotiorum stem rot. The two fertile and stable allohexaploids were developed by polyethylene glycol mediated protoplast fusions between Brassica juncea (AABB) and S. alba (SS) and named as JS1 and JS2. These symmetric hybrids (2n = 60) were validated using morphological and molecular cytology techniques and were found to be stable over consecutive generations. The complete chromosome constitution of the three genomes was determined through genomic in situ hybridization of mitotic cells probed with S. alba genomic DNA labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. These two allohexaploids showed 24 hybridization signals demonstrating the presence of complete diploid chromosomes from S. alba and 36 chromosomes from B. juncea. The meiotic pollen mother cell showed 30 bivalent sets of all the 60 chromosomes and none of univalent or trivalent observed during meiosis. Moreover, the backcross progeny 1 plant revealed 12 hybridization signals out of a total of 48 chromosome counts. Proper pairing and separation were recorded at the meiotic metaphase and anaphase, which proved the stability of the allohexaploid and their backcross progeny. When screening, the allohexaploid (JS2) of B. juncea and S. alba displayed a high degree of resistance to S. sclerotiorum rot along with a half-yellow and half-brown (mosaic) seed coat color, while the B. juncea and S. alba allohexaplopid1 (JS1) displayed a yellow seed coat color with the same degree of resistance to Sclerotinia rot.

AB  - In recent decades, hybridization has become a focus of attention because of its role in evolutionary processes. However, little is known about changes in genetic structure within and between parental species and hybrids over time. Here, we studied processes of genetic change in parental species and hybrids from the Daphnia longispina complex (Crustacea, Cladocera) over a period of six years across ten habitats. These cyclical parthenogens respond to fluctuating environments by switching from asexual to sexual reproduction. Importantly, sexually produced diapausing eggs, which resist extreme conditions such as low temperatures and serve as dispersal stages, are produced to a lower extent by hybrids. Long-term microsatellite data revealed clear differences between hybrids and parental species. In hybrids, clonal diversity values were lower, whereas heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium values were higher compared to parental species. Clonal diversity of hybrids responded to the strength of the winter, with cold winters resulting in few genotypes in the following spring. In time windows when only asexual hybrid females survive, priority effects will favour the establishment of the hybrid offspring before hatchlings from parental diapause eggs can enter the community. The constant high levels of heterozygosity maintained by clonal reproduction in hybrids might lead to their successful establishment over time, when they are able to escape competition from both parental species. Although we found evidence that hybrids diversity depends on fluctuating environments, a direct link between hybrid abundance and the strength of winter was missing. Because of reduced adaptability in clonally reproducing hybrids, multiple factors must contribute to promoting their long-term success in fluctuating environments.

AB  - Bifacial solar panels are perceived to be the technology of choice for next-generation solar farms for their increased energy yield at a marginally increased cost. As the bifacial farms proliferate around the world, it is important to investigate the role of temperature-dependent energy-yield and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of bifacial solar farms relative to monofacial farms, stand-alone bifacial modules, and various competing bifacial technologies. In this work, we integrate existing irradiance and light collection models with experimentally validated physics-based temperature-dependent efficiency models to compare the energy yield and LCOE of various bifacial technologies across the world. We find that temperature-dependent efficiency changes the energy yield and LCOE by approximately - 10 to15%. Indeed, the results differ significantly depending on the location of the farm (defines the illumination and ambient temperature), the elevation of the module (increases light collection), as well as the temperature-coefficients of various bifacial technologies. The analysis presented in this paper will allow us to realistically assess location-specific relative advantage and economic viability of the next generation bifacial solar farms.

AB  - This study examines the use of distributed power plants coupled to desalination systems to achieve combined production of electrical energy and of water for drinking and similar purposes in Marches, an Adriatic region in central Italy. To reduce Marches' large electricity deficit, the regional government has drawn up an environmental and energy plan promoting distributed generation through power plants built right where the electricity is consumed. At the same time, the region's abundant water resources are increasingly threatened by aquifer pollution, due particularly to fertilizers and to the phenomenon of saltwater intrusion near the coast. Distributed electrical energy generation combined with water production can help meet the goal of reducing the electrical deficit while at the same time improving ground-water quality and reducing the hydrogeological risk. The solution is also efficient, since the more the useful heat recovered by the energy system, the higher its global efficiency. Furthermore, coupling power plants to desalination units is also an excellent application of cogeneration systems, allowing useful recovery of thermal energy in the summer. The study examines different sized plants for the distributed generation of water and power in Marches, from small units to thermal desalination systems that can be coupled to existing power plants. It shows that although endowing existing large power plants with MED (multiple effect distillation) units makes it possible to meet 58% of the freshwater demand in Marches, it further increases the electricity deficit, whereas coupling small or medium-sized distributed power plants to reverse osmosis systems allows meeting 75% of the demand for freshwater and reduces the electrical energy demand by up to 50% in the more energy-intensive districts.

AB  - Despite the potential constraints imposed by cutaneous; respiration and nocturnality, some salamanders actively thermoregulate when conditions permit. We measured substrate temperature selection in two species of Desmognathus in a moist thermal gradient in the laboratory. Desmognathus monticola selected significantly higher temperatures than Desmognathus quadramaculatus. Although the substrate temperatures selected by D. quadramaculatus did not vary over time (mean +/- 1 SE = 13.6 +/- 1.1 C), D. monticola selected significantly higher temperatures at night than during the day. Mean temperatures selected by D. monticola were 14.0 +/- 1.5 C from 12001600 and 19.7 +/- 1.6 C from 2000-0000 h. This difference in temporal patterns is consistent with field behavior, because A monticola is more frequently found away from water at night than is D. quadranzaculatus.

AB  - In order to respond to the constant demand for more productivity in the manufacture of IC devices, higher throughput and higher resolution are fundamental requirements for each new generation of exposure tools. However, meeting both requirements lead to unwanted aberration we refer to as "thermal aberration". In our experience, the problem of the thermal aberrations does not correlated only to the duration of heavy use. It depends very strongly on both the optical settings and the mask patterns, also even on the specific interaction between the two. So, even if using the same illumination settings, there is a possibility to observe different distribution of thermal aberrations. In this paper, we define and investigate various patterns to be used as targets for thermal aberrations compensation. These patterns are identified as the "weak patterns" of the thermal aberration. We assess several cases of thermal aberrations, and show how the optimized compensation for each is determined and then applied on the actual exposure tools.

AB  - Comets are typically considered to be pristine remnants of the early solar system. However, by definition they evolve significantly over their lifetimes through evaporation, sublimation, degassing and dust release. This occurs once they enter the inner solar system and are heated by the Sun. Some comets (e.g. 1P/Halley, 9P/Tempel and Hale-Bopp) as well as chondritic porous cosmic dust - released from comets - show evidence of minor aqueous alteration resulting in the formation of phyllosilicates, carbonates or other secondary phases (e.g. Cu-sulphides, amphibole and magnetite). These observations suggest that (at least some) comets experienced limited interaction with liquid water under conditions distinct from the alteration histories of hydrated chondritic asteroids (e.g. the CM and CR chondrites).
   This synthesis paper explores the viability of perihelion-induced heating as a mechanism for the generation of highly localised subsurface liquid water and thus mild aqueous alteration in periodic comets. We draw constraints from experimental laboratory studies, numerical modelling, spacecraft observations and microanalysis studies of cometary micrometeorites. Both temperature and pressure conditions necessary for the generation and short-term (hour-long) survival of liquid water are plausible within the immediate subsurface (<0.5 m depth) of periodic comets with small perihelia (<1.5 A.U.), low surface permeabilities and favourable rotational states (e.g. high obliquities and/or slow rotational periods). We estimate that solar radiant heating may generate liquid water and perform aqueous alteration reactions in 3-9% of periodic comets. An example of an ideal candidate is 2P/Encke which has a small perihelion (0.33 A.U.), a high obliquity and a short orbital period. This comet should therefore be considered a high priority candidate in future spectroscopic studies of comet surfaces. Small quantities of phyllosilicate generated by aqueous alteration may be important in cementing together grains in the subsurface of older dormant comets, thereby explaining observations of unexpectedly high tensile strength in some bodies.
   Most periodic comets which currently pass close to the Sun are dormant, having experienced surface heating, significant cometary activity and dust release in the past. These bodies may be responsible for the partially hydrated cometary micrometeorites we find at the Earth's surface and their aqueous alteration histories may have been produced by perihelion-induced subsurface heating. This is in contrast to radiogenic and impact heating that operated during the early solar system on asteroids. This study has implications for the alteration history of the active asteroid Phaethon, the target of JAXA's DESTINY+ mission.

AB  - The change in oceanic carbonate chemistry due to increased atmospheric P-CO2 has caused pH to decline in marine surface waters, a phenomenon known as ocean acidification (OA). The effects of OA on organisms have been shown to be widespread among diverse taxa from a wide range of habitats. The majority of studies of organismal response to OA are in short-term exposures to future levels of P-CO2. From such studies, much information has been gathered on plastic responses organisms may make in the future that are beneficial or harmful to fitness. Relatively few studies have examined whether organisms can adapt to negative-fitness consequences of plastic responses to OA. We outline major approaches that have been used to study the adaptive potential for organisms to OA, which include comparative studies and experimental evolution. Organisms that inhabit a range of pH environments (e.g. pH gradients at volcanic CO2 seeps or in upwelling zones) have great potential for studies that identify adaptive shifts that have occurred through evolution. Comparative studies have advanced our understanding of adaptation to OA by linking whole-organism responses with cellular mechanisms. Such optimization of function provides a link between genetic variation and adaptive evolution in tuning optimal function of rate-limiting cellular processes in different pH conditions. For example, in experimental evolution studies of organisms with short generation times (e.g. phytoplankton), hundreds of generations of growth under future conditions has resulted in fixed differences in gene expression related to acid-base regulation. However, biochemical mechanisms for adaptive responses to OA have yet to be fully characterized, and are likely to be more complex than simply changes in gene expression or protein modification. Finally, we present a hypothesis regarding an unexplored area for biochemical adaptation to ocean acidification. In this hypothesis, proteins and membranes exposed to the external environment, such as epithelial tissues, may be susceptible to changes in external pH. Such biochemical systems could be adapted to a reduced pH environment by adjustment of weak bonds in an analogous fashion to biochemical adaptation to temperature. Whether such biochemical adaptation to OA exists remains to be discovered.

AB  - Background: Behaviour has been traditionally viewed as a driver of subsequent evolution because behavioural adjustments expose organisms to novel environments, which may result in a correlated evolution on other traits. In Drosophila subobscura, thermal preference and heat tolerance are linked to chromosomal inversion polymorphisms that show parallel latitudinal clines worldwide, such that "cold-climate" ("warm-climate") chromosome arrangements collectively favour a coherent response to colder (warmer) settings as flies carrying them prefer colder (warmer) conditions and have lower (higher) knock out temperatures. Yet, it is not clear whether a genetic correlation between thermal preference and heat tolerance can partially underlie such response.
   Results: We have analyzed the genetic basis of thermal preference and heat tolerance using isochromosomal lines in D. subobscura. Chromosome arrangements on the O chromosome were known to have a biometrical effect on thermal preference in a laboratory temperature gradient, and also harbour several genes involved in the heat shock response; in particular, the genes Hsp68 and Hsp70. Our results corroborate that arrangements on chromosome O affect adult thermal preference in a laboratory temperature gradient, with cold-climate O-st carriers displaying a lower thermal preference than their warm-climate O3+4 and O3+4+8 counterparts. However, these chromosome arrangements did not have any effect on adult heat tolerance and, hence, we putatively discard a genetic covariance between both traits arising from linkage disequilibrium between genes affecting thermal preference and candidate genes for heat shock resistance. Nonetheless, a possible association of juvenile thermal preference and heat resistance warrants further analysis.
   Conclusions: Thermal preference and heat tolerance in the isochromosomal lines of D. subobscura appear to be genetically independent, which might potentially prevent a coherent response of behaviour and physiology (i.e., coadaptation) to thermal selection. If this pattern is general to all chromosomes, then any correlation between thermal preference and heat resistance across latitudinal gradients would likely reflect a pattern of correlated selection rather than genetic correlation.

AB  - The Texas fatmucket, Lampsilis bracteata, is a unionid mussel endemic to the Colorado and upper Guadalupe River basins of Central Texas and a candidate for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act. There is increased interest in propagation and population restoration of threatened mussels in Texas as a potential conservation method, but still little is known about their life histories and how local populations may differ in aspects of their reproductive ecology, e.g. timing of brooding and potential local adaptations to host fish. The purpose of this study was to compare host fish compatibilities and seasonality of reproduction between two populations: (a) by cross-infesting fish from the San Saba and Llano Rivers in the Colorado River basin with sympatric and allopatric mussel larvae in the laboratory (hatchery-produced Guadalupe bass and largemouth bass were also infested); and (b) by assessing gamete concentration, brooding period, viability of larvae and sex ratios using monthly sampling events between February 2017 and February 2018. Reproduction varied with season and between populations. The proportion of females brooding tended to be lower in the summer and the autumn, and higher during winter and spring months before peak water temperatures were reached. The sex ratio in both populations did not significantly differ from 1:1. Fecundity and larvae viability were higher in the Llano River population compared with the San Saba population. Trematode flatworms were found in several female gonad samples from the San Saba population and in a few samples from the Llano population. The highest metamorphosis success occurred on wild green sunfish and largemouth bass, and hatchery-produced largemouth and Guadalupe bass. The average metamorphosis success tended to be higher for some mussel-fish pairings originating from the same tributary, suggesting that mussels may be locally adapted to host fish, which should be considered in conservation efforts.

AB  - Temperature and thermal variability are increasing worldwide, with well-known survival consequences. However, effects on other potentially more thermally sensitive reproductive traits are less understood, especially when considering thermal variation. Studying the consequences of male reproduction in the context of climate warming and ability to adapt is becoming increasingly relevant. Our goals were to test how exposure to different average temperatures that either fluctuated or remained constant impacts different male reproductive performance traits and to assess adaptive potential to future heat stress. We took advantage of a set of Drosophila melanogaster isogenic lines of different genotypes, exposing them to four different thermal conditions. These conditions represented a benign and a stressful mean temperature, applied either constantly or fluctuating around the mean and experienced during development when heat stress avoidance is hindered because of restricted mobility. We measured subsequent male reproductive performance for mating success, fertility, number of offspring produced and offspring sex ratio, and calculated the influence of thermal stress on estimated heritability and evolvability of these reproductive traits. Both costs and benefits to different thermal conditions on reproductive performance were found, with some responses varying between genotypes. Mating success improved under fluctuating benign temperature conditions and declined as temperature stress increased regardless of genotype. Fertility and productivity were severely reduced at fluctuating mean high temperature for all genotypes, but some genotypes were unaffected at constant high mean temperature. These more thermally robust genotypes showed a slight increase in productivity under the fluctuating benign condition compared to constant high temperature, despite both thermal conditions sharing the same temperature for 6 hr daily. Increasing thermal stress resulted in higher heritability and evolvability. Overall, the effects of temperature on reproductive performance depended on the trait and genotype; performance of some traits slightly increased when high temperatures were experienced for short periods but decreased substantially even when experiencing a benign temperature for a portion of each day. While thermal stress increased genetic variation that could provide adaptive potential against climate warming, this is unlikely to compensate for the overall severe negative effect on reproductive performance as mean temperature and variance increase.

AB  - Encysted embryos of the primitive crustacean, Artemia franciscana, are among the most resistant of all animal life history stages to extremes of environmental stress. This resistance has likely been acquired during evolutionary adaptation to their harsh ecological setting, In the laboratory, for example, some of these embryos survive more than 6 years of continuous anoxia while fully hydrated and at room temperature, a phenomenal capability that can easily be related to their frequent encounters with anoxic conditions in nature. A small heat shock protein belonging to the alpha-crystallin family of proteins, referred to as p26, appears to play a central role in the stress resistance of these embryos. Our evidence shows that this protein is an important component in their adaptive repertoire, and vital for the survival of Artemia in nature.

AB  - The recent developments in the energy industry have kindled renewed interest in producing energy more efficiently. This has motivated the development of higher temperature cycles and their associated equipment. In this paper we will discuss several design configurations coupled with the inherent properties of preferred ceramic materials to assess the viability and design reliability of ceramic heat exchangers for next generation high temperature heat exchangers. These analyses have been extended to conceptually compare the traditional shell and tube heat exchanger with shell and plate heat exchangers. These analyses include hydrodynamic, heat transfer, mechanical stress and reliability models applicable to an Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) and Process Coupling Heat Exchangers. It was found that ceramic micro-channel heat exchanger designs proved to have the greatest reliability due to their inherent mechanical properties, minimal thermo-mechanical stresses while improving the performance efficiency in a compact footprint.

AB  - Phenotypic variation is a fundamental component of the process of evolution and understanding the factors that create this variation is critical to investigations of this process. We test the hypothesis that phenotypic variation created under natural incubation conditions will differ from that created under constant laboratory conditions in a reptile species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). Using a split clutch design, we demonstrate that offspring morphology, behavior, and sex differed between hatchlings incubated in the field and those from the laboratory, but immune response did not. The interactions between different phenotypic parameters will ultimately determine how natural selection acts upon offspring, and consequently our data suggest that offspring developing under these differing conditions should have different fitnesses. The relationship between offspring sex and phenotype serves as the theoretical foundation on which most investigations into the evolution of TSD are built. Thus, it may be necessary to use natural incubation conditions to accurately examine how offspring sex relates to other phenotypic parameters if we are to understand the evolution of this sex determining mechanism.

AB  - A new incentive scheme for power generation from biogas is favoring in Italy the construction of small plants. These ones, however, have poorer financial viability and biological stability than larger plants. In order to ensure adequate performance and a reasonable payback period it is therefore essential that every aspect of their operations is carefully designed. In this respect, summer overheating of anaerobic digesters due to solar gains must be prevented. A solution relies upon the implementation of a 'cool' gasometer dome with properly chosen solar reflectance, whose effectiveness was assessed through the use of a calculation code specifically built and validated by comparison with experimental data.

AB  - Transgenerational phenotypic plasticity is increasingly recognized as an important buffer of environmental change - many studies show that mothers alter the phenotype of their offspring so as to maximize their performance in their local environment. Fewer studies have examined the capacity of parents to alter the phenotype of their gametes to cope with environmental change. In organisms that shed their gametes externally, gametes are extremely vulnerable to local stresses and transgenerational plasticity in the phenotypes of gametes seems likely in this group.
   In a marine tubeworm, Hydroides diramphus, we manipulated the salinity environment that mothers and fathers experienced before reproduction and then examined the phenotype of their gametes, as well as the performance of those gametes and the resultant larvae in different salinities.
   We found strong evidence for gamete plasticity - both mothers and fathers adaptively adjust the phenotype of their gametes to maximize the performance of those gametes in the salinity regime experienced by their parents. Parents were quite flexible in the phenotype of gametes that they produced: they could switch the salinity tolerance of their gametes back and forth depending on their most recent experience.
   Gamete plasticity was not without risks, however. We observed strong trade-offs in performance when gametes experienced an environment that did not match that of their parents. These effects of the parental environment persist for the duration of the larval phase such that larvae may not be able to disperse to environments that do not match their parents. Gamete plasticity may therefore represent an important source of phenotype-environment mismatches.
   Gamete plasticity may represent an important mechanism for coping with environmental change and an important source of maternal and paternal effects in species with external fertilization. Studies that seek to predict the impacts of stresses that persist across generations (e.g. ocean acidification) should include parental exposures to the stress of interest.

AB  - 1. Current syndrome research focuses primarily on behaviour with few incorporating components of physiology. One such syndrome is the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) which describes covariation between behaviour, metabolism, immunity, hormonal response, and life-history traits. Despite the strong effect temperature has on behaviour, thermal physiology has yet to be considered within this syndrome framework.
   2. We proposed the POLS to be extended to include a new dimension, the cold-hot axis. Under this premise, it is predicted that thermal physiology and behaviour would covary, whereby individual positioning along the thermal continuum would coincide with that of the behavioural continuum.
   3. This hypothesis was tested by measuring thermal traits of delicate skinks (Lampropholis delicata) and linking it to their behaviour. Principal components analysis and structural equation modelling were used to determine if traits were structured within the POLS and to characterize the direction of their interactions.
   4. Model results supported the inclusion of the cold-hot axis into the POLS and indicated that thermal physiology was the driver of this relationship, in that thermal traits either constrained or promoted activity, exploration, boldness and social behaviour.
   5. This study highlights the need to integrate thermal physiology within a syndrome framework.

AB  - Climate change is resulting in a radical transformation of the thermal quality of habitats across the globe. Whereas species have altered their distributions to cope with changing environments, the evidence for adaptation in response to rising temperatures is limited. However, to determine the potential of adaptation in response to thermal variation, we need estimates of the magnitude and direction of natural selection on traits that are assumed to increase persistence in warmer environments. Most inferences regarding physiological adaptation are based on interspecific analyses, and those of selection on thermal traits are scarce. Here, we estimate natural selection on major thermal traits used to assess the vulnerability of ectothermic organisms to altered thermal niches. We detected significant directional selection favouring lizards with higher thermal preferences and faster sprint performance at their optimal temperature. Our analyses also revealed correlational selection between thermal preference and critical thermal maxima, where individuals that preferred warmer body temperatures with cooler critical thermal maxima were favoured by selection. Recent published estimates of heritability for thermal traits suggest that, in concert with the strong selective pressures we demonstrate here, evolutionary adaptation may promote long-term persistence of ectotherms in altered thermal environments.

AB  - Numerous factors, such as global environmental changes, habitat destruction, introduced species, diseases, and chemical pollution, appear to be contributing to amphibian population declines. Moreover, the life history characteristics and behavior of many amphibian species appear to be placing them in jeopardy. Such behaviors and ecological attributes were molded over evolutionary time under selection pressures that acted on amphibians in a variety of ways. Many biologists who study amphibian population declines, however, have failed to consider some of these evolutionary aspects. Better understanding of amphibian population declines requires that scientists and policy makers consider the ecological processes associated with the declines in light of evolutionary principles such as these: Evolution is limited by historical constraints; not all evolution is adaptive; adaptations are often compromises; evolution can only alter existing variations; and evolution takes time.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity can serve as a stepping stone towards adaptation. Recently, studies have shown that gene expression contributes to emergent stress responses such as thermal tolerance, with tolerant and susceptible populations showing distinct transcriptional profiles. However, given the dynamic nature of gene expression, interpreting transcriptomic results in a way that elucidates the functional connection between gene expression and the observed stress response is challenging. Here, we present a conceptual framework to guide interpretation of gene expression reaction norms in the context of stress tolerance. We consider the evolutionary and adaptive potential of gene expression reaction norms and discuss the influence of sampling timing, transcriptomic resilience, as well as complexities related to life history when interpreting gene expression dynamics and how these patterns relate to host tolerance. We highlight corals as a case study to demonstrate the value of this framework for non-model systems. As species face rapidly changing environmental conditions, modulating gene expression can serve as a mechanistic link from genetic and cellular processes to the physiological responses that allow organisms to thrive under novel conditions. Interpreting how or whether a species can employ gene expression plasticity to ensure short-term survival will be critical for understanding the global impacts of climate change across diverse taxa.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) has taken heavy tolls on the global economy and public health, calling for air filters that can remove PM from high-temperature emission sources. However, creating desirable filter media capable of capturing polydisperse fine particles (PFPs) effectively and enduringly, while also withstanding high speed airstream, is extremely challenging. Here, a biomimetic and bottom-up strategy to prepare superelastic, strong, and thermostable nanofibrous aerogels (NFAs) as cascade filters by assembling semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN)-based nanofibers into a gradient architecture is reported. Inspired by the robust loofah sponges originating from stiff cellulose networks, the mechanical property of NFAs is enhanced via tailoring the chain flexibility of heat-resistant semi-IPNs. Further constructing a gradient cellular architecture endows NFAs with a versatile cascade filtration behavior for capturing polydisperse fine particles. The resultant semi-IPN-based gradient NFAs exhibit temperature-invariant superelasticity, a high compressive stress (7.9 kPa) and modulus (12 kPa), high filtration efficiency (>99.97%, PM0.3), low pressure drop (approximate to 50% that of membranes), and ultrahigh dust-holding capacity (114 g m(-2)). The fabrication of this attractive material paves the way for designing next-generation air filters for industrial dust removal.

AB  - The spawning and well-being of fish in an ecosystem are closely linked to climatic cues, viz., temperature and rainfall. Reduced fitness can affect the reproductive performance and lead to skipped spawning. Benchmarking the threshold fitness required for a fish population to achieve readiness for spawning, and understanding how climatic parameters influence the fitness will aid in predicting the fate of its reproductive success in future climatic conditions. This study determined the threshold condition factor pre-spawning fitness (K-spawn50) at which 50% of the femaleChanna punctatapopulation can be deemed fit for spawning. The optimal climate within which pre-spawning fitness is attained by this species under Indian climatic conditions was also identified. The study was conducted from June 2015 to September 2016, covering two spawning seasons (June-August) in a Gangetic floodplain wetland of West Bengal, India. The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method (survival fit) was used for estimation of pre-spawning fitness. "Ready to spawn" females were classified based on binary coding of the gonadal maturity stages. The thermal and precipitation range within which spawning fitness is achieved was identified by using the locally weighted smoothing technique. FemaleC. punctatapre-spawning fitness (K-spawn50) ranged from 1.26 to 1.39 with an estimated median of 1.29 units. Temperatures between 29 and 32 degrees C and rainfall above 100 mm were conducive to attaining the requisite pre-spawning fitness inC. punctata. This is the first study benchmarking the pre-spawning fitness and optimal climate forC. punctata. Understanding spawning requirements can inform the climate change-induced impacts on reproductive plasticity and evolutionary adaptations of snakeheads in the Ganga river basin.

AB  - We addressed the question if local adaptation to a thermal gradient is possible in spite of a high gene flow among closely spaced populations of two species of Drosophila from the island of La Gomera (Canary Islands). Variation in multiple traits related to stress resistance in different life stages was measured in both species in flies collected from five localities at different altitudes and thereby with different climatic conditions. Based on microsatellite loci, the populations were not genetically differentiated. However, 18 of the 24 independent traits measured showed significant differentiation among populations of Drosophila buzzatii, but only nine of 25 for Drosophila simulans. This difference in the number of traits might reflect higher habitat specificity and thus higher potential for local adaptation of D. buzzatii than D. simulans. We found clinal variation, as some traits showed significant linear regressions on altitude, but more on altitude cubed.

AB  - Geographically widespread species must cope with environmental differences between habitats. Information concerning geographic variations in response to climate variability is critical because many morphological, life history and physiological traits show variation across space. Reciprocal transplant experiments have shown to be relevant to evaluate the role of phenotypic plasticity and potential local adaptation in ecophysiological responses when coping with environmental variability. In this study, we characterize through reciprocal transplant experiments the reaction norms of morphological, biochemical, physiological and life-history traits between two intertidal populations of the socioeconomically important mussel Mytilus chilensis, inhabiting contrasting local environments (estuarine vs coastal habitats). We found a gradient in phenotypic plasticity with plastic trait responses in metabolic, ingestion and clearance rates, and in HsP(70) gene expression, and some traits with responses more canalized as growth and calcification rates. This emphasizes that responses not only vary across different local populations but also in different traits in M. chilensis, thus it is difficult to establish an overall trend of the responses at integrated organismal level. Moreover, the synergistic interaction of factors such as salinity and carbonate system parameters evaluated make it necessary to study the response at the population level with emphasis on benthic species important in aquaculture. Finally, field studies such as this one are useful for documenting the patterns of traits variation that occur in nature, identifying possible causes of such variation, and generating testable hypotheses for future controlled experiments.

AB  - Common-garden experiments with populations sampled along natural thermal gradients help to reveal local adaptation, disentangle environmental and genetic effects, and ultimately predict, by analogy, future biotic responses to climate change. In this regard, geothermal habitats are useful model systems as they exhibit dramatic changes in soil temperature. The springtail Protaphorura pseudovanderdrifti has apparently coped with such local geothermal warming in Iceland, as this species occurs along a more than half-century-old geothermal gradient in a grassland and persists along a newly emerged temperature gradient in a previously non-geothermal planted spruce forest. We measured thermal reaction norms for development and walking speed and acute cold shock tolerance of P. pseudovanderdrifti originating from the grassland and forest geothermal gradients. Temperature-dependent juvenile development showed little variation among subpopulations from the recently warmed forest, probably due to insufficient evolutionary time, but springtails from the warmed grassland plots had significantly steeper reaction norms than their counterparts from the corresponding unwarmed plot. In contrast, cold tolerance and locomotory activity showed no conclusive clinal pattern despite significant within-habitat variation. There appeared to be significant differences between habitats, as springtails from the forest had more temperature-sensitive developmental rate and locomotory activity, walked faster, and exhibited more variable cold tolerance than grassland springtails did. The planting of a forest, therefore, seems to have exerted a stronger effect on the thermal phenotype of P. pseudovanderdrifti than the emergence of a geothermal gradient. Thus, habitat properties may be no less important in shaping thermal reaction norms than the mean temperature. These local-scale findings suggest that, in addition to warming per se, global transformation of communities may drive the evolution of thermal phenotypes to an extent comparable with the effect of rising environmental temperature.

AB  - The endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis (wMel strain) has been successfully established in several populations of Aedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. The virulent Wolbachia strain wMelPop is known to cause several pathological impacts (increased egg mortality, life shortening, etc.) reducing overall fitness in the mosquito Ae. aegypti. Increased egg mortality could substantially reduce egg banks in areas with a lengthy monsoonal dry season, and be employed to eliminate local populations. We tested this application under semi-field cage conditions. First, we determined that wMelPop infection significantly reduced the survival of desiccation-resistant eggs of the dengue vector Ae. aegypti, with shade and temperature having a significant impact; nearly all wMelPop-infected eggs failed to hatch after 6 and 10 weeks in summer and winter conditions, respectively. In laboratory selection experiments we found that egg desiccation resistance can be increased by selection, and that this effect of wMelPop infection is due to the nuclear background of the host rather than Wolbachia. We then conducted an invasion of wMelPop within a semi-field cage using sustained weekly releases of wMelPop infected mosquitoes, with fixation achieved after 9 weeks. The egg populations wMelPop infected and an uninfected control were then subjected to a simulated prolonged monsoonal dry season (2.5 months) before flooding to induce hatching. The wMelPop infected eggs suffered significantly greater mortality than the controls, with only 0.67% and 4.35% of respective infected and uninfected eggs held in 99% shade hatching after 80 days. These studies suggest that wMelPop could be used to locally eliminate populations of Ae. aegypti that are exposed to prolonged dry conditions, particularly if combined with vector control.

AB  - This paper proposes a new nonlinear model for cascaded hydro-power generation and preventive maintenance scheduling. The reservoir level and the maintenance scheduling are optimized, simultaneously, to minimize the thermal generation complement and to maximize the future water value. To achieve better accuracy, the productivity was modeled considering the head effect. Since the model considers individualized plants, the water flow balance must be taken into account. By means of a transformation, this constraint can be modeled only with the reservoir volume. Also, by means of a simple nonlinear transformation, the maintenance scheduling was modeled as continuous variable, instead of the usual binary models. The maintenance start date is a continuous variable, so, it allows the maintenance to begin within the time period. These simplifications altogether define a compact continuous nonconvex problem. The proposed model was successfully solved by a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm in Brazilian cascades. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alpine environments are particularly susceptible to environmental changes associated with global warming but there is potential for alpine plants to adapt to warming if local adaptation occurs and gene flow allows genotypes adapted to low altitudes to colonize higher altitude sites. Here we examine the adaptive potential of a common alpine grass, Poa hiemata, within the restricted alpine habitat of Australian mountains, across a narrow altitudinal gradient replicated in three areas. Grasses at high altitude sites had shorter leaf lengths and larger circumferences than those at lower sites. Transplant experiments with clonal material and plants grown from seed indicated that these differences were partly genetic, with environmental and genetic factors both contributing to the differences between altitudes. Differences in altitudinal forms were also evident in a common garden experiment. Plants showed a home-site advantage in terms of survival. A fitness analysis indicated that at high altitude sites, selection favored plants with short leaves and larger circumferences, whereas these traits were selected in the opposite direction at the low altitude sites. These findings indicate cogradient selection and potential for both plastic and genotypic shifts in response to climate change in P. hiemata.

AB  - Intralocus sexual conflict (IaSC) occurs when selection at a given locus favors different alleles in males and females, placing a fundamental constraint on adaptation. However, the relative impact of IaSC on adaptation may become reduced in stressful environments that expose conditionally deleterious mutations to selection. The genetic correlation for fitness between males and females (r(MF)) provides a quantification of IaSC across the genome. We compared IaSC at a benign (29 degrees C) and a stressful (36 degrees C) temperature by estimating r(MF)s in two natural populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus using isofemale lines. In one population, we found substantial IaSC under benign conditions signified by a negative r(MF) (-0.51) and, as predicted, a significant reduction of IaSC under stress signified by a reversed and positive r(MF) (0.21). The other population displayed low IaSC at both temperatures (r(MF): 0.38; 0.40). In both populations, isofemale lines harboring alleles beneficial to males but detrimental to females at benign conditions tended to show overall low fitness under stress. These results offer support for low IaSC under stress and suggest that environmentally sensitive and conditionally deleterious alleles that are sexually selected in males mediate changes in IaSC. We discuss implications for adaptive evolution in sexually reproducing populations.

AB  - Shelled pteropods are cosmopolitan, free-swimming organisms of biogeochemical and commercial importance. They are widely used as sentinel species for the overall response of marine ecosystems to environmental stressors associated with climate change and changes in ocean chemistry. However, currently we are unable to project the effects of climate change on shelled pteropods at the population level, due to the missing spatio-temporal characterization of the response of pteropods to environmental stressors, and the limited information on the pteropod life history and life-cycle. In this study, we implement a shelled pteropod Individual-Based Model (IBM), i.e. we simulate a pteropod population as a set of discrete individuals over several generations, life-stages (eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults) and as a function of temperature, food availability, and aragonite saturation state. The model is able to provide an abundance signal that is consistent with the abundance signal measured in the temperate region. In addition, the modeled life-stage progression matches the reported size spectrum across the year, with two major spawning periods in spring and fall, and maturation in March and September. Furthermore, our IBM correctly predicts the abundance maxima of younger, smaller and potentially more susceptible life-stages in spring and winter. Thus, our model provides a tool for advancing our understanding of the response of pteropod populations to future environmental changes.

AB  - Density-dependent habitat selection has been used to predict and explain patterns of abundance of species between habitats. Thermal quality, a density-independent component of habitat suitability, is often the most important factor for habitat selection in ectotherms which comprise the vast majority of animal species. Ectotherms may reach high densities such that individual fitness is reduced in a habitat due to increased competition for finite resources. Therefore, density and thermal quality may present conflicting information about which habitat will provide the highest fitness reward and ectotherm habitat selection may be density-independent. Using ornate tree lizards Urosaurus ornatus at 10 sites each straddling two adjacent habitats (wash and upland), we tested the hypothesis that habitat selection is density-dependent even when thermal quality differs between habitats. We first tested that fitness proxies decline with density in each habitat, indicating density-dependent effects on habitat suitability. We also confirmed that the two habitats vary in suitability (quantified by food abundance and thermal quality). Next, we tested the predictions that habitat selection depends on density with isodar analyses and that fitness proxies are equal in the two habitats within a site. We found that monthly survival rates decreased with density, and that the wash habitat had more prey and higher thermal quality than the upland habitat. Lizards preferred the habitat with more food and higher thermal quality, lizard densities in the two habitats were positively correlated, and fitness proxies of lizards did not differ between habitats. These patterns are consistent with density-dependent habitat selection, despite differences in thermal quality between habitats. We expect that density-dependent habitat selection is widespread in terrestrial ectotherms when densities are high and temperatures are close to their optimal performance range. In areas where thermal quality is low, however, we expect that depletable resources, such as food, become less limiting because assimilating resources is more difficult.

AB  - Niger (Guizotia abyssinica) is an economically important edible oilseed crop with a wide variation in seed oil content and fatty acid composition between populations. This study sought to determine the extent of this variation among the Ethiopian niger populations and to analyze the inheritance of high oil and oleic acid (C18:1) contents. The analysis of 153 niger populations revealed a twofold variation in seed oil content (27-56%) with 7% of the populations having more than 50% oil. These high oil content populations came from different regions and a wide altitudinal range (1400-2590 m asl). There was also a high variation in oleic acid content between populations (3.3-31.1%). Interestingly, the populations with more than 13% oleic acid were entirely collected from elevations of less than 2000 m asl. Breeding of selected genotypes for two generations revealed a highly significant positive correlation between the parents and their progenies both in oil and oleic acid contents. The study also suggests a significant contribution of environmental factors to the variation in both traits suggesting a moderate heritability. We conclude that there is a highly significant variation both in oil content and fatty acid composition in the niger populations that can be used for its improvement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biological features of Diaeretiella rapae (Mcintosh), an aphid parasitoid, are conditioned by temperature and host. However, studies of host quality changes due to temperature adaptability have not been performed previously. Therefore, this study evaluated the adaptability of Lipaphis pseudobrassicae (Davis) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) to high temperature, high temperature effect on their quality as hosts for D. rapae, and on parasitoid's thermal threshold. Aphid development, survivorship, fecundity, and longevity were compared at 19 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Host quality in different temperatures was determined through evaluation of parasitoid biology. Thermal threshold of D. rapae was determined using development time data. At 28 degrees C, development time, rate of immature survival, and total fecundity rates were greater in L. pseudobrassicae than in M. persicae. Development time of D. rapae in L. pseudobrassicae was shorter than that in M. persicae at 28 degrees C and 31 degrees C for females and at 31 degrees C for males. The thermal threshold of D. rapae was 6.38 degrees C and 3.33 degrees C for females and 4.45 degrees C and 3.63 degrees C for males developed on L. pseudobrassicae and M. persicae, respectively. Diaeretiella rapae size gain was greater in L. pseudobrassicae than that in M. persicae at 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Lipaphis pseudobrassicae showed better adaptation than M. persicae to elevated temperatures, which resulted in a better quality host for D. rapae at temperatures of 28 degrees C and 31 degrees C and a higher lower thermal threshold when the parasitoid developed within L. pseudobrassicae. The host's adaptation to high temperatures is a determinant of host quality for the parasitoid at that same climatic condition.

AB  - As part of the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Power Electronics and Electric Machines program area, the DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is currently leading a national effort to develop next-generation cooling technologies for hybrid vehicle electronics. Spray cooling has been identified as a potential solution that can dissipate 150-200 W/cm(2) while maintaining the chip temperature below 125 degrees C. This paper explores the viability and implementation of this cooling scheme. First, commercial coolants are assessed for their suitability to this application in terms of thermal, environmental, and safety concerns and material compatibility. In this assessment, HFE-7100 is identified as the optimum coolant in all performance categories. Next, spray models are used to determine the HFE-7100 spray conditions that meet such stringent heat dissipation requirements. These findings are verified experimentally, demonstrating that spray cooling is a viable thermal management solution for hybrid vehicle electronics.

AB  - Nine wild Iberian provenances of Castanea sativa Mill. grouped in two gene pools, North Iberian Peninsula and Mediterranean, were evaluated for several adaptive traits in two provenance-progeny trials with the aim of evaluating the role of natural selection in shaping adaptive variation and increasing our understanding of the genetic structure of this species, as well as reporting complete information on the genetic variation among and within the studied populations. An annual growth rhythm experiment was evaluated during the first 3 years after establishment for phenology, growth, stem form and survival, and a periodic drought-stress experiment was evaluated for dry weight, growth, survival and other related drought traits in both well-watered and drought-stress treatments. The high genetic variability reported in both trials is largely due to the genetic variation among populations. The significant differences reported between quantitative genetic and neutral marker differentiation indicated the local adaptation of these populations through directional selection, mainly for phenology, growth and biomass allocation. A clinal variation among populations was determined through correlations of phenology with latitude and xerothermic index of the provenances, showing that central and southern Mediterranean populations had earlier phenology than northern populations and that drought played a relevant role in this differentiation. The significant correlation between phenological traits and the ancestry values in the Mediterranean gene pool supported the different pattern of behavior between both gene pools and also indicated the existence of two ecotypes: xeric and mesophytic ecotypes, corresponding to Mediterranean and North Iberian gene pools, respectively. The results obtained in the drought-stress experiment confirmed that, in general terms, xeric populations showed a greater adaptability to drought, with more developed root systems and higher survival than northern populations. Moreover, the genetic variability observed within populations indicated the potential response capacity of Iberian C. sativa populations to undergo fast adaptive evolution.

AB  - Induction heating is one of the most widely used methods for heat treatment of steel. However, due to the complex interplay of electromagnetic, thermal and metallurgic phenomena, it is very demanding to model it numerically. The aim of our study was to determine the optimal coil position and the optimal amplitude and frequency of the electric current to attain the desired heat profile (temperature of the outer layer of the heated steel object should reach 450 - 500 K) by using the genetic algorithm optimization method in combination with finite-element numerical modelling. The object of our study was a non-ferromagnetic steel cylinder (Fig. 1) surrounded by a copper coil consisting of four loops. We calculated the magnetic field (Eq. 4), which causes joule heating (Eq. 6), and redistribution of the temperature throughout the material. In our calculations we took into account the steels temperature-dependent material properties (Eqs. 1, 2 and 3). We considered the following optimization parameter constraints: position of the single-coil loop and amplitude and frequency of the electric current through the coil (Fig. 2). Solutions were selected according to their fitness (Eq. 9) depending on the accuracy of heating and the amount of the used energy. We compared our optimized solution with an educated guess and the actual global optimum. The optimized solution and the global optimum had very comparable temperature profiles and almost identical fitness function values due to a better selection of the electric current parameters compared to the educated guess (Table 3). The genetic algorithm was terminated after 30 generations, when the fitness of the top solution usually converged close to the global optimum (Fig. 4). One of the advantages of our approach is the adaptability of the algorithm enabling its easy use in various heat treatment applications. Even though the optimized solution is not identical to the global optimum, it is always close to it and it can also be used as an initial approximation for other more precise deterministic optimization methods. We demonstrated that our approach assures precise heating of the steel cylinder at low-energy consumption and high time-efficiency. We believe these advantages will become even more pronounced when the algorithm is used on more complex induction heating problems.

AB  - Climate change plays a key role in the development and survival of oviparous ectotherms such as sea turtles. Higher environmental temperatures are expected to lead to increased production of female hatchlings and potential feminization of many populations, as well as reduced hatching success and hatchling fitness. We investigated how different sand temperatures affect sea turtle embryo mortality, hatchling phenotype, and hatchling predation during their crawl to the sea. The study was conducted in Cabo Verde, the only rookery of the endangered loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) in the Eastern Atlantic. During three consecutive seasons (2015-2017), 240 loggerhead clutches were exposed to three different incubation temperature regimes created by different sand colours. The warm treatment (mean = 32.3 degrees C +/- 0.5) killed 33% more embryos than the cold treatment (mean = 29.7 degrees C +/- 0.6). Hatchlings from the warm treatment were mostly females, smaller in size, and had lower performance. Hatchling predation by ghost crabs during seaward transit was higher for hatchlings incubated in the warm treatment. Combining embryo mortality and hatchling predation, the rate of female hatchling arrival at the sea was more than twice as high in the cold treatment (34.4 females per 100 eggs) than in the warm treatment (16.0 females per 100 eggs). This increase in mortality caused by warmer incubation temperatures may cancel any potential benefit of a female-biased sex ratio. Conservation planners should consider behavioural adaptations and the potential dispersal of the nesting areas to colder areas to increase resilience of loggerhead turtles to climate change.

AB  - Metabolic resistance threatens the sustainability of pyrethroid-based malaria control interventions. Elucidating the fitness cost and potential reversal of metabolic resistance is crucial to design suitable resistance management strategies. Here, we deciphered the fitness cost associated with the CYP6P9a (P450-mediated metabolic resistance) in the major African malaria vector Anopheles funestus. Reciprocal crosses were performed between a pyrethroid susceptible (FANG) and resistant (FUMOZ-R) laboratory strains and the hybrid strains showed intermediate resistance. Genotyping the CYP6P9a-R resistance allele in oviposited females revealed that CYP6P9a negatively impacts the fecundity as homozygote susceptible mosquitoes (CYP6P9a-SS) lay more eggs than heterozygote (OR = 2.04: P = 0.01) and homozygote resistant mosquitoes. CYP6P9a also imposes a significant fitness cost on the larval development as homozygote resistant larvae (CYP6P9a-RR) developed significantly slower than heterozygote and homozygote susceptible mosquitoes (chi(2) = 11.2; P = 0.0008). This fitness cost was further supported by the late pupation of homozygote resistant than susceptible mosquitoes (OR = 2.50; P < 0.01). However, CYP6P9a does not impact the longevity as no difference was observed in the life span of mosquitoes with different genotypes (chi(2) = 1.6; P = 0.9). In this hybrid strain, a significant decrease of the resistant CYP6P9a-RR genotype was observed after ten generations (chi(2) = 6.6; P = 0.01) suggesting a reversal of P450-based resistance in the absence of selection. This study shows that the P450-mediated metabolic resistance imposes a high fitness cost in malaria vectors supporting that a resistance management strategy based on rotation could help mitigate the impact of such resistance.

AB  - Solar steam generation with thermal localization was recently proposed for highly efficient solar-thermal desalination. However, to achieve high steam productivity with long term stability remains a critical challenge due to salt accumulation at the evaporation surface. Here, we designed a T-shaped synthetic tree that could simultaneously achieve high steam productivity and salt collection with the structure characteristics of interfacial thermal evaporation, ambient energy harvesting and edge-preferential crystallizing. Under 1sun, the synthetic tree exhibited a steady water evaporation rate of 2.03kgm(-2) hours(-1) over 60hours, achieving solar thermal efficiency of 75%. Salt was continuously rejected at the edge of the evaporator with a steady collection rate of 59.879gm(-2) hours(-1), which did not affect water evaporation. This new design principle to simultaneously harvest water and salt provides a new avenue for solar energy utilization.

AB  - To forecast the responses of species to future climate change, an understanding of the ability of species to adapt to long-term shifts in temperature is crucial. We present a review on evolutionary adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of temperature-related traits in terrestrial invertebrates. The evidence for adaptive evolution in melanization is good, but we caution that genetic determination needs to be tested in each individual species, and complex genetic correlations may exist. For phenological traits allochronic data sets provide powerful means to track climate-induced changes; however, rarely are responses deconstructed into evolutionary and plastic responses. Laboratory studies suggest climate change responses in these traits will be driven by both. For stress resistance, the evidence for shifts in traits is poor. Studies leaning heavily on Drosophila have demonstrated potential limits to evolutionary responses in desiccation and heat resistance. Quantifying the capacity for these species to respond plastically and extending this work to other taxa will be an important next step. We also note that, although not strictly speaking a species trait, the response of endosymbionts to heat stress requires further study. Finally, while clearly genetic, and possibly adaptive, the anonymous nature of latitudinal shifts in clines of genetic markers in Drosophila prevents further interpretation.

AB  - Direct and correlated responses in selection for heat-shock resistance in adult and in larval Drosophila buzzatii were studied. Two lines were artificially selected for higher survival to heat stress as adults, and two other lines were reared under a fluctuating thermal environment as larvae, 35 degrees C for 6 h and 25 degrees C for 18 h, to ''naturally'' select for higher resistance as larvae. The latter two lines were duplicated after nine generations to yield additional lines to be ''naturally'' selected as larvae at a higher temperature, 38.2 degrees C for 6 h. Control lines were maintained separately for the adult and larval selection lines. A significant direct response to selection was found for the adult selection lines. However, larvae of these adult selection lines were no more heat resistant than were larvae of the control lines. One of the two larval selection lines increased significantly in heat resistance as larvae. However adult heat resistance was similar for lines selected as larvae and the corresponding control lines maintained at 25 degrees C. Changes in developmental time accompanied changes in survival after stress in both sets of lines selected for increased heat resistance.

AB  - A mathematical model was recently developed to simulate the calcination process of regular petroleum coke suitable for aluminum industry applications. The model is made of 14 ordinary differential equations describing energy and mass conservation in the gas and in the coke bed, and complemented by correlations and algebraic equations. It calculates temperature and concentration profiles in the kiln, and also yields other information important to kiln operation, such as calcined coke recovery factor and coke loss through the generation of dust. In this paper it is demonstrated that the model is an efficient tool for the optimization of kiln operation. The model is used to study the effect of key control variables upon kiln operation and productivity. Further, it is shown that higher kiln productivity may be obtained with optimized kiln control and without loss of satisfactory kiln operating condition.

AB  - Five Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains and one nonpathogenic E. coli strain were used. All strains were cultured in brain heart infusion broth and were inoculated in 16-well disposable module cassettes of a Bactometer impedance system. Two initial concentrations were obtained in the wells: 1.37 x 10(3) and 1.36 x 10(5) CFU/ml. The impedance measurements were monitored for 72 h at 5, 10, or 15 degrees C, 48 h at 20 degrees C, and 24 h at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or 55 degrees C. The lag time and the generation time of each culture were calculated from the detection time data. The coefficients of variation between the strains' growth parameters were low (0.009 to 0.105 for generation time and 0.074 to 0.475 for lag time). An F test showed no significant differences between strains at 5 or 1% confidence levels.

AB  - Within the context of ongoing environmental changes, the life history of diadromous fish represents a real potential for exploring and colonizing new environments due to high potential dispersal abilities. The use of dynamic approaches to assess how these species will respond to climate change is a challenging issue and mechanistic models able to incorporate biological and evolutionary processes are a promising tool. To this end we developed an individual-based model, called GR3D (Global Repositioning Dynamics for Diadromous fish Distribution), combining climatic requirements and population dynamics with an explicit dispersal process to evaluate potential evolution of their distribution area in the context of climatic change. This paper describes thoroughly the model structure and presents an exploratory test case where the repositioning of a virtual allis shad (Alosa alosa L.) population between two river catchments under a scenario of temperature increase was assessed. The global sensitivity analysis showed that landscape structure and parameters related to sea lifespan and to survival at sea were crucial to determine the success of colonization. These results were consistent with the ecology of this species. The integration of climatic factors directly into the processes and the explicit dispersal process make GR3D an original and relevant tool to assess the repositioning dynamics and persistence of diadromous fish facing climate change.

AB  - Reproduction and related traits such as mating success are strongly affected by thermal stress. We tested direct and correlated responses to artificial selection in replicated lines of Drosophila buzzatii that were selected for mating success at high temperature. Knockdown resistance at high temperature (KRHT) and chill-coma recovery (CCR) were tested as correlated selection responses. Virgin flies were allowed to mate for four hours at 33 degrees C in three replicated lines (S lines) to obtain the selected flies and then returned at 25 degrees C to lay eggs. Other three replicated lines were maintained at 25 degrees C without any selection as control (C lines). After 15 selection generations, KRHT and CCR were measured. Both traits were assessed in flies that did not receive any hardening pretreatments as well as in flies that were either heat or cold hardened. Thermotolerance traits showed significant correlated responses with higher KRHT in S than in C lines, both with a heat-hardening pretreatment and without a heat-hardening pretreatment. CCR time was longer in S than in C lines both with a cold-hardening pretreatment and without a cold-hardening pretreatment. Hardening treatments improved both KRHT and CCR in all cases excepting KRHT in C lines. Overall, KRHT and CCR showed an antagonistic pattern of correlated responses to our selection regime, suggesting either pleiotropy or tightly linked trait-specific genes partially affecting KRHT and CCR.

AB  - We used experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster, which had either been subdivided (metapopulations) or kept undivided for 40 generations, to study the consequences of population subdivision for the tolerance and adaptive response after six generations of exposure to novel environmental factors (high temperature, medium with ethanol or salt added) for traits with different genetic architectures. In this setup, we attempted to separate the effects of the loss of fitness due to inbreeding (i.e., the survival upon first exposure to stress) from the loss of adaptive potential due to the lack of genetic variation. To place our experimental results in a more general perspective, we used individual-based simulations combining different options of levels of gene flow, intensity of selection and genetic architecture to derive quantitative hypotheses of the effects of these factors on the adaptive response to stress. We observed that population subdivision resulted in substantial inter-deme variation in tolerance due to redistribution of genetic variation from within demes to among demes. In line with the simulation results, the adaptive response was generally lower in the subdivided than in the undivided populations, particularly so for high temperature. We observed pronounced differences between stress factors that are likely related to the different genetic architectures involved in resistance to these factors. From a conservation genetics viewpoint, our results have two important implications: (i) Long-term fragmentation in combination with restricted gene flow will limit the adaptive potential of individual subpopulations because adaptive variation will become distributed among populations rather than within populations. (ii) The genetic architecture of the trait(s) under selection is of great significance to understand the possible responses to novel stresses that may be expected.

AB  - The target of our study is the Monarch Butterfly, which is known for its multi-generational migration behavior: it migrates between southern Canada and Mexico over the course of one year within three to four generations. We approach this subject by using an evolutionary simulation that is an ecosystem consisting of artificial agents and five areas. We focus on the metamorphosis and the reproductive diapause, which are the ecological characteristics of the Monarch, and we design a model of agent which has the state as its inner parameter. We simulate under the environmental condition that the average annual temperature rises every year, which is modeled on the current global temperature rise. Our agents emerge the migration behavior similar to the multi-generational migration behavior of the actual Monarch. The migration process of the agents and their genetic factors are discussed, and our proposed model and the previous model are compared.

TI  - Entropy generation theory for characterizing the freezing and thawing injury of biological materials
T2  - FORSCHUNG IM INGENIEURWESEN-ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - OPTIMIZATION
AB  - As an important approach for long-term preservation of biological material, cryopreservation has been widely studied and applied in clinics. However, one of the most critical issues involved-the injury of biology material induced during freezing and thawing process still remains to be incompletely answered due to complexity of the problem itself. In this paper, we proposed for the first time to interpret the freezing or thermal injury by using the irreversible thermodynamics theory which is generalized in concept and has wide applicability. Comprehensive entropy generation analysis was performed on several typical freezing/thawing processes of biological tissues subject to cryopreservation. Particularly, variation of entropy generation rate due to injury induced change of thermal properties of the biological materials was investigated. Several useful indexes were suggested to quantify the freezing injury or viability of the biological material, through a combination with certain specific measurements. This study may possibly open a new theoretical strategy for evaluating the final output of either cryobiology or hyperthermia practices.

AB  - Acclimation increases tolerance to stress in individuals but is assumed to contribute fitness costs when the stressor is absent, though data supporting this widely held claim are sparse. Therefore, using clonal (i.e., genetically identical) cultures of Daphnia pulex, we isolated the contributions of acclimation to the regulation of the metal response gene, metallothionein 1 (MT1), and defined the reproductive benefits and costs of cadmium (Cd)-acclimation. Daphnia pulex were exposed for 50 parthenogenetic generations to environmentally realistic levels (1 mu g Cd/L), and tolerance to Cd and other metals assessed during this period via standard toxicity tests. These tests revealed (1) increased tolerance to Cd compared to genetically identical nonacclimated cultures, (2) fitness costs in Cd-acclimated Daphnia when Cd was removed, and (3) cross-tolerance of Cd-acclimated Daphnia to zinc and silver, but not arsenic, thereby defining a functional role for metallothionein. Indeed, Cd-acclimated clones had significantly higher expression of MT1 mRNA than nonacclimated clones, when Cd exposed. Both the enhanced induction of MT1 and tolerant phenotype were rapidly lost when Cd was removed (1-2 generations), which is further evidence of acclimation costs. These findings provide evidence for the widely held view that acclimation is costly and are important for investigating evolutionary principles of genetic assimilation and the survival mechanisms of natural populations that face changing environments.

AB  - Findings on climate change influence on plant pathogens are often inconsistent and context dependent. Knowledge of pathogens affecting agricultural crops and natural plant communities remains fragmented along disciplinary lines. By broadening the perspective beyond agriculture, this review integrates cross-disciplinary knowledge to show that at scales relevant to climate change, accelerated evolution and changing geographic distribution will be the main implications for pathogens. New races may evolve rapidly under elevated temperature and CO2, as evolutionary forces act on massive pathogen populations boosted by a combination of increased fecundity and infection cycles under favourable microclimate within enlarged canopy. Changing geographic distribution will bring together diverse lineages/genotypes that do not share common ecological niche, potentially increasing pathogen diversity. However, the uncertainty of model predictions and a lack of synthesis of fragmented knowledge remain as major deficiencies in knowledge. The review contends that the failure to consider scale and human intervention through new technology are major sources of uncertainty. Recognizing that improved biophysical models alone will not reduce uncertainty, it proposes a generic framework to increase focus and outlines ways to integrate biophysical elements and technology change with human intervention scenarios to minimize uncertainty. To synthesize knowledge of pathogen biology and life history, the review borrows the concept of fitness' from population biology as a comprehensive measure of pathogen strengths and vulnerabilities, and explores the implications of pathogen mode of nutrition to fitness and its interactions with plants suffering chronic abiotic stress under climate change. Current and future disease management options can then be judged for their ability to impair pathogenic and saprophytic fitness. The review pinpoints improving confidence in model prediction by minimizing uncertainty, developing management strategies to reduce overall pathogen fitness, and finding new sources of data to trawl for climate signatures on pathogens as important challenges for future research.

AB  - Estimating the heritability and genotype by environment (GxE) interactions of performance-related traits (e.g., growth, survival, reproduction) under future ocean conditions is necessary for inferring the adaptive potential of marine species to climate change. To date, no studies have used quantitative genetics techniques to test the adaptive potential of large pelagic fishes to the combined effects of elevated water temperature and ocean acidification. We used an experimental approach to test for heritability and GxE interactions in morphological traits of juvenile yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi, under current-day and predicted future ocean conditions. We also tracked the fate of genetic diversity among treatments over the experimental period to test for selection favoring some genotypes over others under elevated temperature and CO2. Specifically, we reared kingfish to 21 days post hatching (dph) in a fully crossed 2 x 2 experimental design comprising current-day average summer temperature (21 degrees C) and seawater pCO(2) (500 mu atm CO2) and elevated temperature (25 degrees C) and seawater pCO(2) (1,000 mu atm CO2). We sampled larvae and juveniles at 1, 11, and 21 dph and identified family of origin of each fish (1,942 in total) by DNA parentage analysis. The animal model was used to estimate heritability of morphological traits and test for GxE interactions among the experimental treatments at 21 dph. Elevated temperature, but not elevated CO2 affected all morphological traits. Weight, length and other morphological traits in juvenile yellowtail kingfish exhibited low but significant heritability under current day and elevated temperature. However, there were no measurable GxE interactions in morphological traits between the two temperature treatments at 21 dph. Similarly, there was no detectable change in any of the measures of genetic diversity over the duration of the experiment. Nonetheless, one family exhibited differential survivorship between temperatures, declining in relative abundance between 1 and 21 dph at 21 degrees C, but increasing in relative abundance between 1 and 21 dph at 25 degrees C. This suggests that this family line could perform better under future warming than in current-day conditions. Our results provide the first preliminary evidence of the adaptive potential of a large pelagic fisheries species to future ocean conditions.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in physiological traits and the standard metabolic rate (SMR) is common in widely distributed ectotherms since populations at contrasting latitudes experiences different thermal conditions. The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) states that populations at higher latitudes presents higher acclimation capacity than those at lower latitudes, given the wider range of climatic variability they experience. The endemic four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul is widely distributed in Chile. We examined the variation in maximum and minimum critical temperatures (CTmax and CTmin), preferred temperature (T-pref), SMR and their acclimatory capacity in two populations from the northern and center of its distribution. All the traits are higher in the warmer population. The capacity for acclimation varies between traits and, with the exception of CTmax and T-pret, it is similar between populations. This pattern could be explained by the higher daily thermal variability in desert environments, that increases plasticity to the levels found in the high latitude population. However, we found low acclimatory capacity in all physiological traits, of only about 3% for CTmin) 10% for CTmax and T-pref and 1% for SMR. Thus, despite the fact that Pleurodema thaul possess some ability to adjust thermal tolerances in response to changing thermal conditions, this acclimatory capacity seems to be unable to prevent substantial buffering when body temperatures rise. The low acclimatory capacity found for P. thaul suggests that this species use behavioral rather than physiological adjustments to compensate for environmental variation, by exploiting available micro-environments with more stable thermal conditions.

AB  - Ocean acidification, a decrease in the pH in marine waters associated with rising atmospheric CO2 levels, is a serious threat to marine ecosystems. In this paper, we determine the effects of long-term exposure to near-future levels of ocean acidification on the growth, condition, calcification, and survival of juvenile red king crabs, Paralithodes camtschaticus, and Tanner crabs, Chionoecetes bairdi. Juveniles were reared in individual containers for nearly 200 days in flowing control (pH 8.0), pH 7.8, and pH 7.5 seawater at ambient temperatures (range 4.4-11.9 degrees C). In both species, survival decreased with pH, with 100% mortality of red king crabs occurring after 95 days in pH 7.5 water. Though the morphology of neither species was affected by acidification, both species grew slower in acidified water. At the end of the experiment, calcium concentration was measured in each crab and the dry mass and condition index of each crab were determined. Ocean acidification did not affect the calcium content of red king crab but did decrease the condition index, while it had the opposite effect on Tanner crabs, decreasing calcium content but leaving the condition index unchanged. This suggests that red king crab may be able to maintain calcification rates, but at a high energetic cost. The decrease in survival and growth of each species is likely to have a serious negative effect on their populations in the absence of evolutionary adaptation or acclimatization over the coming decades.

AB  - We found that variation in temperature and humidity significantly affected mortality rates and population dynamics of the spittlebug Deois flavopicta Stal by monitoring cohorts of diapausing eggs and nymphs for three generations. Cohorts of quiescent eggs, when exposed to increasing periods of high moisture (free water), produced higher proportions of eggs resuming embryonic development in laboratory experiments. The accumulated number of eggs resuming development as a function of (lays of exposure to moist conditions was modeled using a 0 distribution. Periods of drought and high temperatures after the beginning of postdiapause development increased embryonic and nymphal mortality. Mortality was modeled with a linear function, and in combination with the development model allowed the simulation of varying mortality rates in the newly emerged nymphal population. Comparisons with field data demonstrated a close fit to the observed and expected proportion of nymphs hatching daily. By accurately simulating natural mortality, hatching distribution and population dynamics, the model promises to be useful for managing the spittlebug in the field.

AB  - Environmental toxicants such as insecticides are able to provoke epigenetic alterations which can be inherited to future generations. The aim of the current study was to assess whether the insecticide Trebon lop (containing the active ingredient etofenprox) causes multigenerational and/or transgenerational effects on the egg traits of the collembolan Folsomia candida. The parent generation was kept in soil treated with three concentrations of the insecticide. The hatched offspring from each treatment were divided into two groups and were treated in the same manner as their parents (multigenerational effect), or remained untreated (transgenerational effect). The parents reacted with smaller eggs to the insecticide in a concentration dependent manner. Both multigenerational and transgenerational effects were detected in the offspring generations. While neither the number of eggs nor the ratios of the egg diameters (shortest/longest diameter) changed, the egg size increased as the Trebon lop concentration increased. This is an indication that parents living under insecticide stress transmit this information to their offspring, who react with higher quality egg production. Such alterations in egg traits may have important consequences on the F. candida population dynamic.

AB  - The ability of native fish to establish self-sustaining populations when reintroduced to vacant habitats is variable. We evaluated factors that potentially affect the reintroduction success of juvenile Colorado River Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus that were reintroduced to an isolated watershed and were experiencing suboptimal survival and recruitment. We conducted a 3-year mark-recapture study to model annual apparent survival probability as it related to (1) different ex situ rearing strategies and (2) initial release among different habitat types. The use of PIT tags also enabled the quantification of loss via emigration. Apparent survival was highest for small fish that were minimally exposed to ex situ rearing conditions, stocked in small, headwater stream reaches. However, maximum estimates of apparent survival remained low (<= 0.38 +/- 0.05 [estimate +/- SE]) regardless of rearing treatment, stocking location, or interactive effects between covariates. Emigration of stocked fish (<1%) from the study area did not appear to limit their establishment. Our results suggest that variation in stocking and rearing strategy may have some effect on translocation success and the interaction between rearing and stocking strategy highlights the importance of considering the life history stage of stocked individuals when identifying stocking sites. Consistently low annual survival values may be indicative of a larger issue, requiring in-depth evaluation of adaptive potential within our brood source and other factors that potentially limit population persistence.

AB  - Concerns about climate change and other issues mostly related to the reduction of fossil fuel usage have increased the demand for renewable energy sources. The possibility of using lignocellulosic biomass for energy generation is gaining interest in many countries worldwide. The current paper presents the analysis of physicochemical characteristics of nine lignocellulosic biomasses: five types of eucalyptus wood chips, sugar cane bagasse, elephant grass, bamboo, and coconut husk. Selection of a thermal conversion technology depends on the knowledge of important biomass characteristics in relation to thermal conversion: density and productivity, proximate and ultimate analysis, heating value, ash and polysaccharides composition, and thermogravimetric analysis. With regard to the annual energy potential and density, it was suggested that Eucalyptus urophylla (Flores IF) x E. urophylla (Timor) and bamboo have the greatest potential for energy application, which reduces transport and storage costs. Moreover, the eucalyptus has desirable characteristics in thermal conversion processes: low ash content that results in lesser damage to the equipment and low content of sulfur and nitrogen that leads to better environmental performance and product quality. The obtained information could be used as a basis for a more comprehensive database of biomass properties that will help to evaluate various biomasses with respect to the renewable energy potential.

AB  - Species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are more vulnerable to climate change than species with genetically based sex determination because an increase in average environmental temperature could lead to biased offspring sex ratios. In TSD species, the relationship between sex ratio and constant incubation temperature is characterized by two parameters: the pivotal temperature (T-piv) and the transitional range of temperature (TRT) that produces both sexes. Species with variation in either of these parameters should have more potential to adapt to new climatic conditions, therefore putting them at lower risk to global warming. In this study, we incubated eggs of the turtle Podocnemis lewyana (Testudines: Podocnemididae) from two geographically isolated populations (Magdalena and Sinu rivers) under controlled microclimatic conditions to corroborate the TSD pattern previously reported for this species and to estimate the degree of inter-and intrapopulation variation in T-piv and TRT. We used these estimates, together with information found in the literature on other life history traits of P. lewyana, to evaluate its adaptive potential or vulnerability to climate change. We found interpopulation variation in TRT and intrapopulation variation in T-piv. This latter parameter exhibited a high broad-sense heritability, demonstrating this species' potential to adapt to climate change; however, when considering the narrow TRT found in this study, the species' equatorial distribution and related adaptations to relatively more stable climates, its fragmented populations and low vagility that prevent gene flow, and its low genetic variability, we concluded that the ability of P. lewyana to adapt to climate change is limited.

AB  - Decapod crustaceans have repeatedly colonised brackish, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. Many decapods that inhabit brackish and freshwater habitats export larvae into estuarine and coastal areas where conditions for larval development may be better. In this study, we assessed the starvation resistance, biochemical composition and respiration rate during larval development of the brackish-water palaemonine shrimp, Palaemonetes varians, and the effects of temperature on these factors. Our results demonstrate that P. varians is highly resistant to starvation and may be considered facultative lecithotrophic in its first and second larval instars, and planktotrophic from its third instar. This high starvation resistance is associated with a relatively large size, high carbon content (similar to 45%) and C:N ratio (similar to 4.2), and visible yolk reserves at hatching. These energy reserves are interpreted as an adaptation to the exportation of larvae from peripheral adult environments into mid-and lower estuarine waters. Respiration rates varied with the moult cycle and were similar between fed and unfed larvae, suggesting that starved larvae do not suppress their metabolism as an energy-saving strategy. Despite higher respiration rates at higher temperatures, energy loss throughout development (estimated from respiration rates) increased with decreasing temperature, whilst larval growth and development rates increased with increasing temperature. High energy reserves at hatching, as within P. varians, is an important life history adaptation in the colonisation of brackish and fresh water, initially enabling the exportation of larvae from adult environments and eventually enabling lecithotrophy and direct development.

AB  - Age is known to have a large effect upon fertility and survival. Here we study the impact of maternal and grandmaternal age on wing size and developmental instability (DI) in offspring using a parthenogenetic strain of Drosophila mercatorum. This enabled us to cancel out any genetic variance between individuals. The mean centroid size of the wings was estimated in offspring from four maternal/grandmaternal age groups. Further, DI was calculated by measuring phenotypic variability and correcting this index for the bias produced by the environmental variability. The offspring developed from eggs laid by mothers belonging to four different age groups with young (Y) or old (O) mothers and grandmothers. The age groups are: YY, YO, OY and OO, with the first letter referring to the age of the grandmother and the second letter to the age of the mother. We consider flies between three to six days of age as young and flies between 15 and 18 days of age as old. We found that environmental variability was present in this study and therefore the correction for its bias on phenotypic variability was shown to be necessary for a correct interpretation of the results. DI displayed, for most of the traits investigated, a significantly higher level in the OY and OO age groups, as compared to the YY and YO age groups. The mean centroid size of the wings were in almost all cases significantly different among the age groups with the highest mean value in the OY group for all traits. This investigation shows that offspring are affected by maternal age and that this effect can be transmitted maternally across more than one generation.

AB  - It remains to be determined experimentally whether increasing fitness is related to positive selection, while stationary fitness is related to neutral evolution. Long-term laboratory evolution in Escherichia coli was performed under conditions of thermal stress under defined laboratory conditions. The complete cell growth data showed common continuous fitness recovery to every 2uC or 4 degrees C stepwise temperature upshift, finally resulting in an evolved E. coli strain with an improved upper temperature limit as high as 45.9 degrees C after 523 days of serial transfer, equivalent to 7,560 generations, in minimal medium. Two-phase fitness dynamics, a rapid growth recovery phase followed by a gradual increasing growth phase, was clearly observed at diverse temperatures throughout the entire evolutionary process. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed the transition from positive to neutral in mutation fixation, accompanied with a considerable escalation of spontaneous substitution rate in the late fitness recovery phase. It suggested that continually increasing fitness not always resulted in the reduction of genetic diversity due to the sequential takeovers by fit mutants, but caused the accumulation of a considerable number of mutations that facilitated the neutral evolution.

AB  - Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were mapped for longevity and fecundity at two temperatures, 20 and 30 degrees C, in two sets of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) highly differing in thermotolerance. Early fecundity (EF) and longevity showed a negative association between temperatures. For instance, longevity was higher and fecundity was lower in the RIL panel showing higher life span at 30 degrees C. One X-linked QTL (7B3-12E) co-localized for longevity and EF at 20 degrees C, with one QTL allele showing a positive additive effect on longevity and a negative effect on EF. The across-RIL genetic correlation between longevity and EF was not significant within each temperature, and most QTL that affect life span have no effect on EF at each temperature. EF and longevity can mostly be genetically uncoupled in the thermotolerance-divergent RIL within each temperature as opposed to between temperatures. QTL were mostly temperature specific, although some trait-specific QTL showed possible antagonistic effects between temperatures.

AB  - Spodoptera exigua is a secondary target pest of Bt cotton commercialized in China. With the continuous adoption of Bt cotton, populations of S. exigua have gradually increased. However, the cold tolerance ability of Bt-resistant S. exigua and the effect of continuous Bt diet on anti-cold materials are unknown. In our study, it was found that Bt-resistant S. exigua (Bt10) developed better with shorter larval and pupal duration and higher pupation rate compared to CM at the suboptimal low temperature. The supercooling points and freezing points of the Bt-resistant S. exigua strain were determined, and body water content and anti-cold materials such as total sugar, trehalose and glycogen, glycerol and fat were examined to explore the effect of Bt toxin on overwintering and on population increase. The results showed that the supercooling point and the freezing point of the Bt-resistant S. exigua pupae were both significantly lower than that of the Bt-susceptible strain. No difference was found in the body water content of pupae and adults between the two strains. Total sugar content of the Bt-resistant strain at both the pupal and adult stages was higher than that of the susceptible strain at the corresponding stages, and glycogen content of the Bt-resistant strain at the larval stage was higher than that of the susceptible larval S. exigua. Fat content of the Bt-resistant larvae, pupae and adults was for each higher than that of the susceptible strain, but the difference was not significant except for that of the 3rd instar larvae. Glycerol content of the Bt-resistant strain at larval, pupal and adult stages was for each higher than that of the corresponding life stages of the susceptible strain. It can be seen that more glycerol was accumulated in Bt-resistant S. exigua. The results indicate that Bt-resistant S. exigua has better cold tolerance. The contents of the anti-freeze substances of progeny, especially glycerol, were increased after previous generations were continuously fed on Bt protein, which means that the Bt-resistant secondary target pests could more easily overcome the overwinter season and become a source of crop damage the following year.

AB  - A case study for a proposed concentrating solar power (CSP) integration into an existing Californian brewery is highlighted. Using the System Advisor Model (SAM), the modelled annual thermal yield from the 1 MWth solar field (SF) was approximately 2,636 MWh(th). The economics considered the viability of the project where different variables such as the installed SF cost were changed to determine the effect on the Net Present Value (NPV) and payback period. With a 15-year project life, changing the tax rate from 35% to 21% (which occurred in 2018), flips the Base Case from economically viable with an NPV > 0 (i.e. +$9k), to economically unattractive, i.e. with an NPV = -$7k. For the Base Case, without the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), and with a Federal tax rate of 21%, the project's NPV reached $0 (i.e., the project becomes viable), when the installed SF cost reached $146/m(2). The biggest influences on project viability measured by NPV were the project life, Federal tax rate, and the SF cost. For viability, solar industrial process heat (SIPH) projects, need SF costs of $150 to $200/m(2) in California.

AB  - Understanding how temperature affects fitness is important for conservation and pest management, especially in the era of global climate change. Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Oliver) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a worldwide pest of many economically important crops. Although much is known about this pest's life cycle, its adaptability to different temperatures is not fully understood. Here, we used age-and stage-specific life tables to investigate the effects of temperature on fitness-related traits and demographic parameters of R. ferrugineus under eight constant temperature regimens in the laboratory. The growth potential of these populations was also evaluated. The greatest longevity for males and females was 158.0 d at 24 degrees C and 144.5 d at 21 degrees C, respectively, but mean total fecundity was the highest at 27 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), and net reproductive rate (R-0) increased initially at low temperatures and then decreased. All metrics reached a maximum at 27 degrees C and a minimum at 36 degrees C. Mean generation times (T) decreased across the temperature range with a minimum at 36 degrees C. Our results indicate that the optimum temperature for growth of R. ferrugineus was approximately 27 degrees C. Our work will be of value for developing strategies for control management of this pest species.

AB  - Gestation length varies among populations of common geckos on the South Island of New Zealand, from annual reproductive cycles at a relatively warm site at Alexandria to biennial cycles at a cool site at Macraes. We compared the effect of warm and cool thermal regimes on the length and success of gestation between geckos from Macraes and Alexandra. To assess the likelihood of geckos experiencing these temperatures in the wild, we compared the laboratory thermal regimes with data available for field microhabitat temperatures, body temperatures (T-b) and selected temperatures (T-set) of pregnant females. Temperature had a profound effect on the length and success of pregnancy: geckos from both populations under the cool regime had longer pregnancies that were less successful in producing developed neonates than geckos under the warm regime. Though no viable young were produced under the cool regime there were qualitative differences in outcome of pregnancies between populations all geckos from Alexandra (warm site) aborted pregnancies early on whereas several from Macraes (cool site) produced fully developed embryos after extremely long gestation periods (up to 440 days). Under the warm regime, populations appeared to differ in the rate of embryogenesis and in neonatal growth rate (both in g/day, with individuals from the Macraes population having the highest rates). Though temperatures of both thermal regimes overlapped with common microhabitat temperatures for both populations in most seasons of embryogenesis, maximum field T-b and T-set for pregnant females were generally higher than in the laboratory regimes, at least for certain times of day in warm weather. The prolonged embryogenesis exhibited by geckos under the warm regime and the poor success of pregnancy under the cool regime demonstrate the necessity of thermoregulation by pregnant females for successful reproduction, particularly at Macraes. Our study describes complex but significant plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of female reproduction in a viviparous gekkonid lizard.

AB  - Natural gas has become the largest fuel source for electricity generation in the United States and accounts for a third of energy production and consumption. However, the environmental and socioeconomic impacts across the supply chain and over the boom-and-bust cycle have not been comprehensively characterized. To provide insight for long-term decision-making for energy transitions, we estimate the cumulative effects of the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin from 2004 to 2016 on air quality, climate change and employment. We find that air quality effects (1,200 to 4,600 deaths; US$23 billion +99%/-164%) and employment effects (469,000 job-years +/- 30%; US$21 billion +/- 30%) follow the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts (US$12 billion to 94 billion) persist for generations well beyond the period of natural gas activity. Employment effects concentrate in rural areas where production occurs. However, almost half of cumulative premature mortality due to air pollution is downwind of these areas, occurring in urban regions of the northeast. The cumulative effects of methane and carbon dioxide emissions on global mean temperature over a 30-yr time horizon are nearly equivalent but over the long term, the cumulative climate impact is largely due to carbon dioxide. We estimate that a tax on production of US$2 per thousand cubic feet (+172%/-76%) would compensate for cumulative climate and air quality externalities across the supply chain.

AB  - This study uses the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli as an experimental system to examine evolutionary responses of bacteria to an environmental acidic-alkaline range between pH 5.3 and 7.8 (15-5000 nM [H+]). Our goal was both to test general hypotheses about adaptation to abiotic variables and to provide insights into how coliform organisms might respond to changing conditions inside and outside of hosts. Six replicate lines of E. coli evolved for 2000 generations at one of four different constant pH conditions: pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, or 7.8. Direct adaptation to the evolutionary environment, as well as correlated changes in other environments, was measured as a change in fitness relative to the ancestor in direct competition experiments. The pH 5.3 group had the highest fitness gains, with a highly significant increase of 20%. The pH 7.8 group had far less significant gains and much higher variance among its lines. Analysis of individual lines within these two groups revealed complex patterns of adaptation: all of the pH 5.3 lines exhibited trade-offs (reduced fitness in another environment), but only 33% of the pH 7.8 lines showed such trade-offs and one of the pH 7.8 lines demonstrated exaptation by improving fitness in the pH 5.3 environment. Although there was also prevalent exaptation in other groups to the acidic environment, there were no such cases of exaptation to alkalinity. Comparison across the entire experimental pH range revealed that the most acidic lines, the pH 5.3 group, were all specialists, in contrast to the pH 6.3 lines, which were almost all generalists. That is, although none of the pH 5.3 lines showed any correlated fitness gains, all of the pH 6.3 lines did.

AB  - A natural radioactivity in thermal water was investigated based on 19 selected thermal waters from Poland. The analysed results show that the radionuclides' concentrations in the study waters vary over a wide range. The temperature of the waters varies from above 20 degrees C to above 80 degrees C. The waters are characterised by different mineralisation, chemical compositions, and belong to different hydrochemical types. There is a good correlation between the water temperature and the depths of the aquifer formations occurrence, suggesting the thermal energy originates from the thermal geogradient. The concentration of radium is well correlated with the water mineralisation. The ratio of radium activity (Ra-226/Ra-228) in groundwater relates not only the ratio of uranium activity to that of thorium (U-238/Th-232) in aquifer formation, but also depends on the physical and chemical water properties. Based on the concentration of radon and its transport model, the radiation exposures due to inhalation of Rn-222 and its progeny for employees and clients of the spa were assessed. The use of the thermal waters as a drinking resource may be problematic due to the possibility of exceeding the recommended annual committed effective dose 0.1 mSv.

AB  - We assessed the functional and numerical responses of Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko under long-term rearing (45 generations, G5-G45) on eggs of a common factitious host, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Under such long-term mass rearing, the function response of this parasitoid shifted from Type III (from G5 to G20) to Type II (from G25 to G45). The maximum attack rate (T/T-h) (33.62 hosts/day) and the shortest handling time (0.7138 +/- 0.0272 h) were recorded in G5. Also, G45 had the lowest attack rate (21.67 hosts/day) and longest handling time (1.1076 +/- 0.0689 h). The handling time increased gradually over the generations (P- reg <0.01, R-2 = 0.903). The number of eggs laid by the parasitoid increased significantly with increased host density, but reached a plateau at very high densities. While no significant differences in daily parasitism were observed over 45 generations at densities of 2, 4, 8, and 16 available host eggs per wasp, there were significant differences in parasitism at host densities of 32, 64, and 128 eggs per wasp. T. brassicae females were more active and foraged more frequently in earlier generations (G5 to G20), which allowed wasps to parasitize more E. kuehniella eggs compared to later generations. Also, continuous mass rearing of T. brassicae negatively affected foraging behavior and the quality of wasps after G20. However, rejuvenation of the colony by adding field-collected parasitoids or rearing wasps on more suitable factitious hosts is strongly recommended to lower the negative effects of long-term mass rearing on quality of this parasitoid.

AB  - Local adaptation has been studied in a broad range of taxa for decades. However, we have limited understanding of how often it occurs in variable environments. Whether phenotypic plasticity can evolve in distinct ways among populations experiencing different patterns of abiotic variability is unclear. Abiotic conditions in coastal marine habitats can be highly heterogeneous at small spatial scales, which might promote local adaptation. The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912) has become a model system for testing whether phenotypic differences among populations are a result of local adaptation. To identify potential selective pressures in the field, temperature and salinity were measured in high shore pools for six months at three sites on San Juan Island in Washington, USA. A common garden experiment with factorial combinations of seven temperature and two salinity (32, 55 ppt) treatments was conducted on these distinct populations. Two temperature treatments varied daily, both with an average of 20 C, but different ranges (low amplitude: 15-25 C, high amplitude: 10-30 C). The other five treatments were the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures held constant. Fecundity, survivorship, and development were characterized across two generations. There were strong interactive effects of temperature and hypersalinity on copepod culture dynamics, but these effects differed among populations. Abiotic patterns in the field were correlated with few observed differences in population phenotypes, thus limited evidence for local adaptation was found. For these populations, differences in selective pressures among sites might not be strong enough to overcome the influence of genetic drift.

AB  - The subsurface temperature gradually increases southward in the Sumikawa geothermal field and decreases sharply toward the north. The geothermal reservoir contains a two-phase zone between the cap rock and hot water zone. The target for production was designated in the deep zone, in the high temperature southern area. The production and reinjection areas have been separated to recover thermal energy efficiently during the recycling of reinjection fluid; the wells have been spaced as far apart as possible to reduce well interference. To improve productivity and injectivity, cold-water well stimulation was applied, and this experiment reduced the number of wells required for 50 MWe power generation. (C) 2000 CNR.

AB  - Tropical and subtropical species represent the majority of biodiversity. These species are predicted to lack the capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to selection imposed by climatic change. However, these assessments have relied on indirect estimates of adaptive capacity, using conditions that do not reflect environmental changes projected under climate change. Using a paternal half-sib full-sib breeding design, we estimated the additive genetic variance and narrow-sense heritability for adult upper thermal limits in two rainforest-restricted species of Drosophila reared under two thermal regimes, reflecting increases in seasonal temperature projected for the Wet Tropics of Australia and under standard laboratory conditions (constant 25 degrees C). Estimates of additive genetic variation and narrow-sense heritability for adult heat tolerance were significantly different from zero in both species under projected summer, but not winter or constant, thermal regimes. In contrast, significant broad-sense genetic variation was apparent in all thermal regimes for egg-to-adult viability. Environment-dependent changes in the expression of genetic variation for adult upper thermal limits suggest that predicting adaptive responses to climate change will be difficult. Estimating adaptive capacity under conditions that do not reflect future environmental conditions may provide limited insight into evolutionary responses to climate change.

AB  - In the northern acorn barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, polymorphism at the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) locus appears to be maintained by distinct selection regimes that vary between intertidal microhabitats. The goal of the present experiment was to elucidate the mechanism of selection at the MPi locus by examining the relationship between genotype and fitness-related life-history traits in laboratory manipulations. When barnacles were cultured on a mannose-supplemented diet and exposed to thermal stress, different Mpi genotypes exhibited differences in the rate of growth that predicted survivorship. In contrast, no such relationship was observed in control or fructose-supplemented dietary treatments either in the presence or in the absence of stress. Similarly, the phenotype and survivorship of genotypes at another allozyme locus and a presumably neutral mitochondrial DNA marker were homogeneous across all treatments and unaffected by experimental manipulations. These results suggest that the differential survivorship of Mpi genotypes in the field and laboratory results from a differential ability to process mannose-6-phosphate through glycolysis. The widespread polymorphism at MPi observed in marine taxa may reflect the interaction between dietary composition and environmental heterogeneity in intertidal habitats.

AB  - Oligonychus litchii Lo and Ho (Arachnida: Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the primary pests in the litchi orchard and causes serious damage. We studied the effects of temperature on development and reproduction of O. litchii and constructed experimental population life tables at 5 constant temperatures (20, 23, 26, 29, and 32 degrees C) under laboratory conditions. The results showed that development, reproduction, and life table parameters of O. litchii were significantly affected by different temperatures. The egg stage had the longest period of development, and survival or development time decreased significantly with rising constant temperatures. Duration of the larva, protonymph, and deutonymph stages, and total generation time, tended to decline as the temperature increased, but development time at 26, 29, and 32 degrees C did not differ significantly. The longest generation time (egg to death of the adult) was 34.3 d at 20 degrees C, followed by 21.9 d at 23 degrees C, and it was shortest at 32 degrees C (10.7 d). There is a positive linear correlation between the temperature (T) and developmental rate (V). The developmental threshold temperature and effective accumulated temperatures for the entire generation were 13.4 degrees C and 172.41 degree-d, respectively. The highest number of eggs laid per female was 77.2 eggs at 26 degrees C, while the lowest was 30.0 eggs at 20 degrees C. The maximum population growth rate (r(m)) values increased from 20 degrees C (0.04) to 29 degrees C (0.17), then decreased at 32 degrees C (0.12). The finite rates of increase (lambda) were over 1.00 at all 5 constant temperatures. Temperature had a great effect on the development and reproduction of O. litchi, and the optimal temperature for the mite is around 26 degrees C.

AB  - The influence of generation (under field conditions) and photoperiod (under laboratory conditions) on Lobesia botrana larvae development was studied. Some larvae were collected during three annual generations in two grape-growing areas of northeastern Italy, and others were individually reared in the laboratory from egg to pupa on an artificial diet under two different photoperiod conditions (respectively, daylight 16 h/d [long day {LD}] and 14 h/d [short day {SD}]). The mandible lengths of collected larvae were measured and the data analyzed morphometrically to determine the number of larval instars. In the laboratory study, the number of larval moultings, the mandible length of each instar, the development time from hatching larva to pupa, and the pupal weight were considered. The measurement of mandible lengths of larvae collected in the field indicated the existence of five larval instars in all three annual generations, but the size of the two oldest larval instars was significantly higher for third-generation larvae than for the previous generations. Under laboratory conditions, the larvae usually exhibited five instars, but the mandible lengths of larvae and the pupa size were greater for individuals reared under SD. These also took a greater number of days to develop from hatching larvae to pupae. Because a larger size of the final larval instar occurs in individuals that produce diapausing pupae under SD in both the laboratory and the field, a positive association between larval size and the probability of surviving the winter can be inferred.

AB  - The genetic response of Atlantic salmon to culture is important in predicting the success of these fish in nature and their impacts on wild populations through competition and interbreeding. We compared a seventh-generation strain of farmed Atlantic salmon from Sunndalsora, Norway, with its principal founder population from the wild, the River Namsen. The fish were reared from eggs in a common environment and assessed for the extent of genetic divergence in several fitness-related traits. Morphology had diverged, as farmed juveniles showed more robust bodies and smaller rayed fins than the wild juveniles. Ecologically important aspects of behaviour also differed. Farmed juveniles were more aggressive in a tank environment typical of culture facilities, while wild juveniles dominated in a stream-like environment. Farmed juveniles were also more risk-prone, reappearing from cover sooner after a simulated predator attack. It was not surprising that growth performance was higher in farmed than wild juveniles, as the former had been subjected to intentional selection for this trait. Correlated responses to this selection may also explain the higher rate of smelting and lower rate of male parr maturity in the farmed than the wild salmon. Competition with wild juveniles, however, negatively affected the growth of the farmed juveniles, particularly under semi-natural conditions. Our results indicate that fanning of Atlantic salmon generates rapid genetic change, as a result of both intentional and unintentional selection in culture, that alters important fitness-related traits.

AB  - Power generation processes are major contributors of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which have been linked to the global warming phenomenon, and by relying on solar photovoltaics (PV) for power generation, GHG emissions can be minimized. However, current and future power supply scenarios in Nigeria are heavily dependent on natural-gas-fired plants. Whereas the solar energy resource available in Nigeria is adequate for PV power generation, concurrent evaluations of its technoeconomic feasibility and GHG mitigation effectiveness are lacking. In this study, 100-MW solar PV stations were proposed for 25 locations in Nigeria and analyzed for profitability and GHG mitigation effectiveness. Using the RETScreen software, energy and cost models were developed for each location, and GHG emissions the base (gas-fired plants) and proposed cases (solar PV plants) were analyzed. The systems proposed for high-latitude locations were found to be more profitable than those for low-latitude locations. Of the 25 locations, the proposed 100-MW PV plant in Gusau (lat. 11.88 degrees N, lon. 6.65 degrees) had the highest annual energy production of 167,307 MWh of electricity, a cumulative cash flow (CCF) of US$795.3 million, an energy production cost of US$66.74/MWh, a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$215 million, and a GHG reduction potential of 41,195.2 tCO(2) /year. Port Harcourt (lat. 4.75 degrees N, lon. 7.00 degrees E) was the least favorable location with electricity production estimated at 108,309 MWh per annum, CCF at US$389.7 million, energy production cost at US$103.10/MWh, NPV at US$40 million, and GHG reduction potential estimated at 26, 668.5 tCO(2)/year. The huge initial costs required for installing the systems could be recovered within 10.6 to 14 years at the locations considered, the estimated simple payback periods being between 11.6 and 18 years. An average GHG reduction payment of US$265/tCO(2) is recommended to improve the profitability of the solar PV plants in Nigeria.

AB  - Albania is relatively rich with low up to the middle enthalpy, geothermal resources. Their temperature varies from 34 degrees C up to 65.5 degrees C to Kozani-8, the most important among the Albanian geothermal wells. It had been drilled in 1989. The well is located on the hills, 26km SE of Tirana. It encounters limestone strata at 1819m, penetrating 10m into the section. The yield of the well is 10.3 l/s, and is stable from more than 23 years. The geographical position of the well, placed in the middle of a village, very close to the corridor 8, are the basic parameters on choosing these waters for our designs and calculations. The design provides the cascade and integral use, but not only. It also provide the electricity generations, through a hybrid system. The centre will be also equipped with SPA, open and closed pools, fitness, massages, and greenhouse & also aquaculture pools. The economic analyses shows that this resource is completely competitive, and is unjustified it's further "waste". It will also help on improving the living standards for the local community.

AB  - Energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains a challenging issue at the midway point to the United Nations' development goals. From the perspective of energy efficiency and diversification of power-generation sources, this paper investigates the capacity of the wood-processing industry to contribute to the decentralised power generation by performing a techno-economic analysis of the use of wood residues for cogeneration. Using a survey performed in Cameroon as a case study, a biomass-fuelled cogeneration scheme and a model analysing its viability are proposed for the specific context of SSA. A sensitivity analysis indicates for a given process efficiency of the industry, the attractiveness of cogeneration as the processing capacity and feed-in tariffs of electricity increase. More specifically, the threshold of feed-in tariffs ensuring the economic viability of CHP in the sub-region is estimated at $0.15 per kWh for mills where the output capacities of sawn timber products are of 5000 cubic metre per annum and more. The power-generation potential from the primary processing of timbers in the sub-region is about 388 kWh per cubic metre of sawn wood, while the energy intensity of the sawing process is estimated at 132 kWh per cubic metre. Therefore, the industry can generate up to 2472 GWh of electricity in the three sub-regions of East, West and Central Africa if a total of US$ 2.5 billion is invested, allowing a substantial increase of 1% of the current electricity-generation capacity for the geographic location which has the most important forestry resources on the continent.

AB  - A quasi-static model is proposed to describe wafer deformation due to stress build up in the Si epitaxy process. The analysis takes into account temporal stress variations as the wafer sags into the dish-shaped pocket of the susceptor at a deposition temperature above 1100 degreesC. It is shown that the magnitude of the negative bending moment at the wafer supporting edge decreases over time. As a result, the maximum deflection at the wafer center and the tensile stress at the wafer supporting edge also decrease over time. The generation of slip defects near the wafer edge as the wafer responds the thermal, Gravitational and contact stress is explored. A new test methodology is developed to track the time-varying wafer deflection. It allows for the measurement of quality of the susceptor and its fitness for use in the reactor system.

AB  - Chironomidae larvae are important macroinvertebrates in limnic environments, but little knowledge exists about their biometrics development characteristics. This study aims to describe the immature Chironomus calligraphus Goeldi, 1905 under laboratory conditions by the accomplishment of thirteen egg masses from eggs eclosion to adults emergency, at controlled room temperature (25 degrees C) and photoperiod (12-12h). Larvae were feed ad libitum with "Alcon Basic - MEP 200 Complex" fish food and commercial dehydrated Spirulina. The postures had a mean length of 9 +/- 1 mm (n = 13) and 348 +/- 66 eggs. The brownish colored eggs with elliptical shape had length of 160.3 +/- 17.7 mu m (n = 130), being arranged as an organized string in a pseudo spiral form. The time duration from the first to the four instars were three, four, four and eight days, and the average length of a cephalic capsule to each one of the instars (66.3 +/- 12.3 mu m, 102.9 +/- 22.1 mu m, 159 +/- 24.6 mu m, 249.2 +/- 29.7 mu m, n = 456) were significantly different (ANOVA, p < 0.001). The Dyar's Rule showed a constant growth rate, r = 1.5. Our results demonstrated that C. calligraphus is a species with short life cycle, low mortality rate, food adaptability, fast larval growth and easily maintained at laboratory, factors that allowed the use of this native species as a tool for ecotoxicological tests.

AB  - Metabolic rates of early life history stages of marine fishes show considerable interindividual differences, and are highly influenced by extrinsic factors like temperature or food availability. Measuring oxygen uptake rates is a proxy for estimating metabolic rates. Still, the relationship between respiration rates and ambient or previous salinity conditions as well as parental and developmental acclimation to changes in salinity remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we conducted experiments to investigate the effects of salinity on the routine metabolic rates (RMR) of euryhaline Atlantic herring Clupea harengus larvae at 3 levels of salinity: low (6 psu), intermediate (16 psu) and high (35 psu), reflecting ecologically relevant conditions for herring populations in the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. The larvae originated from different genetic backgrounds and salinity adaptations to account for cross-generation effects on metabolic rates. Closed respirometry carried out over 24 h on individual fish larvae generally confirmed near isometric respiration rates at all salinity regimes, with rates being 15.4% higher at 6 psu and 7.5% higher at 35 psu compared to 16 psu conditions. However, transgenerational acclimation to different salinity regimes of the parents had no effect on the salinity-specific metabolic rates of their offspring. Our study demonstrates the ability of herring to cope with a wide range of salinity conditions, irrespective of parental environmental history and genetic origin.

AB  - 1. In the life cycle of monogonont rotifers it is generally assumed that diapausing eggs invariably hatch into amictic stem females which produce female offspring parthenogenetically. Diapausing eggs are only produced by later generations after sexual reproduction has been induced by environmental cues.
   2. We show that populations of an undescribed Hexarthra species inhabiting small temporary ponds in the Chihuahuan Desert deviate from this life cycle pattern. These ponds may dry within days and up to 85% of females were mictic. Females producing male offspring and diapausing eggs were observed 1 or 2 days, respectively, after ponds had filled with water.
   3. Under laboratory conditions, 7-46% of females hatching from re-hydrated sediments were sexual. Male offspring of these females can fertilise other mictic stem females leading to diapausing egg formation. In laboratory experiments, females produced fully developed diapausing eggs within 1.9 days at 20 degrees C and 1.2 days at 30 degrees C.
   4. In addition, embryonic development time (1.1-0.3 days at temperatures between 12 and 30 degrees C) and juvenile period (2.1-0.5 days for the same temperature range) are shorter than those of other rotifer species. In short-lived habitats, the potential for rapid population development and production of new diapausing eggs may be crucial in the long-term survival of populations.

AB  - Temperature is a crucial factor determining biology and ecology of poikilothermic animals. It often constitutes an important barrier for invasive species originating from different climate zones but, on the other hand, may facilitate the invasion process of animals with wide thermal preferences and high resistance to extreme temperatures. In our experimental study, we investigated the thermal behaviour of two Ponto-Caspian amphipod crustaceans-Dikerogammarus villosus and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes. Both species are known to live under a wide range of thermal conditions which may promote their invasion. Moreover, both these amphipods are hosts for microsporidian parasites which co-evolved with them within the Ponto-Caspian region and spread in European waters. As the presence of a parasite may influence the thermal preferences of its host, we expected to observe behavioural changes in infected individuals of the studied amphipods leading to (1) behavioural fever (selecting a warmer habitat) or (2) anapyrexia (selecting a colder habitat). The experiment (N =20) was carried out for 30 min in a 100 cm. 20 cm from boths sides were not avaliable for amphipods long thermal gradient (0-40 C-degrees), using 30 randomly selected adult amphipod individuals of one species. At the end of each trial, we checked the position of amphipods along the gradient and determined their sex and infection status (uninfected or infected by one of microsporidium species). D. villosus was infected with Cucumispora dikerogammari whereas D. haemobaphes was a host for C. dikerogammari, Dictyocoela muelleri or D. berillonum. Thermal preferences of amphipods depended on their species and sex. Females of D. villosus preferred warmer microhabitats (often much above 30 C-degrees) than conspecific males and females of D. haemobaphes, whereas no significant differences were found among males of both species and both sexes of D. haemobaphes. Moreover, infected males of D. villosus stayed in warmer water more often than uninfected males of this species, selecting temperatures higher than 30 C-degrees, which may be explained either as a behavioural fever constituting a defence mechanism of a host against the infection, or as a parasite manipulation of the host behaviour increasing the parasite fitness. On the other hand, none of the parasite species affected the thermal preferences of D. haemobaphes, including also C. dikerogammari, changing the behaviour of D. villosus. Our research presents the complexity of the thermal behaviour of studied amphipods and the evidence that microsporidia may trigger a change in temperature preferendum of their host species and those observations may be the result of different host-parasite coevolution time which may vary for the two host species (Poulin, 2010).

AB  - Nowadays, the use of renewable energy sources is one of the keys to achieve the sustainable development of societies. The intensive use of fossil fuels has caused effects in the environment and the human health. Greenhouse gas emissions and the carcinogenic effect of diesel are widely demonstrated. The production of clean energy based on renewable sources and the use of hydrogen as an energy vector in general and as an alternative fuel in particular represent a technically feasible reality. However, it is necessary to study the economic variables of centralized or distributed production of hydrogen as an alternative fuel. The aim of this paper is to analyze the technical and economic viability of a centralized generation hydrogen plant for mobility use. It was performed a sensitivity analysis of main parameters such as size of hydrogen production plant, operating hours of the plant, investment costs of the main equipment and electricity price. A NPV of 1,272,692 and a 9-year pay-back were obtained for a centralized hydrogen production plant of 2 MW, considering commercial values of the main evaluation parameters. The sensitivity analysis determines that the main variables affecting the NPV are the price of electricity and the operating hours of the plant. With 95% of confidence, the NPV will be positive with an 80.19% of certainty. Therefore, centralized hydrogen production represents a technically viable, environmentally friendly and economically attractive process that can rapidly position hydrogen as an alternative fuel for mobility.

AB  - Low temperature air plasma was used as the mutation tool for penicillin-producing strain Penicillium chrysogenum. The discharge conditions were RF power of 360 W, temperature of 40 degrees C in a sealed chamber, and pressure of 10 Pa to 30 Pa. The result showed that the kinetics of the survival rate followed a typical saddle-shaped curve. Based on a statistic analysis, at the treating duration of 10 min, the positive mutation rate was as high as 37.5% while the negative mutation rate was low. The colonial morphology changed obviously when the plasma treating duration reached or exceeded 45 min. After both primary and secondary screening, a mutant designated as aPc051310 with high productivity of penicillin was obtained, and a strong mutagenic effect on P. chrysogenum was observed in the process. It was proved that after five generations, the mutant aPc051310 still exhibits a high productivity. All the results prove that the plasma mutation method could be developed as a convenient and effective tool to breed high-yield strains in the fermentation industry, while expanding the plasm application at the same time.

AB  - Due to their antioxidant activity, anthocyanins are of increasing interest for nutritionists, food scientists and plant breeders. Anthocyanins in wheat grains are expressed in either the pericarp or aleurone layer. Previous studies revealed that different anthocyanins are present in wheat varieties carrying genes for either the purple pericarp or the blue aleurone trait. Progeny from crosses between red-, purple- and blue-grained wheat varieties were selected over several cycles for grain colour by visual scoring. Bulked F-5 grains were evaluated for their total anthocyanin content by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and HPLC-MS. The results demonstrate that it is possible to increase the anthocyanin content by the combination of the different genetic backgrounds for purple pericarp and blue aleurone, even though the majority of progeny were within the range of the purple- and blue-grained check varieties. Visual scoring for grain colour is efficient, reliable and fast for selection in early breeding generations. Advanced breeding lines with high anthocyanin content can be identified by simple extraction methods and spectrophotometric measurements.

AB  - Oviparous animals, such as turtles, lay eggs whose success or demise depends on environmental conditions that influence offspring phenotype (morphology, physiology, and in many reptiles, also sex determination), growth, and survival, while in the nest and post-hatching. Consequently, because turtles display little parental care, maternal provisioning of the eggs and female nesting behavior are under strong selection. But the consequences of when and where nests are laid are affected by anthropogenic habitat disturbances that alter suitable nesting areas, expose eggs to contaminants in the wild, and modify the thermal and hydric environment experienced by developing embryos, thus impacting hatchling survival and the sexual fate of taxa with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) and genotypic sex determination (GSD). Indeed, global and local environmental change influences air, water, and soil temperature and moisture, which impact basking behavior, egg development, and conditions within the nest, potentially rendering current nesting strategies maladaptive as offspring mortality increases and TSD sex ratios become drastically skewed. Endocrine disruptors can sex reverse TSD and GSD embryos alike. Adapting to these challenges depends on genetic variation, and little to no heritability has been detected for nest-site behavior. However, modest heritability in threshold temperature (above and below which females or males develop in TSD taxa, respectively) exists in the wild, as well as interpopulation differences in the reaction norm of sex ratio to temperature, and potentially also in the expression of gene regulators of sexual development. If this variation reflects additive genetic components, some adaptation might be expected, provided that the pace of environmental change does not exceed the rate of evolution. Research remains urgently needed to fill current gaps in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of nest-site choice and its adaptive potential, integrating across multiple levels of organization.

AB  - Temperature plays a multidimensional role in host-pathogen interactions. As an important element of climate change, elevated world temperature resulting from global warming presents new challenges to sustainable disease management. Knowledge of pathogen adaptation to global warming is needed to predict future disease epidemiology and formulate mitigating strategies. In this study, 21 Phytophthora infestans isolates originating from seven thermal environments were acclimated for 200 days under stepwise increase or decrease of experimental temperatures and evolutionary responses of the isolates to the thermal changes were evaluated. We found temperature acclimation significantly increased the fitness and genetic adaptation of P. infestans isolates at both low and high temperatures. Low-temperature acclimation enforced the countergradient adaptation of the pathogen to its past selection and enhanced the positive association between the pathogen's intrinsic growth rate and aggressiveness. At high temperatures, we found that pathogen growth collapsed near the maximum temperature for growth, suggesting a thermal niche boundary may exist in the evolutionary adaptation of P. infestans. These results indicate that pathogens can quickly adapt to temperature shifts in global warming. If this is associated with environmental conditions favoring pathogen spread, it will threaten future food security and human health and require the establishment of mitigating actions.

AB  - Iron ore pellets abrade during their production and handling, which lowers product quality and leads to dustiness issues. Pellets were collected from a variety of plants (operating either Straight-Grate (SG) or Grate-Kiln (GK) furnaces) to understand whether furnace type affects fines and dust formation. Results showed that pellets fired in SG furnaces were less abrasion-resistant (3.5xlower) than pellets fired in GK furnaces. Concurrently, laboratory pellets were prepared using various ores, binders, and firing temperatures. These were tested to understand the relationship between abrasion index and dustiness. AI was observed to range from 1 to 14%. Dustiness, determined via AI and size distributions of abrasion progeny, ranged from 0.2 to 1.6%. For AI greater than 5%, AI can be used to indicate potentially high levels of dust. For AI less than 5%, there was a poor correlation between AI and dustiness. This was explained by the observation that as AI decreased, the abrasion product fineness increased. The results from parts I and II of this investigation suggest that material loss and levels of pellet dustiness may be significantly affected by pellet quality up to a certain point. Poorly fired pellets will be dusty during handling and transportation, while well-fired pellets will generate less - but finer - material as their quality improves. This could lead to little observed changes in dust generation over a wide range of pellet quality. Dust generation at each site would then depend on the quantity of material produced and their extent of handling.

AB  - Spider densities are often low after winter in annual crops, and crop management decimates spider populations several times per year. Population recovery rates and phenology depend on reproductive and development rates, which in turn are driven largely by temperature. We aimed to quantify the relationships between eggsac development rates and temperature in order to understand the relative value of different linyphiid species for the biological control of agricultural pests. Female adults of nine linyphiid species were collected from winter wheat in the UK over 3 years; Bathyphantes gracilis (Blackwall), Erigone atra ( Blackwall), Erigone dentipalpis ( Wider), Erigone promiscua O. P.- Cambridge), Tenuiphantes tenuis ( Blackwall) [ formerly Lepthyphantes tenuis ( Blackwall)], Meioneta rurestris ( C. L. Koch), Oedothorax apicatus ( Blackwall), Oedothorax fuscus ( Blackwall), and Oedothorax retusus (Westring). These are agrobiont species that are dominant in agroecosystems. We tested how well development in the field can be predicted on the basis of laboratory experiments. We also built a simple phenology simulation model to test whether spider phenology in the field can be predicted by a general knowledge of the relationship between temperature and development rate. The relationships between temperature and development rates of eggsacs were not linear as described by a day-degree model, but exponential as described by a biophysical model. Duration of the eggsac development period in the field was predicted accurately from laboratory experiments. We only found minor differences between development thresholds of eggsacs at constant temperatures compared with fluctuating temperatures. The phenology model predicted the phenology of L. tenuis and E. atra well, but the number of generations predicted for O. fuscus was not realised in the field. This suggests that development of this species may be affected by factors other than temperature. The methods used here could also be applied to other natural enemies, to determine whether their thermal biology is conducive to a role as biocontrol agents in disturbed agricultural systems.

AB  - Parallel systems that employ CPUs and GPUs as two heterogeneous computational units have become immensely popular due to their ability to maximize performance under restrictive thermal budgets. However, programming heterogeneous systems via traditional programming models like OpenCL or CUDA involves rewriting large portions of application-code. They also lead to code that is not performance portable across different architectures or even across different generations of the same architecture.
   In this paper, we evaluate the current state of two emerging parallel programming models: C++ AMP and OpenACC. These emerging programming paradigms require minimal code changes and rely on compilers to interact with the low-level hardware language, thereby producing performance portable code from an application standpoint. We analyze the performance and productivity of the emerging programming models and compare them with OpenCL using a diverse set of applications on two different architectures, a CPU coupled with a discrete GPU and an Accelerated Programming Unit (APU). Our experiments demonstrate that while the emerging programming models improve programmer productivity, they do not yet expose enough flexibility to extract maximum performance as compared to traditional programming models.

AB  - Simple Summary Does variation in the mitochondrial DNA sequence influence the survival and reproduction of an individual? What is the purpose of genetic variation of the mitochondrial DNA between individuals from the same population? As a simple laboratory model, Drosophila species can give us the answer to this question. Creating experimental lines with different combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear genomic DNA and testing how successful these lines were in surviving in different experimental set-ups enables us to deduce the effect that both genomes have on fitness. This study on D. obscura experimentally validates theoretical models that explain the persistence of mitochondrial DNA variation within populations. Our results shed light on the various mechanisms that maintain this type of variation. Finally, by conducting the experiments on two experimental temperatures, we have shown that environmental variations can support mitochondrial DNA variation within populations. The adaptive significance of sympatric mitochondrial (mtDNA) variation and the role of selective mechanisms that maintain it are debated to this day. Isofemale lines of Drosophila obscura collected from four populations were backcrossed within populations to construct experimental lines, with all combinations of mtDNA Cyt b haplotypes and nuclear genetic backgrounds (nuDNA). Individuals of both sexes from these lines were then subjected to four fitness assays (desiccation resistance, developmental time, egg-to-adult viability and sex ratio) on two experimental temperatures to examine the role of temperature fluctuations and sex-specific selection, as well as the part that interactions between the two genomes play in shaping mtDNA variation. The results varied across populations and fitness components. In the majority of comparisons, they show that sympatric mitochondrial variants affect fitness. However, their effect should be examined in light of interactions with nuDNA, as mito-nuclear genotype was even more influential on fitness across all components. We found both sex-specific and temperature-specific differences in mitochondrial and mito-nuclear genotype ranks in all fitness components. The effect of temperature-specific selection was found to be more prominent, especially in desiccation resistance. From the results of different components tested, we can also infer that temperature-specific mito-nuclear interactions rather than sex-specific selection on mito-nuclear genotypes have a more substantial role in preserving mtDNA variation in this model species.

AB  - The phenotypic differentiation of 16 provenances of Scots pine originating from a wide variety of habitats that range from lowland to southern highland locations in Poland was assessed during 47 years of their growth and development in the Carpathian Mountains. The traits, including height, diameter at breast height, stem straightness, and crown width, were used to evaluate the differentiation of the provenances in their juvenile period and at maturity and were examined for patterns of local adaptation. The populations from northern Poland were characterized by the best growth and productivity, whereas provenances from central Poland had the best stem quality. There were some changes in growth between provenances observed during the experiment, but the stand volume (m(3)/ha) in juvenile trees was closely correlated with that in mature trees (r = 0.979). There was a positive relationship between the productivity and the environmental conditions of the geographical origin of provenances with increasing values for the trees' productivity from south to north. Additionally, the elevation above sea level of the original populations was inversely correlated with the growth achieved by the progeny. In general, most populations from the species distribution range in Poland tested in the severe climate conditions of the Carpathian Mountains showed good growth performance under that environment, characterized by low temperatures and short growing periods. Provenances from climatic zones outside mountain regions demonstrated great growth and productivity, which proved to be the most important for competitively outperforming the local populations. Our study demonstrates good adaptive potential of the tested provenances, as selection will favor fast-growing genotypes under the predicted environmental change scenario.

AB  - This work is alined at evaluating the optimal location of three discrete heat Sources Which Could be placed anywhere inside a ventilated cavity and cooled by forced convection. The computational domain involves a square cavity with adiabatic walls, diagonally opposite inlet and outlet, with a heat flux of 1000 W/m(2) oil the heat sources and constant velocity of 4 m/s at the inlet. The two dimensional flow and temperature fields are obtained by performing simulations oil FLUENT 6.3. The micro genetic algorithm (MGA) using the six coordinates of the heat sources as input parameters and 5 individuals in it population is used for the optimization, with the objective function as minimizing the maximum temperature oil any of the heat sources. Initially for 66 generations, simulations were repeatedly done to evaluate the objective function. This data was used to train a back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) using the Bayesian regularization algorithm to predict the fitness from the Six inputs. This trained ANN was integrated with the micro genetic algorithm to evolve the Population for 1000 generations to arrive at the global optimum. Sensitivity studies have been carried out oil the optimal solution by varying file Reynolds number. This study shows that by integrating ANN with GA, the computational time call be reduced substantially in problems of this class. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change affects organisms worldwide with profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, often increasing population extinction risk. Climatic factors can increase the strength, variability, or direction of natural selection on phenotypic traits, potentially driving adaptive evolution. Phenotypic plasticity in relation to temperature can allow organisms to maintain fitness in response to increasing temperatures, thereby "buying time" for subsequent genetic adaptation and promoting evolutionary rescue. Although many studies have shown that organisms respond plastically to increasing temperatures, it is unclear if such thermal plasticity is adaptive. Moreover, we know little about how natural and sexual selection operate on thermal reaction norms, reflecting such plasticity. Here, we investigate how natural and sexual selection shape phenotypic plasticity in two congeneric and phenotypically similar sympatric insect species. We show that the thermal optima for longevity and mating success differ, suggesting temperature-dependent trade-offs between survival and reproduction in both sexes. Males in these species have similar thermal reaction norm slopes but have diverged in baseline body temperature (intercepts), being higher for the more northern species. Natural selection favored reduced thermal reaction norm slopes at high ambient temperatures, suggesting that the current level of thermal plasticity is maladaptive in the context of anthropogenic climate change and that selection now promotes thermal canalization and robustness. Our results show that ectothermic animals also at high latitudes can suffer from overheating and challenge the common view of phenotypic plasticity as being beneficial in harsh and novel environments.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms underlying population declines is critical for preventing the extinction of endangered populations. Positive feedbacks can hasten the process of collapse and create an 'extinction vortex,' particularly in small, isolated populations. We provide a case study of a male-biased sex ratio creating the conditions for extinction in a natural population of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) on North Brother Island in the Cook Strait of New Zealand. We combine data from long term mark-recapture surveys, updated model estimates of hatchling sex ratio, and population viability modeling to measure the impacts of sex ratio skew. Results from the mark-recapture surveys show an increasing decline in the percentage of females in the adult tuatara population. Our monitoring reveals compounding impacts on female fitness through reductions in female body condition, fecundity, and survival as the male-bias in the population has increased. Additionally, we find that current nest temperatures are likely to result in more male than female hatchlings, owing to the pattern of temperature-dependent sex determination in tuatara where males hatch at warmer temperatures. Anthropogenic climate change worsens the situation for this isolated population, as projected temperature increases for New Zealand are expected to further skew the hatchling sex ratio towards males. Population viability models predict that without management intervention or an evolutionary response, the population will ultimately become entirely comprised of males and functionally extinct. Our study demonstrates that sex ratio bias can be an underappreciated threat to population viability, particularly in populations of long-lived organisms that appear numerically stable.

AB  - Understanding the factors that shape the evolution of gene expression is a central goal in biology, but the molecular mechanisms behind this remain controversial. A related major goal is ascertaining how such factors may affect the adaptive potential of a species or population. Here we demonstrate that temperature-driven gene expression changes in fish adapted to differing thermal environments are constrained by the level of gene pleiotropy estimated by either the number of protein interactions or gene biological processes. Genes with low pleiotropy levels were the main drivers of both plastic and evolutionary global expression profile changes, while highly pleiotropic genes had limited expression response to temperature treatment. Our study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms by which natural populations can adapt to changing environments. In addition to having important implications for climate change adaptation, these results suggest that gene pleiotropy should be considered more carefully when interpreting expression profiling data.

AB  - The potential of environmental adaptation as a survival mechanism enabling a human-derived probiotic Lactobacillus strain to withstand heat stress and spray drying was investigated. Heat-adapted (52degreesC for 15 min) L. paracasei NFBC 338 exhibited 300- and 700-fold greater thermotolerance (survival at a lethal temperature of 60 C) compared with controls, in MRS and reconstituted skim milk (RSM), respectively. The level of thermal protection in RSM by pre-adaptation in hydrogen peroxide (0.003 M), salt (0.3 M NaCl) and bile salts (0.1% w/v) was also examined. Although not as efficient as the homologous stress, the levels of cross protection were in the order heat>salt>hydrogen peroxide>bile. Viability of the heat-adapted L. paracasei NFBC 338 in RSM was enhanced 18-fold during spray drying at outlet temperatures of 95-105degreesC, while salt-adapted cultures exhibited 16-fold greater viability than controls. These results highlight the potential of preconditioning treatments for maximizing survival of probiotic bacteria during development of probiotic functional foods. The cross protection afforded by salt against thermal stress may indicate that certain common protective mechanisms are induced by both heat and salt stress.

AB  - Loading pattern optimization (LPO) is a main issue of in-core fuel management. In this work, the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm based on behavior of gray wolves for hunting is introduced for the multi-objective LPO of a WWER-1000 core. Besides the GWO, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) have been applied and the performances of these algorithms are compared in challenging test functions (Griewank and Rastrigin) and LPO. The basic goal of this paper is to optimize the loading pattern with Neutronic and Thermal-Hydraulic (NTH) parameters, simultaneously. Considering these goals, a fitness function is defined for increasing k(eff) and flattening of PPFs. Thermal-hydraulic (TH) goals with specified weight are considered in this fitness (including critical heat flux (CHF) and fuel temperature). To calculate the required parameters of the core, two nuclear computational codes are used. The neutronic calculations are done by PARCS and COBRA-EN code is implemented for Thermal-hydraulic. These codes have been coupled with the GWO, GA and GSA algorithms with proper procedures. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the GWO and confirm that the GWO has appropriate adaptability for loading pattern optimization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The life histories of anadromous Arctic Char Salvelinus alpinus are complex and vary greatly between populations and environments. Here, we detail key aspects of the physical environment and life history of a population of Arctic Char from Nulahugyuk Creek, Nunavut, Canada, to characterize migration traits in a highly variable environment. Over the course of this migration, creek discharge declined precipitously, forcing Arctic Char to migrate through shallow water with large diel temperature fluctuations (>10 degrees C) and high temperature extremes (>21 degrees C). The downstream migration of adults (>55 cm) began in mid-June and continued into early July, while the downstream migration of smolts (<30 cm) began in late June and continued until late July. The upstream adult migration began in late June and ended in late July, far earlier than most upstream migrations in the region. There was no appreciable upstream migration of juveniles, and Arctic Char 30 to 55 cm in length were absent from the up- and downstream migrations. The average age at first migration was 4 years, and the youngest adult Arctic Char migrating upstream were 8 and 9 years old. The missing size- and age-classes, and the fact that most upstream migrants were near reproductive maturity, indicate that Arctic Char in this system typically leave at a length of 19 cm and an age of 4 years and do not return for 4 to 5 years, when they are ready to reproduce. Anadromous Nulahugyuk Creek Arctic Char appear to employ strategies that limit their exposure to restrictive migratory conditions and facilitate their existence in an otherwise uninhabitable system. Understanding such population-specific migratory strategies is critical to the management of Arctic Char fisheries, which are comprised of populations with highly diverse life histories, and to our understanding of how these life histories may contribute to the adaptability and persistence of the species as climate change progresses.

AB  - As revealed from recent drilling and organic geochemical testing and research, a series of lacustrine high-grade hydrocarbon source rocks was discovered in the upper section of the Chang 9 oil reservoir member of upper Triassic in Ordos Basin. The hydrocarbon source rocks show average TOC content as high as 5.03%, average bitumen "A" content as high as 0.8603%, and good quality organic precursors, which are of the sapropelic type mainly derived from lower aquatic plants and have reached the thermal evolution stage featured by oil-producing climax. Generally the lacustrine high-grade hydrocarbon source rocks were developed in local depressions of a lake basin, and the Chang 9(1) member was particularly formed in a depositional environment characterized by fresh water to weakly saline water, weakly oxidizing to weakly reducing setting and semi-deep lake facies, as was demonstrated by a variety of organic to inorganic geochemical parameters. As a result, high productivity constitutes the principal controlling force for generation of this series of high-grade hydrocarbon source rocks. Deposition of thinly-bedded and laminated tuffs as well as positive Eu anomaly corroborate the possible occurrence of anoxic geological event closely related to contemporaneous volcanic eruption, which would play a key part in development of the Chang 9(1) member of high-grade hydrocarbon source rocks.

AB  - Most organisms respond and can adapt to photoperiodic changes. This affects measurable end points like developmental time, survival and fertility. For ectotherms like Chironomus riparius, temperature is the most studied environmental cue regulating their life cycle, whereas photoperiodic influence is neglected. However, the developmental speed between summer and winter seasons of a field population could not be explained solely by temperature variations. Therefore, to have a comprehensive view on how photoperiods influence chironomid's life cycle, we investigated if it plays a role in their development and if it acts as an important selective pressure on developmental time speed. To this end, first emerged C. riparius were artificially selected for seven generations. Pre-selected and unselected organisms could develop and breed independently under three light regimes: constant light (24:0 L:D), long days (16:8 L:D) and short days (8:16 L:D). Adult emergence, mean and median emergence time and fertility were integrated into the population growth rate to compare fitness. Our findings show that although developmental time is extended under short days, this same condition may exert a selective pressure towards a shorter development. Moreover, by also using photoperiodic clues to anticipate environmental changes, chironomids can potentially adapt to alterations in climate.

AB  - BACKGROUND In fluctuating climatic environments, heat acclimation in predatory mites is a superior adaptation strategy for effective agricultural pest management and can be used to enhance the abilities critical in biological control efficiency. We investigated the regulatory mechanism governing the remarkable plastic response of thermotolerance in a high-temperature adapted strain (HTAS) and discerned the differences in the defensive reactions between the HTAS and the conventional strain (CS) in the predatory miteNeoseiulus barkeri. RESULTS At 42 degrees C, the relative expression levels of four identified HSP70 genes increased rapidly in bothN. barkeristrains; meanwhile the expression ofNbHSP70-1andNbHSP70-2in CS sharply decreased after 4 h, displaying a distinct contrast with the remaining elevated expression in HTAS.Western blot analysis showed that the protein level ofNbHSP70-1in CS was dramatically elevated at 0.5 h and decreased at 6 h at 42 degrees C. Conversely, in HTAS,NbHSP70-1was constantly induced and peaked at 6 h at 42 degrees C. Furthermore, HSP70 suppression by RNAi knockdown had a greater influence on the survival of HTAS, causing a higher mortality under high temperature than CS. Finally, the recombinant exogenousNbHSP70-1protein enhanced the viability ofE. coliBL21 under a lethal temperature of 50 degrees C. CONCLUSION Sustained accumulation of HSP70 proteins results in predatory phytoseiid mites with the thermotolerance advantage that could promote their biological control function to pests. The divergent constitutive regulation of HSP70 to a thermal environment is conducive to the flexible adaptability of predators in the higher trophic level to trade off under extremely adversity stress.

AB  - How does recent climate warming and climate variability alter fitness, phenotypic selection and evolution in natural populations? We combine biophysical, demographic and evolutionary models with recent climate data to address this question for the subalpine and alpine butterfly, Colias meadii, in the southern Rocky Mountains. We focus on predicting patterns of selection and evolution for a key thermoregulatory trait, melanin (solar absorptivity) on the posterior ventral hindwings, which affects patterns of body temperature, flight activity, adult and egg survival, and reproductive success in Colias. Both mean annual summer temperatures and thermal variability within summers have increased during the past 60 years at subalpine and alpine sites. At the subalpine site, predicted directional selection on wing absorptivity has shifted from generally positive (favouring increased wing melanin) to generally negative during the past 60 years, but there is substantial variation among years in the predicted magnitude and direction of selection and the optimal absorptivity. The predicted magnitude of directional selection at the alpine site declined during the past 60 years and varies substantially among years, but selection has generally been positive at this site. Predicted evolutionary responses to mean climate warming at the subalpine site since 1980 is small, because of the variability in selection and asymmetry of the fitness function. At both sites, the predicted effects of adaptive evolution on mean population fitness are much smaller than the fluctuations in mean fitness due to climate variability among years. Our analyses suggest that variation in climate within and among years may strongly limit evolutionary responses of ectotherms to mean climate warming in these habitats.

AB  - We report the first measures of thermotolerance (recorded as percentage mortality and induced HSP70 production) for pelagic larvae of three populations of the New Zealand greenshell (green-lipped) mussel Perna canaliculus. Our goal was to determine whether distinct populations of P. canaliculus were more susceptible to predicted climate change than others, and whether such patterns of susceptibility were either genetically controlled (local adaptation of populations) or simply reflect the acclimatory capacity of this species. F2 larvae from three P. canaliculus populations (D'Urville Island, Banks Peninsula and Stewart Island) were subjected to an acute thermal challenge (3h exposure to a fixed temperature in the range 20-42 degrees C). No latitudinal patterns in either percentage mortality or HSP70 protein production were apparent. For all populations, larval mortality (LT50) was between 32.9 and 33.9 degrees C, with significant amounts of HSP70 induction only occurring in those individuals that experienced temperatures of 40 degrees C or greater. The data presented therefore do not support the hypothesis that genetic adaptation of P. canaliculus to distinct thermal environments will be reflected by a corresponding difference in acute heat tolerance. In fact, the apparently vulnerable veligers show a surprisingly wide thermal safety margin. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the effects of ocean warming upon this species, subsequent studies should consider the impacts of sub-lethal stress upon fitness in addition to chronic thermal challenge and, crucially, the response of sedentary juvenile and adult stages.

AB  - Dispersal capacity is a key life-history trait especially in species inhabiting fragmented landscapes. Evolutionary models predict that, given sufficient heritable variation, dispersal rate responds to natural selection imposed by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we estimate phenotypic variance components and heritability of flight and resting metabolic rates (RMRs) in an ecological model species, the Glanville fritillary butterfly, in which flight metabolic rate (FMR) is known to correlate strongly with dispersal rate. We modelled a two-generation pedigree with the animal model to distinguish additive genetic variance from maternal and common environmental effects. The results show that FMR is significantly heritable, with additive genetic variance accounting for about 40% of total phenotypic variance; thus, FMR has the potential to respond to selection on dispersal capacity. Maternal influences on flight metabolism were negligible. Heritability of flight metabolism was context dependent, as in stressful thermal conditions, environmentally induced variation dominated over additive genetic effects. There was no heritability in RMR, which was instead strongly influenced by maternal effects. This study contributes to a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of dispersal-related traits, a pressing question in view of the challenges posed to many species by changing climate and fragmentation of natural habitats.

AB  - The African fig fly, Zaprionus indianus, was first recorded in fig orchards in Brazil in 1999, at the Valinhos region, in the State of Sao Paulo. In view of the scarcity of biological data on this insect in Brazil, the objective of this research was to study the biology, temperature requirements, and to estimate the number of Z. indianus annual generations for the main fig producing regions of Brazil, aimed at controlling the pest. The insects were reared on artificial diet at constant temperatures of 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, and 32 degrees C, relative humidity 80 +/- 10%, and 14-h photophase. Duration of the development stages was variable with temperature, being longer at the lower temperatures. Temperature also influenced viability during the larval and pupal stages and the egg-adult biological cycle, with significant differences between 32 degrees C and the other temperature conditions. The lower temperature development threshold (TT) and thermal constant (K) values for the egg, larval, and pupal stages were 9.7 and 10.5; 9.2 and 148.6, and 10.7 degrees C and 66.25 DD, respectively, for a total thermal constant of 262.2 DD for the egg-adult biological cycle. Based on a lower temperature development threshold of 7.9 degrees C., Z. indianus may have up to 16.6, 12.4, and 12.7 annual generations in the regions of Valinhos-SP, Pelotas-RS, and Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso-MG, respectively, which are traditionally known as fig producing regions in the country.

AB  - We estimated thermal developmental thresholds (T-0) and degree-day (DD) constants for the immature stages of two tephritid pests, Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) and Ceratitis capitata (Weidenmann). Males of both species were trapped in an Egyptian guava orchard during the fruiting seasons of 2016 and 2017 and trap catches were compared with peak flights predicted by the DD model based on local weather data. Ceratitis capitata had faster development than B. zonata at 20 and 25 degrees C, but their overall developmental rate was similar at 30 and 35 degrees C. The thermal threshold of development (T-0) of B. zonata was higher than that of C. capitata, indicating greater sensitivity to cold. Although 35 degrees C yielded the fastest development of both species, survival was higher at 30 degrees C, with B. zonata experiencing a slight advantage, suggesting better tropical adaptation. Immature development of B. zonata and C. capitata was estimated to require 338 and 373 d, respectively, and 616 and 424 DD for a complete generation. Trap catches over both seasons showed good correspondence to peaks of fly activity predicted by the DD models; deviations from expectation ranged from 0 to 7 d for both fly species. Both species had four overlapping generations per season, with B. zonata abundance peaking in the first generation in both years, but only in 2016 for C. capitata. The models predict about eight and 12 generations per year in northeast Egypt for B. zonata and C. capitata, respectively. These models should be useful for timing pest control measures to coincide with periods of peak fly activity in fruit orchards.

AB  - Development of molecular genetic markers provides aquaculture with tools for a number of research and practical applications. Genetic marking of experimental groups allows their evaluation in the same rearing units, increasing statistical power within limited research infrastructure. Parentage can be inferred for individuals in mixed-progeny groups, quantifying the contributions of individual parents and supporting the estimation of sire and dam effects. Building upon parentage assignment, walk-back selection entails retention of the best members of each family as broodstock for the next generation. Molecular markers can be used to detect the segregation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and knowledge of such linkages can be used for marker-assisted selection. Gene expression profiling can identify genes affecting traits of interest, providing candidates for QTL or functional analysis. Purposeful genetic marking can be used to identify proprietary stocks, marketed products, and fish out-planted or escaping into natural ecosystems. Although each application has been demonstrated, genetic markers are not routinely used in commercial aquaculture. The limited practical application can be explained by the limited development of broodstocks; for most aquaculture species, the small size and limited scope of most aquaculture operations, and the costs of genetic screening.

AB  - For the realization of complex renewable energy systems (such as nano-fluids based direct absorption solar collector), an evolutionary system identification method such as genetic programming (GP) can be applied to develop mathematical models/functional relationships between the process parameters. The system complexity is attributed to interaction among the design variables influencing the outputs. There are also uncertainties in the system due to random and unknown variations in the design and response variables. GP suffers from the higher complexity structure of its solutions and non-optimal convergence, which leads to poor fitness values. Therefore, to address these uncertainties and problems, the framework based on the model selection criteria approximated genetic programming (MSC-GP) is proposed for the formulation of geometry design based thermal efficiency and entropy generation optimization function for direct absorption solar collector (DASC) system. In this proposed method, the four mathematical model selection criteria are used as an approximation for objective functions in GP framework for the evaluation of fitting degree and structure of the model. The results based on statistical measures (best fitness, mean fitness, standard deviation of fitness, number of nodes) show that models obtained from the mathematical selection criteria, Predicted Residual error sum of squares (PRESS), have performed the best. Based on Pareto front analysis of PRESS function, it is found that the best objective values and the number of nodes of models (complexity) follows more or less gradually slow increasing trend which is a good symbolic desirable sign of minimal increase of complexity of model with a decrease in objective values as the values of generation increases. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the main factor affecting the efficiency of DASC is its geometry of the structure. 3-D interaction analysis shows that increasing the thickness, length and reducing the width of the collector can make the system maintain its higher thermal efficiency and a smaller entropy generation, which is useful for the optimized operation of DASC. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is applied in the acquisition of the optimal geometric settings of DASC system based on the selected models. The optimal settings achieved is 5 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and 2 cm in thickness. Systems when operated using these settings results in a satisfactory performance with 77.8117% in thermal efficiency and 6.0004E + 3 in entropy generation).

AB  - Variation in climate, particularly temperature, is known to affect the genetic composition of populations. Although there have been many studies of latitudinal variation, comparisons of populations across altitudes or seasons, particularly for animal species, are less common. Here, we study genetic variation (microsatellite markers) in populations of Drosophila buzzatii collected along altitudinal gradients and in different seasons. We found no differences in genetic variation between 2 years or between seasons within years. However, there were numerous cases of significant associations between allele frequencies or expected heterozygosities and altitude, with more than half showing nonlinear relationships. While these associations indicate possible selection and local altitudinal adaptation, direct tests gave strong evidence for selection affecting two loci and weaker evidence for five other loci. Two loci that are located within an inversion (including the one with strongest evidence for selection) show a linear increase in genetic diversity with altitude, likely due to thermal selection. Parallel associations with altitude here and with latitude in Australian populations indicate that selection is operating on chromosomal regions marked by some of the loci.

AB  - Thermal biology research compares field with laboratory data to elucidate the evolution of temperature-sensitive traits in ectotherms. The hidden challenge of many of these studies is discerning whether animals actively thermoregulate, since motivation is not typically assessed. By studying the behaviours involved in thermoregulation, we can better understand the mechanisms underlying body temperature control. Using an integrative approach, we assessed the thermoregulatory and thermotactic behaviours of two sympatric snake species with contrasting life histories: the generalist Eastern Garter Snake (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis (Linnaeus, 1758)) and the semi-fossorial Northern Red-bellied Snake (Storeria occipitomaculata occipitomaculata (Storer, 1839)). We expected that thermoregulatory behaviours would be optimized based on life history, in that T. s. sirtalis would show higher evidence for thermally oriented behaviours than S. o. occipitomaculata due to its active nature. Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis actively thermoregulated, had higher thermal preferences (29.4 +/- 2.5 vs. 25.3 +/- 3.6 degrees C), and was more active than S. o. occipitomaculata, which showed relatively low evidence for thermotaxis. Our results build on the notion that evaluating movement patterns and rostral orientation towards a heat source can help ascertain whether animals make thermally motivated choices. Our data provide insight into the thermoregulatory strategies used by snakes with different life histories and maximize the information provided by behavioural thermoregulation experiments.

AB  - Contemporary theory for thermal adaptation of ectothermic metazoans focuses on the maximization of energy gain and performance (locomotion and foraging). Little consideration is given to the selection for mechanisms that minimize resting energy loss in organisms whose energy gain is severely constrained. We tested a hypothetical framework for thermal performance of locomotor activity (a proxy for energy gain) and resting metabolism (a proxy for energy loss) in energetically compromised snails in the littoral fringe zone, comparing this with existing theory. In contrast to theory, the thermal ranges and optima for locomotor performance and metabolic performance of Echinolittorina malaccana are mismatched, and energy gain is only possible at relatively cool temperatures. To overcome thermal and temporal constraints on energy gain while experiencing high body temperatures (23-50 degrees C), these snails depress resting metabolism between 35 and 46 degrees C (thermally insensitive zone). The resulting bimodal relationship for metabolism against temperature contrasts with the unimodal or exponential relationships of most ectotherms. Elevation of metabolism above the breakpoint temperature for thermal insensitivity (46 degrees C) coincides with the induction of a heat shock response, and has implications for energy expenditure and natural selection. Time-dependent mortality is initiated at this breakpoint temperature, suggesting a threshold above which the rate of energy demand exceeds the capacity for cellular energy generation (rate of ATP turnover). Mortality in a thermal range that elevates rather than limits aerobic metabolism contrasts with the hypothesis that cellular oxygen deficiency underlies temperature-related mortality. The findings of this study point to the need to incorporate aspects of resting metabolism and energy conservation into theories of thermal adaptation.

AB  - The ability of populations to adapt to environmental change and the spatial scale at which this adaptation occurs are fundamentally important issues in evolutionary biology, and ones that may benefit greatly from the study of genetic variability in reaction norms, which represent the plasticity of phenotypic traits across an environmental gradient. Therefore variable reaction norms can reflect genetic differences in the ability of individuals, families, populations, and species to respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental change. Fishes are ideal organisms in which to study plasticity because of their remarkable intraspecific morphological, physiological, behavioural, and life history variation. Here, we review studies demonstrating genetic variability in reaction norms in fishes. Genetic variability in plasticity among full- and half-sib families suggests potential for some populations to develop an adaptive norm of reaction (recalling that plasticity need not be adaptive). Reaction norm variability among populations suggests that adaptive genetic divergence can occur rapidly when selection pressures are strong and that the spatial scale of adaptation is much smaller than previously believed for some species with high dispersal capabilities. These studies demonstrate the potential of using reaction norms to study the evolution of novel phenotypes and the influence of temporal environmental variability and gene flow on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, which can then be used to predict how populations will respond to directional environmental change. To promote future research into genetic variability in reaction norms, we propose questions that would benefit from such an approach and discuss some important considerations for designing experiments to investigate questions related to genetic variation in plasticity and phenotypic evolution.

AB  - Adaptation to stressful environments is one important factor influencing species invasion success. Tolerance to one stress may be complicated by exposure to other stressors experienced by the preceding generations. We studied whether parental temperature stress affects tolerance to insecticide in the invasive Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Field-collected pyrethroid-resistant beetles were reared under either stressful (17 degrees C) or favourable (23 degrees C) insecticide-free environments for three generations. Then, larvae were exposed to pyrethroid insecticides in common garden conditions (23 degrees C). Beetles were in general tolerant to stress. The parental temperature stress alone affected beetles positively (increased adult weight) but it impaired their tolerance to insecticide exposure. In contrast, offspring from the favourable temperature regime showed compensatory weight gain in response to insecticide exposure. Our study emphasizes the potential of cross-generational effects modifying species stress tolerance. When resistant pest populations invade benign environments, a re-application of insecticides may enhance their performance via hormetic effects. In turn, opposite effects may arise if parental generations have been exposed to temperature stress. Thus, the outcome of management practices of invasive pest species is difficult to predict unless we also incorporate knowledge of the evolutionary and recent (preceding generations) stress history of the given populations into pest management.

AB  - Many invasive species may be constrained in their ability to invade high latitude or elevation habitats due to limits of cold tolerance. However, isolated populations at the edge of these species' geographic ranges may face a combination of strong selection and lack of maladaptive gene flow that allows them to adapt to the cold and invade further. Here we show that an isolated population of Gambusia affinis (on Cape Cod, MA, USA), one of the most invasive fish in the world, can survive temperatures lower than any reported tolerances for other populations, with large, long-lived females showing more tolerance than males. Indeed, male acute cold tolerance appears insufficient, suggesting the population may persist through winters mainly via the ability of mated females to delay offspring production until spring. This combination of female cold tolerance and life history may open the door for further expansion of this invasive species into high latitude freshwater habitats.

AB  - Developmental stability, or homeostasis, facilitates the production of consistent phenotypes by buffering against stress. Fluctuating asymmetry is produced by developmental instability and is manifested as small random departures from bilateral symmetry. Increased fluctuating asymmetry is thought to parallel compromised fitness, in part, because stress promotes energy dissipation. Compensatory energy expenditures within the organism are required to complete development, thus promoting instability through reductions in homeostasis. Increased heterozygosity may enhance developmental stability by reducing energy dissipation from stress through increased metabolic efficiency, possibly by providing greater flexibility in metabolic pathways.
   Traditionally, fluctuating asymmetry has been used as a bioindicator of chronic stress, provided that selective mortality of less fit individuals did not reduce stress-mediated increases in fluctuating asymmetry to background levels produced by natural developmental error, or create data inconsistencies such as higher asymmetry in groups exposed to lower stress. Unfortunately, absence of selective mortality and its effects, while often assumed, can be difficult to substantiate. We integrated measures of early growth, mortality, fluctuating asymmetry (mandibular pores, pectoral finrays, pelvic finrays, and gillrakers on the upper and lower arms of the first branchial arch) and directional asymmetry (branchiostegal rays) to assess chronic thermal stress (fluctuating temperatures as opposed to ambient temperatures) in developing eggs from two different coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) stocks and their reciprocal hybrids. Hybridization provided insight on the capacity of heterozygosity to reduce stress during development.
   Although egg losses were consistently higher in crosses exposed to fluctuating temperatures, egg mortality was predominantly a function of maternal stock of origin. Post-hatch losses were higher in crosses exposed to ambient temperatures than in crosses exposed to fluctuating temperatures during embryogenesis. Observed patterns of early growth revealed no heterosis. but instead reflected maternal effects, with some crosses slowing growth and yolk utilization when exposed to fluctuating temperatures. Analyses of fluctuating asymmetry also showed no effects from heterosis. While analyses of composite asymmetry scores and branchiostegal rays were inconclusive, analyses of individual characters showed significantly higher fluctuating asymmetry in pelvic finray counts and a marginal change in the numbers of fish asymmetric for this character in crosses exposed to chronic thermal stress. In contrast, the fluctuating asymmetry. in lower gillraker counts was significantly higher in crosses exposed to ambient temperatures and there were significantly more fish asymmetric for this character. Data on mortalities and fluctuating asymmetry indicate pelvic finray development was thermally stressed, while the heightened fluctuating asymmetry in lower gillraker counts under ambient temperatures was due to a greater frequency of less fit fish that had not been culled by thermal stress. Changes in early growth patterns in response to developmental stress yielded no parallel responses in meristic characters.
   We conclude that chronic thermal stress produced both selectively lethal and sublethal effects that directly shaped fluctuating asymmetry and fitness profiles in these crosses. Implicit in this conclusion is that developmental instability analyses can detect more than just chronic sublethal stress, thus providing substantial credence for using instability studies as proactive bioassessment methodologies.

AB  - What factors influence the ability of populations to adapt to extreme environments that lie outside their current tolerance limits? We investigated this question by exposing experimental populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli to lethally high temperatures. We asked: (1) whether we could obtain thermotolerant mutants with an extended upper thermal limit by this selective screen; (2) whether the propensity to obtain thermotolerant mutants depended on the prior selective history of the progenitor genotypes; and (3) how the fitness properties of these mutants compared to those of their progenitors within the ancestral thermal niche. Specifically, we subjected 15 independent populations founded from each of six progenitors to 44 degrees C; all of the progenitors had upper thermal limits between about 40 degrees C and 42 degrees C. Two of the progenitors were from populations that had previously adapted to 32 degrees C, two were from populations adapted to 37 degrees C, and two were from populations adapted to 41-42 degrees C. All 90 populations were screened for mutants that could survive and grow at 44 degrees C. We obtained three thermotolerant mutants, all derived from progenitors previously adapted to 41-42 degrees C. In an earlier study,we serendipitously found one other thermotolerant mutant derived from a population that had previously adapted to 32 degrees C. Thus, prior selection at an elevated but nonlethal temperature may predispose organisms to evolve more extreme thermotolerance, but this is not an absolute requirement. It is evidently possible to obtain mutants that tolerate more extreme temperatures, so why did they not become prevalent during prior selection at 41-42 degrees C, near the upper limit of the thermal niche? To address this question, we measured the fitness of the thermotolerant mutants at high temperatures just within the ancestral niche. None of the four thermotolerant mutants had an advantage relative to their progenitor even very near the upper limit of the thermal niche; in fact, all of the mutants showed a noticeable loss of fitness around 41 degrees C. Thus, the genetic adaptations that improve competitive fitness at high but nonlethal temperatures are distinct from those that permit tolerance of otherwise lethal temperatures.

AB  - To accurately predict the impact of environmental change, it is necessary to assay effects of key interacting stressors on vulnerable organisms, and the potential resiliency of their populations. Yet, for the most part, these critical data are missing. We examined the effects of two common abiotic stressors predicted to interact with climate change, salinity and temperature, on the embryonic survival and development of a model freshwater vertebrate, the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from different populations. We found that salinity and temperature significantly interacted to affect newt embryonic survival and development, with the negative effects of salinity most pronounced at temperature extremes. We also found significant variation among, and especially within, populations, with different females varying in the performance of their eggs at different salinity-temperature combinations, possibly providing the raw material for future natural selection. Our results highlight the complex nature of predicting responses to climate change in space and time, and provide critical data towards that aim.

AB  - Water temperature is one of the main abiotic factors affecting the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems and its alteration can have important effects on biological communities. Macroinvertebrates are excellent bio-indicators and have been used for decades to assess the status of aquatic ecosystems as a result of environmental stresses; however, their responses to temperature are poorly documented and have not been systematically evaluated. The aims of this review are: (i) to collate and summarize responses of freshwater macroinvertebrates to different temperature conditions, comparing the results of experimental and theoretical studies; (ii) to understand how the focus of research on the effects of temperature on macroinvertebrates has changed during the last 51 years; and (iii) to identify research gaps regarding temperature responses, ecosystem types, organism groups, spatiotemporal scales, and geographical regions to suggest possible research directions. We performed a comparative assessment of 223 publications that specifically consider freshwater macroinvertebrates and address the effects of temperature. Short-term studies performed in the laboratory and focusing on insects exposed to a range of temperatures dominated. Field studies were carried out mainly in Europe, at catchment scale and almost exclusively in rivers; they mainly investigated responses to water thermal regime at the community scale. The most frequent biological responses tested were growth rate, fecundity and the time and length of emergence, whereas ecological responses mainly involved composition, richness, and distribution. Thermal research on freshwater macroinvertebrates has undergone a shift since the 2000s when studies involving extended spatiotemporal scales and investigating the effects of global warming first appeared. In addition, recent studies have considered the effects of temperature at genetic and evolutionary scales. Our review revealed that the effects of temperature on macroinvertebrates are manifold with implications at different levels, from genes to communities. However, community-level physiological, phenological and fitness responses tested on individuals or populations should be studied in more detail given their macroecological effects are likely to be enhanced by climate warming. In addition, most field studies at regional scales have used air temperature as a proxy for water temperature; obtaining accurate water temperature data in future studies will be important to allow proper consideration of the spatial thermal heterogeneity of water bodies and any effects on macroinvertebrate distribution patterns. Finally, we found an uneven number of studies across different ecosystems and geographic areas, with lentic bodies and regions outside the West underrepresented. It will also be crucial to include macroinvertebrates of high-altitude and tropical areas in future work because these groups are most vulnerable to climate warming for multiple reasons. Further studies on temperature-macroinvertebrate relationships are needed to fill the current gaps and facilitate appropriate conservation strategies for freshwater ecosystems in an anthropogenic-driven era.

AB  - In this paper, a genetic algorithm- (GA-) based approach is discussed for designing heat sinks based on total heat generation and dissipation for a pre-specified size and shape. This approach combines random iteration processes and genetic algorithms with finite element analysis (FEA) to design the optimized heat sink. With an approach that prefers "survival of the fittest", a more powerful heat sink can be designed which can cool power electronics more efficiently. Some of the resulting designs can only be 3D printed due to their complexity. In addition to describing the methodology, this paper also includes comparisons of different cases to evaluate the performance of the newly designed heat sink compared to commercially available heat sinks.

AB  - 1. Pemphigus bursarius exhibits a host-alternating life-cycle, overwintering as eggs on the primary host plant (poplar) before migrating in summer to the secondary host plant (mainly annual Compositae). A proportion of the population does not produce return migrants (sexuparae) in the autumn but remains in the soil and overwinters as asexual apterae, even after the annual plants have died in early winter. Laboratory and field experiments investigated the biology and overwintering success of these asexual apterae.
   2. Both temperature and photoperiod are important in morph determination. The highest number of apterae (approximately 50% of progeny) was produced in a 20 degrees C, LD 18:6 h regime. Very few apterae were produced in an alatae-inducing environment (15 degrees C, LD 12:12 h), but the proportion increased over successive generations.
   3. Apterae remaining in the soil in the autumn overwintered successfully in large numbers and were able to reinfest directly the root systems of newly planted lettuce grown in the same field in the following growing season.
   4. Overwintered asexual populations also produced alates in July, which were able to colonise other lettuce plants, indicating that they were not sexuparae. Hence, P. bursarius can avoid the ecological dead-end that would occur through local patch extinction. Clones can therefore persist indefinitely as both asexual apterae and alatae without the need to return to poplar and undergo the sexual phase of the life-cycle.

AB  - Hydrothermal scheduling is a standard problem in the operation of power systems. With the integration of renewable resources, like solar and/or wind to the existing hydro-thermal system, there is a need for a dedicated approach for long-term generation scheduling of the integrated system. Long-term generation scheduling of hydro-thermal-solar systems at the grid level has not been reported so far. This paper discusses a Hydrothermal-Solar Scheduling (HTSS) algorithm for the same. The algorithm is a two-stage formulation using dynamic programming and linear programming techniques. This generic methodology can be used for assessing the impact of large-scale rooftop solar-PV integration with a hydrothermal system, in terms of the electricity energy mix, generation schedules and the annual generation-costs of the concerned system. It has been illustrated by application to the problem of integration of a large-scale rooftop solar photovoltaic scenario with the existing Mumbai sub-system.
   The results show a significantly higher annual generation-cost saving, achieved by integrating the large-scale rooftop solar photovoltaic scenario via the proposed HTSS algorithm. The benefits, however, reduce with increasing penetrations of solar in the electricity energy-mix. The annual generation-cost savings have also been used for estimating the upper cap on feed-in tariffs for solar generation, and the financial viability indicators for the large-scale rooftop solar photovoltaic scenario; the corresponding internal rate of return is found to decline from 18.4% to 16.6% as the share of solar-PV in the electricity energy-mix of Mumbai increases from 2.8% to 13.9%.

AB  - Cane trash could viably substitute fossil fuels in heat and power generation projects to avoid air pollution from open burning and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. It is competitive with bituminous and other agro-industrial biomass. Using cane trash for heat generation project could provide a higher reliability and return on investment than power generation project. The heat generation project could be viable (Financial Internal Rate of Return, FIRR = 36-81%) without feedstock subsidy. With current investment and support conditions, the capacity of 5 MW option of power generation project is the most viable (FIRR = 13.6-15.3%); but 30 MW, 1 MW and 10 MW options require feedstock subsidy 450-1100 Baht/t-cane trash to strengthen financial viability. Furthermore, the revenue from carbon credit sales could compensate the revenue from current energy price adder and increases 0.5-1.0% FIRR of power generation project. Using cane trash for 1 MW power generation could reduce GHG emission 637-861 t CO(2)eq and avoid air pollutant emissions of 3.35 kg nitrogen oxides (NOx), 0.41 kg sulfur oxides (SOx) and 2.05 kg volatile organic compounds (VOC). Also, it steam generation from cane trash could avoid pollutant emissions of 0.6 kg NOx, 0.07 kg SOx, and 0.37 kg VOC. The potential of cane trash to cause fouling/slagging as well as erosion are not significantly different from other biomass, but chlorinated organic compounds and NOx could be higher than bituminous and current biomass feedstock at sugar mill (bagasse and rice husk).

AB  - The viability of solar thermal steam generation for thermal enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) in heavy-oil sands was evaluated using San Joaquin Valley, CA data. The effectiveness of solar TEOR was quantified through reservoir simulation, economic analysis, and life-cycle assessment. Reservoir simulations with continuous but variable rate steam injection were compared with a base-case Tulare Sand steamflood project. For equivalent average injection rates, comparable breakthrough times and recovery factors of 65% of the original oil in place were predicted, in agreement with simulations in the literature. Daily cyclic fluctuations in steam injection rate do not greatly impact recovery. Oil production rates do, however, show seasonal variation. Economic viability was established using historical prices and injection/production volumes from the Kern River oil field. For comparison, this model assumes that present day steam generation technologies were implemented at TEOR startup in 1980. All natural gas cogeneration and 100% solar fraction scenarios had the largest and nearly equal net present values (NPV) of $12.54 B and $12.55 B, respectively. Solar fraction refers to the steam provided by solar steam generation. Given its large capital cost, the 100% solar case shows the greatest sensitivity to discount rate and no sensitivity to natural gas price. Because there are very little emissions associated with day-to-day operations from the solar thermal system, life-cycle emissions are significantly lower than conventional systems even when the embodied energy of the structure is considered. We estimate that less than 1 g of CO2/MJ of refined gasoline results from the TEOR stage of production if solar energy provides all steam. By this assessment, solar thermal or supplemental solar generation systems appear to be a preferred alternative to fully conventional systems using natural gas in areas with large solar insolation.

AB  - Resilience to climate change depends on a species' adaptive potential and phenotypic plasticity. The latter can enhance survival of individual organisms during short periods of extreme environmental perturbations, allowing genetic adaptation to take place over generations. Along the U.S. East Coast, estuarine-dependent spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) populations span a steep temperature gradient that provides an ideal opportunity to explore the molecular basis of phenotypic plasticity. Genetically distinct spotted seatrout sampled from a northern and a southern population were exposed to acute cold and heat stress (5 biological replicates in each treatment and control group), and their transcriptomic responses were compared using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The southern population showed a larger transcriptomic response to acute cold stress, whereas the northern population showed a larger transcriptomic response to acute heat stress compared with their respective population controls. Shared transcripts showing significant differences in expression levels were predominantly enriched in pathways that included metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and immune response. In response to heat stress, only the northern population significantly upregulated genes in the apoptosis pathway, which could suggest greater vulnerability to future heat waves in this population as compared to the southern population. Genes showing population-specific patterns of expression, including hpt, acot, hspa5, and hsc71, are candidates for future studies aiming to monitor intraspecific differences in temperature stress responses in spotted seatrout. Our findings contribute to the current understanding of phenotypic plasticity and provide a basis for predicting the response of a eurythermal fish species to future extreme temperatures.

AB  - Laboratory studies of coke breeze distribution in iron ore sinter charges were carried out with the objective to get sinters having metallurgical properties which are improved versus those generally achieved with a homogeneous coke breeze distribution in the charge which is being preferred for heat generation in sintering.
   The produced sinters were,subjected to shatter and reduction tests as well as to chemical and petrographic studies. Conclusions drawn showed that a concentration of the lower charge layer to a coke breeze of 10-to-15% by weight yielded a sinter cake having a higher strength and productivity than that of a relevant sinter cake having been produced from a charge with a homogeneous coke breeze distribution.

AB  - Extreme thermal environments harm the health and reduce the productivity of outdoor workers. Variations in human physiological indices and the thermal exposure time limit are the main factors in evaluating heat safety in an extreme thermal environment. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the relationships between human physiological indices, psychological responses, and thermal parameters to accurately predict and evaluate human thermal safety in extreme thermal environments. A field survey, including thermal parameter measurements, was conducted at construction sites in South China during the summer of 2019. The relationship between health risk and thermal parameters was obtained, and the adaptability and sensitivity of workers to i) thermal parameters (outdoor ambient temperature (T-a), mean radiant temperature (T-mrt), wind speed (V-a\), and relative humidity (RH)) and ii) physiological indicators (heart rate (HR) and auditory canal temperature (ACT)), as well as the variations in their cognitive ability, were analyzed. The results indicate that 40 % of workers experienced discomfort and that when T-a>34 degrees C, the working intensity of workers needs to be reduced in construction sites. The HR and ACT increased with increasing working hours, and the thermal parameters and cognitive ability decreased. To avoid discomfort, it is suggested that the HR may be kept near 94 beats/min. The effects of physiological indicators and cognitive ability on the physical and mental state of the workers were significant; with an increase in thermal environment parameters, the efficiency decreased by approximately 8%. The results of this investigation are beneficial for ensuring the occupational safety of workers and reducing the risk of heat exposure.

AB  - This paper assesses the viability of providing down and up spinning reserves by renewable energy resources (RES) in island power systems. The process consists of evaluating the impact of providing spinning reserve on the system operation costs of different islands by simulating the unit commitment problem. The assessment is carried out for La Palma (small size) and Tenerife (medium size) island power systems, and by considering different wind source availability scenarios for sample weeks of different seasons in current and future years. This paper differentiates between up and down reserves and studies their impacts separately. Results show that enabling RES to provide just down spinning reserve has economic benefits for all scenarios, by reducing over 40% the amount of thermal generation and over 30% the systems costs for high wind scenarios. It also confirms that employing variable deloading of wind energy as a source of up reserve is advisable, mainly in scenarios with high share of wind sources. In some scenarios, using RES as reserve provider, reduces the amount of thermal generation more than 50%, compared to when RES does not participate as a source of reserve, and can even lead to a full RES coverage of demand.

AB  - The onset of exogenous feeding, when juveniles emerge from the gravel, is a critical event for salmonids where early emergence and large size provide a competitive advantage in the wild. Studying 131 farmed, hybrid and wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon families, originating from four wild populations and two commercial strains, we investigated whether approximately 10 generations of selection for faster growth has also resulted in increased somatic growth prior to the onset of exogenous feeding. In addition, we tested whether relaxed selection in farms has allowed for alterations in hatching time between farmed and wild salmon. Across three cohorts, wild salmon families hatched earlier than farmed salmon families, while hybrid families displayed intermediate hatching times. While the observed differences were small, i. e., 1-15 degree-days (0-3 days, as water temperatures were c. 5-6 degrees C), these data suggest additive genetic variation for hatching time. Alevin length prior to exogenous feeding was positively related to egg size. After removal of egg size effects, no systematic differences in alevin length were observed between the wild and farmed salmon families. While these results indicate additive genetic variation for egg development timing, and wild salmon families consistently hatched earlier than farmed salmon families, these differences were so small they are unlikely to significantly influence early life history competition of farmed and wild salmon in the natural environment. This is especially the case given that the timing of spawning among females can vary by several weeks in some rivers. The general lack of difference in size between farmed and wild alevins, strongly suggest that the documented differences in somatic growth rate between wild and farmed Norwegian Atlantic salmon under hatchery conditions are first detectable after the onset of exogenous feeding.

AB  - Background: When introduced to novel environments, the ability for a species to survive and rapidly proliferate corresponds with its adaptive potential. Of the many factors that can yield an environment inhospitable to foreign species, phenotypic response to variation in the thermal climate has been observed within a wide variety of species. Experimental evolution studies using bacteriophage model systems have been able to elucidate mutations, which may correspond with the ability of phage to survive modest increases/decreases in the temperature of their environment.
   Results: Phage Phi X174 was subjected to both elevated (50 degrees C) and extreme (70 degrees C+) temperatures for anywhere from a few hours to days. While no decline in the phage's fitness was detected when it was exposed to 50 degrees C for a few hours, more extreme temperatures significantly impaired the phage; isolates that survived these heat treatments included the acquisition of several mutations within structural genes. As was expected, long-term treatment of elevated and extreme temperatures, ranging from 50-75 degrees C, reduced the survival rate even more. Isolates which survived the initial treatment at 70 degrees C for 24 or 48 hours exhibited a significantly greater tolerance to subsequent heat treatments.
   Conclusions: Using the model organism Phi X174, we have been able to study adaptive evolution on the molecular level under extreme thermal changes in the environment, which to-date had yet to be thoroughly examined. Under both acute and extended thermal selection, we were able to observe mutations that occurred in response to excessive external pressures independent of concurrently evolving hosts. Even though its host cannot tolerate extreme temperatures such as the ones tested here, this study confirms that Phi X174 is capable of survival.

AB  - Ocean warming is causing declines of coral reefs globally, raising critical questions about the potential for corals to adapt. In the central equatorial Pacific, reefs persisting through recurrent El Nino heatwaves hold important clues. Using an 18-year record of coral cover spanning three major bleaching events, we show that the impact of thermal stress on coral mortality within the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) has lessened over time. Disproportionate survival of extreme thermal stress during the 2009-2010 and 2015-2016 heatwaves, relative to that in 2002-2003, suggests that selective mortality through successive heatwaves may help shape coral community responses to future warming. Identifying and facilitating the conditions under which coral survival and recovery can keep pace with rates of warming are essential first steps toward successful stewardship of coral reefs under 21st century climate change.

AB  - Climate change is impacting the composition and functioning of virtually every ecosystem on Earth, and disrupting the productivity of exploited ones. Species are rapidly adjusting to their changing environments through evolutionary and/or plastic phenotypic changes in behavioural, physiological, phenological and life-history traits. Size-selective harvest produces severe demographic impacts on exploited populations and induces individual phenotypic changes in many of the same fitness-related traits as climate change and thus can impair local adaptation and acclimation. We addressed in the context of inland recreational fisheries two interrelated questions: (1) Will fisheries-induced phenotypic changes operate at different rates and direction than those induced by climate change, and thus hinder local adaptation and acclimation, threatening population persistence?; (2) which harvest regulations most likely lead to overexploitation of populations under the new environmental conditions?
   We used an eco-genetic individual-based model to simulate the consequences of size-selective fishing for a cold-water fish species brown trout Salmo trutta across a range of regulatory (defined by exploitation rate and size-based limits) and environmental scenarios (warming vs. concurrent warming and streamflow reduction) in a Mediterranean system. We ran 1,620 combinations of fishing and environmental scenarios and analysed results using artificial neural networks.
   In our simulations, (a) climate change and size-selective fishing both led to a reduced, truncated population, with increased juvenile but decreased adult growth and earlier maturation at smaller size, but fisheries-induced changes were stronger than those produced by climate change; (b) their effects were additive or dampened but rarely synergistic and (c) phenotypic changes in fitness-related traits resulted from both evolutionary and plastic processes.
   Synthesis and applications. Our model-based analyses highlight that any size-selective fishing regime would lead to the overexploitation of cold-water freshwater fish populations if climate warming is accompanied by streamflow reduction-as projected in Mediterranean fisheries. Even if we assumed no future streamflow regime changes, only a limited range of size-based harvest regulations may provide an acceptable balance between conservation and fishery objectives. Thus, recreational fisheries of cold-water fish in Mediterranean climates might be more sustainably managed under climate change if conservation-oriented strategies based on harvest bans (e.g. catch-and-release fishing) were implemented.

AB  - An important question in evolutionary ecology is to understand the drivers of phenotypic variation in contrasting environments. Disentangling plasticity from evolutionary responses in such contexts provides a better understanding of how organisms adapt to changing climates. Many aspects of the seasonal ecology of insect populations are essential for their persistence in temperate environments, including their capacity to overwinter. Phenotypic plasticity should result in locally adapted diapause levels to experienced environmental conditions. Using an outdoor reciprocal translocation experimental design, we compared diapause expression of Canadian and French populations of aphid parasitoid species of the genus Aphidius in both their native and foreign bioclimatic regions, the insects thus experiencing varying temperature conditions under similar latitude (i.e. same photoperiod). From June to December 2016, diapause and mortality levels were recorded every 2 weeks. We found both genotypic (population origins) and environmental effects (experimental locations) on diapause reaction norms of parasitoid species. The incidence of diapause was higher in Canadian populations (up to 90%) than in French populations (< 20%) at both locations, suggesting local adaptation to harsh (Canadian populations) or mild (French populations) winter climatic conditions in the area of origin. Phenotypic plasticity played an important role in mediating diapause incidence at different temperatures but similar photoperiods, as diapause was induced at higher levels in Canada than in France, independently of the origin of the parasitoid. We conclude that both plastic and evolutionary responses could be involved in the adaptation of parasitoid overwintering strategies to different thermal environments and to ongoing climate warming.

AB  - Intraspecific adaptation in Abies sachalinensis was examined using models based on long-term monitoring data gathered during a reciprocal transplant experiment with eight seed source populations and six transplantation sites along an altitudinal gradient. The consequence of local adaptation was evaluated by testing the home-site advantage for upslope and downslope transplants at five ages. The populations fitness-linked trait was set as their productivity (tree height x survival rate) at each age. The effects of global warming were evaluated on the basis of the 36-year performance of downslope transplants. Evidence was found for adaptive genetic variation affecting both height and survival from an early age. Increasing the distance between seed source and planting site significantly reduced productivity for both upslope and downslope transplantation, demonstrating the existence of a significant home-site advantage. The decrease in productivity was most distinct for upslope transplantations, indicating strong local adaptation to high altitudes. Global warming is predicted to increase the productivity of high-altitude populations. However, owing to their existing local adaptation, all tested populations exhibited lower productivity under warming than demes that were optimal for the new climate. These negative predictions should be considered when planning the management of locally adapted plant species such as A. sachalinensis.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consists of few but vital maternally inherited genes that interact closely with nuclear genes to produce cellular energy. How important mtDNA polymorphism is for adaptation is still unclear. The assumption in population genetic studies is often that segregating mtDNA variation is selectively neutral. This contrasts with empirical observations of mtDNA haplotypes affecting fitness-related traits and thermal sensitivity, and latitudinal clines in mtDNA haplotype frequencies. Here, we experimentally test whether ambient temperature affects selection on mtDNA variation, and whether such thermal effects are influenced by intergenomic epistasis due to interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, using replicated experimental evolution inCallosobruchus maculatusseed beetle populations seeded with a mixture of different mtDNA haplotypes. We also test for sex-specific consequences of mtDNA evolution on reproductive success, given that mtDNA mutations can have sexually antagonistic fitness effects. Our results demonstrate natural selection on mtDNA haplotypes, with some support for thermal environment influencing mtDNA evolution through mitonuclear epistasis. The changes in male and female reproductive fitness were both aligned with changes in mtDNA haplotype frequencies, suggesting that natural selection on mtDNA is sexually concordant in stressful thermal environments. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of mtDNA.

AB  - Adaptation via natural selection is an important driver of evolution, and repeatable adaptations of replicate populations, under conditions of a constant environment, have been extensively reported. However, isolated groups of populations in nature tend to harbor both genetic and physiological divergence due to multiple selective pressures that they have encountered. How this divergence affects adaptation of these populations to a new common environment remains unclear. To determine the impact of prior genetic and physiological divergence in shaping adaptive evolution to accommodate a new common environment, an experimental evolution study with the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) was conducted. Two groups of replicate populations with genetic and physiological divergence, derived from a previous evolution study, were propagated in an elevated-temperature environment for 1,000 generations. Ancestor populations without prior experimental evolution were also propagated in the same environment as a control. After 1,000 generations, all the populations had increased growth rates and all but one had greater fitness in the new environment than the ancestor population. Moreover, improvements in growth rate were moderately affected by the divergence in the starting populations, while changes in fitness were not significantly affected. The mutations acquired at the gene level in each group of populations were quite different, indicating that the observed phenotypic changes were achieved by evolutionary responses that differed between the groups. Overall, our work demonstrated that the initial differences in fitness between the starting populations were eliminated by adaptation and that phenotypic convergence was achieved by acquisition of mutations in different genes.
   IMPORTANCE Improving our understanding of how previous adaptation influences evolution has been a long-standing goal in evolutionary biology. Natural selection tends to drive populations to find similar adaptive solutions for the same selective conditions. However, variations in historical environments can lead to both physiological and genetic divergence that can make evolution unpredictable. Here, we assessed the influence of divergence on the evolution of a model sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, in response to elevated temperature and found a significant effect at the genetic but not the phenotypic level. Under- standing how these influences drive evolution will allow us to better predict how bacteria will adapt to various ecological constraints.

AB  - It is pressing to understand how animal populations evolve in response to climate change. We argue that new sequencing technologies and the use of historical samples are opening unprecedented opportunities to investigate genome-wide responses to changing environments. However, there are important challenges in interpreting the emerging findings. First, it is essential to differentiate genetic adaptation from phenotypic plasticity. Second, it is extremely difficult to map genotype, phenotype, and fitness. Third, neutral demographic processes and natural selection affect genetic variation in similar ways. We argue that Drosophila melanogaster, a classical model organism with decades of climate adaptation research, is uniquely suited to overcome most of these challenges. In the near future, long-term time series genome-wide datasets of D. melanogaster natural populations will provide exciting opportunities to study adaptation to recent climate change and will lay the groundwork for related research in non-model systems.

AB  - Six lines of the bacterium Escherichia coli were propagated for 2,000 generations in a temporally varying environment. The imposed environmental regime consisted of alternating days at 32 degrees C and 42 degrees C, with rapid transitions between them. These derived lines are competitively superior to their ancestor in this variable temperature regime. We also measured changes in the fitness of these lines, relative to their common ancestor, in both the constant (32 degrees C and 42 degrees C) and transition (from 32 degrees C to 42 degrees C and from 42 degrees C to 32 degrees C) components of this temporally varying environment, to determine whether the bacteria had adapted to the particular constant temperatures or the transitions between them, or both. The experimentally evolved lines had significantly improved fitness in each of the constant environmental components (32 degrees C and 42 degrees C). However, the experimental lines had not improved in making the sudden temperature transitions that were a potentially important aspect of the temporally variable environment. In fact, fitness in making at least one of the transitions (between 32 degrees C and 42 degrees C) unexpectedly decreased. This reduced adaptation to the abrupt transitions between these temperatures is probably a pleiotropic effect of mutations that were responsible for the increased fitness at the component temperatures. Among the six experimental lines, significant heterogeneity occurred in their adaptation to the constant and transition components of the variable environment.

AB  - Climate change brings with it unprecedented rates of increase in environmental temperature, which will have major consequences for the earth's flora and fauna. The Odonata represent a taxon that has many strong links to this abiotic factor due to its tropical evolutionary history and adaptations to temperate climates. Temperature is known to affect odonate physiology including life-history traits such as developmental rate, phenology and seasonal regulation as well as immune function and the production of pigment for thermoregulation. A range of behaviours are likely to be affected which will, in turn, influence other parts of the aquatic ecosystem, primarily through trophic interactions. Temperature may influence changes in geographical distributions, through a shifting of species' fundamental niches, changes in the distribution of suitable habitat and variation in the dispersal ability of species. Finally, such a rapid change in the environment results in a strong selective pressure towards adaptation to cope and the inevitable loss of some populations and, potentially, species. Where data are lacking for odonates, studies on other invertebrate groups will be considered. Finally, directions for research are suggested, particularly laboratory studies that investigate underlying causes of climate-driven macroecological patterns.

Chips with rectangular channels of approximately 260 mu m high by 350 mu m wide produced a droplet size of 130 +/- 12 mu m at a rate of 7.9 +/- 0.6 drops per second. Integrated water heating and cooling systems were efficient at regulating channel temperature, preventing the coalescence of droplets within the device without any need for surfactants. HepG2 cell viability two hours after microgel generation was 96.5%.

AB  - Maintaining reliability of power supply is a big challenge when renewable energy sources (RES) are integrated in the traditional power grid. Allocation of adequate storage of energy is essential in order to maintain power balance with changing demand levels and uncertain and intermittent renewable power generation. After the Kyoto protocol on climate change there is global focus on limiting emissions from fossil fuels. As a result increasing number of RES is being integrated with existing power grids. Their intermittent and uncertain nature however creates difficulty in maintaining reliability particularly when large scale integration of these resources is planned. Efficient energy storage systems are therefore essential to store surplus power when renewable generation is in abundance and to release it during periods when renewable generation is insufficient. This paper explores the viability of operating wind farm coupled with compressed air energy storage (CAES) system to meet the demand in a reliable manner and control the electricity prices during peak loads. The optimal dispatch of thermal units is computed using an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) such that all thermal, wind generator and CAES system constraints are satisfied. A 24-hour dispatch period is considered by applying thermal generator ramp-rate limits between consecutive time periods. Two separate models are employed for optimizing cost and profit. The proposed method is tested on a test power system consisting of six thermal generating units integrated with 50 wind turbines.

AB  - Adult flies of Drosophila melanogaster were examined for their tolerance to direct (cold-shock) and indirect chilling (chilling) injury. An exponential increase in mortality with low temperatures occurs. Chilling tolerance (T-ch) at 4 or 0 degrees C was 6.3 days or 37.91 h for 50% survival (LT(50)), respectively, while the cold-shock tolerance (LT(50) of T-cs) at -7 degrees C was only 1.5 h. The increase in cold-shock tolerance (T-cs) at -7 degrees C by acclimation at 4, or 0 degrees C was rapid: the LT(50) increased about 50% with only 2 h of treatment in comparison with the highest LT(50) obtained by acclimation. An equilibrium point (T-eq), the optimal acclimation time for maximal survival of chilling and/or cold-shock, was calculated from the survival data of experiments designed to assess T-ch and T-cs The T-eq was found to be the half time of the acclimation period which resulted in 90% mortality at the chilling temperature (LT(90) of T-ch). Selection for tolerance to cold-shock or chilling over several generations resulted in a significant increase in T-cs or T-ch, respectively. Higher contents of glycogen and total proteins were observed in the cold selected lines than in the control line. Exposure to chilling temperatures eventually depleted the energy reserves, but the highest concentrations of triacylglycerols and proteins were observed at the acclimation time with the highest T-cs. This suggests that systemic regulation in these energetic reserves may be an important part of the cold-hardening mechanisms to cope with the fluctuations of low temperatures causing cold-shock or chilling injury.

AB  - Adult-overwintering insects show diversity in the occurrence of reproductive diapause of males. Mating can occur both before and after winter in different species, and pre-winter mating allows males to reproduce without overwintering. In a pierid butterfly, Eurema mandarina, both diapause and non-diapause male adults emerge in the late autumn generation. Diapause females mate with non-diapause males before winter and re-mate with diapause males the following spring. Although this species is distributed from sub-tropical regions to cool-temperate regions, the geographic variation of this characteristic mating system has not been examined. A rearing experiment and a field survey were conducted to determine the geographic patterns of the mating system of the late autumn generation of E. mandarina for various populations from sub-tropical to cool temperate regions. Non-diapause males were observed in the late autumn generation in all populations examined. The frequency of pre-winter mating of females was not correlated with latitude. These results show that the mating system of the late autumn generation is similar among various populations distributed over a wider range, suggesting that the characteristic mating system may be evolutionarily stable.

AB  - The cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), which is native to North America, emerged as a major invasive insect pest of multiple crops in Asia at the beginning of the 21st century. Considering the economic significance of this insect and its rapid worldwide spread, we examined the possible factors driving its invasions. In this paper, we summarize the life history traits of P. solenopsis conceivably related to population development in invaded regions; these traits include its use of diverse host plants, reproductive capacity and mode, adaptation to temperature, response to food shortage, and insecticidal resistance. Then, focusing on the multiple trophic interactions that may promote or hinder invasion, we review the mutualistic relationship of this mealybug with ants and predation and parasitism by natural enemies. Finally, we suggest topics for future research and provide our perspective on the biological invasions of this mealybug. We speculate that specific biological factors associated with this mealybug, particularly its wide host range, high reproductive potential, evolved changes in life history traits, and mutualism with ants have played important roles in its invasions, allowing this pest to become established and rapidly increase its population upon its introduction into new regions.

AB  - This work studies the economic feasibility of using a hybrid solar energy system to satisfy the thermal demand in industrial processes. From an artificial intelligence perspective, a modeling and computational optimization methodology was developed for the design of a hybrid solar thermal plant. Modeling is applied to satisfy the needs of a pasteurization process in the region of Jalisco, Mexico. Scenarios with four different types of fossil fuels used in the backup system were analyzed. According to the optimization results, all the backup fossil fuel scenarios demonstrate economic viability. Furthermore, the present value studies indicate that under the appropriate climatic conditions, for the four auxiliary fuel scenarios, the optimization methodology can produce economically attractive configurations of the solar thermal plant for investors. The presented methodological procedure can be easily adapted and used to analyze the financial competitiveness of other solar thermal technologies for the industrial heat generation.

AB  - Rising environmental temperatures associated with climate change can adversely affect sea turtles whose hatchling sex determination is temperature-dependent. One hypothetical response of sea turtles to near-future elevated temperatures is a shift in nesting distribution to maintain suitable thermal conditions. Assessing sea turtle responses to climate warming involves evaluating (1) how temperatures will be altered, (2) a species' capacity to respond to changes, and (3) whether responses can mitigate the impacts of warming. We evaluated sand temperatures across nesting habitat of the Critically Endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys kempii in the western Gulf of Mexico. Most nesting now occurs on a 30 km stretch of beach in Tamaulipas, Mexico, but was historically more widely distributed. Applying conservative projections, we assessed whether a shift in the epicenter of nesting to the northern extent of the present distribution would maintain incubation temperatures below lethal levels and suitable to produce hatchlings of both sexes. Coupling temperature measurements with known impacts of temperature on the reproductive physiology of L. kempii, we predict that northern beaches will initially support the production of mixed sex ratios. However, the rapid rate of warming and long generation time for L. kempii make a shift in nesting unlikely to ultimately mitigate the effects of elevated temperatures on hatchling sex ratios and mortality. The limited thermal profile of the restricted L. kempii nesting range, and temperature-dependent sex determination, make this sea turtle particularly vulnerable to climate change. This vulnerability provides the opportunity to gain insights on strategies for the survival of thermally sensitive species in a warming world.

AB  - This article provides the first comprehensive assessment of methods for the creation of weather variables for use in building simulation. We undertake a critical analysis of the fundamental issues and limitations of each methodology and discusses new challenges, such as how to deal with uncertainty, the urban heat island, climate change and extreme events. Proposals for the next generation of weather files for building simulation are made based on this analysis. A seven-point list of requirements for weather files is introduced and the state-of-the-art compared to this via a mapping exercise. It is found that there are various issues with all current and suggested approaches, but the two areas most requiring attention are the production of weather files for the urban landscape and files specifically designed to test buildings against the criteria of morbidity, mortality and building services system failure.Practical application: Robust weather files are key to the design of sustainable, healthy and comfortable buildings. This article provides the first comprehensive assessment of their technical requirements to ensure buildings perform well in both current and future climates.

AB  - Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable natural resource available. Materials for solar photothermal energy conversion are highly sought after for their cost savings, clean environment, and broad utility in providing water heating and/or steam for many applications including domestic water heating and solar-driven desalination. Water desalination via solar steam generation is considered one of the most important technologies to address the increasing pressing global water scarcity. The current solar thermal systems rely on the use of copper or aluminum for absorbers which have limited utility because of their inflexibility for tailored applications, high cost, and limited availability. These bulk metals are not very efficient in absorbing the solar spectrum. Therefore, the current solar thermal desalination devices have low efficiency and low water productivity due to the ineffectiveness of solar collectors to convert most of the sun energy into heat. Herein, we report the development of a new generation of highly efficient, flexible, low weight, highly porous, and cost-effective plasmonic graphene polyurethane (PGPU) nanocomposite materials for solar steam generation through the efficient evaporation of surface water pools. The PGPU nanocomposites contain metallic nanoparticles that exhibit very strong solar absorption. The metal nanoparticles (0.2 wt %) incorporated within the 0.5 wt % graphene oxide (GO)-polyurethane (GOPU) nanocomposites absorb sunlight much more efficiently than bulk metals or carbon materials. Subsequent nonradiative relaxation causes absorbed energy to be converted into heat which can be controlled by the size, shape, and organization of the metal nanoparticles within the PGPU materials. The polyurethane (PU) foam provides a hydrophilic surface with abundant microporous structure, excellent thermal insulation properties, and facile and scalable synthesis. The PGPU nanocomposites are produced as porous foams that float on top of the evaporating water pools which significantly enhance the absorption of the solar energy and the high solar thermal conversion efficiency. The PGPU nanocomposites containing 0.2 wt % Au and Ag nanoparticles are demonstrated to be among the most efficient solar thermal converters reported to date for solar water desalination. The Au/Ag-PGPU foams exhibit average water evaporation rates of 1.00, 6.59, and 11.34 kg m(-2) h(-1) with superb solar thermal efficiencies of up to 63%, 88%, and 96.5%, under 1, 5, and 8 sun illumination, respectively. Furthermore, the PGPU foams display stable evaporation rates over more than 10 repeated evaporation cycles without any performance decline. The high solar thermal evaporation efficiency, excellent stability, and long-time durability make the PGPU nanocomposites excellent candidates for applications in solar steam generation and seawater desalination.

AB  - Brine is usually exist in the oil reservoir. Varying salinity brine are used as stimulants for heavy oil recovery processes using electromagnetic induction heating. The heated heavy oil is floating on top of the brine since it becomes less viscous and lighter. As the temperature increased, more heavy oil is "produced/recovered". An increasing salinity of brine will result in more recovery of heavy oil

AB  - Data from nine studies were compiled to evaluate the effects of selection for postweaning weight on some carcass characteristics in experimental herds of selected Nellore (NeS), control Nellore (NeC), Caracu (CaS), Guzerah (GuS) and Gir (GiS) breeds from Instituto de Zootecnia genetic selection program. After the feeding performance test ( 168 days after weaning), samples of bulls (n= 490) from the progeny groups born between 1992 and 2000 were selected for finishing period and slaughtered. Treatments were different across studies. Meta-analysis was conducted with a random coefficients model in which herd was considered a fixed effect and treatments within year and progeny groups as random effects. Slaughter, empty body, hot carcass and cold carcass weights were higher for NeS and CaS, intermediate for GuS and lower for NeC e GiS. CaS bulls had higher proportions of forequarter and spare ribs and lower proportion of hindquarter than the other groups.

AB  - An operation of a brake at robust thermal loads leads to high-temperature gradients in brake components. This in turn may induce thermal stresses due to thermal expansion. In this article, both uncoupled and coupled problems of thermoelasticity for the frictional heat generation in disk brakes and clutches using the finite element method are presented and analyzed. The article covers a wide range of studies providing the concluding remarks and key factors affecting a change in the distribution of stresses in different types of the disk brakes and clutches, operating parameters, materials, etc.

AB  - 1. We examined the responses of two species of Daphnia to changes in food phosphorus (P) content, with animals reared at three different water temperatures. Specifically, we measured mass-specific growth rate (MSGR), body P content and respiration rate of Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex acclimatised to 10, 17.5 and 25 degrees C and fed food carbon : phosphorus (C : P) ratios of either 150 or 500.
   2. The responses of these three physiological variables to temperature-food quality interactions were species-specific. There was a significant interactive effect of temperature and food quality on D. magna, as the greatest proportional effect of food quality on growth was observed at 10 degrees C and reductions in body P because of low food P content were relatively greater at 25 degrees C. These effects may reflect the temperature dependence of mechanisms that reduce elemental constraints associated with food quality in D. magna. By contrast, there were no interactive effects between food quality and temperature on MSGR, body P or mass-specific respiration of D. pulex.
   3. It thus appears that temperature can alter food quality effects on Daphnia but the nature of these alterations depends upon the daphniid species and its thermal adaptability. Significant temperature-food quality interactions will complicate efforts to understand zooplankton nutrition in nature and warrant future consideration.

AB  - 1. Most temperate insects undergo diapause at a specific developmental stage to overcome severe winters. The bruchine beetle Bruchidius dorsalis in a warmer region in Japan, however, has diverse over-wintering stages-non-diapausing larvae, diapausing larvae, and diapausing adults, whereas in a cooler region, it over-winters only as the final instar larva or adult in diapause.
   2. The geographical pattern of over-wintering stages in 12 populations was investigated over a wide range along the mainland of Japan. It revealed that a distinct geographical pattern of over-wintering stages exists in relation to temperature conditions. In regions with warmer climates, the proportion of non-diapausing larvae increased and B. dorsalis had a more complex over-wintering stage structure.
   3. Life cycles were also compared between two areas of Japan by field experiments. In the cooler area, the first generation over-wintered in the diapausing larval or adult stage. Conversely, in the warmer area, diapause was induced later and some of the first-generation adults produced second-generation offspring before over-wintering.
   4. Based on the geographical cline of climates and the differences in cold hardiness among stages, we can demonstrate that the over-wintering stage variation among and within populations results from an adaptive timing of diapause induction in each region, because the late larval or adult diapauses protect pupae or eggs-which unlike other stages are not cold hardy-from being produced late in the season.

AB  - The potential of environmental adaptation as a survival mechanism enabling a human-derived probiotic Lactobacillus strain to withstand heat stress and spray drying was investigated. Heat-adapted (52 degreesC for 15 min) L. paracasei NFBC 338 exhibited 300- and 700-fold greater thermotolerance (survival at a lethal temperature of 60 degreesC) compared with controls, in. MRS and reconstituted skim milk (RSM), respectively. The level of thermal protection in RSM by pre-adaptation in hydrogen peroxide (0.003 M), salt (0.3 M NaCl) and bile salts (0.1% w/v) was also examined. Although not as efficient as the homologous stress, the levels of cross protection were in the order heat > salt > hydrogen peroxide > bile. Viability of the heat-adapted L. paracasei NFBC 338 in RSM was enhanced 18-fold during spray drying at outlet temperatures of 95-105 degreesC, while salt-adapted cultures exhibited 16-fold greater viability than controls. These results highlight the potential of preconditioning treatments for maximizing survival of probiotic bacteria during development of probiotic functional foods. The cross protection afforded by salt against thermal stress may indicate that certain common protective mechanisms are induced by both heat and salt stress. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Thermal reaction norms pervade organismal traits as stereotyped responses to temperature, a fundamental environmental input into sensory and physiological systems. Locomotory behavior represents an especially plastic read-out of animal response, with its dynamic dependence on environmental stimuli presenting a challenge for analysis and for understanding the genomic architecture of heritable variation. Here we characterize behavioral reaction norms as thermal performance curves for the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae, using a collection of 23 wild isolate genotypes and 153 recombinant inbred lines to quantify the extent of genetic and plastic variation in locomotory behavior to temperature changes. By reducing the dimensionality of the multivariate phenotypic response with a function-valued trait framework, we identified genetically distinct behavioral modules that contribute to the heritable variation in the emergent overall behavioral thermal performance curve. Quantitative trait locus mapping isolated regions on Chromosome II associated with locomotory activity at benign temperatures and Chromosome V loci related to distinct aspects of sensitivity to high temperatures, with each quantitative trait locus explaining up to 28% of trait variation. These findings highlight how behavioral responses to environmental inputs as thermal reaction norms can evolve through independent changes to genetically distinct modular components of such complex phenotypes.

AB  - Evolution depends on the acquisition of genomic mutations that increase cellular fitness. Here, we evolved Escherichia coli MG1655 cells to grow at extreme temperatures. We obtained a maximum growth temperature of 48.5 degrees C, which was not increased further upon continuous cultivation at this temperature for >600 generations. Despite a permanently induced heat shock response in thermoresistant cells, only exquisitely high GroEL/GroES levels are essential for growth at 48.5 degrees C. They depend on the presence of lysyl-tRNA-synthetase, LysU, because deletion of lysU rendered thermoresistant cells thermosensitive. Our data suggest that GroEL/GroES are especially required for the folding of mutated proteins generated during evolution. GroEL/GroES therefore appear as mediators of evolution of extremely heat-resistant E. coli cells.

AB  - The intercooled cycle (IC) as an alternative to the simple cycle recuperated (SCR) and intercooled cycle recuperated (ICR) is yet to be fully analyzed for the purpose of assessing its viability for utilization within Generation IV nuclear power plants (NPPs). Although the benefits are not explicitly obvious, it offers the advantage of a very high overall pressure ratio (OPR) in the absence of a recuperator. Thus, the main objective of this study is to analyze various pressure ratio configurations, the effects of varying pressure ratio including sensitivity analyses of component efficiencies, ambient temperature, component losses and pressure losses on cycle efficiency, and specific work of the IC, including comparison with the SCR and ICR. Results of comparison between the IC and the SCR and ICR derived that the cycle efficiencies are greater than the IC by similar to 4% (SCR) and similar to 6% (ICR), respectively. However, the pressure losses for IC are lower when compared with the SCR and ICR. Nonetheless, heat from the turbine exit temperature of the IC can be used in a processing plant including the possibility of higher turbine entry temperatures (TETs) to significantly increase the cycle efficiency in a bid to justify the business case. The analyses intend to bring to attention an alternative to current cycle configurations for the gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs) and very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), where helium is the coolant. The findings are summarized by evaluating the chosen pressure ratio configurations against critical parameters and detailed comparison with the SCR and ICR.

AB  - Concentrated solar power plants (CSPs) are gaining momentum due to their potential of power generation throughout the day for base load applications in the desert regions with extremely high direct normal irradiance (DNI). Among various types of the CSPs, solar tower power technologies are becoming the front runners especially in the United States and around the world with the possibility to compete with traditional power generation technologies in terms of efficiency and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). A bibliometric analysis of the publications on the CSP systems and components since 1990 shows a total of 6400+ publications and reveals an exponential growth due to reasons that CSP systems promises a lot of potential as the future large scale power source for varied applications. This review consolidates the benefits and challenges of the CSP technologies particularly in the desert regions. Thorough literature analysis as well as the meteorological data projects the trend that the CSP systems would become a reality in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Australia, Southwestern region of the United States, Southwestern part of China and China/Mongolia border with high direct normal irradiance. However, enormous amount of support and capital investments are needed for making these CSP systems realistic as there is not much power grid network in existence. It is evident that there are multiple challenges specifically in water consumption, materials design and development for the optimum heat transfer fluid, thermal energy storage and receiver subsystems in addition to commercial viability and environmental impacts. Each of the challenges is discussed in detail and suggestions are made to address the challenges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The temperature-dependent development of Aproceros leucopoda Takeuchi, 1939 (Hymenoptera: Argidae), an invasive pest of elms in Europe, was studied in the laboratory on Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila) at six constant temperatures (10.9, 15.0, 19.5, 23.0, 24.3 and 27.0 degrees C) and at a photoperiod of 16L:8D. The larvae of the species developed through 4-7 instars, and it was the 6th instar individuals of which continued their development at the highest rate. The developmental threshold (T-min) and the thermal constant (K) were determined by the linear model and Lactin-2 model for egg, larval, prepupal and pupal stages and one whole generation. The estimated values of T-min and K by the two models for one generation were 7.3 and 7.1 degrees C, and 426.5 and 432.7 degree-days, respectively. Based on the survival and fecundity rates, the optimal temperature range for the species may be expected to be between 15.0 and 19.5 degrees C. Allowing for the period of diapause, it was estimated that A.leucopoda might potentially develop through up to four or five generations per year in Hungary. These results may contribute to the better understanding of the biology of an invasive alien species in Europe.

AB  - Under the background of continual global warming, mass summer mortalities of aquatic organisms have become more frequent, causing serious ecological and economic losses. Abalone aquaculture has experienced such losses, and thus, thermal-tolerant species are needed for mechanistic research and selective breeding programs. Hence, suitable methods to evaluate the thermal tolerance of abalone have become vitally important. In this study, a high-throughput evaluation method (heat adhesion duration, HAD) was developed based on the adhesion capacity of abalone. The stability and accuracy of the new method were verified by comparisons of survival time, Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Positive correlations were found between HAD and survival time and between HAD and ABT, indicating that individuals with higher HAD were more thermal tolerant. The HAD values increased with acclimation temperature (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C) but were not affected by abalone size, age, or sex. The assessments of HAD, ABT, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated stronger thermal tolerance of the southern population (JJ) of Haliotis discus hannai compared to the northern population (DL), suggesting plasticity of abalone in thermal tolerance. In addition, the thermal resistance of five abalone species from two hybridization systems, H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (GG), H. fulgens (FF), hybrid H. gigantea female x H. discus hannai male (GD), and hybrid H. discus hannai female x H. fulgens male (DF), was evaluated by HAD and ABT, confirming the existence of heterosis for thermal tolerance. The high throughput method developed in this study could provide a reliable indicator for molecular mechanism analyses and genetic selection for thermal tolerance in abalone.

AB  - Background: Physiological costs of rapid growth may contribute to the observation that organisms typically grow at submaximal rates. Although, it has been hypothesized that faster growing individuals would do worse in dealing with suboptimal temperatures, this type of cost has never been explored empirically. Furthermore, the mechanistic basis of the physiological costs of rapid growth is largely unexplored.
   Methodology/Principal Finding: Larvae of the damselfly Ischnura elegans from two univoltine northern and two multivoltine southern populations were reared at three temperatures and after emergence given a cold shock. Cold resistance, measured by chill coma recovery times in the adult stage, was lower in the southern populations. The faster larval growth rates in the southern populations contributed to this latitudinal pattern in cold resistance. In accordance with their assumed role in cold resistance, Hsp70 levels were lower in the southern populations, and faster growing larvae had lower Hsp70 levels. Yet, individual variation in Hsp70 levels did not explain variation in cold resistance.
   Conclusions/Significance: We provide evidence for a novel cost of rapid growth: reduced cold resistance. Our results indicate that the reduced cold resistance in southern populations of animals that change voltinism along the latitudinal gradient may not entirely be explained by thermal selection per se but also by the costs of time constraint-induced higher growth rates. This also illustrates that stressors imposed in the larval stage may carry over and shape fitness in the adult stage and highlights the importance of physiological costs in the evolution of life-histories at macro-scales.

AB  - Theory predicts that environmental heterogeneity offers a potential solution to the maintenance of genetic variation within populations, but empirical evidence remains sparse. The live-bearing fish Xiphophorus variatus exhibits polymorphism at a single locus, with different alleles resulting in up to five distinct melanistic tailspot patterns within populations. We investigated the effects of heterogeneity in two ubiquitous environmental variables (temperature and food availability) on two fitness-related traits (upper thermal limits and body condition) in two different tailspot types (wild-type and upper cut crescent). We found gene-by-environment (G x E) interactions between tailspot type and food level affecting upper thermal limits (UTL), as well as between tailspot type and thermal environment affecting body condition. Exploring mechanistic bases underlying these G x E patterns, we found no differences between tailspot types in hsp70 gene expression despite significant overall increases in expression under both thermal and food stress. Similarly, there was no difference in routine metabolic rates between the tailspot types. The reversal of relative performance of the two tailspot types under different environmental conditions revealed a mechanism by which environmental heterogeneity can balance polymorphism within populations through selection on different fitness-related traits.

AB  - In many oviparous reptiles, thermal conditions inside nests influence phenotypic traits of hatchlings that are linked to survival. Maternal nest-site selection can therefore have long-term implications for offspring and maternal fitness. We studied nest-site selection in a nocturnal lizard (Amalosia lesueurii) from south eastern Australia. Females of this species lay their eggs communally inside rock crevices, and previous studies have shown that maximum daily nest temperatures are positively correlated with maximum daily air temperatures. The incubation period extends for up to 100 d, so during hot summers, embryos may be exposed to stressful thermal conditions. Potentially, mothers could buffer their eggs from thermal extremes via careful selection of nest sites. To evaluate this, we studied nest site selection in a southern population (Morton) and a northern population (Yengo) that experience mild and hot summers respectively. In the field, we measured the physical characteristics, orientation, canopy cover and incident radiation load, and thermal regimes of nest sites and randomly available crevices during one of the hottest Australian summers on record (2018-2019). We found strong inter population differences in the degree of canopy cover and solar radiation loads above nest sites. Nest sites from Morton were more open, and received higher radiation loads, than nest sites from Yengo. Mean nest temperatures were similar in Morton and Yengo, but nests from Yengo experienced higher daily temperatures than those from Morton. During heatwaves, temperatures in some nests exceeded the species critical thermal maximum (39.9 degrees C) for several hours each day. Our results show that females can adjust nest-site choice to match local environments, but future research is necessary to clarify whether exposure to high temperatures influences hatching success or offspring phenotypes in this species.

AB  - In this study, we propose a new surface generation model for carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTP) manufactured by the long fiber thermoplastic-direct (LFT-D) method. CFRTP are considered to be a next-generation structural material because of their high productivity as well as high mechanical strength and lightness. Conversely, CFRTP have a rough surface, which does not meet the automotive outer panel standard of a "class A surface." In the present study, we establish a surface roughness generation model based on a thermal shrinkage mismatch of thermoplastic resin to carbon fiber and non-uniform carbon fiber distribution. Furthermore, we construct a surface roughness estimation formula based on the model. In the calculation, a cross-sectional image of CFRTP is divided into many vertical segments. Subsequently, the thermal shrinkage of each segment is calculated with a standard deviation, an average, and a probability density of the amount of carbon fiber in each segment. The surface roughness of the manufactured CFRTP was measured using a surface profilometer. The result showed that the arithmetic surface roughness increased with the volume fraction of carbon fiber. We applied the surface roughness calculation to cross-sectional images of the specimens. Consequently, the estimated surface roughness showed the same tendency, in which the surface roughness increased with the volume fraction of carbon fiber. The slope of a regression line of the estimated surface roughness with respect to the volume fraction was 0.010, which was almost the same (0.011) as the slope of a regression line of the measured surface roughness. Furthermore, the estimation formula using a thermal shrinkage effective depth of 395 mu m was able to estimate the surface roughness within a 3% average error. Using the estimation formula, it was predicted that the surface roughness increased with the standard deviation of the amount of carbon fiber in a segment. To confirm the reliability of the model and the formula, we measured the standard deviation of the amount of carbon fiber in CFRTP specimens, showing that the trend for CFRTP specimens matched the estimated values.

AB  - Aims To understand the impact of storage temperature on recovery of Staphylococcus aureus on sampling swabs. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, but also causes a variety of life-threatening diseases. With a large pool of asymptomatic carriers and transmission that can occur even through indirect contact, mitigation efforts have had limited success. Swab sampling, followed by culturing, is a cornerstone of epidemiological studies, however, S. aureus viability on swabs stored at different temperatures has not been characterized.
   Methods and Results We determined survival rates on swabs stored at five different temperatures. Samples stored at -70 degrees C had no decay over time while samples stored at higher temperatures showed an exponential decay in viability. Mortality rates were greatest for swabs stored at 37 degrees C. Survival at intermediate temperatures (-20 to 20 center dot 5 degrees C) did not differ significantly, however, we observed more variation at higher temperatures.
   Conclusions To maximize recovery of S. aureus cells, samples should be stored at -70 degrees C or processed for culturing without delay.
   Significance and Impact of the Study Epidemiological studies of bacterial diseases are typically limited to determination of pathogen presence/absence, yet quantitative assessments of pathogen load and genetic diversity can provide insights into disease progression and severity, likelihood of transmission and adaptive evolutionary potential. For studies of S. aureus where time or access to a microbiology laboratory may delay culturing, deep freezing or timely culturing will maximize the degree to which sampling results reflect source status.

AB  - SUPP (Solar Updraft Tower power plant) is a technology in the power generation sector. The power productivity and efficiency represent important performance characteristics of SUPP. In the present work a mathematical model was developed to estimate the performance of SUPP based on tracking solar collector consideration in Malaysia. The objective is to verify the suggested model and to optimize the slope angle of tilted tracking solar collector. Basically, the hourly solar data were analysed considering solar azimuth angle for tracking case calculation to determine the solar energy incident on the collector. Then, the useful energy gain was calculated based on heat transfer relations. The model was validated with experimental work and well agreement was achieved. Results revealed that the SUPP of slope collector angle of 100 can produce higher power generation over the whole the year. Also, the tracking solar consideration enhanced the performance characteristics especially the power productivity by around 3.5 kW over that of fixed collector. The maximum collector and SUPP efficiencies of 51% and 0.165% respectively were obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Whether sexual selection impedes or aids adaptation has become an outstanding question in times of rapid environmental change and parallels the debate about how the evolution of individual traits impacts on population dynamics. The net effect of sexual selection on population viability results from a balance between genetic benefits of "good-genes" effects and costs of sexual conflict. Depending on how these facets of sexual selection are affected under environmental change, extinction of maladapted populations could be either avoided or accelerated. Here, we evolved seed beetles under three alternative mating regimes to disentangle the contributions of sexual selection, fecundity selection, and male-female coevolution to individual reproductive success and population fitness. We compared these contributions between the ancestral environment and two stressful environments (elevated temperature and a host plant shift). We found evidence that sexual selection on males had positive genetic effects on female fitness components across environments, supporting good-genes sexual selection. Interestingly, however, when males evolved under sexual selection with fecundity selection removed, they became more robust to both temperature and host plant stress compared to their conspecific females and males from the other evolution regimes that applied fecundity selection. We quantified the population-level consequences of this sex-specific adaptation and found evidence that the cost of sociosexual interactions in terms of reduced offspring production was higher in the regime applying only sexual selection to males. Moreover, the cost tended to be more pronounced at the elevated temperature to which males from the regime were more robust compared to their conspecific females. These results illustrate the tension between individual-level adaptation and population-level viability in sexually reproducing species and suggest that the relative efficacies of sexual selection and fecundity selection can cause inherent sex differences in environmental robustness that may impact demography of maladapted populations.

AB  - Studies on reptilian life-history evolution have emphasized the role of cold climates as a selective force for the evolution of viviparity, but have tended to neglect the many cold-climate reptiles that retain oviparity. Many of these species avoid low incubation temperatures by selecting warm nest-sites, and the evolution of viviparity (by uterine retention and maternal thermoregulation) is an extension of this strategy. However, an alternative pathway exists: reptiles may adapt to low-temperature incubation rather than avoid it. The scincid lizard Nannoscincus maccoyi from high-elevation areas of south-eastern Australia follows this alternative strategy. Field studies show that Nannoscincus selects cooler oviposition sites than does the sympatric heliothermic skink Bassiana duperreyi, owing to differences in the type of cover object (log vs. rock), the size of cover object and the depth to which eggs are buried. These interspecific differences in natural incubation regimes are reflected in the responses of laboratory-incubated eggs to incubation temperature. Bassiana eggs tolerate higher temperatures than do Nannoscincus eggs, but do not develop as rapidly at low temperatures. Incubation at lower temperatures produces a larger, faster hatchling in Nannoscincus, whereas the reverse is true in Bassiana. Thus, Nannoscincus and Bassiana follow different pathways to overcome the difficulties of reproducing in cold climates. Only the Bassiana pathway is likely to be compatible with the evolution of viviparity.

AB  - In order to characterize the dynamics of adaptation, it is important to be able to quantify how a population's mean fitness changes over time. Such measurements are especially important in experimental studies of evolution using microbes. The Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) with Escherichia coli provides one such system in which mean fitness has been measured by competing derived and ancestral populations. The traditional method used to measure fitness in the LTEE and many similar experiments, though, is subject to a potential limitation. As the relative fitness of the two competitors diverges, the measurement error increases because the less-fit population becomes increasingly small and cannot be enumerated as precisely. Here, we present and employ two alternatives to the traditional method. One is based on reducing the fitness differential between the competitors by using a common reference competitor from an intermediate generation that has intermediate fitness; the other alternative increases the initial population size of the less-fit, ancestral competitor. We performed a total of 480 competitions to compare the statistical properties of estimates obtained using these alternative methods with those obtained using the traditional method for samples taken over 50,000 generations from one of the LTEE populations. On balance, neither alternative method yielded measurements that were more precise than the traditional method.

AB  - Protective symbionts can allow hosts to occupy otherwise uninhabitable niches. Despite the importance of symbionts in host evolution, we know little about how these associations arise. Encountering a microbe that can improve host fitness in a stressful environment may favor persistent interactions with that microbe, potentially facilitating a long-term association. The bacterium Bacillus subtilis protects Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes from heat shock by increasing host fecundity compared to the nonprotective Escherichia coli. In this study, we ask how the protection provided by the bacterium affects the host's evolutionary trajectory. Because of the stark fitness contrast between hosts heat shocked on B. subtilis versus E. coli, we tested whether the protection conferred by the bacteria could increase the rate of host adaptation to a stressful environment. We passaged nematodes on B. subtilis or E. coli, under heat stress or standard conditions for 20 host generations of selection. When assayed under heat stress, we found that hosts exhibited the greatest fitness increase when evolved with B. subtilis under stress compared to when evolved with E. coli or under standard (nonstressful) conditions. Furthermore, despite not directly selecting for increased B. subtilis fitness, we found that hosts evolved to harbor more B. subtilis as they adapted to heat stress. Our findings demonstrate that the context under which hosts evolve is important for the evolution of beneficial associations and that protective microbes can facilitate host adaptation to stress. In turn, such host adaptation can benefit the microbe.

AB  - The most important boreal conifers of Eurasia are Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies incl. P. obovata) and Larches (Larix gmelinii and L. sibirica, incl. L. sukaczewii), all belonging to Pinaceae. All have a very large distribution and their ranges have contracted and expanded repeatedly under climatic changes during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Evolution has thus led to a large genetic variation and potential for reaction to environmental factors. Morphological, biochemical, molecular and adaptive variation has been observed but the mechanisms of the inheritance are only partly known. Simple patterns of inheritance are rare but negative correlations between useful characters are few. Long term provenance experiments in different conditions have revealed characters of adaptability useful in cultivation. Norway spruce seems to exceed Scots pine in genetic potential. The Larches have reacted variably. Within-population variability is in many cases considerable and for non-adaptive characters the genetic distance between populations of different geographic origin is small. The physiological mechanisms behind the adaptive features are only partly known but new experiments have thrown some light on the processes involved. Knowledge about reaction norms to climate may become important when considering the effects of a possible global warming.

AB  - To deliver steady electric power with decent quality, intelligent and healthy control schemes are greatly necessary for automatic generation control (AGC) of power systems therefore, this work presents the design of two degree of freedom based tilt integral derivative controller with filter for AGC. Firstly, a two-area reheat thermal model is considered, and the gain of the controller are optimized by adaptive differential evolution method. The advantage of the suggested approach is validated by equating results with latest published approaches such as symbiotic organism search algorithm and articial bee colony tuned PID controller. Further, the suggested method is extended to a three unequal area thermal model and the performance of results are equated with teaching-learning based optimization-PIDD and firey algorithm-PID for the identical model. Lastly, the experiment of the proposed scheme has been employed in real-time simulation using OPAL-RT, for validation of its viability and cogency.

AB  - The relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for explaining differences in trait distributions between populations is one of the major issues in evolutionary biology. In ectotherms, temperature can have a major impact on morphology, physiology, and life history strategies, and has often been inferred to explain differences between populations. In species with active thermoregulation, however, the ambient temperature may not be as important as the opportunity for thermoregulation. We studied growth in juvenile common lizards (Lacerta vivipara) originating from two environments differing in such thermal opportunity (i.e. day length). The populations differed significantly in their norms of reaction, with lizards experiencing long days in the wild showing a steeper increase in growth rate with increasing thermal opportunity. The environment with longer days also has a lower mean temperature in the wild, and in accordance with evolutionary predictions, lizards from this population had higher endurance at low temperatures. Both populations showed genetic variation in degree of phenotypic plasticity in growth rate as evident from the extensive crossing in norms of reaction.

AB  - Impoundments of free-flowing rivers for hydropower generation often confine fish to relatively small reaches that can restrict movement, limit habitat availability, and alter life history strategies. Here, acoustic telemetry was used to describe the seasonal habitat use, locomotory activity, and depth use for Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and Walleye (Sander vitreus) within an impounded reach on the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada. Lake Sturgeon foraged and overwintered in the riverine-lacustrine transitionary habitat as well as immediately below the tailrace of the upstream run-of-river facility. Walleye demonstrated high site fidelity to the upstream habitat situated near the tailrace of a hydropower facility. Contrary to Lake Sturgeon, that used multiple habitat types, Walleye used the tailrace for spawning, foraging, and overwintering, given their high residency rates throughout all months at this location. Activity for both species increased with water temperature and when residing in habitat types located farther upstream, but were minimally active during the winter season throughout the impounded reach. On average, Lake Sturgeon utilized 73% of the available depth while Walleye utilized 62% of the available depth across habitat types and months. Overall, the habitat located within the tailrace and below run-of-river facilities should be a conservation priority for both Lake Sturgeon and Walleye populations. There was persistent presence of Lake Sturgeon and Walleye throughout the spawning, foraging, and overwintering periods in the SSGS tailrace and within the first rkm downstream of the tailrace. The habitat proximal to run-of-river facilities generally encompasses small areas of the total potential habitat within impoundments, yet is important to both species studied here. The results provide information on the seasonal habitat use and biological responses to environmental cues for Lake Sturgeon and Walleye that will enhance management and ecological understanding for populations that are confined to impounded reaches.

AB  - The cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi Baly (Coleoptera:Chrysomelidae), a serious pest of crucifers in China, undergoes summer or winter diapause in the soil as an adult. In the present study, the incidence of diapause were measured in reciprocal crosses between a high-diapause strain (HD strain) and a laboratory-selected nondiapausing strain (ND strain) under different photoperiods and temperatures, to explore parental influences on the progeny diapause. Sensitivity to photoperiod in the selected nondiapausing strain was nearly eliminated at 25 degrees C, whereas sensitivity to temperature of the selected nondiapausing strain was retained under continuous darkness at 20 and 22 degrees C. Reciprocal crosses between the HD strain and the ND strain showed that the incidence of diapause in the progeny was always intermediate to that of the parents under different photoperiods and temperatures, suggesting that diapause induction was determined by both female and male parents. There was a significant effect of temperature; temperature interacted with reciprocal cross on diapause induction, whereas no significant effect of reciprocal cross was demonstrated. The incidence of diapause in female(ND) x male(HD) was the same as in female(HD) x male(ND) under continuous darkness at 18 degrees C (100%) and 26 degrees C (0%), but the former was higher than that in female(HD) x male(ND) under continuous darkness at 22 degrees C, suggesting that female parent does not exhibit strong influence on the diapause response to temperature. There was a significant effect of photoperiod and reciprocal cross on diapause induction, whereas no significant interactive effect on diapause induction was demonstrated. Incidence of diapause in female(HD) x male(ND) was always higher than in female(ND) x male(HD) at 25 degrees C and 12:12 L:D, 14:10 L:D, and 16:8 L:D, suggesting a strong maternal influence on the diapause response to photoperiod, though a significant difference was observed only at 14:10 L:D. Our results support the idea that diapause induction is determined by both female and male parents. However, results also indicated that a strong maternal influence on diapause was exhibited only in response to photoperiod.

AB  - The root weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) was reared on artificial diet under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. The Lower thermal threshold for development of neonate larvae was estimated to be 15 degrees C. The growth rate of neonate larvae increased exponentially with increasing temperature up to 30 degrees C. The growth rate of later instars, however, was suppressed at 30 degrees C and mortality was higher than that of larvae reared at 26 degrees C. Larvae reared as late instars only ( >56 d old ), or continuously at 30 degrees C, had increased mortality and produced smaller adults than larvae reared at 22 and 26 degrees C. Larvae reared as late instars only (>56 d) or continuously at 22 degrees C had similar survival rates compared with those reared at 26 degrees C, and they emerged as larger adults compared with larvae reared at 26 or 30 degrees C. The time required for development from neonate to pupation was 125 +/- 3 d (mean +/- SEM, n = 38) at 26 degrees C. Duration of the pupal stage was inversely proportional to temperature between 22 and 30 degrees C. Pupal mortality was higher at 30 degrees C than at 22 or 26 degrees C. The total time required for a single generation from oviposition to adult emergence was estimated to be 154 d at 26 degrees C and adequate humidity. Cumulative mean air and soil temperatures and rainfall for a location inr central Florida were analyzed and presented for the period October 1991 through January 1999.

AB  - Quantum random number generation (QRNG) harnesses the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanical phenomena. On-chip photonic circuitry provides a robust and versatile platform that can address and explore fundamental questions in quantum as well as classical physics. Likewise, integrated waveguide-based architectures hold the potential for intrinsically scalable, efficient and compact implementations of photonic QRNG. Here, we harness the quantum emission from the two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride an emerging atomically thin medium that can generate single photons on demand while operating at room temperature. By means of a customized splitter arrangement, we achieve true random number generation through the measurement of single photons exiting one of four designated output ports, and subsequently verify the randomness of the sequences in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology benchmark suite. Our results clearly demonstrate the viability and efficiency of this approach to on-chip deterministic random number generators.

AB  - This work analyzes the key performance of two different multi-chamber PVD systems used in volume WLP manufacturing. These are the Cluster-type and the Indexer-type platforms, respectively. It is emphasized how the faster wafer handling, which is a unique characteristic of the Indexer concept, results in throughput of production flows exceeding 50 wafers/hour. Moreover, the strategies of degas, cooling and sputter-etch implemented in the process-of-records executed by Indexer allow for wafer processing at lower temperature regimes and result in 50% lower contact resistance baseline. This work reports Rc values well below 1.0 mOhm measured on single-contact Kelvin structures. The Indexer system presented promotes itself as the ideal high-productivity PVD platform capable to tackle the ever-increasing manufacturing challenges arising from the progressive shrinkage of the critical device dimensions of next-generation WLCSP and FOWLP.

AB  - The classic cost-benefit model of ectothermic thermoregulation compares energetic costs and benefits, providing a critical framework for understanding this process (Huey and Slatkin 1976). It considers the case where environmental temperature (T-e) is less than the selected temperature of the organism (T-sel), and it predicts that, to minimize increasing energetic costs of thermoregulation as habitat thermal quality declines, thermoregulatory effort should decrease until the lizard thermoconforms. We extended this model to include the case where T-e exceeds T-sel, and we redefine costs and benefits in terms of fitness to include effects of body temperature (T-b) on performance and survival. Our extended model predicts that lizards will increase thermoregulatory effort as habitat thermal quality declines, gaining the fitness benefits of optimal T-b and maximizing the net benefit of activity. Further, to offset the disproportionately high fitness costs of high T-e compared with low T-e, we predicted that lizards would thermoregulate more effectively at high values of T-e than at low ones. We tested our predictions on three sympatric skink species (Carlia rostralis, Carlia rubrigularis, and Carlia storri) in hot savanna woodlands and found that thermoregulatory effort increased as thermal quality declined and that lizards thermoregulated most effectively at high values of T-e.

AB  - Animals and plants often exhibit narrow ranges of thermal preference in variable environments; fitness-enhancing activities such as reproduction and growth tend to be concentrated during times in which body temperature lies within that narrow range. The relation between fitness-associated performance and temperature is modeled by a performance curve defined by two traits: performance breadth (T-br), a measure of thermal specialization, and the critical maximum temperature for performance (T-max). Optimality models are used to define the fitness landscape for these two traits under several different patterns of within- and among-generation variation in temperature. In constant environments and environments in which there is significant within-generation variation, specialists with narrow preference ranges are the favored phenotype. In environments in which there is considerable among-generation but little within-generation variation, generalists with broad preference ranges are favored. Specialists in a constant environment have a mean fitness an order of magnitude higher than any phenotype in more variable environments, demonstrating that homeostatic mechanisms can confer a large fitness advantage. In contrast to previous models of environmental tolerance, these performance models suggest that increasing temporal environmental variation can favor the evolution of thermal specialization.

AB  - Predicting how species will respond to the rapid climatic changes predicted this century is an urgent task. Species distribution models (SDMs) use the current relationship between environmental variation and species' abundances to predict the effect of future environmental change on their distributions. However, two common assumptions of SDMs are likely to be violated in many cases: (i) that the relationship of environment with abundance or fitness is constant throughout a species' range and will remain so in future and (ii) that abiotic factors (e. g. temperature, humidity) determine species' distributions. We test these assumptions by relating field abundance of the rainforest fruit fly Drosophila birchii to ecological change across gradients that include its low and high altitudinal limits. We then test how such ecological variation affects the fitness of 35 D. birchii families transplanted in 591 cages to sites along two altitudinal gradients, to determine whether genetic variation in fitness responses could facilitate future adaptation to environmental change. Overall, field abundance was highest at cooler, high-altitude sites, and declined towards warmer, low-altitude sites. By contrast, cage fitness (productivity) increased towards warmer, lower-altitude sites, suggesting that biotic interactions (absent from cages) drive ecological limits at warmer margins. In addition, the relationship between environmental variation and abundance varied significantly among gradients, indicating divergence in ecological niche across the species' range. However, there was no evidence for local adaptation within gradients, despite greater productivity of high-altitude than low-altitude populations when families were reared under laboratory conditions. Families also responded similarly to transplantation along gradients, providing no evidence for fitness trade-offs that would favour local adaptation. These findings highlight the importance of (i) measuring genetic variation in key traits under ecologically relevant conditions, and (ii) considering the effect of biotic interactions when predicting species' responses to environmental change.

AB  - The majority of experimental studies of the effects of population bottlenecks on fitness are performed under laboratory conditions, which do not account for the environmental complexity that populations face in nature. In this study, we test inbreeding depression in multiple replicates of inbred when compared with non-inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster under different temperature conditions. Egg-to-adult viability, developmental time and sex ratio of emerging adults are studied under low, intermediate and high temperatures under laboratory as well as semi-natural conditions. The results show inbreeding depression for egg-to-adult viability. The level of inbreeding depression is highly dependent on test temperature and is observed only at low and high temperatures. Inbreeding did not affect the developmental time or the sex ratio of emerging adults. However, temperature affected the sex ratio with more females relative to males emerging at low temperatures, suggesting that selection against males in pre-adult life stages is stronger at low temperatures. The coefficient of variation (CV) of egg-to-adult viability within and among lines is higher for inbred flies and generally increases at stressful temperatures. Our results contribute to knowledge on the environmental dependency of inbreeding under different environmental conditions and emphasize that climate change may impact negatively on fitness through synergistic interactions with the genotype.

AB  - This study reports mortality under laboratory conditions in unselected controls and 2 lines of juvenile Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas previously selected for their high or low survival in the field during the summer period. Oysters were also deployed in field conditions, and mortality between both conditions was then compared. In the laboratory, mortality was observed in all experiments and it always lasted for a week, indicating that mortality under laboratory conditions was a short-term event. It was also shown that mortality could be repeated for a batch in several experiments using oysters that never experienced any abnormal mortality. This approach could facilitate further studies to investigate the causes of mortality by allowing repeated trials during a summer. Differences in mortality between the resistant and the susceptible selected lines confirmed the positive response to selection under laboratory conditions. Batches that performed well in the laboratory also showed high survival in the field, and the results of those exhibiting low survival in the laboratory trials were also mirrored in the field. Finally, challenging oysters with heat stress is proposed as a useful method for estimating the survival capacity of hatchery-produced and wild-caught spat used by the oyster industry.

AB  - Amblyseius eharai is a generalist predatory mite that consumes spider mites, rust mites, thrips, and pollen, with a high adaptability to various plants. To better understand ecological and behavioral aspects of this species, we investigated its functional response to different stages of two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Furthermore, we compared its environmental adaptability with that of other referenced phytoseiids using a temperature-dependent model of the intrinsic rate of increase. We were able to calculate the functional response parameters of both sexes of A. eharai when preying on eggs or larvae of T. urticae and, for females only, when preying on the deutonymph of T. urticae. Among the various combinations tested herein, A. eharai females preying on T. urticae larvae had the highest attack rate and shortest handling time. For eggs of T. urticae, A. eharai showed a lower attack rate; however, its handling time for eggs was significantly shorter compared to other phytoseiids. Using T. urticae larva as a prey, the attack rate of female A. eharai was higher and the handling time of both sexes of this species was shorter than those of other phytoseiid mites. Amblyseius eharai populations can show maximum performance quickly due to this species' lower optimal temperature for population growth (28.1 degrees C) compared to other phytoseiid mites. Thus, we provided evidence that this predatory mite has the potential to be a new, effective biological control agent of greenhouse pests such as T. urticae due to its high predation capacity and low optimal temperature.

AB  - Given the dual role of many plant traits to tolerate both herbivore attack and abiotic stress, the climatic niche of a species should be integrated into the study of plant defense strategies.
   Here we investigate the impact of plant reproductive strategy and components of species' climatic niche on the rate of chemical defense evolution in the milkweeds using a common garden experiment of 49 species.
   We found that across Asclepias species, clonal reproduction repeatedly evolved in lower temperature conditions, in species generally producing low concentrations of a toxic defense (cardenolides). Additionally, we found that rates of cardenolide evolution were lower for clonal than for nonclonal species.
   We thus conclude that because the clonal strategy is based on survival, long generation times, and is associated with tolerance of herbivory, it may be an alternative to toxicity in colder ecosystems. Taken together, these results indicate that the rate of chemical defense evolution is influenced by the intersection of life-history strategy and climatic niches into which plants radiate.

AB  - Early ontogenetic adaptations reflect the evolutionary history of a species. To understand the evolution of the deep-sea fauna and its adaptation to high pressure, it is important to know the effects of pressure on their shallow-water relatives. In this study we analyse the temperature and pressure tolerances of early life-history stages of the shallow-water species Mytilus edulis. This species expresses a close phylogenetic relationship with hydrothermal-vent mussels of the subfamily Bathymodiolinae. Tolerances to pressure and temperature are defined in terms of fertilization success and embryo developmental rates in laboratory-based experiments. In M. edulis, successful fertilization under pressure is possible up to 500 atm (50.66 MPa), at 10, 15 and 20 degrees C. A slower embryonic development is observed with decreasing temperature and with increasing pressure; principally, pressure narrows the physiological tolerance window in different ontogenetic stages of M. edulis, and slows down metabolism. This study provides important clues on possible evolutionary pathways of hydrothermal vent and cold-seep bivalve species and their shallow-water relatives. Evolution and speciation patterns of species derive mostly from their ability to adapt to variable environmental conditions, within environmental constraints, which promote morphological and genetic variability, often differently for each life-history stage. The present results support the view that a direct colonization of deep-water hydrothermal vent environments by a cold eurythermal shallow-water ancestor is indeed a possible scenario for the Mytilinae, challenging previous hypothesis of a wood/bone to seep/vent colonization pathway.

AB  - A beta-Ga2O3 field effect transistor (FET) outperforms a GaN FET in Baliga's figure of merit (FOM) by 400% and Huang's chip area manufacturing figure of merit by 330%, suggesting that beta-Ga2O3 could be a substrate of choice for next generation power transistors. However, its low thermal conductivity leads to extreme self-heating, which deteriorates the device performance during high voltage operation. A holistic evaluation of performance from a material-device-circuit perspective is necessary before reaching any conclusion regarding the technological viability of beta-Ga2O3. In this paper, we develop a multiphysics and multiscale model for a material-device-circuit analysis of beta-Ga2O3 FETs. The framework allows us to explore the effectiveness of various device design strategies (e.g., thermal shunts) for mitigating the thermal chokepoints and compare the performance of improved beta-Ga2O3 FETs against that of GaN and SiC FETs. We highlight the limitations of traditional FOMs to analyze the relative performance of the new generation of power transistors whose structure incorporates stacked layers of materials with different thermal conductivities, like those of beta-Ga2O3 FETs. We suggest device design strategies, such as wafer thinning, incorporation of heat shunts, and improved channel mobility, so that beta-Ga2O3 FETs can compete commercially with GaN and SiC technologies.

AB  - The Zero Energy Building (ZEB) target and the higher affordability of photovoltaic (PV) systems are pushing Governments and large Companies operating in electricity generation and distribution network management to develop tools able to better define the potential productivity of PV systems on a large scale, such as solar maps. However, solar maps mainly consider phenomena related to weather and geometry, with a low level of detail on second order effects. This research aims at the integration of additional technical aspects into solar maps, by means of diagrams able to increase the reliability in the assessment of potential electricity generation. For this purpose, more technical factors are taken into account, such as the variation of PV panel efficiency with cell temperature, the shadow cast by the preceding PV panel array, here including the action of by-pass diodes, and the ratio of active area over the area available for installation.

TI  - Building performance indicators and IEQ assessment procedure for the next generation of EPC-s
T2  - COLD CLIMATE HVAC & ENERGY 2021
LA  - English
CP  - 10th International SCANVAC Cold Climate Conference
AB  - In the current implementation of EPC-s, the assessment focus is purely on the energy consumption data. For the next generation of EPC-s, new performance indicators are proposed to address relevant building performance aspects, such as sustainability, productivity and market value. These indicators would enable evidence-based decision-making processes and facilitate the delivery of renovation triggers. Within the EPC framework, the problem is not the availability of such performance indicators, but the assessment effort required. Only easily available data can justifiably be introduced to bulk EPC-s, either as direct complementary input or as a performance indicator. Availability of such data was analysed from case studies that included EPC-s from 11 EU member states, mainly non-residential buildings. Analysed data included relevant HVAC information such as ventilation air flows, heating and cooling set-points and installed power, but also output data, such as EPC classes, net and primary energy need and GHG emissions. Based on our findings, we outlined two different development paths - one for existing buildings and one for new buildings and major renovations. Two categories of complementary indicators to energy are proposed - IEQ and power indicators.

AB  - Artificial selection can be used to create populations with extreme phenotypic responses to environmental stressors. When artificial selection is applied to a single component of a stress response, this selection may result in correlated responses in other stress responses, a phenomenon called cross-tolerance, which is ultimately controlled by the genetic correlations among traits. We selected for extreme responses to cold tolerance by selecting for chill-coma recovery time from a single temperate population of Drosophila melanogaster. Chill-coma recovery time is a common metric of low, but non-lethal, cold temperature tolerance. Replicated divergent artificial selection was applied to a genetically variable base population for 31 generations, resulting in two cold resistant, two cold susceptible, and two unselected control lines. To quantify the relationship between selection on chill-coma recovery and other metrics of thermal performance, we also measured survivorship after acute cold exposure, survivorship after chronic cold exposure, survivorship after cold exposure following a pre-treatment period (rapid cold hardening), starvation tolerance, and heat tolerance. We find that chill-coma recovery time is heritable within this population and that there is an asymmetric response to increased and decreased chill-coma recovery time. Surprisingly, we found no cross-tolerances between selection on chill-coma recovery time and the other environmental stress response traits. These results suggest that although artificial selection has dramatically altered chill-coma recovery time, the correlated response to selection on other stress response phenotypes has been negligible. The lack of a correlated response suggests that chill-coma recovery time in these selection lines is likely genetically independent from measures of cold survivorship tested here.

AB  - Heterogeneous environmental conditions along the Humboldt Current System (HCS) influence the life-history strategy of a variety of species in different ways. There is limited information on latitudinal traits of coastal cephalopods as part of the interacting species in pelagic and benthic environments. The present study used the loliginid squid Doryteuthis gahi as a model organism to: (1) evaluate latitudinal traits on egg laying patterns, (2) characterize a particular spawning ground, (3) quantify the isotopic variation from different tissues, (4) evaluate potential trophic ontogenetic changes, (5) determinate trophic position, and (6) isotopically estimate the relative importance of putative preys in the squid's assimilated diet. Results evidenced that egg-masses collected between 2014 and 2020 presented similar patterns along northern-central Chile (27-36 degrees S), with females attaching small egg-capsules (10-50 mm length) through the year and over a variety of anthropogenic and natural substrates. At a small scale (Coquimbo; 29 degrees S), early life history traits showed distinct patterns depending on SST, with warmer collection periods (similar to 18 degrees C) evidencing larger capsules and smaller embryos, although small paralarvae were obtained over the 4-year sampling period. In this site, sampling of older ontogenetic stages supported the constant presence of small-sized squids (19-77 mm ML). Males had larger mean sizes compared to females and undetermined specimens, with a high proportion of mature stages. Observations in captivity were extended for up to 110 d, validating that small females (45-64 mm ML) spawn the small egg-capsules typically observed in the field. Differences in stable isotope composition between beaks and soft tissues of adult squids were lower for delta C-13 values (1.1 vs. 1.4 parts per thousand, respectively) and higher for delta N-15 values (5.3 vs. 4.7 parts per thousand, respectively). Isotopic composition through ontogeny found similar delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, suggesting that carbon sources (pelagic origin) and trophic position did not change significantly, with copepods, euphausiids and nereid polychaetes being the most important preys. This study unveils the permanent occurrence of a small reproductive morphotype of D. gahi in shallow coastal habitats of northern-central Chile (i.e., center of the distribution range), providing the first insights for understanding the species' potential adaptations to heterogeneous conditions in the HCS and the unexplored distribution gap between the two centers of abundance (Peru and the Falkland/Malvinas islands).

AB  - This paper describes a data logger system based on microcontroller (wind speed, wind direction, humidity and temperature) and storing data in the SD (Secure Digital) memory card. The evaluation of the wind potential available at a particular site is needed to determine the viability or not the wind turbine installation. However, data acquisition systems for wind prospecting and monitoring of the wind power plants use high cost and precision sensors (anemometer, thermo-hygrometer, wind vane). Therefore, this low cost data acquisition system presented in this paper has characteristics of some commercial data loggers and it is appropriated to study of the feasibility of the installing micro wind turbines for distributed generation.

AB  - Natural color polymorphisms are widespread across animal species and usually have a simple genetic basis. This makes them an ideal system to study the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for maintaining biodiversity. In some populations of the intertidal snail Littorina fabalis, variation in shell color has remained stable for years, but the mechanisms responsible are unknown. Previous studies suggest that this stability could be caused by frequency-dependent sexual selection, but this hypothesis has not been tested. We analyzed shell color polymorphism in mating pairs and surrounding unmated individuals in two different populations of L. fabalis to estimate sexual fitness for color, as well as assortative mating. The estimated effective population size from neutral markers allowed us to disregard genetic drift as the main source of color frequency changes across generations. Shell color frequency was significantly correlated with sexual fitness showing a pattern of negative frequency dependent selection with high disassortative mating for color. The results suggested a contribution of male mate choice to maintain the polymorphism. Finally, the implementation of a multi-model inference approach based on information theory allowed us to test for the relative contribution of mate choice and mate competition to explain the maintenance of color polymorphism in this snail species.

AB  - The development of economic thermoelectric generators for waste heat recovery has become an increasing research focus over the past a few years. Traditionally, attempts to improve their economic viability have concentrated primarily on improving the conversion efficiency by increasing the figure-of-merit of thermoelectric materials, with only marginal successes. This paper explores the possibilities and implications of alternative approaches in an attempt to improve the economic competitiveness of thermoelectric generators based on currently available materials (i.e., with ZTsimilar to1). Novel concepts which provide alternative approaches to overcome low efficiency drawback are discussed and examples presented, typical of which include high-power-density thermoelectric generating modules; symbiotic systems for co-generation of heat and power; high efficiency heat-recirculating thermoelectric-combustion systems and thermoelectric microgenerators.

AB  - A standalone alignment technology was developed as a fundamental solution to improve on-product overlay (OPO). It enables high performance alignment measurements, and delivers state-of-the-art feed forward corrections to exposure scanner. Dense alignment sampling and high-order field distortion correction is effective for scanner fingerprint matching and for heat related field distortions. A modeling and sampling optimization software is a powerful tool for dense sampling and high-order overlay correction with minimal throughput loss. We performed an overlay experiment using the standalone alignment technology coupled with a modeling and sampling optimization software, which demonstrates on-product overlay improvement potential for next generation manufacturing accuracy and productivity challenges.

AB  - Correct reproductive timing is crucial for fitness. Breeding phenology even in similar species can differ due to different selective pressures on the timing of reproduction. These selection pressures define species' responses to warming springs. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis suggests that timing of breeding in animals is selected to match with food availability (synchrony). Alternatively, time-dependent breeding success (the date hypothesis) can result from other seasonally deteriorating ecological conditions such as intra-or interspecific competition or predation. We studied the effects of two ultimate factors on the timing of breeding, synchrony and other time-dependent factors (time-dependence), in sympatric populations of two related forest-dwelling passerine species, the great tit (Parus major) and the willow tit (Poecile montanus) by modelling recruitment with long-termcapture-recapture data. We hypothesized that these two factors have different relevance for fitness in these species. We found that local recruitment in both species showed quadratic relationships with both time-dependence and synchrony. However, the importance of these factors was markedly different between the studied species. Caterpillar food played a predominant role in predicting the timing of breeding of the great tit. In contrast, for the willow tit time-dependence modelled as timing in relation to conspecifics was more important for local recruitment than synchrony. High caterpillar biomass experienced during the pre- and post-fledging periods increased local recruitment of both species. These contrasting results confirm that these species experience different selective pressures upon the timing of breeding, and hence responses to climate change may differ. Detailed information about life-history strategies is required to understand the effects of climate change, even in closely related taxa. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis should be extended to consider subsequent critical periods when food needs to be abundantly available.

AB  - In fish, pre-embryonic events such as insemination, second polar body extrusion and first mitotic cleavage are manipulable and render 37 different types of ploidy induction possible. A classification of physical, chemical, and biological inductors of ploidy is provided. The amazing ability of fish to tolerate genomes from haploid to heptaploid, genomic contributions from the male or female parent alone, and unequal contributions from parents belonging to the same or different species is highlighted: surprisingly, a single species is amenable for 8-12 different types of ploidy induction. Advantages and limitations of different methods and live or preserved tissues for ploidy confirmation are assessed.
   Live haploids have been induced in Oreochromis mossambicus. With an ability to synthesize rRNAs and metabolic enzymes such as LDH, the haploid embryos are capable of normal translation and transcription, but suffer mass mortality at hatching, perhaps due to expression of lethal mutant genes.
   Induction of gynogenesis involves egg activation by irradiated homologous or heterologous sperm, and diploidization by retention of the second polar body (meiotic gynogenesis), or suppression of the first mitotic cleavage (mitotic gynogenesis). UV-irradiation inactivates sperm DNA maximally and avoids chromosome fragmentation. Egg activation by UV-irradiated heterologous sperm under dark conditions, and diploidization by pressure shock result in the highest survival of gynogens; meiotic gynogens survive better than mitotic gynogens. The need for confirmation of genetic purity of mitotic gynogens by one or more methods is emphasized. In different species, survival, growth and fertility improve when gynogens are generated successively for two or more generations.
   Combinations of induction of ploidy and hormonal sex reversal in gynogens renders the scope for generating all-male or all-female populations. In some gynogenetic species genetic homozygosity leads to growth suppression from 3 to 60%; however, meiotic gynogens of Clarias macrocephalus and Paralicthys olivaceus display 18 and 35% faster growth. Hypotheses for the unexpected occurrence of males among natural and artificially induced gynogenetic populations are assessed. In a few species, reproductive performance of gynogens is not equivalent to normal females.
   Maximal elimination of egg genome by UV-radiation, induction of androgenesis using 2n sperm of a tetraploid, facilitation of dispermy using heterologous eggs, and activation by cryopreserved sperm are land-mark events in the history of androgenesis. In male-heterogametic species, androgenesis may produce supermales to establish broodstock for consistent production of air-male populations. In combination with cryopreservation of sperm, androgenesis may prove to be the best method for conservation of fish genomes.
   As many as 11 different types of triploids are inducible; and most of them require the retention of the second polar body. The yield and survival of triploids are higher than those of gynogens and these values decrease with the kind of inductor used in the following order: pressure < cold < heat shock. Usually triploidy confers sterility, especially in females, and accelerates growth during post-maturation, when reared solitarily in some (Tinca tinca, Oreochromis Mossambicus) or communally (with diploids) in other species (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
   The presence of two sets of maternal chromosomes does not disturb the manifestation of morphological sexual characters; however, unexpected sex ratios observed in some triploids indicate a preponderance of females in natural populations and a dominance of males in artificially induced populations. In some species, a certain percentage of female triploids are fertile. possible pathways, through which the natural fertile triploids may form the base for evolution of tetraploids and origin of diploid new species are suggested. Triploids, especially females, suffer delayed maturity, a low gonado-somatic index, and disrupted gametogenesis due to cytogenetic and endocrine incompatibilities; males do not suffer endocrine incompatibility Three possible pathways, through which oogenesis may be completed in these fertile triploid species, are indicated. Triploid hybridization between salmonids, which can tolerate salinity changes (e.g. chum and pink salmons) and which cannot tolerate early transfer to sea water but are desired for their meat quality (e.g. Atlantic, chinook and coho salmons) is commercially important.
   Triploid conspecific salmonids grow faster than diploid conspecifics or triploid hybrids. Protocols for the combination of induced ploidy and hormonal sex reversal to generate all-male, all-female or all-sterile triploid populations are described. In triploids, the increase in nuclear DNA per cell is 1.3 to 1.7 times that of diploids, which results in corresponding volumetric increase of a cell. This, in rum, imposes corresponding decreases in total cell surface area and cell number of a tissue or a triploid individual; however, such a decrease in cell surface area does not impair metabolic processes like oxygen uptake and food utilization. Data for effective temperature required to induce cold or heat shock to retain the second polar body suggest that an elevation of 18, 15 and 14 degrees C successfully retains the polar body in salmonids, cyprinids and cichlids; the corresponding values for the depression of temperature are 11, 19 and 21 degrees C, respectively.
   Seven different kinds of tetraploidy are inducible; however, live, feeding tetraploids have been induced in ten species only. Causes for embryonic or post-embryonic mortality of tetraploids are discussed. Increasing maternal genomic contribution and heterologous insemination appear to enhance tetraploid survival. Survival and growth of Oncorhynchus mykiss progressively improve in F-1 and F-2 tetraploid progenies. In a rare strain of the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, pentaploids, hexaploids and heptaploids have been successfully induced. An individual polyploid leach (3n) simultaneously spawns small, intermediate and large eggs carrying n, 2n and 3n genomes. It is not clear how during oogenesis the passage of n, 2n and 3n genomes is regulated into small, intermediate and large eggs. However, evidence from other fish species is accumulating for the simultaneous production of at least two kinds of eggs by a single female. Studies on ploidy induction have shown the magnitude of the complicated genetic mechanisms that control sex determination in fish.

AB  - Genetic assimilation emerges from selection on phenotypic plasticity. Yet, commonly used quantitative genetics models of linear reaction norms considering intercept and slope as traits do not mimic the full process of genetic assimilation. We argue that intercept-slope reaction norm models are insufficient representations of genetic effects on linear reaction norms and that considering reaction norm intercept as a trait is unfortunate because the definition of this trait relates to a specific environmental value (zero) and confounds genetic effects on reaction norm elevation with genetic effects on environmental perception. Instead, we suggest a model with three traits representing genetic effects that, respectively, (i) are independent of the environment, (ii) alter the sensitivity of the phenotype to the environment and (iii) determine how the organism perceives the environment. The model predicts that, given sufficient additive genetic variation in environmental perception, the environmental value at which reaction norms tend to cross will respond rapidly to selection after an abrupt environmental change, and eventually becomes equal to the new mean environment. This readjustment of the zone of canalization becomes completed without changes in genetic correlations, genetic drift or imposing any fitness costs of maintaining plasticity. The asymptotic evolutionary outcome of this three-trait linear reaction norm generally entails a lower degree of phenotypic plasticity than the two-trait model, and maximum expected fitness does not occur at the mean trait values in the population.

AB  - One of the most challenging problems in evolutionary biology is linking the evolution of the phenotype with the underlying genotype, because most phenotypes are encoded by many genes that interact with each other and with the environment. Further, many phenotypes are correlated and selection on one can affect evolution of the other. This challenge is especially important in fishes, because their evolutionary response to harvest, global warming and conservation actions are among the least understood aspects of their management. Here, we discuss two major genetic approaches to studying the evolution of complex traits, multivariate quantitative genetics and molecular genetics, and examine the increasing interaction between the two fields. These interactions include using pedigree-based methods to study the evolution of multivariate traits in natural populations, comparing neutral and quantitative measures of population structure, and examining the contribution that the two approaches have made to each other. We then explore the major role that quantitative genetics is playing in two key issues in the conservation and management of fish populations: the evolutionary effects of fishing and adaptation to climate change. Throughout, we emphasize that it is important to anticipate the availability of improvements in molecular technology and statistical analyses by creating research populations such as inbred lines and families segregating at fitness traits, developing approaches to measuring the full range of phenotypes related to fitness, and collecting biological material and ecological data in natural populations. These steps will facilitate studies of the evolution of complex traits over informative temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - Daphnia is a widespread freshwater zooplankton species, which is both a classic and emerging new model for research in ecological physiology, ecotoxicology and evolutionary biology of adaptation to novel environments. Heat tolerance in Daphnia is known to depend both upon evolutionary history of a genotype and on individuals' acclimation to elevated temperature and to correlate with the level of haemoglobin expression. We demonstrate the existence of north-south gradient of heat tolerance in North American D. pulex, which is not associated with any parallel changes in haemoglobin expression. Geographically distinct clones differ in the way their haemoglobin expression changes due to acclimation to a sub-stressful (28A degrees C) temperature, but these changes are not correlated with the latitude of clones' origin. Likewise, the effect of acclimation to sub-stressful temperature is independent from, and cannot be fully explained by, haemoglobin expression changes during acclimation. The degree of oxidative damage to haemoglobin, measured as the ratio of absorbance at 540:576 nm at the acclimation temperature, is a strong predictor of 28A degrees C-acclimated Daphnia survival during an acute heat exposure. The comparison of haemoglobin expression in resistant and tolerant clones acclimated to different temperatures indicates that tolerant clones exhibit canalization of haemoglobin expression, possessing a high level of haemoglobin even at non-stressful temperatures. We discuss the evolutionary biology of adaptation and acclimation to elevated temperatures in an ecologically important component of freshwater ecosystems in the context of global climate change.

AB  - Timing of reproduction greatly influences offspring success and resulting population production. Explaining and predicting species' dynamics necessitates disentangling the intrinsic (genotypic) and extrinsic (climatic) factors controlling reproductive timing. Here we explore temporal and spatial changes in spawning time for 21 populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) across the species' range (40 degrees to 80 degrees N). We estimate spawning time using a physiologically relevant metric that includes information on fish thermal history (degree-days, DD). First, we estimate spawning DD among years (within populations) to show how recent changes in spawning time can be explained by local changes in temperature. Second, we employ spawning DD to identify temperature-independent trends in spawning time among populations that are consistent with parallel adaptive evolution and the evolutionary history of the species. Finally, we use our results to estimate spawning time under future climate regimes, and discuss the implications for cod ecology across the species' range.

AB  - An anaerobic wastewater treatment generates at the end of its process an anaerobic biomass, also known as anaerobic sludge, and a major sub product, the biogas, composed mainly by methane (CH4) and carbonic gas (CO2). The biogas needs to be collected in order to be flared or used in another process, especially because it cannot be released directly into the atmosphere due to methane gas and its high global warming potential. Nevertheless, when this gas is burnt, an energy vector for micro generation is discarded. In the present work was designed a thermal power plant using the biogas produced in an anaerobic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) through an implementation methodology that considers the population growth according to a southeast ordinary Brazilian city. The energy production potential, avoided CO2 emissions due to the biogas burnt and the possibility of using this energy to supply the WWTP's internal demand consumption were analyzed, as well as the project's economic viability and the arising benefits from carbon credits, calculated in three scenarios. The data of calculus were based on the Brazilian sales tariffs obtained from Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency - ANEEL, where: i) T1 = 64.9 [US$/MWh] (average tariff on Brazilian energy auction A-5); ii) T2 = 86.47 [US$/MWh] (average tariff for thermal power plants in the same auction), and iii) the third scenario, in which the energy produced would be consumed by the WWTP's internal demand. The economic viability was only achieved in second and third scenarios, being intensified in the scenario that WWTP's internal demand is supplied using the energy generated in the biogas plant.

AB  - Understanding is currently limited of the biological processes underlying the responses of modular organisms to climate change and the potential to adapt through morphological plasticity related to their modularity. Here, we investigate the effects of ocean acidification and seawater warming on the growth, life history and morphological plasticity in the modular bryozoan Calpensia nobilis using transplantation experiments in a shallow Mediterranean volcanic CO2 vents system that simulates pH values expected for the year 2100. Colonies exposed at vent sites grew at approximately half the rate of those from the control site. Between days 34 and 48 of the experiment, they reached a possible 'threshold', due to the combined effects of exposure time and pH. Temperature did not affect zooid length, but longer zooids with wider primary orifices occurred in low pH conditions close to the vents. Growth models describing colony development under different environmental scenarios suggest that stressed colonies of C. nobilis reallocate metabolic energy to the consolidation and strengthening of existing zooids. This is interpreted as a change in life-history strategy to support persistence under unfavourable environmental conditions. Changes in the skeletal morphology of zooids evident in C. nobilis during short-time (87 days) exposure experiments reveal morphological plasticity that may indicate a potential to adapt to the more acidic Mediterranean predicted for the future.

AB  - Background: Diapause is a natural phenomenon characterized by an arrest in development that ensures the survival of organisms under extreme environmental conditions. The process has been well documented in arthropods. However, its molecular basis has been mainly studied in species from temperate zones, leaving a knowledge gap of this phenomenon in tropical species. In the present study, the Neotropical and solitary bee Tetrapedia diversipes was employed as a model for investigating diapause in species from tropical zones. Being a bivoltine insect, Tetrapedia diversipes produce two generations of offspring per year. The first generation, normally born during the wet season, develops faster than individuals from the second generation, born after the dry season. Furthermore, it has been shown that the development of the progeny, of the second generation, is halted at the 5th larval instar, and remains in larval diapause during the dry season. Towards the goal of gaining a better understanding of the diapause phenomenon we compared the global gene expression pattern, in larvae, from both reproductive generations and during diapause. The results demonstrate that there are similarities in the observed gene expression patterns to those already described for temperate climate models, and also identify diapause-related genes that have not been previously reported in the literature.
   Results: The RNA-Seq analysis identified 2275 differentially expressed transcripts, of which 1167 were annotated. Of these genes, during diapause, 352 were upregulated and 815 were downregulated. According to their biological functions, these genes were categorized into the following groups: cellular detoxification, cytoskeleton, cuticle, sterol and lipid metabolism, cell cycle, heat shock proteins, immune response, circadian clock, and epigenetic control.
   Conclusion: Many of the identified genes have already been described as being related to diapause; however, new genes were discovered, for the first time, in this study. Among those, we highlight: Niemann-Pick type C1, NPC2 and Acyl-CoA binding protein homolog (all involved in ecdysteroid synthesis); RhoBTB2 and SASH1 (associated with cell cycle regulation) and Histone acetyltransferase KAT7 (related to epigenetic transcriptional regulation). The results presented here add important findings to the understanding of diapause in tropical species, thus increasing the comprehension of diapause-related molecular mechanisms.

AB  - The Eight Hundred and Thirty-Second ACT of the Parliament of the Republic of Ghana entitled: Renewable Energy Act, 2011 has assented to provide for the development, management, utilization, sustainability and adequate supply of renewable energy for generation of heat and power for related matters by the year 2020. With the current load shedding and inadequate energy supply in Ghana, it was essential to examine other options that can be added to the grid installed capacity to ease the burden on Ghanaians. The study examined the solar energy resources in Ghana and how this huge potential can be utilized to grow and modernize the Ghanaian economy in order to decrease the high prevalence of poverty. Access to energy has been proven to directly affect human development, therefore, an option of the diversified local energy mix for electricity production will be the best choice to improve an energy economy that would guarantee a safe and consistent supply of high-quality energy services for all Ghanaian. Evidence from the study shows that Ghana has a good potential for both concentrating and non-concentrating solar technologies. It is estimated that 50-100 MW solar energy potential are still untapped in Ghana which requires an investment of US $100-150 million. Developing and harnessing this renewable energy potential will boost the productivity of businesses, industries, and the transport sector while making a significant contribution to the export earnings of the country.

AB  - Because many species of semi-aquatic turtles have specific habitat requirements and unique life history characteristics, they are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic habitat modification. The federally threatened Bog Turtle (Glyptemys muhlenbergil) requires specialized wetland habitats, such as bogs and fens, In the eastern United States and often occurs In Isolated populations. To develop a more a detailed understanding of the habitat use, movement, and thermal biology of Bog Turtles, we radiotracked and monitored the temperatures of I I adult Bog Turtles at an Isolated Piedmont meadow bog In North Carolina from May 2007 to March 2008. We found that turtles used soft, shallow mud habitat in the bog, but moved to a streambed when the bog became dry. While In the bog, turtles were often found within or underneath woody debris. Although most turtles resided exclusively In the southern part of the bog and the stream, two male turtles made substantial over-land movements away from the bog exceeding 130 m. All but one turtle overwintered In a streambed adjacent to the bog. Turtles overwintering within stream habitat were not exposed to temperatures below 0 degrees C, but one turtle that overwintered In the bog did reach below-freezing temperatures. This study suggests that high-quality bog habitat and habitat heterogeneity are critical for populations living In Isolated and dynamic habitats. However, maintenance of corridors between suitable habitats may be necessary for the long-term survival of Bog Turtle populations.

AB  - Techno-economic assessments of systems which integrate biomass gasification with fuel cell modules (molten carbonate or phosphoric acid) for electricity generation are presented. The wood-fired Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell was found to be suitable where high heat/electricity values were required, but had low electrical efficiency. Electrical efficiencies of 13-17% are typical for these systems, as are Break-even Electricity Selling Prices (BESPs) of 10-20 p/kWh and specific investments of around pound 3000-pound 7500/kWe. This technology is unlikely to be considered for further development as an electricity generation system.
   The wood-fired Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell was found to be quite efficient and suitable for small-scale electricity generation purposes. Electrical efficiencies of 25-28% are typical for these systems, as are Break-even Electricity Selling Prices of 6-12 p/kWh and specific investments of around pound 2000-pound 5000/kWe. This technology could be considered for further development in the future, if the lifetime and capital costs of molten carbonate fuel cells can be improved. The problems in assessing future capital costs makes the economic viability of such systems difficult to determine. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The survival of three Lactobacillus plantarum strains (Lp 790, Lp 813 and Lp 998) with functional properties was studied taking into account their resistance to thermal, osmotic and oxidative stress factors. Stress treatments applied were: 52 degrees C-15 min (Phosphate Buffer pH 7, thermal shock), H2O2 0.1% (p/v) - 30 min (oxidative shock) and NaCl aqueous solution at 17, 25 and 30% (p/v) (room temperature - 1 h, osmotic shock). The osmotic stress was also evaluated on cell growth in MRS broth added of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% (p/v) of NaCl, during 20 h at 30 degrees C. The cell thermal adaptation was performed in MRS broth, selecting 45 degrees C for 30 min as final conditions for all strains. Two strains (Lp 813 and Lp 998) showed, in general, similar behaviour against the three stress factors, being clearly more resistant than Lp 790. An evident difference in growth kinetics in presence of NaCl was observed between Lp 998 and Lp 813, Lp998 showing a higher optical density (OD570nm) than Lp 813 at the end of the assay. Selected thermal adaptation improved by 2 log orders the thermal resistance of both strains, but cell growth in presence of NaCl was enhanced only in Lp 813. Oxidative resistance was not affected with this thermal pretreatment. These results demonstrate the relevance of cell technological resistance when selecting presumptive "probiotic" cultures, since different stress factors might considerably affect viability or/and performance of the strains. The incidence of stress conditions on functional properties of the strains used in this work are currently under research in our group. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional flip chip technologies such as the mass reflow (MR) process and the thermal compression bonding (TCB) process are commonly used technologies in the micro assembly field. However, there is a continuous need for next generation interconnection technology to achieve a low form factor with increasing die and substrate complexities. Moreover, very thin 3D integrated packages and 2.5D packages with thin interposer die promise advanced interconnection technologies for mobile and wearable applications. With this point of view, the most important factor in interconnection is optimal thermal energy control for soldering. However, a conventional MR process cannot provide any selectivity and controlled thermal energy transferring with the traditional convection reflow. Its high thermal budget makes warpage an issue, aside from other side effects. To overcome the MR process problems, recent researches and industries have focused on developing a TCB process with non-conductive paste (NCP) or non-conductive film (NCF) due to TCB's unique advantages of low mechanical and thermal stress. However, the productivity of the TCB process is not comparably to the conventional process. Laser-assisted bonding (LAB) with beam homogenizer is considered to be the next generation interconnection technology due to its excellent thermal selectivity, extremely fast ramping up speed with purely controlled wavelength. This LAB process offers a very stable interconnection quality as well as robust functional and reliability result. Interestingly, it also achieves excellent results with thin coreless substrate due to its selective heating area availability. This paper will discuss the laser heating mechanism, multi-chip & component bonding availability and advantage of LAB from an assembly industrial perspective.

AB  - Evolutionary adaptation to a constant environment is often accompanied by specialization and a reduction of fitness in other environments. We assayed the ability of the Lenski Escherichia coli populations to grow on a range of carbon sources after 50,000 generations of adaptation on glucose. Using direct measurements of growth rates, we demonstrated that declines in performance were much less widespread than suggested by previous results from Biolog assays of cellular respiration. Surprisingly, there were many performance increases on a variety of substrates. In addition to the now famous example of citrate, we observed several other novel gains of function for organic acids that the ancestral strain only marginally utilized. Quantitative growth data also showed that strains with a higher mutation rate exhibited significantly more declines, suggesting that most metabolic erosion was driven by mutation accumulation and not by physiological tradeoffs. These reductions in growth by mutator strains were ameliorated by growth at lower temperature, consistent with the hypothesis that this metabolic erosion is largely caused by destabilizing mutations to the associated enzymes. We further hypothesized that reductions in growth rate would be greatest for substrates used most differently from glucose, and we used flux balance analysis to formulate this question quantitatively. To our surprise, we found no significant relationship between decreases in growth and dissimilarity to glucose metabolism. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that in a single resource environment, specialization does not mainly result as an inevitable consequence of adaptive tradeoffs, but rather due to the gradual accumulation of disabling mutations in unused portions of the genome.
   Author Summary Adaptation to a single constant environment is commonly expected to result in decreased performance in alternative conditions, or specialization. It has been proposed that, rather than occurring through the neutral accumulation of mutations in unused alternative pathways, this happens because loss of these pathways enhances fitness in the constant environment via tradeoffs. We examined growth rates across a variety of nutrients for 12 independent lineages of Escherichia coli that had evolved in the laboratory for decades in a glucose-containing medium. Surprisingly, after 20,000 generations there were actually widespread improvements in the use of alternative nutrients, rather than the expected declines. After 50,000 generations, however, we find that this trend reversed for those populations that evolved a much higher mutation rate. This indicates that high mutation rate, and not adaptive tradeoffs per se (as had been previously proposed), is the primary driver of specialization. These results caution against general assumptions about the importance of adaptive tradeoffs during evolution, and emphasize the key role that newly evolved changes in mutation rate can play in promoting niche specialization.

AB  - The capacity to delay egg deposition in D. melanogaster females in the absence of a sexual partner is genetically determined and opposite types can be artificially selected. In natural populations, the relative frequency of these genotypes varies geographically and seasonally, with temperature as a selective factor. However, the retention duration of these genotypes can be modified by developmental temperature change. To study the genetic control of this response, chromosome substitution between opposite types of line was carried out in order to produce every possible homozygous chromosomsal combination of the three major chromosomes (X,2,3). Eggs of these eight constructed lines were developed at two different temperatures (25 degrees C and 14 degrees C). Low temperature development directly affected the number of ovarioles but also modified the subsequent expression of adult characteristics such as retention duration and fecundity. The comparison of the eight lines revealed that, although the 3 chromosomes were involved in the genetic determinism of each trait, only one or two of them were sensitive to temperature change, and these differed according to the trait. For retention duration and fecundity, the effect of chromosome 3 from the long retention strain was particularly affected by low temperature, showing antagonism between the selective effect detected in natural populations and the effect on phenotypic plasticity studied here.

AB  - To test whether expression of the inducible heat-shock protein Hsp70 increases under selection for inducible thermotolerance in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed artificial selection on replicate sets of Drosophila lines founded from two independent populations. Selection entailed pretreatment at 36 degreesC to induce thermotolerance and Hsp70 expression, followed by a more severe heat shock, whose temperature varied between sexes and among generations to achieve 50% mortality. Inducible thermotolerance increased slowly and continuously in selected lines and was 37%-50% greater than in controls after 10-11 generations. Lines founded from the two populations differed in their coevolution of Hsp70 expression. In lines founded from Evolution Canyon, Israel, Hsp70 level initially increased and thereafter was unchanged; replicate lines exhibited two temporal patterns of response to selection. In lines founded from Australia, Hsp70 levels increased throughout selection. In both cases, however, the increase in Hsp70 level averaged only 15%, suggesting that pleiotropy in Hsp70 function constrains evolutionary increase in its expression.

AB  - Columnaris disease (CD), caused by Flavobacterium columnare, is an emerging disease affecting rainbow trout aquaculture. Objectives of this study were to 1) estimate heritability of CD resistance in a rainbow trout line (ARS-Fp-R) previously selected 4 generations for improved bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) resistance; 2) estimate genetic correlations among CD resistance, BCWD resistance, and growth to market BW; and 3) compare CD resistance among the ARS-Fp-R, ARS-Fp-S (selected 1 generation for increased BCWD susceptibility), and ARS-Fp-C (selection control) lines. Heritability of CD resistance was estimated using data from a waterborne challenge of 44 full-sib ARS-Fp-R families produced using a paternal half-sib mating design, and genetic correlations were estimated using these data and 5 generations of BCWD resistance, 9-mo BW (approximately 0.5 kg), and 12-mo BW (approximately 1.0 kg) data from 405 ARS-Fp-R full-sib families. The CD and BCWD challenges were initiated at approximately 52 and 84 d posthatch, or approximately 650 and 1,050 degree days (degrees C x d), respectively. Survival of ARS-Fp-R families ranged from 0 to 48% following CD challenge and heritability estimates were similar between CD (0.17 +/- 0.09) and BCWD (0.18 +/- 0.03) resistance, and the genetic correlation between these 2 traits was favorable (0.35 +/- 0.25). Genetic correlations were small and antagonistic (-0.15 +/- 0.08 to -0.19 +/- 0.24) between the 2 resistance traits and 9- and 12-mo BW. Two challenges were conducted in consecutive years to compare CD resistance among ARS-Fp-R, ARS-Fp-C, and ARS-Fp-S families. In the first challenge, ARS-Fp-R families (83% survival) had greater CD resistance than ARS-Fp-C (73.5%; P = 0.02) and ARS-Fp-S (68%; P < 0.001) families, which did not differ (P = 0.16). In the second challenge, using an approximately 2.5-fold greater challenge dose, ARS-Fp-R families exhibited greater CD resistance (56% survival) than ARS-Fp-S (38% survival; P = 0.02) families. The favorable genetic correlation between CD and BCWD resistance is supported by greater CD resistance of the ARS-Fp-R line compared to the ARS-Fp-C and ARS-Fp-S lines and suggests that both traits will be improved simultaneously when selection is practiced on only 1 trait. In summary, these data indicate the feasibility of further selective breeding of the BCWD-resistant ARS-Fp-R line for increased CD resistance to produce a double pathogen-resistant line of rainbow trout.

AB  - Background: Meiotic recombination rate has long been known to be phenotypically plastic. How plastic recombination evolves and is maintained remains controversial; though a leading model for the evolution of plastic recombination rests on the tenet that organismal fitness and recombination frequency are negatively correlated. Motivated by the mounting evidence that meiotic recombination frequencies increase in response to stress, here we test for a negative correlation between fitness and recombination frequency. Specifically, the fitness-associated recombination model (FAR) predicts that if stress increases meiotic recombination frequency, then increasing exposure to stressful conditions will yield an increasing magnitude of the recombinational response, while concomitantly decreasing fitness.
   Results: We use heat shock as a stressor to test this prediction in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that increased exposure to heat shock conditions is associated with a non-linear increase in meiotic recombination frequency. We also find an independent effect of heat shock on organismal fitness, with fitness decreasing with increased duration of thermal stress.
   Conclusions: Our results thus support the foundation of the FAR model for the evolution of plastic recombination. Our data also suggest that modulating recombination frequency is one mechanism by which organisms can rapidly respond to environmental cues and confer increased adaptive potential to their offspring.

AB  - Spawning date is a crucial life history trait in fishes, linking parents to their offspring, and it is highly heritable in salmonid fishes. We examined the spawning dates of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook salmon O. tshawytscha at the University of Washington (UW) Hatchery for trends over time. We then compared the spawning date patterns with the changing thermal regime of the Lake Washington basin and the spawning patterns of conspecifics at two nearby hatcheries. The mean spawning dates of both species have become earlier over the period of record at the UW Hatchery (since the 1950s for chinook salmon and the 1960s for coho salmon), apparently because of selection in the hatchery. Countering hatchery selection for earlier spawning are the increasingly warmer temperatures experienced by salmon migrating in freshwater to, and holding at, the butchery. Spawning takes place even earlier at the Soos Creek Hatchery, the primary ancestral source of the UW populations, and at the Issaquah Creek Hatchery. Both species of salmon have experienced marked shifts towards earlier spawning at Soos Creek and Issaquah Creek hatcheries despite the expectation that warmer water would lead to later spawning. Thus, inadvertent selection at all three hatcheries appears to have resulted in progressively earlier spawning, overcoming selection from countervailing temperature trends.

AB  - Groundwater is recognized as a principal source of water for the drinking, irrigation and many other purposes. Researchers have also used groundwater in the solar distillation to convert it to drinkable water by use of solar energy. Even the researchers used thermoelectric modules with Solar operated devices like flat plate collector, evacuated tubes collector, compound parabolic concentrator etc. Hence, the main aim of the present review paper is to examine different researchers work on groundwater into the solar still with thermoelectric modules. It has been found that the thermoelectric modules with solar still appropriate for potable water generation from the groundwater. Future work of the thermoelectric modules with solar still also added in the review paper. At last, it is concluded that the thermoelectric modules with solar still is a potential application to produce potable water from groundwater along with the generation of electricity.

AB  - The recent developments in the energy industry have kindled renewed interest in producing energy (alternative fuels and electricity) more efficiently(1). This has motivated the development of higher temperature cycles and their associated equipment. In this paper we will discuss several design configurations coupled with the inherent properties of preferred ceramic materials to assess the viability and design reliability of ceramic heat exchangers for next generation high temperature beat exchangers. These analyses have been extended to conceptually compare the traditional shell and tube heat exchanger with shell and plate heat exchangers. These analyses include hydrodynamic, heat transfer, mechanical stress and reliability models. It was found that ceramic micro-channel heat exchanger designs proved to have the greatest reliability due to their inherent mechanical properties, minimal thermo-mechanical stresses while improving the performance efficiency in a compact footprint.

AB  - Food shortage is a stress factor that commonly affects organisms in nature. Resistance to food shortage or starvation resistance (SR) is a complex quantitative trait with direct implications on fitness. However, surveys of natural genetic variation in SR at different geographic scales are scarce. Here, we have measured. variation in SR in sets of lines derived from nine natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected in western Argentina. Our study shows that within population variation explained a larger proportion of overall phenotypic variance (80%) than among populations (7.2%). We also noticed that an important fraction of variation was sex-specific. Overall females were more resistant to starvation than males; however, the magnitude of the sexual dimorphism (SD) in SR varied among lines and explained a significant fraction of phenotypic variance in all populations. Estimates of cross-sex genetic correlations suggest that the genetic architecture of SR is only partially shared between sexes in the populations examined, thus, facilitating further evolution of the SD.

AB  - Climate change induces an alteration in the life cycle of many poikilothermic organisms, resulting in changes in the structure and function of communities. Changes in voltinism in the pine moth Dendrolimus spectabilis (Butler), which is known to be univoltine in South Korea, were studied to elucidate the effects of climate change on their voltinism. The developmental stages of the pine moth were evaluated through field surveys, and the developmental rate was estimated at five different temperatures: 17, 20, 25, 28, and 32A degrees C. Field surveys showed that the moths completed two generations per year, indicating that the phenology of the pine moth in this area had changed from univoltinism to bivoltinism. Laboratory experiments showed that increasing the temperature could induce a change in voltinism in the pine moth population. Generations of the bivoltine population displayed phenotypic plasticity: the fitness of the first generation was greater than that of the second generation with regard to size and fecundity. The difference in fitness between the first and second generations could be due to the influence of factors such as low food quality and heat stress on the second generation. Therefore, changes in thermal conditions due to climate change have offered this species the chance to develop a bivoltine population, but they have also exerted ecological costs, especially for the second generation of the pine moth.

AB  - Stress tolerance is often measured as a threshold trait, the proportion of a group that survives a defined stress regime. Requirements of large offspring numbers coupled with fitness variation in the surviving cohort limit the use of some standard genetic analyses for estimating heritability. Therefore, we present an isofemale line analysis, which is a modified full-sib design, to estimate heritability of tolerance to heat shock in pretreated Drosophila buzzatii adults. Highly significant levels or genetic variation were found in males and females at the third generation of laboratory rearing, and the intraclass correlations were estimated to be about 0.2 for four independent sets of 25 isofemale lines. The proportion of the variance explained within lines among same-sex replicates, however, was larger than that between replicates of males and females. Because genetic variation was estimated from groups, the error variation required factoring by the group size to estimate heritability, which averaged 0.03. The four most tolerant, four least tolerant and four lines of average tolerance to heat stress in each set were reanalysed after 10-11 generations of rearing at 25 degrees C. Survival in the 13th-13th generations was positively and significantly associated with survival at generation 3. These comparisons indicate the high repeatability of measurements of heat-shock tolerance.

AB  - In We have analyzed natural variation in mitochondrial form and function among a set of Caenorhabditis briggsae isolates known to harbor mitochondrial DNA structural variation in the form of a heteroplasmic nad5 gene deletion (nad5 Delta) that correlates negatively with organismal fitness. We performed in vivo quantification of 24 mitochondrial phenotypes including reactive oxygen species level, membrane potential, and aspects of organelle morphology, and observed significant amongisolate variation in 18 traits. Although several mitochondrial phenotypes were non-linearly associated with nad5D levels, most of the among-isolate phenotypic variation could be accounted for by phylogeographic clade membership. In particular, isolate-specific mitochondrial membrane potential was an excellent predictor of clade membership. We interpret this result in light of recent evidence for local adaptation to temperature in C. briggsae. Analysis of mitochondrial-nuclear hybrid strains provided support for both mtDNA and nuclear genetic variation as drivers of natural mitochondrial phenotype variation. This study demonstrates that multicellular eukaryotic species are capable of extensive natural variation in organellar phenotypes and highlights the potential of integrating evolutionary and cell biology perspectives.

AB  - Environmental temperatures play a vital role in the physiological and behavioral activity of ectotherms. Behavioral thermoregulation allows animals to modify their body temperature to optimize functions critical to fitness, including digestion, growth, reproduction, and locomotor performance. Diurnal reptiles are a classic model system to answer questions related to thermal ecology, whereas behavioral thermoregulation in nocturnal species is thought to be strongly constrained by low environmental thermal heterogeneity at night. The few studies describing the thermal ecology of nocturnal reptiles indicate a majority of thermoregulatory behavior (if any) occurs during the day within diurnal retreats, but few examined this behavior throughout the night. In tropical systems, thermal heterogeneity may remain high, even at night, allowing nocturnal ectotherms to thermoregulate through conduction on surfaces that retain heat after sunset. We investigated the thermoregulatory behavior of a tropical nocturnal gecko (Australian house gecko, Gehyra dubia) by measuring its preferred temperature in a thermal gradient, and selected body temperatures using radio telemetry, in relation to available operative environmental temperatures obtained using thermal models. Preferred body temperatures of geckos ranged from 31.4 +/- 0.59-34.5 +/- 0.55 degrees C in a laboratory thermal gradient. In the field, during winter, geckos were more effective thermoregulators than in the summer. In low thermal quality habitats, geckos sought rare, warm microclimates at night to maintain body temperatures warmer than most available environmental temperatures, and were highly effective thermoregulators. For ectotherms, appropriate environmental temperatures are a vital resource for survival, similar to food or shelter. The ability to exploit rare microclimates is especially important for nocturnal species, as heterogeneity of environmental temperatures is reduced at night compared to the day. In a warming world, it is vital to understand the thermal ecology of nocturnal ectotherms, as other species may shift to become more nocturnal to avoid lethal diurnal temperatures.

AB  - Species' range limits are ubiquitous. This suggests that the evolution of the ecological niche is constrained in general and at the edges of distributions in particular. While there may be many ecological and genetic reasons for this phenomenon, here we focus on the potential role of trade-offs. We performed a literature search on evidence for trade-offs associated with geographical or elevational range limits. The majority of trade-offs were reported as relevant at either the cold end of species' distribution (n = 19), the warm or dry end (n = 19) or both together (n = 14). One common type of trade-off involved accelerating growth or development (27%), often at the cost of small size. Another common type involved resistance to or tolerance of climatic extremes that occur at certain periods of the year (64%), often at the cost of small size or reduced growth. Trade-offs overlapped with some of the classic trade-offs reported in life-history evolution or thermal adaptation. The results highlight several general insights about species' niches and ranges, and we outline how future research should better integrate the ecological context and test for the presence of microevolutionary trade-offs.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Species' ranges in the face of changing environments (Part II)'.

AB  - Polymorphisms are widely known in allozymes and are often assumed neutral in the context of phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. However, several studies revealed that, in some loci and species, selection is strongly acting on allozymes and that temperature seems to be an important selective agent. Therefore, we individually determined the recovery time from chill-coma and heat knock-down time of 542 individuals of P. coridon sampled at four sites. Afterwards, we analyzed patterns of allozyme variations in these butterflies by allozyme electrophoresis of eleven loci to test the enzymes' performance under thermal stress conditions and to investigate the possibility of adaptive genotypic variation in relation to temperature stress resistance traits. We obtained significant differences of reactions to cold and heat shocks between the sexes and between reared and wild-captured individuals, but no significant differences among genotypes were found for most of the investigated allozyme loci. However, the Aar1 locus showed significant differences between different genotypes in chill-coma recovery times (p < 0.001), and marginal differences in heat knock-down times (p = 0.073). Thus, Aat1 might be a target for thermal selection. Consequently, our results revealed no clear influence of temperature on most allozyme loci and the otherwise observed differentiation in P. coridon might be explained by stochasticity, and thus geographic structuring should reflect biogeographic processes.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that there is a fundamental conflict between horizontal (infectious) and vertical (intergenerational) modes of parasite transmission. Activities of a parasite that increase its rate of infectious transmission are presumed to reduce its host's fitness. This reduction in host fitness impedes vertical transmission of the parasite and causes a tradeoff between horizontal and vertical transmission. Given this tradeoff, and assuming no multiple infections (no within-host competition among parasites), a simple model predicts that the density of uninfected hosts in the environment should determine the optimum balance between modes of parasite transmission. When susceptible hosts are abundant, selection should favor increased rates of horizontal transfer, even at the expense of reduced vertical transmission. Conversely, when hosts are rare, selection should favor increased vertical transmission even at the expense of lower horizontal transfer. We tested the tradeoff hypothesis and these evolutionary predictions using conjugative plasmids and the bacteria that they infect. Plasmids were allowed to evolve for 500 generations in environments with different densities of susceptible hosts. The plasmid's rate of horizontal transfer by conjugation increased at the expense of host fitness, indicating a tradeoff between horizontal and vertical transmission. Also, reductions in conjugation rate repeatedly coincided with the loss of a particular plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance gene. However, susceptible host density had no significant effect on the evolution of horizontal versus vertical modes of plasmid transmission. We consider several possible explanations for the failure to observe such an effect.

AB  - To provide basic information for orchid conservation, we surveyed the plant allozyme literature to summarize genetic diversity and structure data for (i) rare orchids native to the Korean Peninsula, and (ii) their congeners irrespective of being common and rare or Korean or not. A total of 68 taxa (32 taxa in Korea and 37 outside Korea; Goodyera repens being included in both datasets) were considered in this study. Overall, rare Korean orchid species had significantly lower levels of genetic diversity than their common congeners and common orchids in general at both population and species levels. However, mean values of G (ST) (or F (ST)) for rare and common orchids (Korean or not) did not differ significantly from each other. We found patterns of both low and high genetic diversity in rare Korean orchids. Many rare orchids harbored a complete lack of allozyme variation or extremely low within-population variation, perhaps due to rarity associated with random genetic drift and/or, for the case of warm-temperate orchids, to founder effects during post-glacial re-colonization. In contrast, high levels of genetic variation were found for a few orchids that have become recently rare (due to over-collection during the past several decades), probably because there have not been sufficient generations for the initial diversity to be substantially eroded. In addition, several orchids occurring in the main mountain system of the Korean Peninsula (the Baekdudaegan), that served as a glacial refugium, maintained moderate to high levels of within-population genetic diversity. Based on our genetic data, conservation priority should be given to rare orchid species. Particularly, urgent measures should be implemented on Jeju Island, a popular vacation spot, because it also a hotspot for threatened orchids with low levels of genetic diversity.

AB  - An organism's ability to cope with thermal stress is an important predictor of survival in a changing climate. One way in which organisms may acclimatize to thermal stress in the short-term is through induced thermotolerance, whereby exposure to a sublethal heat shock enables the organism to subsequently survive what might otherwise be a lethal event. Whether induced thermotolerance is related to basal thermotolerance is not well understood for marine organisms. Furthermore, whether populations often differ in their capacity for induced thermotolerance is also unclear. Here, we tested for differences in basal thermotolerance and induced thermotolerance among six populations of Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) from three California estuaries. Oysters were raised under common-garden laboratory conditions for a generation and then exposed to two treatments (control or sublethal heat shock) followed by a spectrum of temperatures that bound the upper critical temperature in order to determine LT50 (temperature at which 50% of the population dies). All populations exhibited induced thermotolerance by increasing their LT50 to a similar maximum temperature when extreme thermal stress was preceded by a sublethal heat shock. However, populations differed in their basal thermotolerance and their plasticity in thermotolerance. Populations with the highest basal thermotolerance were least able to modify upper critical temperature, while the population with the lowest basal thermotolerance exhibited the greatest plasticity in the upper critical temperature. Our results highlight that populations with high basal thermotolerance may be most vulnerable to climate warming because they lack the plasticity required to adjust their upper thermal limits.

AB  - The new developments in cookstove design have been made for better usage of sustainable energy and reducing the worse impact of climate change on environment. A cookstove is a combustion device which liberates lot of heat energy during cooking. In the recent developed design of TEG integrated forced draft biomass cookstove, the liberated waste heat energy is utilized for generation of electricity with the help of a thermoelectric generator. A power of 5W is achieved through the thermoelectric generator. The generated electricity is stored in a Li-ion battery and used further for running a 12Vd.c. fan, lighting a LED light, and charging a mobile phone. The novelty in charging a Li-ion battery is to run a fan for domestic biomass cookstove for cleaner combustion. The fan is also used for cooling one side of TEG through heat sink for improving electrical performance of TEG and thus improving the combustion of the cookstove. This cookstove has been deployed in the rural areas to check its usability, viability, electrical and thermal performance under the umbrella of clean combustion. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the biology of reproduction of an organismal lineage is important for retracing key evolutionary processes, yet gaining detailed insights often poses major challenges. Planktonic Foraminifera are globally distributed marine microbial eukaryotes and important contributors to the global carbon cycle. They cannot routinely be cultured under laboratory conditions across generations, and thus details of their life cycle remain incomplete. The production of flagellated gametes has long been taken as an indication of exclusively sexual reproduction, but recent research suggests the existence of an additional asexual generation in the life cycle. To gain a better understanding of the reproductive biology of planktonic Foraminifera, we applied a dynamic, individual-based modelling approach with parameters based on laboratory and field observations to test if sexual reproduction is sufficient for maintaining viable populations. We show that temporal synchronization and potentially spatial concentration of gamete release seems inevitable for maintenance of the population under sexual reproduction. We hypothesize that sexual reproduction is likely beneficial during the adaptation to new environments, while population sustenance in stable environments can be ensured through asexual reproduction.

AB  - Estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations for seven reproductive attributes had previously been obtained from parent-offspring regression (Gromko, 1987).  Copulation duration was shown to have a heritability of 0.23 and to be genetically correlated with courtship vigor (r(A) = -0.41) and with fertility (r(A) = 0.27).  These observations form the basis for the prediction of direct and correlated responses to selection for increased and decreased copulation duration, which are reported here.  The direct response corresponded closely to prediction, but the correlated responses did not provide consistent qualitative fit.  A hypothesis is proposed to explain this difference in predictability of direct and correlated response to selection.  The major postulate is that the different polygenes involved in the direct response to selection for copulation duration have different pleiotropic effects.

AB  - A two generation selection experiment in Nile tilapia (O. niloticus, Lake Manzala, Egypt) was carried out to test whether the proportion of males after temperature treatment could be sustainably influenced by selection. Starting with 45 families as a base population the families were tested for their thermal sensitivity in the following way. After a 9-day incubation period at 28 degrees C, fry of each family were subdivided into a control (28 degrees C) and a treatment group, each consisting of 110 fish. The treatment group was kept at a temperature of 36 degrees C for 10 days. Thereafter treated fry were gradually adapted to 28 degrees C again. Each treatment and corresponding control group was raised separately until sexing (by microscopic inspection of gonad squashes at a minimum age of 90 days). A random sample of ten males and females from control groups of each family was kept for later selection decisions. The percentage of males in treatment groups was the selection criterion and the families showing more than 80% males or less than 60% after temperature treatment were selected. Over two generations (G0 and G1) around 14% of the tested families were selected to produce two divergent lines (high and low line) which showed a high or low response to temperature treatment regarding their sex ratios. In the first and second generation of selection 66 and 26 families were tested in the high line and 72 and 13 families in the low line, respectively. After two generations of selection the temperature treated groups in the high line showed a male percentage of 90%, whereas the weakly sensitive low line showed an average male proportion of 54%. The realized heritability estimated from the cumulated realized selection response and -differential in successive generations was 0.69 in the high line and 0.86 in the low line. This study provides the first evidence that a surplus of males in temperature treated groups can be selected for as a quantitative trait. Thus, temperature sensitive lines could be produced as a consumer- and environment-friendly approach to significantly increase the proportion of males in Nile tilapia, if large numbers of broodstock could be tested.

AB  - Being affected by a variety of factors, power-generation structure plays an essential role in a high-quality and sustainable development. The focus of this paper is to evaluate the influence of electricity price on it. First, we provide a microeconomic framework to understand the impact mechanism. We discuss two effects through which price level can affect power generation, and then the power-generation structure. After that, an empirical test is conducted using provincial panel data, and the results of it are robust. We also test the above-mentioned mechanism empirically. There are two main conclusions. First, the electricity price has a positive effect on the share of thermal power in electricity generation. Second, the mechanism test shows that an increase of electricity price can not only improve efficiency of power plants but also propel firms to invest in more renewable energy plants.

AB  - High temperatures can negatively impact the performance and survival of organisms, particularly ectotherms. While an organism's response to high temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations during development affected gene expression both independently and in conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a genetically related field population that have been separated for >300 generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae. Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the particular temperature conditions. This study contributes to increased knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses of organisms to temperature fluctuations, which is needed for the development of more accurate thermal performance models.

AB  - Gene editing in C. elegans using plasmid-based CRISPR reagents requires microinjection of many animals to produce a single edit. Germline silencing of plasmid-borne Cas9 is a major cause of inefficient editing. Here, we present a set of C. elegans strains that constitutively express Cas9 in the germline from an integrated transgene. These strains markedly improve the success rate for plasmid-based CRISPR edits. For simple, short homology arm GFP insertions, 50-100% of injected animals typically produce edited progeny, depending on the target locus. Template-guided editing from an extrachromosomal array is maintained over multiple generations. We have built strains with the Cas9 transgene on multiple chromosomes. Additionally, each Cas9 locus also contains a heatshock-driven Cre recombinase for selectable marker removal and a bright fluorescence marker for easy outcrossing. These integrated Cas9 strains greatly reduce the workload for producing individual genome edits.
   Author summaryGermlines have evolved specialized mechanisms to protect themselves from invasions by transposons and viruses, which create barriers to genome editing techniques. For example, transgenes are silenced in the germline of the nematode C. elegans, thereby creating a barrier to CRISPR editing by Cas9. To facilitate gene editing, we built a collection of C. elegans strains in which Cas9 is never silenced. CRISPR is significantly more efficient in these animals, decreasing the effort researchers need to expend to get edited animals. The strains are available in multiple genetic backgrounds, and contain accessory transgenes to simplify downstream genetics. Together, these strains enable efficient, low-cost genome editing in C. elegans.

AB  - In the present work, solar energy utilizations by different solar systems such as solar water treatment, solar water heating, stem generation for the purpose of electricity generation; solar pumps, etc. have been introduced. Out of these, a focused approach for the solar water heating, solar water distillation by utilizing different solar collectors have been extensively reviewed to identify the generalized usability in that field. The collection of different solar collectors have different capabilities towards the absorption of direct and diffused solar radiations based on its materials, geometry, design, etc. and for that a rigorous observations have been made in the present effort. As the Earth has a solar energy rich surfaces so related technology search in other fields such as mechanical devices such as in mechanical devices, pneumatic suspension cars, thermal devices, pneumatic pumps, etc. is a worthwhile approach with the help of the current study. In the present study, solar thermal collectors such as vacuum tube collectors, flat plate collectors, concentrated reflectors, trough collectors, etc. have been recognized in this study. The parabolic concentrator covers the larger area of solar energy and evacuated tubes efficiently hold the available solar energy. And, polygeneration systems presents better options for the multi-disciplinary utilizations of renewable energy resources. Depending on the targeted approach, a dignified discussion and a concise conclusion have been framed with its futuristic recommendations. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: An effective method for obtaining resistant transgenic plants is to induce RNA silencing by expressing virus-derived dsRNA in plants and this method has been successfully implemented for the generation of different plant lines resistant to many plant viruses.
   Results: Inverted repeats of the partial Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) movement protein (MP) gene and the partial Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) replication protein (Rep) gene were introduced into the plant expression vector and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was carried out and three transgenic tobacco lines (MP16-17-3, MP16-17-29 and MP16-17-58) immune to TMV infection and three transgenic tobacco lines (Rep15-1-1, Rep15-1-7 and Rep15-1-32) immune to CMV infection were obtained. Virus inoculation assays showed that the resistance of these transgenic plants could inherit and keep stable in T-4 progeny. The low temperature (15 degrees C) did not influence the resistance of transgenic plants. There was no significant correlation between the resistance and the copy number of the transgene. CMV infection could not break the resistance to TMV in the transgenic tobacco plants expressing TMV hairpin MP RNA.
   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that transgenic tobacco plants expressed partial TMV movement gene and partial CMV replicase gene in the form of an intermolecular intron-hairpin RNA exhibited complete resistance to TMV or CMV infection.

AB  - A series of Escherichia coli strains with varied genomic sequences were subjected to high-density microarray analyses to elucidate the fitness-correlated transcriptomes. Fitness, which is commonly evaluated by the growth rate during the exponential phase, is not only determined by the genome but is also linked to growth conditions, e.g., temperature. We previously reported genetic and environmental contributions to E. coli transcriptomes and evolutionary transcriptome changes in thermal adaptation. Here, we describe experimental details on how to prepare microarray samples that truly represent the growth fitness of the E. coli cells. A step-by-step record of sample preparation procedures that correspond to growing cells and transcriptome data sets that are deposited at the GEO database (GSE33212, GSE52770, GSE61739) are also provided for reference.

AB  - 1. In temperate climates, reptiles face constraining thermal conditions, and thus tradeoff predator avoidance against thermoregulatory requirements.
   2. Selection of high thermal quality shelters can entail substantial fitness gains by enabling the selection of optimal body temperatures for physiological performance (e.g., high body temperature for digestion), whilst minimizing predation risk.
   3. We studied two species of sympatric colubrid snakes (Hierophis viridiflavus and Zamenis longissimus) with contrasted thermal preferences in a forested area, offering a diversity of natural and anthropogenic shelters. Individuals were monitored using radiotelemetry. Physical models were used to assess operative environmental temperature.
   4. The exploitation of particular artificial shelters, both during diurnal and nocturnal phases, entailed important thermal benefits to the snakes.
   5. As predicted, the most thermophilic species, H. viridiflavus, used hot shelters more often than the less thermophilic species Z. longissimus. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An overview of planted forest and its use for energy generation in Brazil is presented. Historical and current data on planted area, productivity and consumption of planted wood is presented. Planted wood was responsible for 7.8% of primary energy consumed in Brazil during 2016, mainly as charcoal for steel industry. Eucalyptus and pine are the main planted species in Brazil. Favourable climate and soil quality enhance productivity of planted forest in Brazil, reaching 30-36 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) thus representing the world's highest productivity, with better managed forests producing up to 70 m(3) ha(-1). Forest residues reach 20% for eucalyptus and 40% for pine as compared to the amount of wood produced. Residues of a particular eucalyptus planted forest were collected directly on the field, considered for fuel and analyzed determining composition, heat value, ash content and thermogravimetric analysis. It is estimated a yearly generation of 20 x 10(6) t of forest residues and 15 x 10(6) t of wood industry residues. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Connectivity and local adaptation are two contrasting evolutionary forces highly influencing population structure. To evaluate the impact of early-life traits and environmental conditions on genetic structuring and adaptation, we studied two sympatric fish species in the Western Mediterranean Sea: Symphodus tinca and S. ocellatus. We followed an individual-based approach and measured early-life history traits from otolith readings, gathered information on environmental variables and obtained genome-wide markers from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The two species presented contrasting population structure across the same geographic gradient, with high and significant population differentiation in S. ocellatus, mostly determined by oceanographic fronts, and low differentiation and no front effect in S. tinca. Despite their different levels of genetic differentiation, we identified in both species candidate regions for local adaptation by combining outlier analysis with environmental and phenotypic association analyses. Most candidate loci were associated to temperature and productivity in S. ocellatus and to temperature and turbulence in S. tinca suggesting that different drivers may determine genomic diversity and differentiation in each species. Globally, our study highlights that individual-based approach combining genomic, environmental and phenotypic information is key to identify signals of selection and the processes mediating them.

In order to solve the shortcoming premature and easily local optimum of the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), the fuzzy adaptive criterion is applied for inertia weight based on the evolution speed factor and square deviation of fitness for the swarm, in each iteration process, the inertia weight is dynamically changed using the fuzzy rules to adapt to nonlinear optimization process. The performance of FAPSO is demonstrated on hydro- thermal system comprising 1 thermal unit and 4 hydro plants, the comparison is drawn in PSO, FAPSO and genetic algorithms(GA) in terms of the solution quality and computational efficiency. The experiment showed that the proposed approach has higher quality solutions and strong ability in global search.

AB  - The present study introduces fundamental aspects of a novel concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) technology.' The technology is based on combining CPV/T receiver along with a solar thermal receiver. The combination is referred to as a High Concentrated Photovoltaic/Thermal - Combined receiver or HCPV/T-CT. The receiver is allocated in lieu of the conventional solar thermal receivers in the solar tower power plant schemes. The plant is designed to generate electricity and thermal energy simultaneously prior to integration with the conventional water desalination plant. The centralized generation in the CPV/T-CT receiver will remarkably simplify the complexity of the conventional solar power plants, and eliminate the piping networks' energy losses in the CPV/T Dish tracking plants. The viability of the HCPV/T-CT power tower plant has also been investigated by; firstly, designing and simulating the plant performance using the System advisor model (SAM) software, and secondly, designing a prototype receiver and then deriving a mathematical model. The Levelised Cost Of Electricity/Energy (LCOE) was found to be 0.119 $/kWhe and 0.021 $/kWhe for electricity and energy generation, respectively, while the photovoltaic cells temperature maintained below the 90 degrees C.

AB  - The effect of high temperature on survival and longevity of Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) female adults was studied in the laboratory by daily exposure of the beetles to 35A degrees C (mean r.h. 52%) combined with 1-, 2- and 3-h intervals of thermal treatment at 38, 40, 42 and 44A degrees C (r.h. 46-48%). Fifty percent of females survived until the 12th-13th day of the thermal treatment at 38A degrees C (depending on the exposure time), the 2nd-10th day at 40A degrees C for 1-2 h exposure and the 4th-5th day at 42A degrees C for 1 h exposure. Survival was 25-38% on the 1st-2nd day of the thermal treatment at 40, 42 and 44A degrees C for 3, 2 and 1 h of exposure, respectively. Three hours of exposure of female C. montrouzieri at 42A degrees C and 2 h exposure at 44A degrees C were lethal for the beetles. Mean longevity of the predator was 33.13 A +/- 1.22 days at 35A degrees C and was significantly shorter as the temperature of the thermal treatments increased from 38(o) to 44A degrees C. These results suggest that daily temperature regimes of 35A degrees C combined with 38-40A degrees C for 1-3 h are marginal for the survival and longevity of the C. montrouzieri, whereas temperatures above 42A degrees C are lethal even at short exposure. These results can partly justify the inability of C. montrouzieri to be permanently established in Pakistan environments and could contribute to a pre-evaluation assay of its potential adaptability in such environmental systems.

AB  - The present study investigated evolutionary patterns of Escherichia coli growth and survival in transmission through the coastal ecosystem between human host and seawater using a novel 'Host to Coast' Laboratory Analog simulating an 11 d sequence cycling through the pH and temperature conditions of the small intestine, colon, sewer, seawater, human stomach, and back into the small intestine. Although historically E. coli has been assumed to die off rapidly in seawater, a few instances of E. coli growth have been observed in environmental fresh water, soils, and nutrient-enriched tropical seawater, suggesting the potential for evolving greater viability in such environments. This study investigated whether E. coli can evolve increased capacity for growth and survival in seawater through selective exposures to singular abiotic factors such as the high alkalinity or low temperatures approximating coastal aquatic conditions, and also whether adaptation to cycling pH can lead to increased growth fitness in a human host. Specialists and generalists were examined to reveal patterns of trade-offs in the multi-stress environment of the Analog. Dramatic increases in fitness revealed in the Host to Coast Analog due to evolutionary exposure to alkalinity and cycling pH suggested that these factors are critically important in the evolutionary ecology of E. coli. Evolving the capacity for seawater survival and growth, combined with increased capability to infect human hosts, could facilitate E. coli infection from seawater exposure. Results suggest implications for wastewater management in order to prevent superior strains of pathogenic E. coli from evolving.

AB  - Equilibrium state generation for the pebble bed reactor (PBR) is challenging due to the need to simultaneously account for both pebble movement and changes in fuel compositions. Multigroup diffusion codes have been historically employed to generate the equilibrium state and perform conventional neutronics calculations for PBRs, while neutron cross-section generation has been challenging due to the double heterogeneity of PBRs. Thanks to the capability to treat the double heterogeneity naturally, continuous-energy Monte Carlo (MC) methods are more suitable for detailed PBR analysis, but at the cost of significantly higher computing power. This paper presents a new Methodology to Efficiently Estimate the Equilibrium State of a PBR (MEEES-PBR) to generate equilibrium-state MC models for PBRs at lower computational expense. The MEEES-PBR is expected to contribute to the future development of PBR designs by accelerating the efforts in core designs and parametric studies. The theory of the MEEES-PBR is introduced in detail in this paper, and the procedure is demonstrated via an example application to the 165-MW(thermal) Xe-100 design. The computational cost and the accuracy of the MEEES-PBR are discussed to prove its viability.

AB  - The rapid movement of heat transferred goes to be the most important target for researchers to deals with the thermal problems of electronic systems. Especially, that has high packing densities in limited space. Consequently, vertical combination between two shapes of fins was considered to improve the thermal performance of heat sink. Here, many models (longitudinal-pin fins) were created as a new approach based on the stable both of material and size.
   In the analytical solution, Finite element techniques used to solve the mathematical modeling and signum-sinusoidal-signum function was modified to model both the variable heat transfer area and convection perimeter. While in the numerical procedure, ANSYS simulation used as the validation of temperature distribution. In addition, results from previous work were used as second method of validation process. The results show a high level of agreement by maximum difference does not exceed (3.52%).
   In the calculation process, natural convection, range of Ra number (105-107) were applied for all models of which each one is distinguished by the parameter of area ratio (A*) between hybrid model and longitudinal model. The results show many advantages; a significant drop in temperature profile about (2.7%-8.8%). Also, decrease in thermal resistance by (23%-43%) and increases in heat transferred (29%-78%). Furthermore, all parameters have a significant improve for the models that have A* < 1.48. But this improvement was down to less level at A* > 1.48 as a result of overlapping between the effects of miscellaneous parameters.
   Irreversibility that associated with the entropy generation was considered. In this step, it becomes important to find the model that achieves maximize of the thermal performance and minimize of the entropy generation. For that, the optimization procedure using genetic algorithm was adopted. It's clearly the best model exist within a close range between 1.509 and 1.518 based on the behavior of the best fitness function. (C) 2020 Beihang University.

AB  - Intersex is an intermediate stage of sexual differentiation in insects. Determining intersex morphology and the cause of its production will aid in the understanding of the mechanism of sexual differentiation in insects. In this paper, Wolbachia-infected Trichogramma pretiosum (T. preW(+)) that shows thelytokous parthenogenesis were used as subjects. In order to determine the causes of the T. preW(+) intersex and the influence of parental generation temperature on gradual changes in secondary masculinization in intersex offspring, we examined the occurrence of intersex offspring (F-1 and F-2 generation) after the parental generations were treated with high temperature (27, 29, 31, and 33 degrees C) and described the external morphology of the intersexes. The results showed that the T. preW(+) parental generation temperature is positively correlated with the probability of intersex offspring. The probability of F-1 intersex is significantly higher than that of F-2 intersex in different high temperature. The degree of secondary masculinization in T. preW+ intersexes increases as parental generation temperature increases. In addition, our study first identified 11 intersex types in T. preW(+) and found that the primary and secondary sexual characteristics showed a regular distribution. We also found that the D type and H type of intersex have the highest frequency of appearance. The external genitalia of most intersexes were female, and only three intersex types have male external genitalia. Conclusions were ultimately obtained: Wolbachia is a direct factor that causes the occurrence of intersexes, while high temperature is an indirect factor that determines the external morphology of intersexes. The effects of high temperature on T. preW(+) intersexes is passed through the parental generation to offspring, and this maternal effect weakens as the number of generations increases. In T. preW(+) intersex individuals, most exhibit female primary sexual characteristics, and secondary sexual characteristics exhibit signs of masculinization.

AB  - Extreme heat has tremendous adverse effects on human health. Heat stress is expected to further increase due to urbanization, an aging population, and global warming. Previous research has identified correlations between extreme heat and mortality. However, the underlying physical, behavioral, environmental, and social risk factors remain largely unknown and comprehensive quantitative investigation on an individual level is lacking. We conducted a new cross-sectional household questionnaire survey to analyze individual heat impairment (self-assessed and reported symptoms) and a large set of potential risk factors in the city of Berlin, Germany. This unique dataset (n = 474) allows for the investigation of new relationships, especially between health/fitness and urban heat stress. Our analysis found previously undocumented associations, leading us to generate new hypotheses for future research: various health/fitness variables returned the strongest associations with individual heat stress. Our primary hypothesis is that age, the most commonly used risk factor, is outperformed by health/fitness as a dominant risk factor. Related variables seem to more accurately represent humans' cardiovascular capacity to handle elevated temperature. Among them, active travel was associated with reduced heat stress. We observed statistical associations for heat exposure regarding the individual living space but not for the neighborhood environment. Heat stress research should further investigate individual risk factors of heat stress using quantitative methodologies. It should focus more on health and fitness and systematically explore their role in adaptation strategies. The potential of health and fitness to reduce urban heat stress risk means that encouraging active travel could be an effective adaptation strategy. Through reduced CO2 emissions from urban transport, societies could reap double rewards by addressing two root causes of urban heat stress: population health and global warming.

AB  - Although environmental variability and predictability have been proposed as the underlying ecological context in which transgenerational plasticity (TGP) arises, the adaptive significance and interaction with within-generation plasticity (WGP) in such scenarios is still poorly understood. To investigate these questions, we considered the tolerance to upper thermal limits of larvae and adults of the desert endemic Drosophila mojavensis adapted to different climatic regions (Desert vs. Mediterranean climate).
   Thermal plasticity was investigated by acclimating parents and offspring at 36 degrees C (vs. at 25 degrees C). We then used historical temperature variation data from both regions to perform individual-based simulations by modelling expected components of adaptive plasticity in multiple life stages.
   Our results indicated that thermal response to ramping heat shocks was more pronounced in larvae, where acclimation treatments in parents and offspring increased their heat-shock performance, while heat knockdown in adults was only increased by offspring acclimation of adults. The relative contribution of WGP and TGP was greater for the population from the more thermally variable Sonoran Desert.
   Similarly, individual-based simulations of evolving maternal effects indicated that variation in tolerance to upper thermal limits across life stages and climates is expected from its adaptive significance in response to environmental predictability.
   Our approach offers a new perspective and interpretation of adaptive plasticity, demonstrating that environmental predictability can drive thermal responses across generations and life stages in a scenario with regional climate variability.

The nature and extent of intensity of this phenomenon are highly influenced by the mechanical and thermal properties of materials. In the present work, three non-asbestos organic (NAO) friction composites with three metallic particulate fillers (iron, copper and brass) were developed. They were evaluated on a specially designed tribometer for enabling the studies of hot spots and thermal localization phenomenon under braking conditions. Overall, composite with iron powder proved best by showing least tendency for hot-spot generation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evolutionary theory predicts that adaptations, including antibiotic resistance, should come with associated fitness costs; yet, many resistance mutations seemingly contradict this prediction by inducing no growth rate deficit. However, most growth assays comparing sensitive and resistant strains have been performed under a narrow range of environmental conditions, which do not reflect the variety of contexts that a pathogenic bacterium might encounter when causing infection. We hypothesized that reduced niche breadth, defined as diminished growth across a diversity of environments, can be a cost of antibiotic resistance. Specifically, we test whether chloramphenicol-resistant Escherichia coli incur disproportionate growth deficits in novel thermal conditions. Here we show that chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria have greater fitness costs at novel temperatures than their antibiotic-sensitive ancestors. In several cases, we observed no resistance cost in growth rate at the historic temperature but saw diminished growth at warmer and colder temperatures. These results were consistent across various genetic mechanisms of resistance. Thus, we propose that decreased thermal niche breadth is an under-documented fitness cost of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the cost of antibiotic resistance shifts rapidly as the environment changes; these context-dependent resistance costs should select for the rapid gain and loss of resistance as an evolutionary strategy.

AB  - Simple Summary Insects are often stressed by adverse factors in their natural environment. Temperature is a crucial driver of insect activity, adaptability, and distribution, and therefore, it greatly impacts the invasive success of alien pests. Bactrocera tau (Walker) is an invasive polyphagous herbivore of vegetables and fruits, now a pest of global importance. This study provides useful information about B. tau's cold- and heat tolerance to extremely low and high temperatures. Its different life stages (i.e., egg, larvae, pupae, and adult) had high survival rates under adverse temperatures spanning -5 to 0 degrees C and 39 to 42 degrees C. These findings suggest that B. tau possesses a wide temperature threshold range for survival, which likely contributes to its better establishment and expansion in new regions. Meanwhile, fitted curves were used to quantify B. tau's tolerance potential as a function of both stress intensity (heat or cold) and exposure duration. The information generated in this study will contribute to our understanding of thermal tolerance in B. tau and could also provide insights for devising phytosanitary control approaches. Bactrocera tau (Walker) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a serious, economically important invasive pest that has spread and been established in many regions worldwide. Temperature is a crucial abiotic factor governing insect activity, fitness, and geographical distribution. Yet, surprisingly, the tolerance of B. tau to extreme cold and heat stress remains unclear. Here, we measured the supercooling point (SCP) of different life stages of B. tau. Further, several life stages of B. tau (egg, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instar larvae, 1-day-old pupae, and 3-day-old adult) were subjected to six low temperatures (-9, -7, -5, -3, -1, and 0 degrees C) and six high temperatures (39, 40, 41, 42, 43, and 44 degrees C) for various durations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 h), and three-way survival-time-temperature relationships were investigated. We found that the SCPs differed significantly among different life stages of B. tau, being the lowest for SCP of eggs, at -25.82 +/- 0.51 degrees C. There was no significant effect of sex on the mean SCPs of B. tau adults, except for 45- to 50-day-old flies. In addition, an interaction effect was uncovered between tested temperatures and exposure duration upon B. tau mortality at different life stages. Eggs exhibited the strongest cold tolerance, yet the weakest heat tolerance. The 3rd instar larvae were the most heat- and cold tolerant among larval stages, followed by the 2nd and 1st instar larvae. The upper limit of the chill injury zone (ULCIZ) for 3-day-old adult and 1-day-old pupae was -2.51 degrees C and -2.50 degrees C, respectively, while their corresponding lower limit of thermal injury zone (LLTIZ) was 39.39 degrees C and 38.29 degrees C. This paper presents valuable data to provide an integrated knowledge for understanding the cold and heat tolerance potential of B. tau and ensure the proper implementation of post-harvest phytosanitary protocols for this pest's disinfestation.

AB  - In the Eastern Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine, which is characterized by a sharp change in weather conditions during the growing season of agricultural crops, it is very important to grow hybrids that are most adapted to frequent weather anomalies during the growing season. This can significantly reduce their negative impact on the productivity of spring wheat.
   The results of a study of 20 samples (soft spring wheat Triticum aestivum L.) and (durum spring wheat Trticum durum) of different ecological and geographical origin for adaptability when changing environmental conditions (Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Sweden) are presented. Adaptability indicators were determined by the following characteristics: mass of one spike, mass of grain from one spike, number of grains from one spike, mass of 1000 seeds, mass of grain from 1 m2. Samples that have high plasticity and stability by these characteristics have been identified. 3As a result of the conducted studies, the dependence between the main signs of productivity were established: the number of grains from one spike, the mass of grains from one spike, the mass of 1000 seeds, the mass of one spike, the mass of seeds from 1 m2 of Triticum aestium and Triticum durumsamples. We have considered the adaptability of selection characteristics of samples by years with different environmental conditions: air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation amount, and hydrothermal coefficient.

AB  - Background: The evolution of insecticide resistance and persistence of resistance phenotypes are influenced by the fitness of resistance alleles in the absence of insecticide pressure. Experimental determination of fitness is difficult, but fitness can be inferred by measuring changes in allele frequencies in appropriate environments. We conducted allele competition experiments by crossing two highly related strains of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. One strain (ISOP450) was permethrin resistant (due to P450-mediated detoxification) and one was a susceptible strain. Allele and genotype frequencies were examined for 12 generations under three environmental conditions: standard laboratory, temephos exposure (an insecticide to which the P450 detoxification mechanism in ISOP450 confers no resistance and which is commonly used in mosquito control programs) and cold temperature stress (mimics the colder temperatures within the habitat of this mosquito).
   Results: A fitness cost was inferred for the P450 mechanism in the standard laboratory environment. A greater cost was associated with the temephos exposed environment, suggesting the temephos placed an additional stress on the P450 resistant mosquitoes. No observed cost was associated with the P450 resistance locus in the cold temperature environment, but there was a significant heterozygote advantage. In all environments the fitness of the resistant homozygotes was the lowest.
   Conclusion: The cytochrome P450-mediated permethrin detoxification resistance in Cx. p. quinquefasciatus can have an associated fitness cost in the absence of permethrin, relative to a susceptible allele. The strength of the cost varies depending on the environmental conditions. P450-mediated resistance is expected to decrease over time if the permethrin application is relaxed and to decrease at an even faster rate if permethrin is replaced with temephos. Additionally, these results indicate that a P450 resistance allele can persist (especially in heterozygotes) in colder temperatures and could potentially be carried into the Culex pipiens hybrid zone.

AB  - In variable environments, selection should favor generalists that maintain fitness across a range of conditions. However, costs of adaptation may generate fitness trade-offs and lead to some compromise between specialization and generalization that maximizes fitness. Here, we evaluate the evolution of specialization and generalization in 20 populations of Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved in constant and variable thermal environments for 3 years. We developed genotypes from each population at two temperatures after which we measured fecundity across eight temperatures. We predicted that constant environments would select for thermal specialists and that variable environments would select for thermal generalists. Contrary to our predictions, specialists and generalists did not evolve in constant and spatially variable environments, respectively. However, temporal variation produced a type of generalist that has rarely been considered by theoretical models of developmental plasticity. Specifically, genotypes from the temporally variable selective environment were more fecund across all temperatures than were genotypes from other environments. These patterns suggest certain allelic effects and should inspire new directions for modeling adaptation to fluctuating environments.

AB  - High-nickel layered oxide cathodes with a Ni content of >90% show substantial potential for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high capacity and lower cost. However, they are plagued by rapid capacity decay and poor thermal stability, which hamper their practical viability. We present here Li0.98Mg0.02Ni0.94Co0.06O2 (NC-Mg) with 2% Mg doping, aiming to provide a strategic guideline for solving the issues. The Mg2+ ions occupy the lithium layer and are proposed to act as pillar ions, which substantially enhance the structural reversibility and reduce the anisotropic lattice distortion upon cycling, thereby greatly improving the electrochemical and thermal stability of NC-Mg compared to the undoped LiNi0.94Co0.06O2 (NC). Specifically, NC-Mg delivers 214 mA h g(-1) with a capacity retention of 80.1% after 500 cycles in pouch-type full cells, much higher than the retention of NC (56.3%). A discharge capacity of 158 mA h g(-1) at 10C rate demonstrates its remarkable rate capability. Additionally, the Mg doping significantly elevates the exothermic peak temperature of NC-Mg to 211 degrees C, in sharp contrast to 177 degrees C for NC, highlighting the improved thermal stability of NC-Mg. Collectively, the superior performance of NC-Mg demonstrates a feasible alternative strategy for developing safer, high-energy-density LIBs.

AB  - Little is known about the behavioral responses of fishes at low temperatures. Of particular interest are predator-prey interactions because feeding at low temperature is necessary for the overwinter survival of many species. This experiment examined how low temperatures affect behavioral interactions between bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix L) and two sizes of bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli V.) prey. Temperature had an effect on multiple responses of predator-prey encounters including the approach distance of bluefish towards prey, attack and escape speeds, and prey handling time. The reaction distance of prey was important in determining the outcome of an attack; anchovy reacting at a greater distance from an attacking bluefish escaped more often. However, temperature did not have an effect on either reaction distance or bluefish capture success. The influence of prey size depended on how capture success was defined. Bluefish ability at catching prey was not affected by anchovy size, but larger prey were ingested less frequently due to a greater incidence of prey being dropped in trials with large anchovy. Further, bluefish had greater difficulty handling and ingesting prey at lower temperatures, especially for larger prey. At the lowest temperature treatment small anchovy were readily consumed, but no attacks were made on larger prey. This shows that bluefish modify prey size-selectivity behavior based on temperature, which probably results from a perceived inability to handle and ingest large prey at low temperatures. These results suggest that at low winter temperatures bluefish are restricted to smaller prey. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The anuran Rhinella spinulosa is distributed along the Andes Range at altitudes that undergo wide daily and seasonal variation in temperature. One of the populations inhabits geothermal streams, a stable environment that influences life history traits such as the timing of metamorphosis. To investigate whether this population has undergone local adaptation to this unique habitat, we carried out transcriptome analyses in animals from two localities in two developmental stages (prometamorphic and metamorphic) and exposed them to two temperatures (20 and 25 degrees C). RNA-Seq, de novo assembly and annotation defined a transcriptome revealing 194,469 high quality SNPs, with 1,507 genes under positive selection. Comparisons among the experimental conditions yielded 1,593 differentially expressed genes. A bioinformatics search for candidates revealed a total of 70 genes that are highly likely to be implicated in the adaptive response of the population living in a stable environment, compared to those living in an environment with variable temperatures. Most importantly, the population inhabiting the geothermal environment showed decreased transcriptional plasticity and reduced genetic variation compared to its counterpart from the non-stable environment. This analysis will help to advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that account for the local adaptation to geothermal streams in anurans.

AB  - Chemical pollution and global warming are two major threats to organisms, which can interact to affect the normal activities of living beings. In this study, to explore the effects of abamectin and high temperature on adaptability of lizard, male adult Eremias argus (a native Chinese lizard) were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of abamectin (0.02 mg.L-1 and 2 mg.L-1) and different temperature (26 & DEG;C and 32 & DEG;C) for 30 days. The fitness-related behaviors (locomotion, predation, and thermoregulation) of lizards were evaluated. Physiological effects were addressed using biochemical biomarkers related to oxidative stress, detoxification, and neurotransmitter content. The results showed that abamectin could affect the neurotransmitter systems, cause oxidative stress, and alters lizard locomotion and predation-related behaviors of lizards, but lizards up-regulating detoxification metabolic enzymes, exhibiting higher body temperature preference to alleviate the toxicity of abamectin, and compensate the increased energy demand for detoxification and repair damage by increasing food intake. After exposure to high temperature, lizards showed adaptation to high temperature (higher body temperature preference), the thermal compensation mechanisms may involve elevated Hsp70 levels and increased food intake. At the combined effects of abamectin and high temperature, more obvious behavioral disorders and more severe oxidative stress were observed, although lizards avoided the negative effects of overheating and pollutants by seeking thermal shelter and reducing energy expenditure, this may subsequently reduce foraging opportunities and the ability to obtain energy needed for vital physiological functions (i.e., growth, maintenance, and reproduction). From a long-term perspective, these short-term adaptive strategies will be detrimental to individual long-term survival and population sustainability, and may transformed into maladaptation.

AB  - Climate changes can affect the distribution and intensity of insect infestations through direct effects on their life cycles. Experiments were carried out during three consecutive generations to evaluate the effect of different temperatures (25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 31 degrees C, 34 degrees C and 37+/-1 degrees C) on biological traits of the velvetbean caterpillar Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, 1818 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The insects were fed on artificial diet and reared in environmental chambers set at 14h photophase. The developmental cycle slowed with the increase in the temperature, within the 25 degrees C to 34 degrees C range. Male and female longevities were reduced with an increase in temperature from 25 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Egg viability was highest at 25 degrees C, and the sex ratio was not influenced by temperature, in the three generations. There was no interactive effect between development time and temperature on pupal weight. The results suggested that the increase in the temperature negatively impacted A. gemmatalis development inside the studied temperature range, indicating a possible future reduction of its occurrence on soybean crops, as a consequence of global warming, mainly considering its impact on tropical countries where this plant is cropped. A. gemmatalis was not able to adapt to higher temperatures in a three-generation interval for the studied temperature range. However, a gradual increase and a longer adaptation period may favor insect selection and consequently adaptation, and must be considered in future studies in this area. Moreover, it is important to consider that global warming might turn cold areas more suitable to A. gemmatalis outbreaks. Therefore, more than a future reduction of A. gemmatalis occurrence due to global warming, we might expect changes regarding its area of occurrence on a global perspective.

AB  - In order to preserve key activities or improve survival, insects facing variable and unfavourable thermal environments may employ physiological adjustments on a daily basis. Here, we investigate the survival of laboratory-reared adult Cydia pomonella at high or low temperatures and their responses to pre-treatments at sub-lethal temperatures over short time-scales. We also determined critical thermal limits (CTLs) of activity of C pomonella and the effect of different rates of cooling or heating on CTLs to complement the survival assays. Temperature and duration of exposure significantly affected adult C. pomonella survival with more extreme temperatures and/or longer durations proving to be more lethal. Lethal temperatures, explored between -20 degrees C to -5 degrees C and 32 degrees C to 47 degrees C over 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h exposures, for 50% of the population of adult C pomonella were -12 degrees C for 2 h and 44 degrees C for 2 h. Investigation of rapid thermal responses (i.e. hardening) found limited low temperature responses but more pronounced high temperature responses. For example, C. pomonella pre-treated for 2 h at 5 degrees C improved survival at -9 degrees C for 2 h from 50% to 90% (p < 0.001). At high temperatures, pre-treatment at 37 degrees C for 1 h markedly improved survival at 43 degrees C for 2 h from 20% to 90% (p < 0.0001). We also examined cross-tolerance of thermal stressors. Here, low temperature pre-treatments did not improve high temperature survival, while high temperature pre-treatment (37 degrees C for 1 h) significantly improved low temperature survival (-9 degrees C for 2 h). Inducible cross-tolerance implicates a heat shock protein response. Critical thermal minima (CTmin) were not significantly affected by cooling at rates of 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 degrees C min(-1) (CTmin range: 0.3-1.3 degrees C). By contrast, critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were significantly affected by heating at these rates and ranged from 42.5 to 44.9 degrees C. In sum, these results suggest pronounced plasticity of acute high temperature tolerance in adult C. pomonella, but limited acute low temperature responses. We discuss these results in the context of local agroecosystem microclimate recordings. These responses are significant to pest control programmes presently underway and have implications for understanding the evolution of thermal tolerance in these and other insects.

   In addition to semen preservation, systematic cryo-banking of testicular tissues is critical to preserve the genetic value of recently deceased or neutered black-footed ferrets. Mature sperm cells produced from vitrified-warmed tissues could be used for in vitro fertilization over multiple generations, which would enhance the genetic management of this rare and endangered species. The objective of the study was to evaluate structural and functional properties of vitrified testicular tissues directly after warming or after warming plus a short period of in vitro culture. Fresh, vitrified/warmed, and warmed/cultured tissues from five adults were analyzed through histology, DNA fragmentation, cell survival, and germ cell composition. Percentages of intact seminiferous tubules decreased right after vitrification/warming and improved after culture (reaching same percentages as the fresh controls). While proportions of cells with intact DNA and viable cells were affected by vitrification/warming, they were then similar or better after additional culture than in the fresh tissue. Proportions of cells labeled with differentiation markers also increased during in vitro culture. We demonstrated for the first time that black-footed ferret testicular tissues can be vitrified and revived, which will potentially contribute to new strategies to enhance assisted reproduction as well as conservation efforts in that rare and endangered species.
   Systematic cryo-banking of semen and testicular tissues is critical to preserve the genetic value of recently deceased or neutered black-footed ferrets (BFFs). Specifically, recovering or producing mature sperm cells from vitrified-warmed issues offers additional options in assisted reproduction. This could, in turn, enhance the genetic management of this rare and endangered species over multiple generations. The objective of the study was to evaluate structural properties, DNA fragmentation, cell viability, and germ cell composition in vitrified testicular tissues from BFFs directly after warming or after warming plus a short in vitro culture period. Tissue biopsies from five adult BFFs were either kept fresh or vitrified with a standard protocol (using dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and glycerol) and warmed at 50 degrees C for 5 s. Some of the warmed samples were then cultured in vitro for 24 h. Fresh, warmed, and warmed/cultured tissues were analyzed using different indicators: histology of seminiferous tubules, intact Sertoli cells (vimentin labeling), DNA integrity, cell viability, germ cell composition (Oct4 and Boule labeling). Percentages of intact seminiferous tubules decreased after vitrification/warming and returned to the level of fresh samples after culture. While percentages of cells labeled with vimentin, with intact DNA integrity, or proportions of viable cells were affected by vitrification/warming, they all reached similar or better levels than the fresh tissue after culture. Proportions of cells labeled with Boule antibodies also improved during in vitro culture post-warming. We demonstrated for the first time that BFF testes subjected to vitrification, rapid warming, and short in vitro culture were viable and maintained the ability to resume germ cell progression. Cryopreserved testicular tissues could potentially contribute to new strategies to enhance BFF assisted reproduction as well as conservation efforts.

AB  - Nest selection has important consequences for fitness in freshwater turtles, as nest predation is extremely high in most populations. However, nest predation has rarely been considered a major factor affecting nest site selection. Thermal qualities of a nest are often suggested as a factor influencing maternal choice of nest site because incubation temperature affects offspring performance and growth, as well as the sex ratio of the clutch in species with temperature dependent sex determination (TSD). Yet experimental manipulations of the nesting environment (habitat and threat) to test factors influencing maternal nest site selection in turtles are uncommon. In this paper, we show that nest site selection in an Australian turtle (Emydura macquarii) with genetically determined sex determination (GSD) exists at two spatial scales, with predation as the major factor affecting the location of a nest. Females prefer to nest in areas where nest predation is minimal but when the risk of direct predation is increased, they trade-off minimising nest predation with survival by locating their nests closer to shore. However, experimentally reducing cover demonstrated that females prefer to nest in open areas, which are more common closer to shore. Hence females are forgoing preferred microhabitat to locate their nests away from shore to minimise nest predation. Despite a preference for open nesting areas, females exhibit similar repeatability of microenvironment selection to a North American species with TSD. Repeatability of nesting overstory vegetation in the North American turtle, Chrysemys picta, suggests that females may exert some control over the thermal qualities of the nests; a key assumption in theoretical models of the microevolution and adaptive significance of TSD in reptiles. Incubation temperature is one factor that may affect microhabitat preferences in both turtles but other factors (e.g. predation and soil moisture) affected by microbabitat may be critical in the evolution of repeatability of overstory cover.

AB  - The present paper reports the results obtained on a carbon dioxide transcritical power cycle using an energy and exergy analysis. The procedure consisted of modifying the inlet pressure to the turbine from 66 bar, by means of the software HYSYS (R), maintaining constant each evaluated turbine inlet temperature (60, 90, 120 and 150 degrees C) until the net work was approximately zero. As a result, an increase up to 25% for the exergy efficiency, and up to 300% for the energy efficiency are obtained when the inlet temperature to the turbine is risen from 60 to 150 degrees C. Consequently, the analysis shows the viability of implementing this process as alternative energy, because of the possibility to recovery energy from waste heat from industrial processes.

AB  - Marine heat waves are increasing in magnitude, duration, and frequency as a result of climate change and are the principal global driver of mortality in reef-building corals. Resilience-based genetic management may increase coral heat tolerance, but it is unclear how temperature responses are regulated at the genome level and thus how corals may adapt to warming naturally or through selective breeding. Here we combine phenotypic, pedigree, and genomic marker data from colonies sourced from a warm reef on the Great Barrier Reef reproductively crossed with conspecific colonies from a cooler reef to produce combinations of warm purebreds and warm-cool hybrid larvae and juveniles. Interpopulation breeding created significantly greater genetic diversity across the coral genome compared to breeding between populations and maintained diversity in key regions associated with heat tolerance and fitness. High-density genome-wide scans of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified alleles significantly associated with larval families reared at 27.5 degrees C (87-2,224 loci), including loci putatively associated with proteins involved in responses to heat stress (cell membrane formation, metabolism, and immune responses). Underlying genetics of these families explained 43% of PCoA multilocus variation in survival, growth, and bleaching responses at 27.5 degrees C and 31 degrees C at the juvenile stage. Genetic marker contribution to total variation in fitness traits (narrow-sense heritability) was high for survival but not for growth and bleaching in juveniles, with heritability of these traits being higher at 31 degrees C relative to 27.5 degrees C. While based on only a limited number of crosses, the mechanistic understanding presented here demonstrates that allele frequencies are affected by one generation of selective breeding, key information for the assessments of genetic intervention feasibility and modelling of reef futures.

AB  - Seasonal variation in activity patterns of reptiles is accompanied by physiological and behavioral adjustments that influence their ecology and life history, and overwinter survival may be an important factor limiting a species' northern range extension. A northern population of Wood Turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) in Ontario, Canada was surveyed in fall 2004, and a subset of adults was radio-tracked every 7-12 days during the winter of 2004-2005 to examine thermal aspects of overwintering. We predicted that Wood Turtles would use hibernacula that protect them from freezing and predation. Temperature data loggers indicated that turtle body temperatures and hibernacula temperatures remained near 0 degrees C from 2 December 2004 until 3 April 2005. During the same period, air temperatures fluctuated substantially and reached a maximum of 10.5 degrees C (on 30 March 2005) and a minimum of less than -40 degrees C (on 21 January 2005) with a mean of -8.3 degrees C. Turtles did not select specific water temperatures nor did they use distinct structures (e.g., root hollows, logjams, and holes in the riverbank) for overwintering but instead rested relatively exposed on the riverbed at a depth of approximately 1 m and at a mean distance of 1.0 m from the riverbank. Surprisingly, turtles made small movements during winter (0.1-10.0 m between radiolocations), typically against the river current and in a direction parallel to the riverbank. Average winter home-range size was 7.1 m(2). Our findings raise questions about why turtles move during winter, we suggest possible answers and future lines of investigation to address these questions.

AB  - High latitude insect populations must cope with extreme conditions, particularly low temperatures. Insects use a variety of cold hardiness mechanisms to withstand this temperature stress, and these can drive geographic distributions through overwintering mortality. The degree of cold hardiness can be altered by two evolved responses: phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation. Phenotypic plasticity can occur within or between generations (transgenerational plasticity; TGP), and local adaptation can evolve through directional selection in response to regional climatic differences. We used the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) as a model to explore the role that variable winter temperatures play in inducing two aspects of plasticity in cold hardiness: TGP and local adaptation in phenotypic plasticity. This species is one of the most destructive boreal forest pests in North America, therefore accurately predicting overwintering survival is essential for effective management. While we found no evidence of TGP in cold hardiness, there was a long term fitness cost to larvae that experienced repeated cold exposures. We also found evidence of local adaptation in both seasonal and short-term plasticity of cold hardiness, as our more northerly populations that would experience lower overwintering temperatures had more plastic responses to cold exposure. These findings provide evidence for the importance of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation when modelling species distributions.

AB  - A high potential of thermosolar power generation systems is the use of thermal storage and/or hybridization to overcome dependability of solar resource availability. The incorporation of these technologies can be of special interest for isolated units intended for distributed generation systems. Among the thermosolar systems, dishStirling technology is the one with more possibilities to be used as a system to feed power independently, i. e., due to the modularity of the units that range between 3 and 25 kWe, depending on the supplier. Thus, the present analysis is focused on studying integration of both hybridization and thermal storage in an isolated unit of 10 kWe dish-Stirling. In particular, hybridization will enable a more continuous operation of the system. Hybridization is analyzed both for a conventional fuel, such as natural gas, and for a renewable energy source, biogas. Analysis of performance of the dish-Stirling system enables to determine the interest of introducing the complementary technologies referred above. Regarding the specific case evaluated in this paper, analyzed data show that hybridization has an advantage that depends on the nature of fuel used, being of 20 % for natural gas and 112 % for biogas in relation to output power of solar-only operation. Thermal energy storage system shows no significant benefits when implemented to a variable power system.

AB  - Environmental change can expose populations to unfamiliar stressors, and maladaptive responses to those stressors may result in population declines or extirpation. Although gene flow is classically viewed as a cause of maladaptation, small and isolated populations experiencing high levels of drift and little gene flow may be constrained in their evolutionary response to environmental change. We provide a case study using the model Trinidadian guppy system that illustrates the importance of considering gene flow and genetic drift when predicting (mal)adaptive response to acute stress. We compared population genomic patterns and acute stress responses of inbred guppy populations from headwater streams either with or without a recent history of gene flow from a more diverse mainstem population. Compared to "no-gene flow" analogues, we found that populations with recent gene flow showed higher genomic variation and increased stress tolerance-but only when exposed to a stress familiar to the mainstem population (heat shock). All headwater populations showed similar responses to a familiar stress in headwater environments (starvation) regardless of gene flow history, whereas exposure to an entirely unfamiliar stress (copper sulfate) showed population-level variation unrelated to environment or recent evolutionary history. Our results suggest that (mal)adaptive responses to acutely stressful environments are determined in part by recent evolutionary history and in part by previous exposure. In some cases, gene flow may provide the variation needed to persist, and eventually adapt, in the face of novel stress.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), the small and random departures from perfect symmetry of an organism's bilateral traits, has been used as a measurement of developmental stability and an indicator of stress in endangered populations. We were interested in testing if the level of developmental stability is the same in different populations experiencing the same conditions, as the use of FA as an indicator of ecological stress is only meaningful if this is true. In order to do this, the effect of thermal stress on wing size FA over a range of temperatures was determined on three different lines of Drosophila melanogaster: two lines were maintained at one of two different constant temperatures (18 degrees C or 28 degrees C) and one under a fluctuating thermal regime (18 degrees C and 28 degrees C) for eight years. The differences in viability of these lines, when reared at a range of different temperatures, are associated with the temperature conditions they previously experienced. All lines showed a similar increase in FA at the two ends of the thermal range but with significantly different mean values. The two units of wing development (compartments) differed in their FA response depending on the selective history of each line. We discuss the implication of our results for the use of FA as an indicator of ecological stress.

AB  - Laser-induced fluorescence is recently used as an efficient technique in cancer diagnosis and non-invasive treatment. Here, the synergic therapeutical efficacies of the Capecitabine (CAP) chemodrug, photosensitive Phycocyanin (PC) and graphene oxide (GO) under laser irradiation were investigated. The therapeutical efficacies of diverse concentrations of CAP (0.001-10 mg/ml) and PC (0.5-10 mg/ml) alone and with laser irradiation on human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells were examined. The interactional effects of 100 mW SHG Nd:YAG laser at 532nm and GaAs laser at 808 nm ranging power of 150 mW- 2.2W were considered. The contribution of graphene oxide (GO) in biocompatible concentrations of 2.5-20 ng/ml and thermal characteristics of laser exposure at 808 nm on GO + fluorophores have been studied. The effects of the bare and laser-excited CAP + PC on cell mortality have been obtained. Despite the laser irradiation could not hold up the cell proliferation in the absence of drug interaction considerably; however, the viability of the treated cells (by a combination of fluorophores) under laser exposure at 808 nm was significantly reduced. The laser at 532 nm excited the fluorescent PC in (CAP + PC) to trigger the photodynamic processes via oxygen generation. Through the in-vitro experiments of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy of PC + CAP, the PC/CAP concentrations of the maximum fluorescence signal and spectral shifts have been characterized. The synergic effects of the laser exposures and (CAP + PC) treatment at different concentrations were confirmed. It has been shown here that the laser activation of (CAP + PC) can induce the mortality of the malignant cells by reducing the chemotherapeutic dose of CAP to avoid its non-desirable side effects and by approaching the minimally invasive treatment. Elevation of the laser intensity/exposure time could contribute to the therapeutic efficacy. Survival of the treated cells with a combination of GO and fluorophores could be reduced under laser exposure at 808 nm compared to the same combination therapy in the absence of GO. This survey could benefit the forthcoming clinical protocols based on laser spectroscopy for in-situ imaging/diagnosis/treatment of adenocarcinoma utilizing PC + CAP + GO.

AB  - The most successful study systems are built on a foundation of decades of research on the basic biology, ecology and life history of the organisms in question. Combined with new technologies, this can provide a formidable means to address important issues in evolutionary biology and molecular ecology. Littorinid marine snails are a good example of this, with a rich literature on their taxonomy, speciation, thermal tolerance and behavioural adaptations. In August 2017, an international meeting on Littorinid evolution was held at the Tjarno Marine Research Laboratory in Western Sweden. In this meeting review, I provide a summary of some of the exciting work on parallel evolution, sexual selection and adaptation to environmental stress presented there. I argue that newly available genomic resources present an opportunity for integrating the traditionally divergent fields of speciation and environmental adaptation in Littorinid research.

AB  - Anagrus nilaparvatae is the dominant egg parasitoid of rice planthoppers and plays an important role in biological control. Symbiotic bacteria can significantly influence the development, survival, reproduction and population differentiation of their hosts. To study the influence of temperature on symbiotic bacterial composition in the successive generations of A. nilaparvatae, A. nilaparvatae were raised under different constant temperatures of 22 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 31 degrees C and 34 degrees C. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to investigate the diversity of symbiotic bacteria. Our results revealed that the endophytic bacteria of A. nilaparvatae were Pantoea sp., Pseudomonas sp. and some uncultured bacteria. The bacterial community composition in A. nilaparvatae significantly varied among different temperatures and generations, which might be partially caused by temperature, feeding behavior and the physical changes of hosts. However, the analysis of wsp gene showed that the Wolbachia in A. nilaparvatae belonged to group A, sub-group Mors and sub-group Dro. Sub-group Mors was absolutely dominant, and this Wolbachia composition remained stable in different temperatures and generations, except for the 3rd generation under 34 degrees C during which sub-group Dro became the dominant Wolbachia. The above results suggest that the continuous high temperature of 34 degrees C can influence the Wolbachia community composition in A. nilaparvatae.

AB  - Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a new biomaterial which has wide application potential in various industries. BC industrialization requires bacterial strains with high BC productivity. The objective of this study is to increase the BC yield of a Gluconoacetobacter xylinus strain through mutagenesis induced by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment. In this study, the parental strain in its exponential phase was treated at 250 MPa and 25 degrees C for 15 min to induce mutagenesis using a HHP machine. The HHP-treated strains were incubated in glucose agar plate at 30 degrees C for 4 days. After the incubation, 50 larger colonies in these plates were randomly selected and cultivated to produce BC membrane in a tailor-made glass vessel, and wet weights of the BC membranes were tested. Compared with the parental strain, 29 mutants showed higher BC yields, of which eight mutants with BC yield >130.00 g/L were initially screened and were then cultivated for five generations to test their genetic stabilities for BC production. Among the eight mutants, M-438, a mutant which showed the highest average BC yield (158.56 g/L) and lowest coefficient of variation (2.4%) for five generations, was finally screened as objective mutant. HHP treatment can serve as an effective method to cause mutagenesis in BC-producing bacteria. The HHP-treated strains with significantly higher BC yield than parental strain can be screened from the HHP-induced mutants.

AB  - This paper presents load frequency control (LFC) of interconnected power systems involving multi-source power generation. The investigations are carried on a typical two area power system comprising hydro, thermal, and gas power generations with speed governors in each area. A discrete time proportional-integral-derivative (PID) load frequency control is applied only to thermal and gas power generating units and hydro is allowed to operate at its scheduled generation level with only speed governor control. The transient performance of the two area power system is investigated for different combinations of generations from thermal and gas sources with different scheduled operating load conditions when subjected to step load disturbance of 1% in area-1. The PID controller gains are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) for a sampling period of two seconds. The combination of integral squared error (ISE) and integral time an absolute error (ITAE) performance index is used for fitness evaluation.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity may be an important initial mechanism to counter environmental change, yet we know relatively little about the evolution of plasticity in nature. Species with widespread distributions are expected to have evolved higher levels of plasticity compared with those with more restricted, tropical distributions. At the intraspecific level, temperate populations are expected to have evolved higher levels of plasticity than their tropical counterparts. However, empirical support for these expectations is limited. In addition, no studies have comprehensively examined the evolution of thermal plasticity across life stages. Using populations of Drosophila simulans collected from a latitudinal cline spanning the entire east coast of Australia, we assessed thermal plasticity, measured as hardening capacity (the difference between basal and hardened thermal tolerance) for multiple measures of heat and cold tolerance across both adult and larval stages of development. This allowed us to explicitly ask whether the evolution of thermal plasticity is favoured in more variable, temperate environments. We found no relationship between thermal plasticity and latitude, providing little support for the hypothesis that temperate populations have evolved higher levels of thermal plasticity than their tropical counterparts. With the exception of adult heat survival, we also found no association between plasticity and ten climatic variables, indicating that the evolution of thermal plasticity is not easily predicted by the type of environment that a particular population occupies. We discuss these results in the context of the role of plasticity in a warming climate.

AB  - The timing of birth is often correlated with offspring fitness in animals, but experimental studies that disentangle direct effects of parturition date and indirect effects mediated via variation in female traits are rare. In viviparous ectotherms, parturition date is largely driven by female thermal conditions, particularly maternal basking strategies. Our field and laboratory studies of a viviparous lizard (Niveoscincus ocellatus) show that earlier-born offspring are more likely to survive through their first winter and are larger following that winter, than are later-born conspecifics. Thus, the association between parturition date and offspring fitness is causal, rather than reflecting an underlying correlation between parturition date and maternal attributes. Survival selection on offspring confers a significant advantage for increased maternal basking in this species, mediated through fitness advantages of earlier parturition. We discuss the roles of environmentally imposed constraints and parent-offspring conflict in the evolution of maternal effects on parturition date.

AB  - Biomass is a renewable, economic and readily available resource of energy that has potential to substitute fossil fuels in many applications such as heat, electricity and biofuels. The increased use of the agricultural biomass can help the agricultural based societies in achieving energy security and creating employment without causing envitonmental degradation. But, the viability and feasibility of electricity generation from agricultural biomass depends upon the availability of biomass supply at a competitive cost. The present study investigates the availability of agricultural biomass for distributed power generation in Punjab. The total production of the crop residues has been estimated by residue-to-product ratio (RPR) method. Further, the restrictions introduced by competitive uses as well as harvesting practices are taken into considerations to evaluate the available biomass potential. The biomass power potential has been obtained on considerations of energy contents of the particular crop residues and selecting appropriate conversion route. A total of 55.396 Mt of the agricultural residues are produced from various major crops. Out of these, 22315 Mt (40.17%) of the agricultural biomass has been found to be surplus with an average density of 443 t/km(2). These surplus residues can significantly be used to provide continuous, reliable and sustainable fuel supply for power plants. Cereals (rice, wheat, maize and barley) have major contribution (74.67%) in the surplus biomass, followed by cotton (25.01%) and sugarcane (0.2%). The estimated annual bio-energy potential of unused crop residues is 0.35 EJ (8.43% of India's potential), which is equivalent to 1.43% India's annual primary energy consumption. It has been revealed that a power potential of 2000-3000 MW can be exploited from these resources depending upon thermal efficiency. The study concludes with a discussion on significance and challenges of decentralized electricity generation for rural energy supply, including brief description about economical, social, environmental and technical aspects of bioelectricity.

AB  - Biomass energy has yet to be fully developed due to the major barriers. These include a lack of knowledge concerning biomass resources and economic obstacles associated with transportation and storage. This study examines the viability of harnessing solid waste and food waste for power generation on the STES Campus in Lonavala, Maharashtra, India. The performance of biomass gasification technology is evaluated to understand its ability to reduce CO2 emissions associated with electricity generation. This study clarifies the various methods of harnessing energy from biomass resources. With the available resources on the Campus, it is estimated that 40kWH of energy can be produced per day. The technology is a promising way to reduced local CO2 emissions which degrade air quality and contribute to global warming.

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is widely considered as the most serious insect defoliator of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L.). The CPB can completely destroy potato crops and cause tremendous yield losses if left uncontrolled. For decades, CPB populations have been suppressed mainly by chemical insecticides. However, this insect's diverse and flexible life history, combined with its remarkable adaptability to a variety of stressors, makes the CPB a very challenging pest to control. Potato foliage, which contains high amounts of volatile and non-volatile chemicals, is the CPB's main food source. Researchers indicated that variations in the feeding performance and abundance of this beetle are attributable to the quality and quantity of chemical components in the host plant foliage. This review investigated the effects of volatile chemicals, carbohydrates, amino acids, glycoallcaloids, and mineral elements in potato foliage on the feeding behaviour and performance of the CPB. In general, the chemical components in potato foliage could enhance or reduce the feeding of the CPB. Altering the chemical composition of potato foliage could be an interesting alternative to reduce the use of insecticides to manage CPB populations in potato crops.

AB  - Braking systems are one of the most important vehicle components. The kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted to heat energy by friction between the brake lining and the rotating brake disc. Brake discs work under very difficult thermo-mechanical conditions due to high temperature and wear. As most commercial discs have high rate and low braking performance, there is a need for development and manufacturing of new discs-brake linings to reduce wear and to increase braking performance.
   In this study, a sample cast iron discs with ventilation channels, coated with NiCrBSi powder by the thermal spraying and melting method were investigated. The braking performance of disc and the sample coated discs was tested according to SAE J2430 test standards. It was found out that the NiCrBSi coated disc exhibited a lower wear rate and a higher friction coefficient than the original disc. As a result, the NiCrBSi coated disc could be better alternative for new generation brake discs in vehicles than the original one.

AB  - In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Tepolt et al. (2021) illustrate how the genetic architecture of adaptation and life history influence invasive success. A marvel of many invasive species is that they are incredibly successful despite evolutionary expectations that they will have low adaptive potential and suffer inbreeding depression due to initially small founding population sizes. Determining the combinations of ecoevolutionary factors that permit this apparent "genetic paradox of invasions" is an ongoing endeavour of invasive species research. Tepolt et al. (2021) study the European green crab in its invasive range on the North American west coast. Following a single introduction into California, this crab quickly spread across a wide latitude gradient, despite low diversity in the original founding population. Adaptation of this crab to clinal variation in temperature appeared largely driven by an inferred chromosomal inversion. This inversion exists as a balanced polymorphism in the European home range of green crabs and is associated with thermal tolerance. Tepolt et al. (2021) therefore demonstrate that adaptive evolution post introduction need not be impeded by bottlenecks if variation at key parts of the genome is available and can be maintained in introduced populations. Moreover, Tepolt et al. (2021) show how chromosomal inversions acting as large-effect loci might facilitate rapid responses to selection in introduced populations.

AB  - In the United States, buildings' heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 40% of the global energy consumption, and contribute between 40% and 48% of the CO2 emissions. One of the largest causes for this type of energy consumption is heat loss. Energy loss can be attributed to inefficiency and sub-surface defects in the structure that reduce the thermal resistance and facilitate unwanted heat transmission within the environment. In recent years, infrared (IR) thermography has proven to be an excellent tool for detecting heat loss from a building envelope. At the same time, advancements in computer vision systems have enabled the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) as a photogrammetry technique. SfM is used for the generation of three-dimensional (3D) building information modeling (BIM). It has the potential to facilitate remote visual inspection of large-scale structures and infrastructure systems by creating virtual renderings. The results of an experiment performed on a lab-scale building using both IR and SfM techniques is analyzed. In particular, the accuracy of SfM in generating a 3D virtual rendering of a target object by using images acquired from a low-cost IR camera is discussed. IR images of a building are recorded and are used for reconstructing a digital model of the structure. The goal is to characterize the viability of SfM in detecting sub-surface defects that can yield to significant heat loss and reduce thermal efficiency in the facade of the building.

AB  - Water temperature influences the behavior and distribution patterns of both larval and adult American lobster Homarus americanus. However, very little is known about the responses of juvenile lobsters. The juvenile life stage is a critical period; high levels of mortality, combined with specific behavioral responses, can disconnect larval settlement from patterns of abundance of adults. We assessed behavioral thermoregulation in juvenile lobsters, and determined how thermal preferences can be altered by the presence of shelter and food. Juvenile lobsters avoided temperatures higher than 20 degrees C and lower than 8 degrees C, and had a mean temperature preference of 16.2 +/- 1 degrees C. This preference was unaffected by prior acclimation, origin (laboratory- raised or wild), or size. When the animals were subjected to a temperature change (5-20 degrees C), activity rates peaked at 15 degrees C, and remained stable thereafter. Activity rates did not change when a shelter was added. The addition of food resulted in an increase in activity associated with food handling. When juvenile lobsters were offered a choice between temperature, shelter, and food, they always chose the environment with a shelter, even when it was in a thermally unfavorable temperature. Juveniles also spent more time in a thermally unfavorable environment when food was present; however, acquisition of a shelter was prioritized over food. Although juveniles had a similar thermal preference to adults, they are more vulnerable to predation; the innate shelter-seeking behavior of juveniles overrode their thermal preference. While temperature is an important environmental factor affecting the physiology, distribution, and growth of aquatic ectotherms, our findings suggest that trade-off behaviors occur in order to maintain optimal fitness and survival of the individual.

AB  - We are concerned with the climatic factors that affect the adaptive radiation of species into and within the temperate zone. As one progresses northward, there is a decrease in summer temperatures and a concomitant increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold. For the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, it has been shown previously that (1) range expansion and evolution has proceeded from south to north, and (2) either realistically hot summer temperatures or a simulated 7-mo winter reduce fitness by 60% or more in two New Jersey (40 degrees N) populations. Herein, we compare the relative fitness of nine populations of W. smithii from 30 degrees to 50 degrees N when exposed to these same stressful summer temperatures and simulated winter. We determined the survivorship, fecundity, and fertility of five cohorts from each population at each temperature in both environments, and we calculated the cohort replacement rate (R(0)) as the product of these three component traits. Survivorship declined with increasing latitude in the summer, but not the winter, environment. Fecundity was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Fertility declined with increasing latitude in both environments. R(0) was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Hence, the interpretation of the adaptive responses to climate can depend critically on the trait being examined. Because R(0) is a composite index of fitness that includes any trade-offs among its constituent traits, we place greater reliance on its noncorrelation with latitude. Therefore, we conclude that, despite their clear impact on fitness, summer heat and winter cold have had little impact on the adaptive evolution of W. smithii to the climatic gradient of North America. The decline in summer heat and increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold as one moves north also impose a latitudinal gradient in the length of the favorable growing season. Many plants and animals use daylength to cue the seasonal events in their life cycles. We then argue that the timing of seasonal development mediated by photoperiodic response constitutes the most immediate adaptation of populations to novel temperate climates, and that adaptation of thermal responsiveness to summer heat or winter cold takes place over a longer time scale or taxonomic distance.

AB  - The concept of heat-driven self-cooling of devices is an important energy saving measure by which devices would be able to provide power to run cooling flow without external power supply. Thermoelectric generation device is proposed to convert the heat energy into electrical energy to drive a hydraulic pump of microchannel heat sink based single phase cooling system. The system could be made self-sustaining in terms of power requirement. In this paper, numerical modeling and validation have been conducted based on an experimental study of net power generation in liquid flow based microchannel heat sink. The relationship between coolant flow rate and heat flux at heat source device has been modeled to study the viability of self-cooling concept. It has been found out that at an optimum flow rate of cooling fluid, it is possible to keep the temperature of a heat source device at a required temperature while providing power to run the coolant through the microchannel heat sink.

AB  - Temperature and humidity are among the most important environmental factors affecting insect adaptive strategies and evolution. Here, we report multiple adaptive differences between Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines derived from the opposite slopes of Lower Nahal Oren canyon at Mount Carmel, Israel. The slopes are separated by 100 m at the bottom and 400 m at the top, and contrast sharply in physical and biotic factors. The multivariate fitness complex analysed in D. melanogaster included oviposition temperature preferences, viability and longevity changes, caused by short-term and lifetime temperature treatments, and resistance to drought stress at different temperatures. Some of these measures were obtained for the sibling species, D. simulans, and gave results that paralleled those of D. melanogaster. We conclude that strong microclimatic natural selection overrides migration in Drosophila at this microsite.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to determine the adaptability and sludge reduction potential of the tubificid worm Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri for different conditions of aeration, temperature and worm density, as well as to determine and characterize the development and population dynamics of the worms during sequential sludge predations. A number of short-and long-term experiments were conducted using waste sludge as the support material. The results demonstrated that improper aeration, temperature and worm density can remarkably affect worm growth and sludge reduction. Adult worms were more susceptible to variable environmental conditions. Continuous individual growth and development of the worms were observed under optimal process conditions: intermittent aeration with light intensity, a water temperature of 25 degrees C and an initial worm density in the range of 11-12 g/L. As calculated in a stage-structured population model, the asymptotic population growth rate of the worms was approximately 1 during a period of 117 days, which indicates a stable population size in the sludge predation system. The worm population exhibited a total sludge reduction rate of 297.0 +/- 10.1 mg-TSS/L/d. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study has elucidated the environmental factors associated with spawning and the ecology of early life cycle stages of the sparid Acanthopagrus butcheri, which is atypically long-lived and large for a species confined to its natal estuary. The prevalence of A. butcheri eggs in monthly plankton samples from the Blackwood River Estuary, south-western Australia, in 2014/15, allied with long-term gonadal data, imply that spawning in this estuary commences in mid-spring (October) as water temperatures increase to -17 degrees C and peak at -22 degrees C in early summer (December). Eggs were initially found only in deeper, downstream areas, where a salt wedge had started to penetrate following precipitous seasonal decline in freshwater discharge. Spawning occurred progressively further upstream during November/December as the salt wedge continued its intrusion of the upper estuary. The concentrations of eggs and yolk-sac and preflexion larvae, which were related positively to salinity and temperature and less so to oxygen concentration, were located predominantly below the halocline, implying that successful spawning typically requires salinities >= 15. Concentrations of eggs and yolk-sac and preflexion larvae peaked in December and of flexion larvae in January. As the concentrations of copepod nauplii exceeded by orders of magnitude those of larval A. butcheri, with which they co-occur and constitute their main prey, it is unlikely that restricted food resources accounted for the poor recruitment of the 2014/15 year class. In this context, the presence of many yolk-sac larvae and preflexion larvae in the low oxygen concentrations, which have become increasingly prevalent in microtidal estuaries of south-western Australia due to climate change, is likely to have led to considerable mortality. In most populations throughout its range in southern Australia, A. butcheri spawns in a restricted period between the austral mid-spring and mid-summer, with the synchrony achieved through differences in the temperatures that cue spawning at different latitudes, i.e. higher temperature cues at lower and thus warmer latitudes. Spawning occurs earlier, however, in atypical estuaries in which salinities and temperatures are high in late winter/spring. Despite experiencing episodic recruitment, A. butcheri sustains substantial populations through maturing early relative to its maximum age, and therefore producing numerous offspring in those few years when spawning conditions are optimal. Episodic recruitment could thus be related to subtle inter-annual differences in environmental conditions during the short spawning periods, with oxygen levels greater than usual a potential key factor. The adaptability of A. butcheri makes this sparid useful in assessing the degree, direction and scale of climate change effects.

AB  - Current study was designed to investigate the current susceptibility levels of field collected strains of T. granarium (Everts) from Punjab, Pakistan. T. granarium populations were collected from different areas of Punjab i.e., Lahore, Sheikhupura, Gujranwala, Bahawalpur, Bhakkar and Faisalabad, were evaluated for their relative resistance or susceptibility in comparison to laboratory reared strain against pyrethroids. Filter paper impregnation method was used to assess the contact toxicity of pyrethroids (technical grade deltamethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, cypermethrin and bifenthrin) against 4(th) instar larval stage of T. granarium. Mortality responses were evaluated under constant temperature and relative humidity (r.h.) at 32 +/- 2 degrees C and 65 +/- 5 r.h. respectively. Data was recorded after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment and completely randomized design (CRD) were used with four replications. Experiments were conducted in Grain Research Training and Storage management cell, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan during year 2018-19. Bioassays showed that field collected strains were resistant to all test insecticides. Very low to moderate level of resistance was found in field strains. Bahawalpur strain showed highest resistance ratios of up-to 12.7, 18.9, 4.63 and 8.27 for deltamethrin, bifenthrin, alpha-cypermethrin and cypermethrin respectively, after 72 h of exposure to treatment. Bhakkar strain also showed moderate resistance following Bahawalpur strain. Lahore and Faisalabad collected strains were susceptible as compared to other field strains. In-vitro selection for deltamethrin revealed increase in resistance up-to 18.7 folds after selection for 7 generations by maintaining selection pressure at 80% mortality. Reversion in resistance occurred when strain was again reared for next 5 generations without insecticide exposure and resistance values decreased to 7.74 folds at G(12). DR value for change in resistance was -0.07. The effectiveness of commonly used pyrethroids for the management of T. granarium was significantly reduced in the field populations exhibiting low to moderate resistance. Long-term use of insecticides with similar mode of action could be the reason for the development of resistance. Multi-tactical approach with integrated pest management (IPM) framework may prolong the effectiveness of pyrethroids in the T. granarium management.

AB  - Organisms become adapted to their environment by evolving through natural selection, a process that generally transpires over many generations. Currently, anthropogenically driven environmental changes are occurring orders of magnitude faster than they did prior to human influence, which could potentially outpace the ability of some organisms to adapt. Here, we focus on traits associated with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a classic polyphenism, in a model turtle species to address the evolutionary potential of species with TSD to respond to rapid climate change. We show, first, that sex-ratio outcomes in species with TSD are sensitive to climatic variation. We then identify the evolutionary potential, in terms of heritability, of TSD and quantify the evolutionary potential of 3 key traits involved in TSD: pivotal temperature, maternal nest-site choice, and nesting phenology. We find that these traits display different patterns of adaptive potential: pivotal temperature exhibits moderate heritable variation, whereas nest-site choice and nesting phenology, with considerable phenotypic plasticity, have only modest evolutionary potential to alter sex ratios. Therefore, the most likely response of species with TSD to anthropogenically induced climate change may be a combination of microevolution in thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway and of plasticity in maternal nesting behavior.

AB  - Dispersal of benthic species in the sea is mediated primarily through small, vulnerable larvae that must survive minutes to months as members of the plankton community while being transported by strong, dynamic currents. As climate change alters ocean conditions, the dispersal of these larvae will be affected, with pervasive ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review the impacts of oceanic changes on larval transport, physiology, and behavior. We then discuss the implications for population connectivity and recruitment and evaluate life history strategies that will affect susceptibility to the effects of climate change on their dispersal patterns, with implications for understanding selective regimes in a future ocean. We find that physical oceanographic changes will impact dispersal by transporting larvae in different directions or inhibiting their movements while changing environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and turbidity, will affect the survival of larvae and alter their behavior. Reduced dispersal distance may make local adaptation more likely in well-connected populations with high genetic variation while reduced dispersal success will lower recruitment with implications for fishery stocks. Increased dispersal may spur adaptation by increasing genetic diversity among previously disconnected populations as well as increasing the likelihood of range expansions. We hypothesize that species with planktotrophic (feeding), calcifying, or weakly swimming larvae with specialized adult habitats will be most affected by climate change. We also propose that the adaptive value of retentive larval behaviors may decrease where transport trajectories follow changing climate envelopes and increase where transport trajectories drive larvae toward increasingly unsuitable conditions. Our holistic framework, combined with knowledge of regional ocean conditions and larval traits, can be used to produce powerful predictions of expected impacts on larval dispersal as well as the consequences for connectivity, range expansion, or recruitment. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies take a holistic view of dispersal incorporating biological and oceanographic impacts of climate change rather than solely focusing on oceanography or physiology. Genetic and paleontological techniques can be used to examine evolutionary impacts of altered dispersal in a future ocean, while museum collections and expedition records can inform modern-day range shifts.

AB  - Distinctive survival strategies, specialized in regulation and in quality control, were observed in thermal adaptive evolution with a laboratory Escherichia coli strain. The two specialists carried a single mutation either within rpoH or upstream of groESL, which led to the activated global regulation by sigma factor 32 or an increased amount of GroEL/ES chaperonins, respectively. Although both specialists succeeded in thermal adaptation, the common winner of the evolution was the specialist in quality control, that is, the strategy of chaperonin-mediated protein folding. To understand this evolutionary consequence, multilevel analyses of cellular status, for example, transcriptome, protein and growth fitness, were carried out. The specialist in quality control showed less change in transcriptional reorganization responding to temperature increase, which was consistent with the finding of that the two specialists showed the biased expression of molecular chaperones. Such repressed changes in gene expression seemed to be advantageous for long-term sustainability because a specific increase in chaperonins not only facilitated the folding of essential gene products but also saved cost in gene expression compared with the overall transcriptional increase induced by rpoH regulation. Functional specialization offered two strategies for successful thermal adaptation, whereas the evolutionary advantageous was more at the points of cost-saving in gene expression and the essentiality in protein folding.

AB  - Climate change is altering geographical ranges, population dynamics and phenologies of many organisms. For ectotherms, increased ambient temperatures frequently have direct consequences for metabolic rates, activity patterns and developmental rates. Consequently, in many insect species both an earlier beginning and prolongation of seasonal duration occurred in parallel with recent global warming. However, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, the number of generations (voltinism) and investment into each generation may be even more important than seasonality, since an additional generation per unit time may accelerate population growth or adaptation. Using a dataset extending back to the mid-nineteenth century, I report changes in the voltinism of butterfly and moth species of Central Europe. A significant proportion of 263 multi-voltine species showed augmented frequency of second and subsequent generations relative to the first generation in a warm period since 1980, and 44 species even increased the number of generations after 1980. Expected ecological consequences are diverse. Since multi-voltinism has been linked to insect outbreaks they include an increase in the abundance of herbivorous pests of agriculture and forestry. However, disruption of the developmental synchrony associated with multi-voltinism and host plant phenology may also reduce fitness, potentially having unexpected consequences for species of conservation concern. The ability of species to adapt evolutionarily to a changing environment may be facilitated by increased voltinism.

AB  - Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidemann (Heteroptera, Coreidae) is a harmful insect to cones and seeds of several conifers in North America, and was accidentally introduced into Europe where it rapidly spread to many countries. In Central Italy, the pest damaged cones and seeds of Pinus pinea L., leading to a severe reduction of pine nut production. Gryon pennsylvanicum (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera, Platygastridae) is the most common egg-parasitoid of L. occidentalis in British Columbia. This natural enemy has been successfully reared under laboratory conditions. However, the possibility to arrange a sufficient large number of specimens is crucial for the success in biological control. In the present work, stored L. occidentalis eggs at fridge and freezing temperatures of +4, -20 A degrees C, and ultra-low temperatures of -80 and -140 A degrees C for different times up to one year, were tested for parasitization success. Results showed that G. pensylvanicum can exploit successfully host eggs stored for long time when stored at ultra-low temperatures and that storage did not affect fitness of the first and second generation. For shorter periods of time, the use of +4 A degrees C for store eggs did not vary significantly from eggs stored at ultra-low temperatures.

AB  - BACKGROUND Insecticide resistance arises at a given location in response to selection acting on novel genotypes or standing variation, or allelic migration. Fitness costs of resistance may slow resistance evolution or result in reversion to susceptibility, but consistent and geographically widespread use of insecticides may provide sufficient selection to offset the fitness costs of resistance. Understanding this relationship is important to the success of insecticide resistance management. We report the existence of fitness costs of neonicotinoid resistance in field-collected populations of the tobacco thrips (Frankliniella fusca), which increasingly challenge upland cotton production in the southeastern USA. RESULTS Populations (14 of 15 in 2015; 4 of 5 in 2016) investigated showed a loss of resistance to imidacloprid after multiple generations without exposure to the insecticide. Populations studied in 2016 were each split into two colonies, and one of each pair was repeatedly exposed to imidacloprid. In three of the four populations that lost resistance, imidacloprid-exposed colonies lost resistance significantly more slowly than did corresponding unexposed colonies. CONCLUSION For imidacloprid resistance to be broadly increasing in the landscapes of the southeastern USA despite fitness costs of resistance, selection for resistance must be sufficient to overcome the costs. Findings encourage investigation into why costs are overcome in this system, potentially including geographic extent of neonicotinoid use or prevalence of low-dose exposure.

AB  - This review describes the history and use of heat in the management of a wide range of agricultural and structural pests. Definitions and concepts used in heat treatments are discussed as well as possible mechanisms of thermal lethality. Factors used in determining treatments are availability, costs, complexity, and other constraints. Heat can be used separately in multiple forms or in combination: fire, water-based and atmospheric, steam, vapor heat, dry heat, forced hot air, high temperature controlled atmospheres, electric fields, and electromagnetic energies. The early research into each of these strategies is presented, including design, temperature ranges, and target pests. An understanding of the development of thermal treatments will increase efficacy of pest control and adaptability, and will reduce duplication.

AB  - Sun based energy is the chief source of heat from the sun, and it utilizes in photovoltaic cells, sun-based power plates, photovoltaic lights and sun-based hybrid nanofluids. Specialists are currently exploring the utilization of nanotechnology and sun-based radiation to further develop flight effectiveness. In this analysis, a hybrid nanofluid is moving over an expandable sheet. Analysts are presently exploring the utilization of nanotechnology and sunlight-based radiation to further develop avionics productivity. To explore the heat transfer rate phenomenon, a hybrid nanofluid stream is moving towards a trough having a parabolic type shape and is located inside of solar airplane wings. The expression used to depict the heat transfer phenomenon was sun based thermal radiation. Heat transfer proficiency of airplane wings is evaluated with the inclusion of distinguished effects like viscous dissipation, slanted magnetic field and solar-based thermal radiations. The Williamson hybrid nanofluid past an expandable sheet was read up for entropy generation. The energy and momentum expressions were solved numerically with the utilization of the Keller box approach. The nano solid particles, which are comprised of copper (Cu) and Graphene oxide, are dispersed utilizing SA (Sodium alginate) as an ordinary liquid (GO). A huge number of control factors, for example, temperature, shear stress, velocity, frictional element along with Nusselt number are investigated in detail. Intensification of thermal conduction, viscous dissipation and radiation improve the performance of airplane wings subjected to heat transmission. Hybrid nanofluid performance is much better than the ordinary nanofluid when it comes to heat transmission analysis.

AB  - Weight reduction is increasingly being considered very important in light of air pollution and the exhaustion of resources. As a result, many automotive components are being replaced by Al and Mg alloys, and studies are increasingly focusing on the same. However, the use of Mg alloys is limited because they have higher material cost and lower productivity owing to the difficult forming conditions compared with Al alloys. In this study, the tube extrusion process conditions of an automotive bumper back beam were analyzed using FEA. Material tests were performed to determine the properties, and experiments and analyses for a simple shape were performed to define the data for heat generation during plastic deformation. Then, the analyses of the product were carried out by considering various temperatures and ram speeds. The conditions were then established, and a product without surface defects was extruded successfully.

AB  - Obliquebanded leafroller (OBLR), Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is widely distributed in North America where it causes damage to several fruit and nut crops. Macrocentrus iridescens (French) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) parasitizes OBLR in California pistachio orchards, but to date there is little published information on its biology or effectiveness. To determine its potential as a biological control agent, development of M. iridescens was evaluated at eight constant temperatures, ranging from 12.6 to 36.8 degrees C. Results show development times, from egg to adult eclosion, ranged from 115.8 to 36.5 days at 13.9 and 31.0 degrees C, respectively, the lowest and highest temperatures tested that permitted complete development. Fitting the data to a nonlinear model provided estimates of M. iridescens lower (9.8 degrees C), upper (34.3 degrees C), and optimal (23.7 degrees C) development temperatures. M. iridescens requires 625 degree-days to develop from egg to adult stage. To complement laboratory studies, OBLR and M. iridescens season-long field population dynamics were monitored in pistachio orchards, including overwintering behaviors. M. iridescens overwinters in the OBLR larva and produces one generation for each generation of the host. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soiling, shading, and thermal losses were calculated for a 30-kWp PV plant using measured performance data combined with measured transmittance loss of glass coupons installed near the plant. Soiling and shading losses in the month of December were as high as 25.7% and 9.7%, respectively.
   Apart from being a clean source of energy, photovoltaic (PV) power plants are also a source of income generation for its investors and lenders. Therefore, mitigation of system losses is crucial for economic operation of PV plants. Combined losses due to soiling, shading and temperature in PV plants go as high as 50%. Much of these losses are unaccounted initially, which can jeopardize the economic viability of PV projects. This paper aims to provide a model to determine losses due to soiling, shading and temperature using quantities like irradiance, cell temperature, DC power and current, which are readily available in PV yield data captured by the remote monitoring system, without involving any additional sensors or equipment. In this study, soiling, shading and thermal losses were calculated using PV yield data obtained from a 30-kWp PV plant located in Kharagpur, India. The results showed soiling and shading losses as high as 25.7% and 9.7%, respectively, in the month of December. Soiling loss was verified by measuring transmittance loss of coupon glasses installed in the vicinity of the plant. Shading loss was verified by shadow simulation using an architectural tool (SketchUp). Array thermal loss obtained using the proposed methodology was found to be in line with the estimated value obtained from PVsyst simulation. Additionally, using time-series data, the energy losses corresponding to soiling, shading and temperature effects were calculated by a numerical-integration technique. The monetary loss due to these energy losses thus obtained provides criteria for deciding when to mitigate the sources of these losses.

AB  - Chemical looping air separation (CLAS) is a promising technology for oxygen generation with high efficiency. The key challenge for CLAS is to design robust oxygen sorbents with suitable redox properties and fast redox kinetics. In this work, perovskite-structured Sr1-xCaxFe1-yCoyO3 oxygen sorbents were investigated and demonstrated for oxygen production with tunable redox properties, high redox rate, and excellent thermal/steam stability. Cobalt doping at B site was found to be highly effective, 33% improvement in oxygen productivity was observed at 500 degrees C. Moreover, it stabilizes the perovskite structure and prevents phase segregation under pressure swing conditions in the presence of steam. Scalable synthesis of Sr0.8Ca0.2Fe0.4Co0.6O3 oxygen sorbents was carried out through solid state reaction, co-precipitation, and sol-gel methods. Both co-precipitation and sol-gel methods are capable of producing Sr0.8Ca0.2Fe0.4Co0.6O3 sorbents with satisfactory phase purity, high oxygen capacity, and fast redox kinetics. Large scale evaluation of Sr0.8Ca0.2 Fe0.4Co0.6O3, using an automated CLAS testbed with over 300 g sorbent loading, further demonstrated the effectiveness of the oxygen sorbent to produce 95% pure O-2 with a satisfactory productivity of 0.04 g(O2) g(sorbent)(-1) h(-1) at 600 degrees C.

AB  - India has incorporated renewable energy sources like solar and wind in its energy mix in order to achieve its ambitious plan to set up 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022 to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Among the solar technologies for power generation, solar photovoltaic (SPV) is considered and large SPV parks are deployed around the country. Some of the drawbacks of deploying large-scale SPV parks are discussed in the manuscript. Because of the intermittency of SPV and wind, there is a backup resource of fossil fuel fired thermal plants that are ramped up or down to meet the electricity demand in the grid, especially the peak demand. The manuscript proposes that India has to consider solar thermal technology that can be ramped up and down, namely, the molten-salt solar tower technology (STT). Based on the direct solar irradiance data there are about 6000 sq. km of land with 7.5 to 8.0 kWh/m(2)/day and about 12 000 sq. km with 7.0 to 7.5 kWh/m(2)/day where such STT plants can be set up. Cost analysis demonstrates that the capital cost of STT plant is roughly (sic) 389 million per MW. This is quite competitive compared to the nuclear and coal thermal technologies because these technologies have high operational costs.

AB  - This article presents hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) tuned automatic generation controller for two areas interconnected multisource power system model. The control areas consist of thermal, hydro, and doubly fed induction generator-based wind power plants. The optimal tuning of AGC controller using genetic algorithm is less robust due to larger standard deviation of the fitness values. Therefore, Taguchi method which is based on modified statistical approach and has systematic reasoning ability is used to enhance the performance of genetic algorithm. The simulation study is carried out with the optimum gains of AGC controller obtained from HTGA, conventional GA and conventional techniques. The dynamic stability of the power system model is examined to analyze the performance of the HTGA technique. From investigations it is quite clear that the optimum gains of AGC system obtained from HTGA technique has better response in the dynamic stability of the interconnected multisource power system as compared to genetic algorithm and conventional technique.

AB  - Genetic variability in reaction norms reflects differences in the ability of individuals, populations and ultimately species to respond to environmental change. By increasing our understanding of how genotype x environment interactions influence evolution, studies of genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity serve to refine our capacity to predict how populations will respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental variability, including climate change. Given the extraordinary variability in morphology, behaviour and life history in salmonids, one might anticipate the research milieu on reaction norms in these fishes to be empirically rich and intellectually engaging. Here, I undertake a review of genetic variability in continuous and discontinuous (threshold) norms of reaction in salmonid fishes, as determined primarily (but not exclusively) by common-garden experiments. Although in its infancy from a numerical publication perspective, there is taxonomically broad evidence of genetic differentiation in continuous, threshold and bivariate reaction norms among individuals, families and populations (including inter-population hybrids and backcrosses) for traits as divergent as embryonic development, age and size at maturity, and gene expression. There is compelling inferential evidence that plasticity is heritable and that population differences in reaction norms can reflect adaptive responses, by natural selection, to local environments. As a stimulus for future work, a series of 20 research questions are identified that focus on reaction-norm variability, selection, costs and constraints, demographic and conservation consequences, and genetic markers and correlates of phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - We investigated the effect of water constraints on yearling Lacerta vivipara, a widespread species of lizard inhabiting European peat bogs and heath land. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate plasticity of growth rate, activity level and preferred body temperature. We subjected individuals of two source habitats (dry vs humid) to two laboratory conditions of water supply resulting in different air relative humidity and water availability (high vs low). We observed that a low water supply induced a lower growth rate and lower activity level, suggesting that growth limitation is correlated with adaptive responses to avoid dehydration. However, individuals from the two habitats selected different body temperatures when restricted in water and showed different ratios between growth and activity. This suggests that there is population variability in phenotypic plasticity with respect to water availability in the habitat. Field observations conducted in six natural populations, classified into two groups (dry vs humid habitat) also suggest that growth rate in nature is constrained by water availability.

AB  - The sex ratios of the progenies of woodlice Porcellionides pruinosus (Crustacea, Isopoda) raised at different temperatures were studied. Females from three French populations sampled in the wild produced highly female-biased broods at 20 degrees C and male-biased broods above 30 degrees C. The effect of high temperature was not due to selective mortality of females. Sex determination was thus sensitive to temperature in P. pruinosus. We also found an interpopulation variability of sex ratio thermosensitivity and a weak inheritance of male-biased sex ratios at high temperatures. Samples taken from a wild population throughout the year showed that while the thermal conditions required for changes in the sex ratio occurred, there was no significant variation in the sex ratio. On the other hand, almost all the females and many males in the four populations studied harboured intracytoplasmic bacteria. These maternally inherited symbionts belong to the genus Wolbachia and are known to possess a feminizing effect. While in other arthropods Wolbachia are destroyed at high temperatures, the symbionts of P. pruinosus were detected by a PCR procedure whatever the rearing temperatures. In light of these results, we propose that the thermosensitivity of sex determination in P. pruinosus could reflect the removal of the cytoplasmic effect on sex determination rather than environmental sex determination sensu stricto. The reduction in the amount of bacteria (but not their entire elimination), or the inhibition of bacterial metabolism, may be responsible for sex ratio variations relating to temperature. The incomplete inheritance of male-biased sex ratios at high temperatures might reflect a selection of thermo-tolerant bacterial strains.

AB  - Theories of habitat selection assume that habitat selection patterns are based on the fitness consequences of selecting a particular habitat, and predict that individuals should be distributed between habitats so that each individual obtains the same fitness. The predictions are relatively simple when habitat suitability is based upon the quantity of depletable resources, such as food, in a habitat: individuals should be distributed between habitats in proportion to the depletable resources in those habitats. Yet, non-depletable resources can also be important in habitat selection. For example, ectotherms must obtain heat from the environment, which causes them to select habitats based, at least partly, upon thermal quality. Non-depletable resources can cause habitat selection that is independent of density and may modify the value of depletable resources. We used red flour beetles Tribolium castaneum to test the hypothesis that habitat selection by ectotherms depends upon both food abundance and temperature. We determined the thermal preference of red flour beetles. We then conducted habitat selection experiments with beetles when habitats were set at their preferred temperature and 10 degrees C below their preferred temperature. We simultaneously manipulated food abundance in both habitats, and varied population density. We also examined the fitness effects of habitat selection by measuring oviposition rates of beetles. Beetles selected the habitat within their preferred temperature when food was equal between habitats and when food was higher in that habitat across all population densities. Beetles showed equal preference for high- and low-temperature habitats when food was higher in the low-temperature habitat across all population densities. Fecundity was always higher at the preferred temperature of beetles, regardless of food abundance or population density. Temperature is clearly an important factor in habitat selection of ectotherms and should be considered whenever thermal differences exist between habitats.

AB  - The acclimation capacity of leading edge tree populations is crucially important in a warming climate. Theoretical considerations suggest that adaptation through genetic change is needed, but this may be a slow process. Both positive and catastrophic outcomes have been predicted, while empirical studies have lagged behind theory development. Here we present results of a 30-year study of 55,000 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees, planted in 15 common gardens in three consecutive years near and beyond the present Scots pine tree line. Our results show that, contrary to earlier predictions, even long-distance transfers to the North can be successful when soil fertility is high. This suggests that present northern populations have a very high acclimation capacity. We also found that while temperature largely controls Scots pine growth, soil nutrient availability plays an important role-in concert with interpopulation genetic variation-in Scots pine survival and fitness in tree line conditions. These results suggest that rapid range expansions and substantial growth enhancements of Scots pine are possible in fertile sites as seed production and soil nutrient mineralization are both known to increase under a warming climate. Finally, as the ontogenetic pattern of tree mortality was highly site specific and unpredictable, our results emphasize the need for long-term field trials when searching for the factors that control fitness of trees in the variable edaphic and climatic conditions of the far North.

AB  - Plastic behavioural adjustments represent a powerful mechanism for animals to respond to severe environmental changes. For instance, animals may use distinct resources, which could enhance their fitness, because of increased temperatures. Such shifts in resource use may be observed in egg laying female insects, modifying host plant preference under challenging conditions. Indeed, females are expected to increase their selectivity towards high-quality host plants when experiencing high compared with benign temperatures. In this study, we examined whether female Bicyclus anynana butterflies can enhance their reproductive performance by modifying host plant use in response to challenging temperature regimes. Towards this end, we investigated (1) whether exposure to variable thermal conditions affected reproductive output when females had access to only one host plant, and (2) whether this in turn affected the oviposition preference for host plants of different quality under laboratory conditions. We expected hot conditions to reduce the reproductive performance (egg number, offspring survival and performance) of butterflies. Such deleterious effects may, however, be counterbalanced by a higher selectivity for high-quality plants when females have simultaneous access to plants of different quality. We found that the reproductive performance of butterflies was indeed reduced when they experienced hot conditions. These temperature effects were only observed when butterflies only had access to a lowquality plant. However, individuals did not increase their selectivity towards the higher-quality host plant in response to hot conditions, possibly because of fecundity costs associated with increased choosiness. Our results illustrate the limits of plastic behavioural adjustments in response to changing environmental conditions under laboratory conditions. Further studies are, however, necessary to clarify whether this lack of plasticity is also observed in wild animals, which may limit their adaptability in the face of climate change. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - In this research article, a maiden approach of hybrid adaptive gbest' guided gravitational search and pattern search (hGGSA-PS) optimization method are proposed for load frequency control (LFC) of multi-area interconnected power system considering the nonlinear effect of generation rate constraint (GRC). At first, the two area single stage thermal-thermal power system with conventional proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is analyzed and the parameters of the PID controller are optimized by the proposed technique. Initially, the gbest' guided gravitational search algorithm (GGSA) using integral time absolute error (ITAE) fitness function is used and then pattern search (PS) technique is employed to fine-tune the obtained best solution from the GGSA. The supremacy of the hGGSA-PS optimized PID controller is presented by comparing its results with other modern soft computing techniques. Later in order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed controller, the sensitive analysis is performed. Finally, the proposed technique is extended to a two area multi-source power system. The parameters of the controller for each area are optimized using the novel hGGSA-PS technique. From the simulation results, it can be seen that the proposed technique has superior performance than the prior results with lesser settling time and different performance index values.

AB  - First instar nymphs and adults of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae that had been reared at 10-degrees-C and 20-degree-C over a number of generations, were cooled to - 5-degrees-C and - 10-degrees-C for 1 h and 6 h and returned to 20-degrees-C to assess the effects of brief exposures to low temperatures (cold-pulses) on their survival, rate of development, longevity and fecundity. A strong acclimation response was observed in first instar nymphs, with significantly less mortality in groups reared to 10-degrees-C compared to 20-degrees-C. Mean development time from first instar to adult was not significantly affected by low temperature exposure at the first nymphal stage. Longevity in all groups cooled as first instars was reduced by the sub-zero cold-pulses, and was also dependent on temperature and exposure time. Acclimated aphids survived longer than non-acclimated individuals. Reproductive rate, in terms of the number of nymphs born per aphid per day, was unaffected by cold stress applied at the first instar stage. Total fecundity was however reduced, being a function of the number and longevity of the survivors.
   Adult aphids were less cold hardy than nymphs; mortality was higher at - 10-degrees-C than - 5-degrees-C, increasing with duration of exposure from 1 h to 6 h. Mean fecundity was reduced significantly in aphids cooled at the adult stage, the number of aphids born per day decreasing as the exposure period of the cold-pulse increased, suggesting that low temperature had affected embryogenesis. All the nymphs born to adults surviving exposure to - 5-degrees-C for 6 h died within 48 h of birth, indicating that low temperature has a pre-natal effect on mortality.

AB  - trade-off between growth rate in areas with different temperatures and predation rates was modelled for juvenile cod living in the Barents Sea by a dynamic optimisation model. The choice of optimal temperature area of a juvenile (1-group) cod growing from a start weight (50 g, 15 cm) to a size refuge (640 g, 40 cm) was modelled for two scenarios with distributions of predators (4+ groups cod) similar to those observed in the Barents Sea in February 1990 and 1994, respectively, and without food limitations, The model predicted that when there was an overlap in distribution between large cod and younger cud (0-3 group), the younger year classes would move to areas with lower temperature and less predators. offering higher survival rates. Fish predators forced the prey to inhabit less optimal areas, and both growth and survival rates fell in comparison a with a scenario with fewer fish predators (cannibals) and less overlap. Increased fish predator density increased these effects. and the juveniles would stay in colder water for a longer period and their growth rate would be further reduced. Higher mortality, independent of area and size, made it more profitable to stay in warmer water. leading to higher growth but increased mortality rates.

AB  - Adults of the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi display a summer diapause in response to the exposure of their larvae to long photoperiods. In the present study, the inheritance of the photoperiodic response controlling summer diapause in C. bowringi by crossing a high diapause strain (D strain) with a laboratory selected nondiapause strain (N strain) was investigated under different photoperiods at 22, 25 and 28 degrees C. The beetles in both reciprocal crosses and backcrosses showed a clear short-day response for the induction of diapause at all temperatures, similar to that of the D strain, suggesting that photoperiodic response of this beetle is heritable. The diapause incidences in the progeny from all the crosses under LD 15:9 or LD 12:12 at 25 degrees C suggest that genetic and genetic-environmental interactions are involved in diapause induction. The incidence of diapauses in F-1 progeny was significantly lower than that in the D x D strain but significantly higher than that in the N x N strain, indicating that the diapause capability is inherited in an incomplete dominant manner. The incidence of diapause was greater among the offspring of hybrid females when those females had a D strain mother or grandmother rather than a N strain mother or grandmother, indicating that maternal effects on diapause induction are stronger than paternal effects. The laboratory selected nondiapause strain also showed a short-day photoperiodic response at a low temperature of 22 degrees C, indicating that the photoperiodic photoreceptor and photoperiodic clock still function in the nondiapause strain.

AB  - Organisms possess a wide range of physiological mechanisms to cope with climate change, yet most of what we know about these mechanisms comes from solitary organisms. Because there is a tight linkage between climate change and organismal physiologies, understanding the physiological mechanisms driving the responses of species to climate change has emerged as a research priority in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, responses become more complex when considering social organisms, as their responses to a changing climate can involve hundreds or even thousands of individuals that make up a single colony. Ants are especially good model systems for how social organisms may physiologically cope with global changes in climate, as they are geographically widespread and occur across diverse climatic regimes. Surprisingly, ants have received remarkably little attention in context of physiological responses to climate change given their ubiquity and key roles in many ecosystems. In particular, we have yet to bridge the gap between individual and colony-level responses to climate change in social organisms. In this review, we use ants as a focal taxon to examine the general patterns and mechanisms associated with thermal physiology and performance in individuals; how colony-level performance might differ in social organisms; and where the fields of physiological ecology and myrmecology can converge to better understand how ants will respond to anthropogenic changes in climate.

AB  - The amount of pine needles (pinus roxburgii) potentially available for use as energy feedstock in the Central Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in India has been estimated. It involves estimating the gross annual amount of pine needle yield followed by a comprehensive identification and quantification of the factors that affect the net annual pine needle yield available as energy feedstock. These factors include considerations such as accessibility, alternative uses, forest fires, other losses, etc., that are influenced by aspects ranging from physical constraints to traditional societal traits. Tree canopy cover method has been used for estimating the gross annual pine needle yield. The information on canopy density is obtained from remote sensing data, that forms the basis for forest classification. The annual gross pine needle yield has been estimated at 1.9 million tonnes while the annual net pine needle yield at 1.33 million tonnes. The annual primary energy potential of pine needles available as energy feedstock has also been estimated. For annual net energy potential estimation, thermal and electrical routes are considered. Electrical energy generation from pine needles using thermochemical conversion has been examined and the corresponding potential for electricity generation been estimated. An installed capacity of 789 MW can be supported with pine needles feedstock for supplying electricity in rural areas for five hours a day. For round the clock generation, an installed capacity of 165 MW can be supported by the pine needle energy feedstock.

AB  - The Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) is a federally listed endangered species living solely within the confines of Devils Hole, a geothermal pool ecosystem in the Mojave Desert of the American Southwest. This unique species has suffered a significant, yet unexplained, population decline in the past two decades, with a record low survey of 35 individuals in early 2013. The species survives on a highly variable seasonal input of nutrients and has evolved in a thermal regime lethal to other pupfish species. The short lifespan of the species (approximately 1 year) makes annual recruitment in Devils Hole critical to the persistence of the species, and elevated temperatures on the shallow shelf that comprises the optimal spawning habitat in the ecosystem can significantly reduce egg viability and increase larval mortality. Here we combine computational fluid dynamic modeling and ecological analysis to investigate the timing of thresholds in the seasonal cycles of food supply and temperature. Numerical results indicate a warming climate most impacts the heat loss from the water column, resulting in warming temperatures and reduced buoyancy-driven circulation. Observed climate change is shown to have already warmed the shallow shelf, and climate change by 2050 is shown to shorten the window of optimum conditions for recruitment by as much as 2 weeks. While there are many possible reasons for the precipitous decline of this species, the changing climate of the Mojave region is shown to produce thermal and nutrient conditions likely to reduce the success of annual recruitment of young C. diabolis in the future, leading to continued threats to the survival of this unique and enigmatic species.

AB  - We examine the causes of variation in personality traits among human hunter-horticulturalists. Specifically, we demonstrate that prosocial aspects of personality (related to leadership and gregarious cooperation) associate positively with physical strength and the possession of formal education. Moreover, we report evidence that the heritability associated with strength and education explains much of the heritability in prosocial personality traits. Our results suggest personality is calibrated to condition-dependent aspects of one's phenotype, such as size and skill.Evolutionary theories of personality origins have stimulated much empirical research in recent years, but pertinent data from small-scale human societies have been in short supply. We investigate adaptively patterned personality variation among Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists. Based on a consideration of cost-benefit tradeoffs that likely maintain variation in human prosociality, we hypothesize that individual differences in prosocial personality traits are facultatively calibrated to variation in "embodied capital"aEuro"that is, knowledge, skills, or somatic traits that increase expected future fitness. In support of this hypothesis, 2 components of embodied capital-physical strength and formal education-associated positively with Tsimane' prosocial leadership orientation (PLO), a broad personality dimension representing gregarious cooperation, interpersonal warmth, and pursuit of leadership. Moreover, using pedigrees to compute heritability estimates, strength and education had additive effects on the heritable variance in PLO, which suggests that prosocial traits may be "reactively heritable" by virtue of their calibration to condition-dependent components of embodied capital. Although alternative explanations must be falsified in future research, our findings 1) provide one of the first demonstrations of adaptively patterned personality variation in a small-scale society and 2) illustrate the potential power of an adaptationist approach to elucidate the causal underpinnings of heritable personality variation.

AB  - To meet the demand for food from a growing global population, aquaculture production is under great pressure to increase as capture fisheries have stagnated. However, aquaculture has raised a range of environmental concerns, and further increases in aquaculture production will face widespread environmental challenges. The effects of climate change will pose a further threat to global aquaculture production. Aquaculture is often at risk from a combination of climatic variables, including cyclone, drought, flood, global warming, ocean acidification, rainfall variation, salinity, and sea level rise. For aquaculture growth to be sustainable its environmental impacts must reduce significantly. Adaptation to climate change is also needed to produce more fish without environmental impacts. Some adaptation strategies including integrated aquaculture, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), and the expansion of seafood farming could increase aquaculture productivity, environmental sustainability, and climate change adaptability.

AB  - Evolve and Resquence (E&R) studies are a useful tool to study genomic processes during rapid adaptation, e.g., in the framework of adaptive responses to global climate change. We applied different thermal regimes to a natural Chironomus riparius (Diptera) population in an E&R framework to infer its evolutionary potential for rapid thermal adaptation. We exposed two replicates to three temperatures each (14 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 26 degrees C) for more than two years, the experiment thus lasting 22, 44 or 65 generations, respectively. The two higher temperatures presented a priori moderate, respectively strong selection pressures. Life-cycle fitness tests revealed no appreciable adaptation to thermal regimes but a common adaptation of all six replicates probably due to the rearing conditions, presumably increased larval density and water quality. Genomic analyses showed a strong, genome-wide selective response in all replicates (mean s of selected SNPs = 0.305). This genomic response was significantly similar at all genomic levels among all replicates (SNPs, 10 kb windows, genes, exons, regions of elevated allele frequency change [REA]). The intersections among the replicates exposed to the same temperature were either insignificant or underrepresented. This confirmed a selective response to identical selection pressure(s), however, not to thermal regime. Genes closest to the SNP with the highest selection coefficient per REA were enriched for GO terms related to ion transport, regulation of transcription and signal transduction, which supported the presumed acting selection pressures. Our study showed the evolutionary potential for rapid adaptation by genome-wide and probably polygenic selection on standing genetic variation in C. riparius. However, because of the impossibility to accurately predict the acting selective regime in evolutionary experiments, we discuss the sobering perspectives for inferring the evolutionary potential of natural populations with this approach.

AB  - The electrification of the non-interconnected Greek islands is mainly based on Autonomous Power Stations (APS), which consume conventional fossil fuels at high energy production cost, while in most cases the contribution of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) (mainly wind) accounts for a small percentage of total electricity generation in these regions. On the basis of comparative analysis of alternative "development scenarios" for electricity generation, the main objective of the present study is to investigate the techno-economic viability of high Wind Energy (WE) share at local (island) level, in accordance to the energy and climate change commitments undertaken by the country, having as central feature large-scale penetration of RES. In this context, the possibilities of increasing WE contribution are examined through the use of an integrated theoretical model developed from first principles, assuming two main possible scenarios for covering future electrification needs of a medium-sized Greek island, i.e. Lesbos. The first scenario (S1) is based on autonomous development of the island keep using as main source for electricity generation oil products. The second scenario (S2) involves the interconnection (IC) of the island with the mainland grid for satisfying part of electricity demand by establishing two alternative solutions, i.e. S2a: without the contribution of local Thermal Power Plant (TPP) and S2b: TPP are maintained to ensure electrification of the island. Subsequently, the economic feasibility of the above options is investigated in terms of their Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), calculated for the time-period 20202045, including also a sensitivity analysis on worst/reference/best Cases for future electricity demand and production cost. According to the obtained results, IC of Lesbos island with the mainland grid presents considerable economic interest in comparison to autonomous development, with WE having a dominant and an essential role towards that direction.

AB  - Bruchidius atrolineatus (Pic) is a common pest infesting cowpea seeds (Vigna unguiculata Walp) in Africa.  In the Sahelian zone, the adults are in reproductive diapause during the dry season.  Diapause induction depends on the climatic conditions during embryonic and post-embryonic development.  A strain of B. atrolineatus originating from the Niamey (13-degrees-N) was reared in different thermoperiodic and photoperiodic conditions.  In the thermoperiodic regime 40:25-degrees-C, in continuous darkness, induction of diapause was dependent on the duration of the thermophase.  Photoperiod could also influence diapause induction but the response depended on the temperature.  When the beetles were reared in conditions of LD 12:12 h, 40:25-degrees-C, for seven generations, the proportion of diapausing adults decreased and their sensitivity to photoperiod increased.  In LD 14:10 h, 40:25-degrees-C, the proportion of diapausing adults remained high regardless of the photoperiod.  In these conditions, the first emerging adults were sexually active and were used for selection of a strain with a low incidence of diapause.  After twelve generations, the proportion of diapausing beetles was lower than 5%.  The responses of this selected strain to photo- and thermoperiods were reduced.  The sensitivity of B. atrolineatus to photoperiod and thermoperiod could be controlled by genetic systems as observed in other insect species.

AB  - Under environmental change, the relationship between phenotype and fitness can change rapidly, leaving populations vulnerable. Plasticity within and between generations could provide the fastest mitigation to environmental change. However, plasticity may depend on interactions among parental environment, offspring environment and offspring sex, and we know little of how these interactions manifest. We examine the importance of parental and offspring thermal environment in the context of a terrestrial ectotherm (the jacky lizard,Amphibolurus muricatus), where the thermal environment depends on complex thermoregulatory behaviours. By manipulating both parental and offspring thermoregulatory (basking) opportunities in a full factorial design, we found that transgenerational plasticity was highly context dependent. Overall, longer parental thermoregulatory opportunities led to increased growth in offspring, providing a clear fitness benefit to daughters but inducing a cost of increased oxidative stress in sons. Daughters, but not sons, received the greatest advantage when their thermal environment matched that of their parents. The offspring thermal environment had little independent effect on offspring phenotype. Together, the results suggest that both directional selection on offspring size (leading to growth being dependent on thermal conditions) and selection for anticipatory parental effects operate, but with a different balance in males and females. More broadly, restrictions in thermoregulatory opportunities under climatic warming will have negative consequences both within and between generations, but the exact nature will depend on the evolved functional form of plasticity.

AB  - The trend toward a more fiercely competitive and strictly environmentally regulated electricity market in several countries, including China has led to efforts by both industry and government to develop advanced performance evaluation models that adapt to new evaluation requirements. Traditional operational and environmental efficiency measures do not fully consider the influence of market competition and environmental regulations and, thus, are not sufficient for the thermal power industry to evaluate its operational performance with respect to specific marketing goals (operational effectiveness) and its environmental performance with respect to specific emissions reduction targets (environmental effectiveness). As a complement to an operational efficiency measure, an operational effectiveness measure not only reflects the capacity of an electricity production system to increase its electricity generation through the improvement of operational efficiency, but it also reflects the system's capability to adjust its electricity generation activities to match electricity demand. In addition, as a complement to an environmental efficiency measure, an environmental effectiveness measure not only reflects the capacity of an electricity production system to decrease its pollutant emissions through the improvement of environmental efficiency, but it also reflects the system's capability to adjust its emissions abatement activities to fulfill environmental regulations. Furthermore, an environmental effectiveness measure helps the government regulator to verify the rationality of its emissions reduction targets assigned to the thermal power industry. Several newly developed effectiveness measurements based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) were utilized in this study to evaluate the operational and environmental performance of the thermal power industry in China during 2006-2013. Both efficiency and effectiveness were evaluated from the three perspectives of operational, environmental, and joint adjustments to each electricity production system. The operational and environmental performance changes over time were also captured through an effectiveness measure based on the global Malmquist productivity index. Our empirical results indicated that the performance of China's thermal power industry experienced significant progress during the study period and that policies regarding the development and regulation of the thermal power industry yielded the expected effects. However, the emissions reduction targets assigned to China's thermal power industry are loose and conservative. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the last few decades, Renewable energy has received remarkable attention. This is partially because fossil fuels are depleting and the necessity for energy is rising because of the increasing population of the world. Among renewable sources of energy, solar energy is one such type that is becoming increasingly popular because it is inexhaustible, clean, and reliable. Solar radiation is obtained as heat and light that can be converted by solar thermal power generation into valuable thermal energy or electricity generation. With regard to efficiency and financial viability, the availability of trusted data on solar radiation is crucial to forecast the performance of solar power plants at different places in the country. This paper describes a general integrated structure for assessing land suitability for ideal positioning of photovoltaic solar energy panels based on a variety of geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing methods. The Location Viability Assessment, i.e. the areas appropriate for harvesting Solar Energy, is measured based on Global, Diffuse, Direct Solar Radiation Data that estimates the potential of the Solar Power Generation sites. Two interrelated steps were implemented in this study. First, Remote Sensing was used, including LANDSAT 8 satellite data, to extract the study area's land use/land cover map. Second, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to model the research zone map of aspect angles and slope maps. These results indicate the potential sites for Solar Power Generation.

AB  - Eastern (Tsuga canadensis) and Carolina hemlocks (T. caroliniana) of eastern North America have been attacked by the non-native hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) (HWA) since the first half of the 20th century. Unlike most insects, HWA develops through one generation from fall to late winter, exposing this insect to the lethal effects of winter temperatures. The mortality inflicted by winter temperatures on HWA determines the surviving population density as well as its ability to spread to uninfested areas. With the ongoing changes in climate, knowledge of this species' ability to survive and spread in the future can help land managers prepare for its management. This study began during the winter of 2014 and ended in the spring of 2017. During this period, winter mortality of HWA was recorded at 100 sites from Maine to Georgia (n = 209). Changes in population density from the sistens to the succeeding progrediens generation were recorded at 24 sites (n = 35). Models were developed to predict HWA mortality using the lowest minimum temperature prior to the mortality assessment date, the number of days with mean temperature <-1 degrees C, and the mean daily temperature of the three days preceding that minimum. Models were also developed to predict population density changes from the overwintering sistens generation to the following progrediens generation. Future projections under climate change showed increases in winter survival and population growth rates over time. Especially towards the northeastern edge of T. canadensis' distribution as minimum temperatures are predicted to increase at a greater rate. This will result in an increase in density throughout its current distribution and expansion northward causing an increase in its impact on eastern Tsuga spp.

AB  - Understanding adaptive genetic responses to climate change is a main challenge for preserving biological diversity. Successful predictive models for climate-driven range shifts of species depend on the integration of information on adaptation, including that derived from genomic studies. Long-lived forest trees can experience substantial environmental change across generations, which results in a much more prominent adaptation lag than in annual species. Here, we show that candidate-gene SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) can be used as predictors of maladaptation to climate in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), an outcrossing long-lived keystone tree. A set of 18 SNPs potentially associated with climate, 5 of them involving amino acid-changing variants, were retained after performing logistic regression, latent factor mixed models, and Bayesian analyses of SNP-climate correlations. These relationships identified temperature as an important adaptive driver in maritime pine and highlighted that selective forces are operating differentially in geographically discrete gene pools. The frequency of the locally advantageous alleles at these selected loci was strongly correlated with survival in a common garden under extreme (hot and dry) climate conditions, which suggests that candidate-gene SNPs can be used to forecast the likely destiny of natural forest ecosystems under climate change scenarios. Differential levels of forest decline are anticipated for distinct maritime pine gene pools. Geographically defined molecular proxies for climate adaptation will thus critically enhance the predictive power of range-shift models and help establish mitigation measures for long-lived keystone forest trees in the face of impending climate change.

AB  - Recent developments in metacommunity theory have raised awareness that processes occurring at regional scales might interfere with local dynamics and affect conditions for the local coexistence of competing species. Four main paradigms are recognized in this context (namely, neutral, patch-dynamics, species-sorting, and mass-effect), which differ according to the role assigned to ecological or life-history differences among competing species, as well as to the relative time scale of regional vs. local dynamics. We investigated the patterns of regional and local coexistence of two species of shrews (Crocidura russula and Sorex coronatus) sharing a similar diet (generalist insectivores) over four generations, in a spatially structured habitat at the altitudinal limit of their distributions. Local populations were small, and regional dynamics were strong, with high rates of extinction and recolonization. Niche analysis revealed significant habitat differentiation on a few important variables, including temperature and availability of winter resting sites. In sites suitable for both species, we found instances of local coexistence with no evidence of competitive exclusion. Patterns of temporal succession did not differ from random, with no suggestion of a colonization-competition trade-off. Altogether, our data provide support for the mass-effect paradigm, where regional coexistence is mediated by specialization on different habitat types, and local coexistence by rescue effects from source sites. The strong regional dynamics and demographic stochasticity, together with high dispersal rates, presumably contributed to mass effects by overriding local differences in specific competitive abilities.

AB  - Understanding and predicting how adaptation will contribute to species' resilience to climate change will be paramount to successfully managing biodiversity for conservation, agriculture, and human health-related purposes. Making predictions that capture how species will respond to climate change requires an understanding of how key traits and environmental drivers interact to shape fitness in a changing world. Current trait-based models suggest that low- to mid-latitude populations will be most at risk, although these models focus on upper thermal limits, which may not be the most important trait driving species' distributions and fitness under climate change. In this review, we discuss how different traits (stress, fitness and phenology) might contribute and interact to shape insect responses to climate change. We examine the potential for adaptive genetic and plastic responses in these key traits and show that, although there is evidence of range shifts and trait changes, explicit consideration of what underpins these changes, be that genetic or plastic responses, is largely missing. Despite little empirical evidence for adaptive shifts, incorporating adaptation into models of climate change resilience is essential for predicting how species will respond under climate change. We are making some headway, although more data are needed, especially from taxonomic groups outside of Drosophila, and across diverse geographical regions. Climate change responses are likely to be complex, and such complexity will be difficult to capture in laboratory experiments. Moving towards well designed field experiments would allow us to not only capture this complexity, but also study more diverse species.

AB  - This 10-yr field study examined prolonged dormancy (dormancy of more than 1 yr) in Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), from Upstate New York. The research focused on whether the life cycle of the Colorado potato beetle could reduce the effectiveness of crop rotation as a pest management tactic. One set of experiments quantified variation in the occurrence and duration of prolonged dormancy in a natural population. A second set of experiments tested the effect of artificial selection for increased incidence of prolonged dormancy. Of the approximate to12,600 unselected beetles in the field cages overall survival (= % emergence) averaged 56.5 +/- 18.4% (mean +/- SD, range = 23.5-84.3%, n = 19 cages). Most (97.7%) of the emerging beetles surfaced after one winter; the remainder (2.3%) emerged after more than one winter in dormancy. The range of variation in the incidence of prolonged dormancy among the experimental cages during the 10-yr period was 0-7.2%. The incidence of emergence from prolonged dormancy was higher among beetles from the first summer-generation [mean +/-SD = 3.0 +/- 2.0% (10 cages)] than from the second [1.0 +/- 1.5 (7 cages)], and significantly more females than males emerged from prolonged dormancy (female:male = 97:64). Most (approximate to70%) of the beetles that underwent prolonged dormancy emerged after two winters in diapause; the majority of the remainder (approximate to29%) emerged after 3-7 yr in diapause; and, one beetle (approximate to1%) emerged after 9 yr. Artificial selection for prolonged dormancy over three generations did not result in a significant increase in the incidence of delayed emergence, nor did it result in incidences of prolonged dormancy greater than those in the controls (unselected field-reared beetles and lines selected for 1-yr dormancy). From our results, we conclude that the Colorado potato beetle has considerable variation in both the incidence and duration of prolonged dormancy, and that this variation has strong environmental and genetic determinants. Viewed in the context of the beetle's life history, these findings lead us to suggest that the evolution of resistance to crop rotation would require strong and sustained selection over large areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic global warming has become a major geological and environmental force driving drastic changes in natural ecosystems. Due to the high thermal conductivity of water and the effects of temperature on metabolic processes, freshwater ecosystems are among the most impacted by these changes. The ability to tolerate changes in temperature may determine species long-term survival and fitness. Therefore, it is critical to identify coping mechanisms to thermal and hyper-thermal stress in aquatic organisms. A central regulatory element compensating for changes in oxygen supply and ambient temperature is the respiratory protein haemoglobin (Hb). Here, we quantify Hb plastic and evolutionary response in Daphnia magna subpopulations resurrected from the sedimentary archive of a lake with known history of increase in average temperature and recurrence of heat waves. By measuring constitutive changes in crude Hb protein content among subpopulations, we assessed evolution of the Hb gene family in response to temperature increase. To quantify the contribution of plasticity in the response of this gene family to hyper-thermal stress, we quantified changes in Hb content in all subpopulations under hyper-thermal stress as compared to nonstressful temperature. Further, we tested competitive abilities of genotypes as a function of their Hb content, constitutive and induced. We found that Hb-rich genotypes have superior competitive abilities as compared to Hb-poor genotypes under hyper-thermal stress after a period of acclimation. These findings suggest that whereas long-term adjustment to higher occurrence of heat waves may require a combination of plasticity and genetic adaptation, plasticity is most likely the coping mechanism to hyper-thermal stress in the short term. Our study suggests that with higher occurrence of heat waves, Hb-rich genotypes may be favoured with potential long-term impact on population genetic diversity.

AB  - The association between the insensitivity of adapted ecotypes of invertebrates to environmental stress, such as heavy metal pollution, and overall low Hsp levels characterizing these organisms has been attracting attention in various studies. The present study seeks to induce and examine this phenomenon in Daphnia magna by multigenerational acclimation to cadmium in a controlled laboratory setting. In this experiment, interclonal variation was examined: two clones of D. magna that have previously been characterized to diverge regarding their cadmium resistance and levels of the stress protein Hsp70, were continuously exposed to a sublethal concentration of Cd over four generations to study the effects of acclimation on Hsp70, metallothionein (MT), reproduction and cross-tolerance to heat stress. The two clones differed in all the measured parameters in a characteristic way, clone T displaying Cd and heat resistance, lower Hsp70 levels and offspring numbers on the one hand and higher MT expression on the other hand, clone S the opposite for all these parameters. We observed only slight acclimation-induced changes in constitutive Hsp70 levels and reproductive output. The differences in MT expression between clones as well as between acclimated organisms and controls give evidence for MT accounting for the higher Cd tolerance of clone T. Overall high Hsp70 levels of clone S did not confer cross tolerance to heat stress, contrary to common expectations. Our results suggest a trade-off between the efforts to limit the proteotoxic symptoms of Cd toxicity by Hsp70 induction and those to sequester and detoxify Cd by means of MT.

AB  - Critical investigations into the cellular and molecular biology of parasitic nematodes have been hindered by a lack of modern molecular genetic techniques for these organisms. One such technique is transgenesis. To our knowledge, the findings reported here demonstrate the first heritable DNA transformation and transgene expression in the intestinal parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. When microinjected into the syncitial gonads of free-living S. stercoralis females, a construct fusing the S. stercoralis era-1 promoter, the coding region for green fluorescent protein (gfp) and the S. stercoralis era-1 3' untranslated region was expressed in intestinal cells of normally developing F1 transgenic larvae. The frequency of transformation and GFP expression among F1 larvae was 5.3%. By contrast, expression of several promoter::gfp fusions incorporating only Caenorhabditis elegans regulatory elements was restricted to abortively developing F1 embryos of S. stercoralis. Despite its lack of regulated expression, PCR revealed that one of these C. elegans-based vector constructs, the sur-5::gfp fusion, is incorporated into F1 larval progeny of microinjected female worms and then transmitted to the F2 through F5 generations during two host passages conducted without selection and punctuated by free-living generations reared in culture. Heritable DNA transformation and regulated transgene expression, as demonstrated here for S. stercoralis, constitute the essential components of a practical system for transgenesis in this parasite. This system has the potential to significantly advance the molecular and cellular biological study of S. stercoralis and of parasitic nematodes generally.

AB  - Mumps virus (MuV) is known to be associated with acute arthritis and may also have a role in chronic inflammatory joint disease.  The mechanism of induction of joint inflammation is not known but may be associated with direct invasion of joint tissue.  To investigate the possibility of presistent intra-articular infection, the interaction of MuV with primary cells from normal human joint tissue was examined.  These mixed cultures of synovial membrane cells and chondrocytes were found to be semi-permissive to the virus; only a small proportion of cells (5 to 20%) were infected and produced low titres of progeny virions.  In addition, little viral antigen was detected on the cell surface relative to that found on Vero cells.  This restricted infection of synovial membrane cells was related to a severely decreased synthesis of the viral glycoproteins, fusion and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase, and the membrane protein in comparison to the levels found in Vero cells.  Persistent infections were readily established and could be maintained for 2 to 3 months.  During the first month, the infection remained highly focal and supernatant viral titres were low.  Thereafter both the percentage of infected cells and viral titres increased until finally the cultures were killed.  No evidence was obtained for the generation of temperature-sensitive mutants or defective interfering particles during long-term infection, but the persistent virus derived from the cultures gave cloudy plaques and induced no fusion in Vero cells until passaged.  This study has shown that human synovial tissue cells have the intrinsic ability to support MuV replication and persistence which may be important in the pathogenesis of mumps arthritis.

AB  - This paper proposed an improved structure of Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller called as Integral Proportional Derivative (I-PD), applied for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of Multi-Source Interconnected Power System (IPS). The parameters of the proposed controller are optimized with a newly developed, powerful, nature-inspired meta-heuristic technique known as Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO). To show the efficacy of the proposed controller and the technique used, they have been tested on three different system models. Initially, a two-equal area of diverse source generation including reheat-thermal, gas, and hydro power system is considered. In the second scenario, the same power system model is used with addition of two non-linearities; Generation Rate Constraint (GRC) and Governor Dead Band (GDB). Lastly, multiple non-linearities including Governor Dead Band (GDB), Time Delay (TD), Generation Rate Constraint (GRC), and Boiler Dynamics (BD) have been considered to make the initial system more realistic and practical. The outcome from the proposed techniques is also compared with some recently meta-heuristic algorithms such as Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Firefly Algorithm (FA). From the results, it has been perceived that the proposed technique shows superior performance in respect of Overshoot (O-sh), Undershoot (U-sh) and Settling Time (T-s) of the system frequency.

AB  - Heterogeneous and ever-changing thermal environments drive the evolution of populations and species, especially when extreme conditions increase selection pressure for traits influencing fitness. However, projections of biological diversity under scenarios of climate change rarely consider evolutionary adaptive potential of natural species. In this study, we tested for mechanistic evidence of evolutionary thermal adaptation among ecologically divergent redband trout populations (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) in cardiorespiratory function, cellular response and genomic variation. In a common garden environment, fish from an extreme desert climate had significantly higher critical thermal maximum (p < .05) and broader optimum thermal window for aerobic scope (>3 degrees C) than fish from cooler montane climate. In addition, the desert population had the highest maximum heart rate during warming (20% greater than montane populations), indicating improved capacity to deliver oxygen to internal tissues. In response to acute heat stress, distinct sets of cardiac genes were induced among ecotypes, which helps to explain the differences in cardiorespiratory function. Candidate genomic markers and genes underlying these physiological adaptations were also pinpointed, such as genes involved in stress response and metabolic activity (hsp40, ldh-b and camkk2). These markers were developed into a multivariate model that not only accurately predicted critical thermal maxima, but also evolutionary limit of thermal adaptation in these specific redband trout populations relative to the expected limit for the species. This study demonstrates mechanisms and limitations of an aquatic species to evolve under changing environments that can be incorporated into advanced models to predict ecological consequences of climate change for natural organisms.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids are a new generation in vitro cell model, however, their applications are severely limited by difficulties in their generation. Here patterned poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogel films were synthesized for their generation. Instead of polymerization of HEMA monomers in the presence of a cross-linker, here the PHEMA films were synthesized by cross-linking furan-fimctionalized linear PHEMA, PHEMA-furan, and maleimide-functionalized linear PHEMA, PHEMA-mal, via Diets-Alder (DA) reaction between furan and maleimide groups. A thermal treatment temperature of 75 degrees C was chosen for the cross-linking reaction. The occurrence of DA reaction was confirmed by IR spectra. Using this method, cross-linked PHEMA films with smooth surface were successfully synthesized in situ in the well of cell culture plates. The films were then patterned by simply adding water to swell them. Highly ordered, honeycomb-like wrinkling patterns were successfully obtained by adjusting the furan and maleimide contents in the precursor linear polymers. The patterned hydrogel films were used to generate multicellular spheroids. Guided by the patterns, 3D spheroids with narrow size distribution, tunable size, and high cell viability were successfully obtained. The patterned PHEMA films reported here exhibited a lot of advantages. The patterning method was quite simple and required no template or special equipment. They were synthesized in situ in commercial cell culture plates. Particularly, thanks to the clean nature of the DA reaction, no low molecular weight monomer, cross-linker, initiator, or catalyst, which were potentially cytotoxic, was involved in the film synthesis, and no byproduct was produced and left in the film. The resulting films presented a high biocompatibility, allowing the avoidance of the tedious washing step. The films synthesized here were expected to have high potential for massive production of well-defined multicellular spheroids.

AB  - Biomass can be used for heat or power generation or for a combined heat and power generation in order to substitute fossil fuels. As a result of the low fossil fuel prices and the higher investment and operating costs of biomass-fired plants, the energy use of biomass has to be checked for every case in each application area. The preferred field of application is the rural area because of the reasonable relation between the potential of biomass and the transportation distances that have a great influence on the economic viability. The knowledge about the location of consumers as well as of the energy plants and the possible laying of a district heating pipe is important for the clarification of an optimal heat supply structure in an isolated area. A mixed-integer linear optimization model based on the dynamical evaluation of economic efficiency can help to find the most economical and ecological supply structure. The model has to be developed for three different types of operating companies. The influences of different parameters on the target function can be analyzed by defining scenarios and by running sensitivity analyses. The results show that the energy prices have the greatest influence on the economy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evolutionary theory predicts that dioecious species should produce a balanced primary sex ratio maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Organisms with environmental sex determination, however, are vulnerable to maladaptive sex ratios, because environmental conditions vary spatio-temporally. For reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination, nest-site choice is a behavioural maternal effect that could respond to sex-ratio selection, as mothers could adjust offspring sex ratios by choosing nest sites that will have particular thermal properties. This theoretical prediction has generated decades of empirical research, yet convincing evidence that sex-ratio selection is influencing nesting behaviours remains absent. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence from nature that sex-ratio selection, rather than only viability selection, is probably an important component of nest-site choice in a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination. We compare painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) neonates from maternally selected nest sites with those from randomly selected nest sites, observing no substantive difference in hatching success or survival, but finding a profound difference in offspring sex ratio in the direction expected based on historical records. Additionally, we leverage long-term data to reconstruct our sex ratio results had the experiment been repeated in multiple years. As predicted by theory, our results suggest that sex-ratio selection has shaped nesting behaviour in ways likely to enhance maternal fitness.

AB  - Populations of marine organisms are potentially affected by numerous selective pressures such as temperature and salinity, or anthropogenic pressures such as xenobiotics that may preclude adaptation to particular habitats. Such selective pressures may also affect their demography. Examples include modifications of the population dynamics through shifts in growth rate, and in life history traits affecting fitness such as size or age of first reproduction. However, the documentation of variation in phenotypically plastic traits specific to distinct environments cannot be taken as the ultimate proof that natural selection has occurred. Measurement of the impact of selection and subsequent local adaptation of fish populations based exclusively on morphological or physiological characters is one of the most difficult things to achieve because it depends on the use of phenotypic characters that closely match the genotype. Molecular markers can help to overcome this problem and, under some circumstances, can record the footprints of selection. A combination of polymorphisms that are under selection and those that are not can provide complementary information. In this paper, we review how and why selection can be detected at the molecular level, using genetic markers analysed in a population genetic framework. We then report and discuss case studies in fish. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change is expected to increase heat-related mortality across the world. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) studies are used to quantify the impact of higher temperatures, taking into account the effect of population adaptation. Although air-conditioning (AC) is one of the main drivers of technological adaptation to heat, the health impacts associated with AC-induced air pollution have not been examined in detail. This study uses the city of Thessaloniki, Greece as a case study and aims to estimate the future heat-related mortality, the residential cooling demand, and the adaptation trade-off between averted heat-related and increased air pollution cardiorespiratory mortality. Using temperature and population projections under different Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CIMP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios (SSPs), a HIA model was developed for the future heat and air pollution cardiorespiratory mortality. Counterfactual scenarios of either black carbon (BC) or natural gas (NG) being the fuel source for electricity generation were included in the HIA. The results indicate that the heat-related cardiorespiratory mortality in Thessaloniki will increase and the excess of annual heat-related deaths in 2080-2099 will range from 2.4 (95% CI: 0.0-20.9) under SSP1-2.6 to 433.7 (95% CI: 66.9-1070) under SSP5-8.5. Population adaptation will attenuate the heat-related mortality, although the latter may be counterbalanced by the higher air pollution-related mortality due to increased AC, especially under moderate SSP scenarios and coal-fired power plants. Future studies examining the health effects of warmer temperatures need to account for the impact of both adaptation and increased penetration and use of AC.

AB  - Life-history theory predicts a trade-off between early-life fitness and life span. While the focus traditionally has been on the fecundity-life span trade-off, there are strong reasons to expect trade-offs with growth rate and/or development time. We investigated the roles of growth rate and development time in the evolution of life span in two independent selection experiments in the outcrossing nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. First, we found that selection under heat-shock leads to the evolution of increased life span without fecundity costs, but at the cost of slower development. Thereafter, the putative evolutionary links between development time, growth rate, fecundity, heat-shock resistance and life span were independently assessed in the second experiment by directly selecting for fast or slow development. This experiment confirmed our initial findings, since selection for slow development resulted in the evolution of long life span and increased heat-shock resistance. Because there were no consistent trade-offs with growth rate or fecundity, our results highlight the key role of development rate - differentiation of the somatic cells per unit of time - in the evolution of life span. Since development time is under strong selection in nature, reduced somatic maintenance resulting in shorter life span may be a widespread cost of rapid development.

AB  - Unfavorable environmental conditions-abiotic stress-constitute one of the key drivers of evolution leading to environmental adaptation. Since the start of industrial revolution, natural populations are also facing a new stress-global warming-that, in turn, leads to alteration of the severity of most of the existing stress factors and emergence of novel stress combinations. Biological adaptation to environmental perturbations occurs at all levels of biological organization, but the current knowledge on the role of adaptation in responses of ecosystems to global change is limited, especially concerning the interplay of climatic and chemical/pollutant stressors. Particularly limited is the understanding of how biological adaptation alters the performance of aquatic ecosystems that integrate the pollution and nutrient loads from large catchment areas. This review describes the responses, tolerance, acclimation, and adaptation of species at different levels of aquatic food chain to globally changing environmental drivers with emphasis on arctic to temperate ecosystems. The analysis highlights major variations in tolerance and in extent and speed of acclimation and adaptation to various environmental drivers within and among species and among species groups at different trophic levels. The variety of responses to novel stressors causes modifications in species composition and diversity and can lead to asynchronous peak activities of organisms at different trophic levels. All these effects are expected to profoundly alter the aquatic ecosystem productivity, resilience, and adaptation capacity and can ultimately modify the global feedbacks between ecosystem-level processes and environmental drivers. We argue that joint efforts of researchers working at different levels of biological organization are needed to understand and predict global change effects on various functional types of organisms and scale up from physiological responses to large-scale integrated ecosystem responses in future climates.

AB  - Cities demand a large proportion of energy supplies while exporting significant amounts of municipal solid waste (MSW). Landfill regulations, self-sufficiency and proximity principles have induced shifts in waste management techniques. Historically, energy security, best use of resources, renewable energy use and climate change mitigation have not been leveraged in waste management strategies. This study examines emerging treatment technologies that could make a contribution in the aforementioned areas and have the potential for working at smaller scales in urban locations. The energy efficiency and environmental and economic performance of two thermal treatment technologies are presented, thus elucidating their potential role in urban strategies in the light of rising energy prices, decarbonisation of the economy, taxation and full use of incentives. The study illustrates that considering the full life cycle, beyond waste management, will enable more strategic technology utilisation. Improvements in viability over time according to evolving regulations are assessed, demonstrating how possible contributions to renewable heat and power can enhance profitability. Combustion technology is analysed for a medium-scale configuration, processing 100 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) using a steam turbine for heat and power generation, and a large-scale 250 ktpa configuration. Fluidised bed gasification is analysed at the small scale (50 ktpa) and medium scale (100 ktpa) using a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) for heat and power generation. One key aspect is the evaluation of the processing of waste into a predominantly renewable fuel capable of running a gas and steam turbine while rendering a significant proportion of residues reusable. Emission profiles and mass and energy balances are presented quantitatively. A discounted cash flow of material and energy outputs incorporating the effect of incentives across deployment scenarios is presented. Furthermore, key technical and policy pre-conditions are discussed.

AB  - Pregnant female Zootoca vivipara select lower body temperatures than males or nonpregnant females, and this shift in the thermal preferendum is believed to be related to optimising the conditions for embryogenesis. Thus, subjecting embryos to the higher temperature selected by males and non-gravid females might have detrimental effects on embryonic development and on hatchling fitness, according to predictions of the "maternal manipulation" hypothesis on the evolution of viviparity. To test the role of gestation environment on embryonic development in oviparous Z. vivipara, we kept a number of gravid females at the temperature selected by non-gravid females in a laboratory thermal gradient, whereas control females were allowed to regulate their body temperature without restrictions. Developmental stage at oviposition was more advanced for embryos of the experimental clutches, which were heavier than those of the control group. Forced gestation temperature also affected hatching success (58.62% in the experimental treatment vs. 97.37% in the control group). In addition, hatchlings from females subjected to high temperatures during pregnancy were smaller, had shorter head length and performed worse in running trials. Our results fulfil the prediction of the "maternal manipulation" hypothesis, and suggest that the shift in female body temperature during pregnancy optimizes embryogenesis and hatchling phenotype by avoiding the negative effects of the high incubation temperatures preferred by non-gravid females.

AB  - Climate change, sea level rise, and human freshwater demands are predicted to result in elevated temperature and salinity variability in upper estuarine ecosystems. Increasing levels of environmental stresses are known to induce the cellular stress response (CSR). Energy for the CSR may be provided by an elevated overall metabolic rate. However, if metabolic rate is constant or lower under elevated stress, energy for the CSR is taken from other physiological processes, such as growth or reproduction. This study investigated the examined energetic responses to the combination of temperature and salinity variability during a multigenerational exposure of partheogenetically reproducing Daphnia pulex. We raised D. pulex in an orthogonal combination of daily fluctuations in temperature (15, 15-25, 15-30 degrees C) and salinity (0,0-2, 0-5). Initially metabolic rates were lower under all variable temperature and variable salinity treatments. By the 6th generation there was little metabolic variation among low and intermediate temperature and salinity treatments, but metabolic suppression persisted at the most extreme salinity. When grown in the control condition for the 6th generation, metabolic suppression was only observed in D. pulex from the most extreme condition (15-30 degrees C, 0-5 salinity). Generation time was influenced by acclimation temperature but not salinity and was quickest in specimens reared at 15-25 C, likely due to Q(10) effects at temperatures closer to the optima for D. pulex, and slowest in specimens reared at 15-30 degrees C, which may have reflected elevated CSR. Acute tolerance to temperature (LT50) and salinity (LC50) were both highest in D. pulex acclimated to 15-30 degrees C and salinity 0. LT50 and LC50 increased with increasing salinity in specimens raised at 15 degrees C and 15-25 degrees C, but decreased with increasing salinity in specimens raised at 15-30 degrees C. Thus, increasing temperature confers cross-tolerance to salinity stress, but the directionality of synergistic effects of temperature and salinity depend on the degree of environmental variability. Overall, the results of our study suggest that temperature is a stronger determinant of metabolism, growth, and tolerance thresholds, and assessment of the ecological impacts of environmental change requires explicit information regarding the degree of environmental variability.

AB  - 1. There is increasing acceptance of the ideas that tests of adaptationist hypotheses should consider the importance of phenotypic plasticity for the traits involved, and explicitly incorporate the phylogeny of the organisms in question.
   2. However, it is difficult to combine these two concepts. For many cases of major Life-history shifts, transitional forms displaying intermediate character states no longer exist, and thus their reaction norms cannot be measured directly. None the less, indirect tests may be done by using extant taxa on either side of the relevant transition.
   3. This paper provides an example of such a test on a reproductively bimodal lizard species (Lerista bougainvillii, Gray 1839) to infer phenotypic responses to incubation temperature in the putative intermediate form between oviparity and viviparity.
   4. By virtue of this tight taxonomic focus and parallel experimental manipulations of extant taxa, predictions of alternative adaptationist hypotheses on the selective forces responsible for this evolutionary transition, from incubation in the nest to incubation in utero, are tested.
   5. By examining the responses of offspring phenotypes to experimental manipulation of incubation conditions in the extant oviparous and viviparous forms, it was possible to 'reconstruct' those of the now extinct transitional form.
   6. The data on phenotypically plastic responses obtained here suggest that the phylogenetic shift from oviparity to viviparity would have induced changes in hatching times, as well as in hatchling morphology and behaviour, in the transitional form.

AB  - In this paper, the genetic algorithms were used to realize optimization of the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process for manufacturing carbon-carbon composites for the first time. The density homogeneity, bulk density and infiltration time were selected as the optimizing objectives, and the density homogeneity was taken as the main optimizing objective. By combining selection, crossover and mutation operator of genetic algorithms with computer simulation technology, the CVI process parameters including deposition temperature and concentration of reacting gases had been optimized. After 30 generation evolutions, the fitness values were converged, and the optimized results were obtained. So, this paper has provided an effective optimization method for CVI process, which can solve the problem of difficulty of establishing a model for the process.

AB  - Adaptive genetic differentiation along a climatic gradient as a response to natural selection is not necessarily expressed at phenotypic level if environmental effects on population mean phenotypes oppose the genotypic effects. This form of cryptic evolution - called countergradient variation - has seldom been explicitly demonstrated for terrestrial vertebrates. We investigated the patterns of phenotypic and genotypic differentiation in developmental rates of common frogs (Rana temporaria) along a ca. 1600 km latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia. Developmental rates in the field were not latitudinally ordered, but displayed large variation even among different ponds within a given latitudinal area. In contrast, development rates assessed in the laboratory increased strongly and linearly with increasing latitude, suggesting a genetic capacity for faster development in the northern than the southern larvae. Experiments further revealed that environmental effects (temperature and food) could easily override the genetic effects on developmental rates, providing a possible mechanistic explanation as to why the genetic differentiation was not seen in the samples collected from the wild. Our results suggest that the higher developmental rates of the northern larvae are likely to. be related to selection stemming from seasonal time constrains, rather than from selection dictated by low ambient temperatures per se. All in all, the results provide a demonstration of environmental effects concealing substantial latitudinally ordered genetic differentiation understandable in terms of adaptation to clinal variation in time constrains.

AB  - To predict the effects of global change on marine populations, it is important to measure the effects of climate stressors on performance and potential for adaptation. Adaptation depends on heritable genetic variance for stress tolerance being present in populations. We determined the effects of near-future ocean conditions on fertilization success of the sea urchin Pseudoboletia indiana. In 16 multiple dam-sire crosses, we quantified genetic variation in tolerance of warming (+3 degrees C) and acidification (-0.3 to 0.5 pH units) at the gastrulation stage. Ocean acidification decreased fertilization across all dam-sire combinations with effects of pH significantly differing among the pairings. Decreased pH reduced the percentage of normal gastrulae with negative effects alleviated by increased temperature. Significant sire by environment interactions indicated the presence of heritable variation in tolerance of stressors at gastrulation and thus the potential for selection of resistant genotypes, which may enhance population persistence. A low genetic correlation indicated that genotypes that performed well at gastrulation in low pH did not necessarily perform well at higher temperatures. Furthermore, performance at fertilization was not necessarily a good predictor of performance at the later stage of gastrulation. Southern range edge populations of Pseudoboletia indiana may benefit from future warming with potential for extension of their distribution in south-east Australia.

AB  - Cold stress can reduce insect fitness and is an important determinant of species distributions and responses to climate change. Cold tolerance is influenced by genotype and environmental conditions, with factors such as day length and temperature having a particularly strong influence. Recent studies also indicate that diet impacts cold tolerance, but it is unclear whether diet-mediated shifts in cold tolerance are consistent across distinct genotypes. The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which commonly used artificial diets influence cold tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster, and whether these effects are consistent across genetically distinct lines. Specifically, we tested the impact of different fly diets on 1) ability to survive cold stress, 2) critical thermal minimum (CTmin), and 3) the ability to maintain reproduction after cold stress. Experiments were conducted across six isogenic lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, and these lines were reared on different fly diets. Cold shock survival, CTmin, and reproductive output pre- and post-cold exposure varied considerably across diet and genotype combinations, suggesting strong genotype by environment interactions shape nutritionally mediated changes in cold tolerance. For example, in some lines cold shock survival remained consistently high or low across diets, while in others cold shock survival ranged from 5% to 75% depending on diet. Ultimately, these results add to a growing literature that cold tolerance is shaped by complex interactions between genotype and environment and inform practical considerations when selecting a laboratory diet for thermal tolerance experiments in Drosophila.

AB  - In ponds, a chemical produced by predaceous Chaoborus (Insecta, Diptera) larvae changes the development of juvenile Daphnia pulex (Crustacea, Branchiopoda) so the juveniles grow spines (neckteeth) on the back of their head. It is generally assumed that the spined phenotype is (or is an indicator of) a morphological predator defense. The research reported here tests the hypothesis that the induced neckteeth do in fact increase Daphnia survivorship, over a range of temperatures. Predation experiments were conducted over a range of temperatures from 6 to 22 degrees C using fourth instar Chaoborus americanus larvae as the predator. The prey were a mixture of spined (induced ''necktooth'' phenotype) and unspined (uninduced) juvenile Daphnia pulex. At 6 and 11 degrees C, Chaoborus selected the unspined phenotype over the spined phenotype, as expected. However, at 22 degrees C, the selectivity was reversed: significantly fewer on the spined survived compared to the unspined phenotype. These results suggest that the spined phenotype may either increase or decrease Daphnia pulex survival, depending on temperature and clone.

AB  - Hydrogen gas is widely acknowledged as a significant energy carrier worldwide. Hydrogen gas derived from sustainable sources could be used as an alternative to fossil fuel for electricity generation with zero emission of hazardous pollutants. Food waste valorization to hydrogen is a viable energy source with potential economic benefits. The current study examines the economic viability and environmental effect of producing hydrogen from food waste in China using biogas steam reforming for power generation. The key findings show that the steam reforming of biogas from food waste could produce 221.12 billion kg of hydrogen gas. The quantity of hydrogen gas yield could generate 661.97 TWh of electricity. It was found that the consumption of the available electricity from the hydrogen gas could displace 15,482.26 M liters of diesel fuel combustion. The amount of diesel fuel consumption avoided can reduce global warming by 42,041.90 kt CO(2)e. It was also discovered that hydrogen has an appealing ecological efficiency of 94.64% when used as a source of energy generation. According to the outcomes of the economic analysis, the food waste to hydrogen project is economically feasible in all of China's provinces. The average hydrogen production cost, return on investment, the payback period is $0.814/kWh, 29.8%, and 7.2 years. This study could provide scientific data for investment and decision-making on ecological sustainability in food waste to hydrogen initiatives in China and other emerging nations with a similar culture.

AB  - The seven species of sea turtles occupy a diversity of niches, and have a history tracing back over 100 million years, yet all share basic life-history features, including exceptional navigation skills and periodic migrations from feeding to breeding habitats. Here, we review the biogeographic, behavioural, and ecological factors that shape the distribution of genetic diversity in sea turtles. Natal homing, wherein turtles return to their region of origin for mating and nesting, has been demonstrated with mtDNA sequences. These maternally inherited markers show strong population structure among nesting colonies while nuclear loci reveal a contrasting pattern of male-mediated gene flow, a phenomenon termed 'complex population structure'. Mixed-stock analyses indicate that multiple nesting colonies can contribute to feeding aggregates, such that exploitation of turtles in these habitats can reduce breeding populations across the region. The mtDNA data also demonstrate migrations across entire ocean basins, some of the longest movements of marine vertebrates. Multiple paternity occurs at reported rates of 0-100%, and can vary by as much as 9-100% within species. Hybridization in almost every combination among members of the Cheloniidae has been documented but the frequency and ultimate ramifications of hybridization are not clear. The global phylogeography of sea turtles reveals a gradient based on habitat preference and thermal regime. The cold-tolerant leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) shows no evolutionary partitions between Indo-Pacific and Atlantic populations, while the tropical green (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea vs. L. kempi) have ancient separations between oceans. Ridleys and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) also show more recent colonization between ocean basins, probably mediated by warm-water gyres that occasionally traverse the frigid upwelling zone in southern Africa. These rare events may be sufficient to prevent allopatric speciation under contemporary geographic and climatic conditions. Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of marine turtle biology and evolution, but significant gaps persist and provide challenges for the next generation of sea turtle geneticists.

AB  - Background: One of the most widespread prokaryotic symbionts of invertebrates is the intracellular bacteria of Wolbachia genus which can be found in about 50% of insect species. Wolbachia causes both parasitic and mutualistic effects on its host that include manipulating the host reproductive systems in order to increase their transmission through the female germline, and increasing the host fitness. One of the mechanisms, promoting adaptation in biological organisms, is a non-specific neuroendocrine stress reaction. In insects, this reaction includes catecholamines, dopamine, serotonin and octopamine, which act as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and neurohormones. The level of dopamine metabolism correlates with heat stress resistance in Drosophila adults.
   Results: To examine Wolbachia effect on Drosophila survival under heat stress and dopamine metabolism we used five strains carrying the nuclear background of interbred Bi90 strain and cytoplasmic backgrounds with different genotype variants of Wolbachia (produced by 20 backcrosses of Bi90 males with appropriate source of Wolbachia). Non-infected Bi90 strain (treated with tetracycline for 3 generations) was used as a control group. We demonstrated that two of five investigated Wolbachia variants promote changes in Drosophila heat stress resistance and activity of enzymes that produce and degrade dopamine, alkaline phosphatase and dopamine-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase. What is especially interesting, wMelCS genotype of Wolbachia increases stress resistance and the intensity of dopamine metabolism, whereas wMelPop strain decreases them. wMel, wMel2 and wMel4 genotypes of Wolbachia do not show any effect on the survival under heat stress or dopamine metabolism. L-DOPA treatment, known to increase the dopamine content in Drosophila, levels the difference in survival under heat stress between all studied groups.
   Conclusions: The genotype of symbiont determines the effect that the symbiont has on the stress resistance of the host insect.

AB  - The balsam twig aphid Mindarus abietinus Koch (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the spruce spider mite Oligonychus ununguis (Jacobi) (Acari: Tetranychidae), and the pine needle scale Chionaspis pinifoliae (Fitch) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) are three important pests for the Christmas tree industry of Quebec, Canada. Temperaturedependent development rates for postdiapause overwintering eggs of these species have never been studied for populations of southern Quebec, where the vast majority of Christmas trees are grown. The accumulation of physiological time in growing degree days (GDD) is a standard tool to predict egg eclosion dates for pests, when first generation immatures are most vulnerable to insecticidal control. Development rates for postdiapause eggs were tested at four or five constant temperatures in the 11-23 degrees C range under controlled conditions, based on time before hatching for eggs collected in a balsam fir plantation in late winter. The standard linear model and three published nonlinear models were fitted to the data and compared for their ability to estimate key biological temperature parameters and to predict development rates of postdiapause eggs. Validation of model predictions of egg eclosion time on balsam fir in the field was reasonably accurate using the classical linear model where field-accumulated GDD were calculated with a particular interpretation of the average method based on daily maximum and minimum temperatures. The linear model could predict mean egg eclosion within around 5 d of eclosion dates observed in the field.

AB  - Despite extensive mariculture of the gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, in the Mediterranean basin, there are no heritability estimates for growth in this or any other cultured warm water marine teleost, and so it is unknown whether selection for faster growing fish would result in genetic improvement. In the present study, we estimated heritability for weight in the Eilat hatchery strain of S. aurata, using single-generation mass selection procedures. Down, control, up and extreme up (''jumper'') selected male groups were crossed with randomly chosen unselected females. Progeny groups were cultured in replicates under communal and separate rearing conditions. Heritability estimates for weight varied, but overall were positive and of a moderate magnitude.

AB  - Microalgae have been considered as the feedstock for the third generation biofuels production, given its high lipid content and fast productivity. Herein, a catalytic approach for microalgae liquefaction to biocrude is examined in a temperature range of 250-300 degrees C in methanol and ethanol over zeolites. Higher biocrude yield was achieved in ethanol and at lower temperatures, while better quality biocrude with higher light biocrude ratio and lower average molecular weight (M-w) was favored in methanol and at higher temperatures. Application of zeolites improves the biocrude quality significantly. Among the catalysts, HY shows the strongest acidity and performs the best to produce high quality biocrude. Solid residues have been extensively explored with thermal gravity analysis and elemental analysis. It is reported for the first time that up to 99 wt.% of sulfur is deposited in the solid residue at 250 degrees C for both solvents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate risks pervade agriculture and generate major consequences on crop production. We do not know what the next season will be like, let alone the season 30 years hence. Yet farmers need to decide on genotype and management (GxM) combinations in advance of the season and in the face of this environment risk. Beyond that, breeders must target traits for future genotypes up to 10 years ahead of their release. Here we present the case for next generation design of GxMxE for crop adaptation in future climates. We focus on adaptation to drought and high-temperature shock in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] in Australia, but the concepts are generic. The considerable knowledge of climate, both past and future, gives us insight into climate variability and trends. We know that CO2 and temperature are increasing, and this influences drought and high-temperature risks for crops. We also have considerable knowledge of crop growth and development responses to CO2, drought, and high temperature that have been integrated into advanced crop simulation models. Here we explore by simulation the design of crops best suited to current and future environments. A yield-risk framework is used to identify adapted GxM combinations. The results in this case study indicate the urgent need for high-temperature tolerance to effects on seed set. Further, existing approaches to GxMfor effective use of water through the crop cycle will not be adequate to maintain productivity once global warming of similar to 2 degrees C is reached. Improvement in transpiration efficiency offered the avenue with best potential for advancing adaptation relevant to future climates.

AB  - Recent syntheses indicate that global warming affects diverse biological processes, but also highlight the potential for some species to adapt behaviourally or evolutionarily to rapid climate change. Far less attention has addressed the alternative, that organisms lacking this ability may face extinction, a fate projected to befall one-quarter of global biodiversity. This conclusion is controversial, in part because there exist few mechanistic studies that show how climate change could precipitate extinction. We provide a concrete, mechanistic example of warming as a stressor of organisms that are closely adapted to cool climates from a comparative analysis of organismal tolerance among clinally varying populations along a natural thermal gradient. We found that two montane salamanders exhibit significant metabolic depression at temperatures within the natural thermal range experienced by low and middle elevation populations. Moreover, the magnitude of depression was inversely related to native elevation, suggesting that low elevation populations are already living near the limit of their physiological tolerances. If this finding generally applies to other montane specialists, the prognosis for biodiversity loss in typically diverse montane systems is sobering. We propose that indices of warming-induced stress tolerance may provide a critical new tool for quantitative assessments of endangerment due to anthropogenic climate change across diverse species.

T2  - EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Experiments were performed on first generation hybrid populations, obtained by reciprocally crossing two Drosophila melanogaster strains, one inbred continuously, and the other, before and after keeping parents in mass-cultures for some generations. Parental populations were divided at random into two groups. One group was permitted to lay eggs at 16 +/- 1.00 degrees C, and the other, at 25 +/- 100 degrees C. The adult longevity and the female fecundity, which provide some measure of fitness in the treated and untreated populations, were measured at 25 +/- 1.00 degrees C.
   While no appreciable differences were observed in the physiological parameters measured in the combined sexes, the average adult life span of males in one hybrid was considerably increased compared with that of males in the other population. It is suggested that the observed differences in the longevity are due to the X-chromosome differences and, possibly, to their interactions with the other chromosomes. On the other hand, the mean adult longevity of males in the treated populations was more adversely affected than that of females, indicating a sex difference for surviving, as adults, a temperature change introduced during development. Because significant differences in the average adult life span, although not in the average egg production, were found in the two hybrids, the presence of some kind of maternal effect is indicated.
   A comparison of the experimental populations revealed a drastic reduction in the fitness compared with the controls. Evidence is presented to show that this is due to the inability of homeostatic mechanisms to regulate effectively in a changed environment and that, besides heterozygosity, the nature of integration of genotypes is essential for eliciting homeostatic or adaptive responses contributory to the fitness of a population.

AB  - Some Pacific salmon populations have been experiencing increasingly warmer river temperatures during their once-in-a-lifetime spawning migration, which has been associated with en route and prespawn mortality. The mechanisms underlying such temperature-mediated mortality are poorly understood. Wild adult pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon were used in this study. The objectives were to investigate the effects of elevated water temperature on mortality, final maturation, and blood properties under controlled conditions that simulated a "cool" (13 degrees C) and "warm" (19 degrees C) freshwater spawning migration. After 10 d at 13 degrees C, observed mortality was 50%-80% in all groups, which suggested that there was likely some mortality associated with handling and confinement. Observed mortality after 10 d at 19 degrees C was higher, reaching >= 98% in male pink salmon and female pink and sockeye salmon. Thus, male sockeye salmon were the most thermally tolerant (54% observed mortality). Model selection supported the temperature-and sex-specific mortality patterns. The pink salmon were closer to reproductive maturation and farther along the senescence trajectory than sockeye salmon, which likely influenced their survival and physiological responses throughout the experiment. Females of both species held at 19 degrees C had reduced plasma sex steroids compared with those held at 13 degrees C, and female pink salmon were less likely to become fully mature at 19 degrees than at 13 degrees C. Male and female sockeye salmon held at 19 degrees C had higher plasma chloride and osmolality than those held at 13 degrees C, indicative of a thermally related stress response. These findings suggest that sex differences and proximity to reproductive maturity must be considered when predicting thermal tolerance and the magnitude of en route and prespawn mortality for Pacific salmon.

AB  - Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. In addition to short-term reproductive health impacts, climate -related events will influence the risks of long-term and intergenerational mortality and morbidity for both birthing parents and offspring. As climate conditions continue to deteriorate in future generations, less healthy parents will give birth to less healthy offspring, who themselves will experience increased risk of reproductive outcomes. This intergenerational process causes a repeating cycle of poor parental preconception health, gestational complications, and poor offspring health, which leads to suboptimal precon-ception health among those offspring when they reach reproductive age. Because our ongoing efforts mostly focus on helping families achieve and maintain a healthy pregnancy, a critical need to think beyond the infant in our arms and consider the long-term implica-tions of climate change exists. Such efforts may involve policy strengthening efforts to reduce emissions, further engaging health care providers as active advocates, ensuring equitable and sustainable mitigation and adaptable strategies, and conducting more research that yields actionable data to guide policy efforts, especially in regions and populations most affected by climate change.

AB  - Polyolefin coordination catalysts useful for producing UHMWPE are surveyed, including classic Ziegler-Natta (ZN), current commercial generation ZN, metallocene single site, and non-metallocene. Catalysts were prepared and compared for productivity and selected polymer properties under a variety of conditions. Classic catalysts used were long lived TiCl3 crystalline metal clusters made by reducing TiCl4 by co-crystallizing with aluminum alkyls. Data presented from the synthesis and polymerization with these catalysts shows temperature and molecular weight response that were expected for these systems. Commercially available titanium on silica/magnesium chloride was activated with aluminum alkyls and had higher activity than those of the previous generation. Conditions for polymerizing supported metallocenes for producing polymers in the UHMWPE range were described. Long range "non-metallocenes" of the phenoxy-imine class were activated with MAO was tested and reported.

AB  - Biological studies on Laricobius nigrinus Fender (Coleoptera: Derodontidae) were conducted in the laboratory to obtain basic information on this little known predator. Laricobius nigrinus is a candidate biological control agent of the hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Homoptera: Adelgidae), an exotic pest on eastern (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere) and Carolina (T. caroliniana Engelmann) hemlocks in the eastern United States. It is univoltine and undergoes an aestival diapause. Post-aestivation activity period was 36.6 and 30.8 weeks for males and females, respectively. Adult activity and oviposition are well synchronized with the over-wintering generation of A. tsugae. Mean lifetime fecundity was 100.8 eggs over a mean duration of 13.2 weeks oviposition period. Within the temperature range (12-18 degreesC) studied, development was fastest at 18 degreesC. Mean development time from egg to adult was 88.8, 64.8 and 46.6 days at 12, 15 and 18 degreesC, respectively. Laricobius nigrinus has four larval instars. Mean larval consumption was 225.9 and 252.3 A. tsugae eggs at 12 and 18 degreesC, respectively. These findings provide essential data on the rate of development and feeding capacity of L. nigrinus at temperatures typical of ambient conditions during late winter/early spring in Virginia. Its rapid development at 18 degreesC indicates that it has potential as a biological control agent of A. tsugae because of its synchrony with the development of the over-wintering generation of A. tsugae in eastern United States.

AB  - Rising ocean temperatures will alter the productivity and composition of marine phytoplankton communities, thereby affecting global biogeochemical cycles. Predicting the effects of future ocean warming on biogeochemical cycles depends critically on understanding how existing global temperature variation affects phytoplankton. Here we show that variation in phytoplankton temperature optima over 150 degrees of latitude is well explained by a gradient in mean ocean temperature. An eco-evolutionary model predicts a similar relationship, suggesting that this pattern is the result of evolutionary adaptation. Using mechanistic species distribution models, we find that rising temperatures this century will cause poleward shifts in species' thermal niches and a sharp decline in tropical phytoplankton diversity in the absence of an evolutionary response.

AB  - The poplar lace bug, Monosteira unicostata (Mulsant & Rey), is one of the most important pests of almond trees in the Mediterranean area. The developmental times and survival of the immature stages of this tingid were determined at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35.5, 37 and 39 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% relative humidity and under a 16L : 8D photoperiod. At 16 and 39 degrees C, 100% mortality was recorded during immature development, with the egg, first and second nymphal instars the most susceptible. The lowest mortality was recorded at 28 degrees C (9.8%). As temperature increased, the total developmental period decreased and the shortest duration was recorded at 34 degrees C (12.1-12.2 d). At 37 degrees C, the developmental time was slightly longer (12.5-13.0 d). The thermal requirement for complete development, from egg to adult, was 229.2 DD. Several non-linear models were fitted to the developmental rate data recorded for the range of temperatures tested. Selection criteria indicated that the Lactin model best described the relationship between developmental rate and temperature. It predicted lower and upper thermal thresholds for the complete preimaginal period of 14.8 and 39.1 degrees C, respectively. Models were validated by comparing their predictions for the total preimaginal period with the developmental times recorded at three different fluctuating temperature regimes. The Lactin model again best fitted the actual durations recorded. This model could be used in IPM programs for predicting the moment of occurrence of the most damaging generations of this species.

AB  - The induction and isolation of four morphological mutants and one temperature sensitive lethal strain of Ceratitis capitata are described. After ten generations, the tsl strain CENA-78 no longer showed temperature sensitivity during the egg stage, but the sensitivity was maintained in larvae. During tests involving the CENA-78 strain, many females laid few or no eggs. Dissection of the ovaries showed that females had either one or two abnormal ovaries with minor or severe atrophy.

AB  - The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, spends the majority of its life cycle within the phloem of pine trees, experiencing exposure to temperatures below -30 degrees C in many parts of their expansive range. To better understand cold tolerance capabilities of this insect, seasonal patterns of cold-hardiness, as measured by supercooling points in the laboratory, were compared with seasonal patterns of host tree phloem temperatures at several geographic sites for 2 beetle generations. Larvae were found to be intolerant of tissue freezing, and supercooling points measured appear to be a reasonable estimate of the lower limit for survival. Of the compounds analyzed, glycerol was found to be the major cryoprotectant. No differences in supercooling points were found among instars or between larvae collected from the north and south aspect of tree boles. Both phloem temperatures and supercooling points of larvae collected from within the phloem were found to be different among the geographic sites sampled. Mountain pine beetle larvae appear to respond to seasonal and yearly fluctuations in microhabitat temperatures by adjusting levels of cold hardening.

AB  - The ability of first instar nymphs and newly moulted pre-reproductive adults of the grain aphid S. avenae to rapidly cold harden was investigated. When nymphs reared at 20 degreesC were transferred directly to -8 degreesC for 3 h, there was 18% survival. This exposure was selected as the discriminating temperature. Maximum increases in survival were achieved by acclimating nymphs for 2 h at 0 degreesC and adults for 3 h at 0 degreesC, resulting in survival of 83% and 68%, respectively. Cooling nymphs from 10 to 0 degreesC at different rates (1, 0.1 and 0.05 degreesC min(-1)) also increased cold hardiness, with the slowest rate of 0.05 degreesC min(-1) conferring the highest survival following exposure to the discriminating temperature. Adult aphids also expressed a rapid cold hardening response but to a lesser extent, with survival increasing from 16% to 68% following 3 h at 0 degreesC. There were no 'ecological costs' associated with rapid cold hardening in terms of development, longevity or fecundity. The data support the hypothesis that rapid cold hardening can be induced during the cooling phase of natural thermal temperature cycles, allowing insects to track daily changes in environmental temperatures.

CSTs are commonly used to start up heavy loads for example mining conveyors and produces heat during startup. Models for CST clutch heat generation together with thermal behavior has been developed and investigated. This includes a temperature model together with a kinetic model of the gearbox and a torque model of the clutch. Validation of separate model components and sensitivity analysis of parameters are conducted. The developed models are then compared by analyzing measurements and simulations to investigate generated heat during regular usage.

AB  - In order to attain emissions reduction targets to improve air quality and reduce global warming, electric vehicles (EVs) arise as alternatives to conventional vehicles fueled by fossil fuels. In this context, this work presents a comparative study between an EV and its conventional version, a medium-duty, diesel engine powered vehicle, from road tests following a standard cycle in urban driving conditions. The performance parameters evaluated are EV electric energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electricity generation and, for the conventional vehicle, exhaust CO2 emissions and energy consumption calculated from fuel consumption and heating value. Five scenarios were built to conduct an economic viability study in terms of payback and net present value (NPV). Considering the conditions applied, the results from the environmental analysis showed that CO2 emissions from the EV was 4.6 times lower in comparison with the diesel vehicle. On the other hand, the economic analysis revealed that the viability of the EV is compromised, mainly due to the imported parts with unfavorably high exchange rates. In the best scenario and not considering revenue from commercial application, the calculated payback period of the EV is 13 years of operation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temperature plays a key role in outdoor industrial cultivation of microalgae. Improving the thermal tolerance of microalgae to both daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations can thus contribute to increase their annual productivity. A long term selection experiment was carried out to increase the thermal niche (temperature range for which the growth is possible) of a neutral lipid overproducing strain of Tisochrysis lutea. The experimental protocol consisted to submit cells to daily variations of temperature for 7 months. The stress intensity, defined as the amplitude of daily temperature variations, was progressively increased along successive selection cycles. Only the amplitude of the temperature variations were increased, the daily average temperature was kept constant along the experiment. This protocol resulted in a thermal niche increase by 3 degrees C (+16.5%), with an enhancement by 9% of the maximal growth rate. The selection process also affected T. lutea physiology, with a feature generally observed for 'cold-temperature' type of adaptation. The amount of total and neutral lipids was significantly increased, and eventually productivity was increased by 34%. This seven month selection experiment, carried out in a highly dynamic environment, challenges some of the hypotheses classically advanced to explain the temperature response of microalgae.

AB  - The abundance and distribution of marine fishes is influenced by environmental conditions, predator-prey relationships, multispecies interactions, and direct human impacts, such as fishing. The adaptive response of the system depends on its structure and the pathways that link environmental factors to the taxon in question. The "Star Diagram" is a socio-ecological model of marine ecosystems that depicts the general pathways between climate, fish, and fisheries, and their intersection with climate policy and resource management. We illustrate its use by identifying the key factors, pathways and drivers that influence walleye pollock, crab, and sockeye salmon, under a warming scenario on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. This approach predicts that all three species will see reduced populations under a long-term warming scenario. Going forward, the challenge to managers is to balance the magnitude of the effect of harvest and the adaptability of their management system, with the scale and degree of resilience and the behavioral, physiological, or evolutionary adaptation of the ecosystem and its constituents. The Star Diagram provides a novel conceptual construct that managers can use to visualize and integrate the various aspects of the system into a holistic, socio-ecological management framework.

AB  - A piggyBac construct carrying two green fluorescent protein (GFP)-coding sequences one driven by Bombyx mori actin gene promoter and the other by Drosophila melanogaster heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) promoter were injected together with a nonautonomous helper plasmid containing an active piggyBac transposase gene into the posterior end of mature unfertilized eggs dissected from the ovaries of Athalia rosae (Hymenoptera: Symphyta). These injected eggs, which developed as haploid male embryos upon artificial activation, were cultured to adulthood. Of 278 injected eggs, 61 grew to G(0) haploid adult males. These G(0) haploid males were individually mated to diploid females. The progeny embryos (G(1) generation) were examined for GFP expression. Four GFP-positive embryos (from three independent G(0) matings) were obtained. Two eclosed as diploid adult G(1) females. Mature unfertilized eggs dissected from the GFP-positive G(1) diploid females were activated artificially, and the resultant embryos were examined for GFP expression, separated and cultured to adulthood (G(2) generation). The G(2) haploid embryos segregated to GFP-positive and negative individuals. By mating the G(2) adult haploid males individually to diploid females, stocks were established in which the piggyBac construct was stably integrated into the genome, as evidenced by GFP expression and Southern blot hybridization. The piggyBac transposition occurred at its canonical target TTAA sequence.

AB  - Use of biomass is crucial for a sustainable supply of chemicals and fuels for future generations. Compared to fossil feedstocks, biomass is more functionalized and requires defunctionalisation to make it suitable for use. Deoxygenation is an important method of defunctionalisation. While thermal deoxygenation is possible, high energy input and lower reaction selectivity makes it less suitable for producing the desired chemicals and fuels. Catalytic deoxygenation is more successful by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, and when designed correctly, is more selective. Catalytic deoxygenation can be performed in various ways. Here we focus on decarboxylation and decarbonylation. There are several classes of catalysts: heterogeneous, homogeneous, bio- and organocatalysts and all have limitations. Homogeneous catalysts generally have superior selectivity and specificity but separation from the reaction is cumbersome. Heterogeneous catalysts are more readily isolated and can be utilised at high temperatures, however they have lower selectivity in complex reaction mixtures. While bio-catalysts can operate at ambient temperatures, the volumetric productivity is lower. Therefore it is not always apparent in advance which catalyst is the most suitable in terms of conversion and selectivity under optimal process conditions. Here we compare classes of catalysts for the decarboxylation and decarbonylation of biobased molecules and discuss their limitations and advantages. We mainly focus on the activity of the catalysts and find there is a strong correlation between specific activity (turn over frequency) and temperature for metal based catalysts (homogeneous or heterogeneous). Thus one is not more active than the other at the same temperature. Alternatively, enzymes have a higher turnover frequency but drawbacks (low volumetric productivity) should be overcome.

AB  - This study presents the first intraspecific evaluation of larval growth performance across several different experimental scales, environments, and regions of a marine fish species. Size- and temperature-dependent growth models for larval and early juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are developed based on selected laboratory experiments with cod fed in excess. Observed sizes-at-age of cod from several experiments and stocks are compared with predictions from the models using initial size and ambient temperature history as inputs. Comparisons with results from other laboratory experiments reveal that the model predictions represent relatively high growth rates. Results from enclosure experiments under controlled seminatural conditions generally provide growth rates similar to those predicted from the models. The models therefore produce suitable reference growth predictions against which field-based growth estimates can be compared. These comparisons suggest that surviving cod larvae in the sea typically grow at rates close to their size- and temperature-dependent capacity. This suggests that climatic influences will strongly affect the year-to-year variations in growth of cod during their early life history owing to their markedly temperature-dependent growth potential.

AB  - The present paper is a survey of the economics of survival, a branch of ecological economics that stresses the preservation of the opportunities of future generations over an extended time horizon. It outlines the main analytical foundation of the branch - in which the concept of entropy is a major building block -, and its analysis of the interaction between the economic system and the environment. Regarding its outlook of the future, we see that the founders of the branch were mainly concerned with the consequences of a serious depletion of natural resources - particularly the energetic capital of the earth. More recently, however, emphasis is being placed on problems that stem from the fragility of the global ecosystem in face of the disturbances caused by the entropic acceleration imposed by mankind. It is feared that the ongoing expansion of the scale of the economy may bring about irreversible damages to vital environmental functions, such as protection against undesirable consequences of solar radiation, maintenance of temperature within a range that will support life, and preservation of ecosystem resiliency.

AB  - The predatory mite Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) is an important biological control agent for thrips in commercial greenhouses, but its effectiveness in fall and winter is limited by reproductive diapause induced under short day conditions.  Influence of photoperiod and temperature on diapause induction was investigated to provide information for successful management of the predator.  Under 8:16 (L:D) photoperiods and 22-degrees-C photophase temperatures, diapause incidence was inversely related to scotophase temperature, decreasing from 100% diapause at 15-degrees-C to no diapause at 21-degrees-C.  In continuous darkness, diapause was induced by thermoperiods of 20:10 and 22:17 but not 25:15-degrees-C (T:C) (8 h thermophase).  Critical daylength for inducing diapause under 22:17-degrees-C (T:C) was 12.45 h, which was consistent with the trend in diapause incidence in mites collected from an established greenhouse population September to November.  Most A. cucumeris diapaused only when exposed to diapause inducing conditions throughout their juvenile development and none stopped laying eggs when transferred from nondiapause to diapause inducing conditions as adults.  After 14 generations of genetic selection for a nondiapause strain, diapause incidence was 33.3%.

AB  - Experimental evolution allows testing hypotheses derived from theory or from observed patterns in nature. We have designed a droplet-based microfluidic "evolution machine" to test how transient compartmentalization ("trait-groups") of independent molecular replicators (likely a critical step in the origin of life) could have prevented the spread of parasitic mutants; that is, inactive RNAs that have been reported to spoil a system of free replicators. In remarkable agreement with the theory, we show that this simple population structure was sufficient to prevent takeover by inactive RNAs. A more complex scenario arises when we use experimental evolution to test field-derived hypotheses; for instance, the idea that temperature is driving genetic spatiotemporal patterns of climate change. In the fly Drosophila subobscura, latitudinal dines in gene arrangement frequencies occur worldwide, and more equatorial gene arrangements are becoming more frequent at higher latitudes as a correlated response to climate change. However, the evolution at different constant temperatures in the laboratory was not consistent with patterns in nature, suggesting some limitations of experimental evolution. Finally, also in D. subobscura, we show that repeatability in experimental evolution is staggeringly consistent for life history traits, making evolution quite predictable and suggesting that laboratory selection can quickly erase differences between populations. Yet, the genetic paths used to attain the same adaptive phenotypes are complex and unpredictable. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2018

AB  - Aquatic pathogens are a major concern for fish hatchery production, fisheries management, and conservation, and disease control needs to be addressed. Two important salmonid pathogens are Myxobolus cerebralis and Flavobacterium psychrophilum that cause whirling disease and bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), respectively. Innate disease resistance is a potential option for reducing disease-related mortality in hatchery-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum). Two experiments were conducted to assess pathogen resistance of first-generation (F1) rainbow trout created by crossing M. cerebralis- and F. psychrophilum-resistant strains. In the first experiment, we exposed two rainbow trout strains and one F1 cross to six treatments: control (no exposure), mock injection, F. psychrophilum only, M. cerebralis only, F. psychrophilum then M. cerebralis, and M. cerebralis then F. psychrophilum. Results indicated that the F1 cross was not resistant to either pathogen. In the second experiment, we exposed five rainbow trout strains and four rainbow trout crosses to F. psychrophilum. The second experiment indicated that at least one rainbow trout cross was F. psychrophilum-resistant. Achieving dual resistance may be possible using selective breeding but only some multigenerational strains are suitable candidates for further evaluation.

AB  - This study compares the economic viability of renewable energy technologies - wind, solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar thermal, biomass and wave power - to traditional generation technologies including hydroelectricity, nuclear power, coal power and gas power sources. The Levelised cost of Electricity (LCOE) for different generation technologies in Brazil are calculated by reviewing existing published literature and examining 13 case study projects. Initial results found that using a low (5%) discount rate, the hydroelectric plants had the lowest LCOE, but were only slightly cheaper than the wind power case studies. However, using a high (10%) discount rate, one of the wind power case studies actually had the lowest LCOE. Solar photovoltaic (PV) was found to be the most expensive technology followed by wave power and concentrated solar thermal power (CSP). It will be shown that grid connected distributed PV and concentrated solar thermal technology are largely undeveloped in Brazil due to the high price associated with importing solar power equipment into Brazil and also due to ineffective federal government policy. The environmental and social externality costs of fossil fuel plants and large scale hydroelectric dams (in the Amazon region) are also discussed. It will be demonstrated that wind power becomes the cheapest generation technology in Brazil, once all externality and transmission line costs are taken into consideration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Salmonella enterica is a leading cause of human gastrointestinal disease worldwide. Given that Salmonella is persistent in aquatic environments, this study examined the prevalence, levels and genotypic diversity of Salmonella isolates recovered from major rivers in an important agricultural region in northwestern Mexico. During a 13-month period, a total of 143 river water samples were collected and subjected to size-exclusion ultrafiltration, followed by enrichment, and selective media for Salmonella isolation and quantitation. The recovered Salmonella isolates were examined by next-generation sequencing for genome characterization. Salmonella prevalence in river water was lower in the winter months (0.65 MPN/100 mL) and significantly higher in the summer months (13.98 MPN/100 mL), and a Poisson regression model indicated a negative effect of pH and salinity and a positive effect of river water temperature (p = 0.00) on Salmonella levels. Molecular subtyping revealed Oranienburg, Anatum and Saintpaul were the most predominant Salmonella serovars. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogeny revealed that the detected 27 distinct serovars from river water clustered in two major clades. Multiple nonsynonymous SNPs were detected in stiA, sivH, and ratA, genes required for Salmonella fitness and survival, and these findings identified relevant markers to potentially develop improved methods for characterizing this pathogen.

AB  - The processes used to form an advanced PMOS SDE become increasing complex with each technology generation. Aggressive requirements for junction depth, sheet resistance and abruptness are difficult to satisfy with conventional technologies. The fundamental issues are the low productivity of implant systems at the required low boron implant energies and the diffusion rate of boron in silicon at the temperatures needed for activation. We propose an alternate process sequence with the goal of simplifying the process module by eliminating the Ge PAI implant and using a conventional spike anneal.
   Our approach is to utilize a ClusterCarbon implant to control boron diffusion, a ClusterBoroe (R) implant for high productivity at low process energy and a conventional spike anneal at moderate temperature. The ClusterCarbon (TM) implant uses the same ClusterIon (R) source and related system as the ClusterBoron implant. This process combination provides a solution to the technology requirements using conventional production tools, high productivity and a simple, direct path to optimizing the SDE conditions.

AB  - Many organisms have geographical distributions extending from the tropics to near polar regions or can experience up to 30 degrees C temperature variation within the lifespan of an individual. Two forms of evolutionary adaptation to such wide ranges in ambient temperatures are frequently discussed: local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. The freshwater planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna, whose range extends from South Africa to near arctic sites, shows strong phenotypic and genotypic variation in response to temperature. In this study, we use D. magna clones from 22 populations (one clone per population) ranging from latitude 0 degrees (Kenya) to 66 degrees North (White Sea) to explore the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation to high temperature tolerance. Temperature tolerance was studied as knockout time (time until immobilization, T-imm) at 37 degrees C in clones acclimatized to either 20 degrees C or 28 degrees C. Acclimatization to 28 degrees C strongly increased T-imm, testifying to adaptive phenotypic plasticity. At the same time, T-imm significantly correlated with average high temperature at the clones' sites of origin, suggesting local adaptation. As earlier studies have found that haemoglobin expression contributes to temperature tolerance, we also quantified haemoglobin concentration in experimental animals and found that both acclimatization temperature (AccT) and temperature at the site of origin are positively correlated with haemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, Daphnia from warmer climates upregulate haemoglobin much more strongly in response to AccT, suggesting local adaptation for plasticity in haemoglobin expression. Our results show that both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to temperature tolerance, and elucidate a possible role of haemoglobin in mediating these effects that differs along a cold-warm gradient.

AB  - This paper presented a review on the past, present and the future of thorium fuel cycle. The aim of this study is to evaluate the developments in thorium fuel cycle, looking at the prospects and drawbacks on the possibility of thorium-based nuclear fuel for commercial reactors realising the increasing challenges of uranium-based nuclear fuel. The initial interest on thorium-based nuclear fuel and why it was abandoned at the early stage of nuclear technology were considered. Also, the reasons behind the present renewed interest on the viability of thorium fuel cycle as a valuable alternative to the conventional uranium-based fuel were studied. Thorium abundance, its physical, chemical and neutronic properties were evaluated in comparison to the uranium fuel cycle to determine thorium fuel sustainability for next generation nuclear industry. In this study, it was found that thorium fuel is three to four times more abundant, has higher conductivity, high melting temperature, low expansivity and more proliferation resistant compared to uranium fuel. The possible application and related challenges of thorium fuels in different reactor types and designs such as light water reactors (LWRs), high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), heavy water reactors (HWRs), molten salt reactors (MSRs) and accelerator driven system reactors (ADSRs) were reviewed. The findings indicate that thorium fuel cycle can be used in the currently dominant LWRs designs in the nuclear industry with little technical modification, and also in other reactor types under investigation for future application especially molten salt breeder reactors, fast reactors and accelerator driven system reactors. Finally, this review made some recommendations on the short-term and long-term applications of thorium-based nuclear fuel cycle, and the issues that must be addressed before using thorium fuel for commercial reactor operations.

AB  - Phosphoglucose isomerase genotypes in the butterfly Colias differ dramatically in biochemical properties. These differences were evaluated earlier, using metabolic network theory, to predict, successfully, their effects on glycolytic metabolism and hence on Colias flight capacity and several consequent fitness components in the wild. Female egg-laying, not previously studied, also depends on flight, so female fecundity is now predicted to differ among these genotypes. An experimental design incorporating the thermal ecology of Colias confirms these predictions in a cool habitat. Thus female fecundity differences among animal enzyme polymorphs have now been found. Quantitative reconstruction of the selection regime for phosphoglucose isomerase genotypes in Colias can now begin. The most heat-stable genotypes are the least fecund, suggesting that global warming, if it occurs, may have severe impacts, through population genetics, on demography of thermally sensitive creatures.

AB  - The utilization of renewable energy sources such as solar energy and biogas have recently received more attention due to a decline in fossil energy sources and environmental issues. A leading method for long-term renewable energies sources storage is to convert to fuels such as hydrogen and heavy value hydrocarbons. In this work, a novel integrated structure is developed for sustainable cogeneration of hydrogen and heavy liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This integrated structure consists of the zinc-sulfur-iodine thermochemical cycle, biogas treatment cycle, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactions, a carbon dioxide power generation, and solar dish collectors. It is demonstrated that this integrated structure produces 359.8 kmol/h hydrogen, 116.8 kmol/h liquid fuels, 1714 kmol/h carbon monoxide, and 289,149 kmol/h hot water. The thermal energy and exergy efficiencies of the integrated structure are 58.03% and 44.34%, respectively. The exergy analysis illustrates that exergy destruction mostly occurs in heat exchangers (36.67%), reactors (24.69%), and collectors (20.25%). The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the absorbed useful energy and solar collector thermal efficiency decrease up to 9.735 kW and 0.7751, respectively when the average operating wall temperature in each solar collector increases from 627 degrees C to 1127 degrees C. The thermal efficiency and productivity of the liquid fuels increase up to 0.63 and 383.6 kmol/h, respectively with increase of carbon dioxide composition in the biogas from 40 mol% to 55 mol%.

AB  - The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is becoming a valuable model for investigating antiviral defense in the Lophotrochozoa superphylum. In the past five years, improvements to laboratory-based experimental infection protocols using Ostreid herpesvirus I (OsHV-1) from naturally infected C. gigas combined with next-generation sequencing techniques has revealed that oysters have a complex antiviral response involving the activation of all major innate immune pathways. Experimental evidence indicates C. gigas utilizes an interferon-like response to limit OsHV-1 replication and spread. Oysters injected with a viral mimic (polyI:C) develop resistance to OsHV-1. Improved survival following polyI: C injection was found later in life (within-generational immune priming) and in the next generation (multi-generational immune priming). These studies indicate that the oyster's antiviral defense system exhibits a form of innate immune-memory. An important priority is to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. This knowledge will motivate the development of practical and cost-effective treatments for improving oyster health in aquaculture.

AB  - There are several chip to substrate interconnection technologies in the packaging tool kit such as mass reflow (MR), thermocompression bonding (TCB) and laser assisted bonding (LAB). MR is a mature process but has known limitations on fine pitch devices and large/thin substrate packages. TCB has the advantage to minimize bump stress for low-K dielectric devices but its productiviy is very low. However, LAB can provide a solution for advanced devices with its localized heating and short bonding time. Recently, demand for fine-pitch Flip Chip bumps and large/thin substrate packages has increased, resulting in industry interest in LAB due to its good quality and high productivity.
   Amkor Technology invented LAB technology in 2014 and passed qualification for multiple devices from customers through many years of development and has been in high volume production for major customers since 2018.
   However, as the industry continues to require high bonding performance with various new devices, existing LAB technology may not support all these applications. These devices have led to the development of Next Gen LAB technology with a new bonding concept. One of devices that requires Next Gen LAB will be back side metallization (BSM) dies. BSM dies are necessary for Metal thermal interface material (TIM) applications for high thermal performance packages.
   In this study, new LAB technology is introduced, and its performance is compared with existing LAB with BSM die bump using large body FCBGA package. We focused on infrared (IR) temperature, X-ray inspection and cross-sectional anaysis to verify bump interconnection quality. Good bump quality was achieved with Next Gen LAB technology. This allows it to be another solution for next generation devices in the near future.

AB  - We investigated previously unknown associations between bacterial endosymbionts and bat flies of the subfamily Nycterophiliinae (Diptera, Streblidae). Molecular analyses revealed a novel clade of Gammaproteobacteria in Nycterophilia bat flies. This clade was not closely related to Arsenophonus-like microbes found in its sister genus Phalconomus and other bat flies. High population infection rates in Nycterophilia across a wide geographic area, the presence of the symbionts in pupae, the general codivergence between hosts and symbionts, and high AT composition bias in symbiont genes together suggest that this host-symbiont association is obligate in nature and ancient in origin. Some Nycterophilia samples (14.8%) also contained Wolbachia supergroup F (Alphaproteobacteria), suggesting a facultative symbiosis. Likelihood-based ancestral character mapping revealed that, initially, obligate symbionts exhibited association with host-specific Nycterophilia bat flies that use a broad temperature range of cave environments for pupal development. As this mutualism evolved, the temperature range of bat flies narrowed to an exclusive use of hot caves, which was followed by a secondary broadening of the bat flies' host associations. These results suggest that the symbiosis has influenced the environmental tolerance of parasite life history stages. Furthermore, the contingent change to an expanded host range of Nycterophilia bat flies upon narrowing the ecological niche of their developmental stages suggests that altered environmental tolerance across life history stages may be a crucial factor in shaping parasite-host relationships.

Important applications of whole-body human thermal models are predicting comfort under various conditions, such as riding in an air-conditioned automobile on a hot day, and predicting the probability of survival under life-threatening conditions, such as accidental immersion is cold water. This paper is arranged in three parts. In the first part, the evolution of human thermal models is discussed. Then, aspects of human physiology fundamental to thermoregulation are discussed, and finally we discuss a practical application derived from an Arctic survival project with which the author is involved.

AB  - Habitat selection is an important aspect of the ecology of animals and models predict that density dependence is a strong force shaping patterns of habitat selection. In ectotherms, however, density dependence of fitness tends to weaken as temperature deviates from the species' optimal temperature (T-o). This may have important implications for density-dependent habitat selection because the underlying mechanism for density-dependent habitat selection is density dependence in fitness. We examine how temperature can modify the predictions from isodar theory and obtain temperature-dependent predictions for density-dependent habitat selection. We specifically predict that the isodar's intercept will be furthest from zero and the slope will be steepest at the optimal temperature. As temperature deviates from the optimal temperature, we predict that the intercept will approach zero and the slope will approach one. We then test these predictions with experiments on habitat selection based on food abundance by red flour beetles in the laboratory. We also confirm that fitness decreases as density increases and that density dependence weakens as temperature deviates from T-o. In agreement with our predictions, preference for habitats with more food weakened as density dependence weakened. Our results have implications for habitat selection by ectotherms because we demonstrate that variation in environmental temperature can weaken markedly the effect of density on both fitness and habitat selection. High density may entail no fitness costs for ectotherms that cannot maintain their optimal temperature.

AB  - To assess long-term impacts of global warming on species, there is growing interest in latitudinal intraspecific patterns in thermal adaptation. Yet, while both mean temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs) are expected to increase under global warming, latitudinal differences in the effects of DTFs have not been documented. We tested whether low-latitude populations of an ectotherm deal better with greater DTF than high-latitude populations, especially at a high mean temperature close to the optimal temperature for growth where DTF causes exposure to extreme high temperatures. We evaluated the impact of DTFs when assessing the effect of gradual thermal evolution at the high latitude with a space-for-time substitution. We compared effects of both mean temperatures (20 and 24 degrees C) and DTFs (constant=0 degrees C, low=5 degrees C and high=10 degrees C) on growth rates between low-latitude and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a common-garden experiment. DTFs, if anything, reduced growth and were generally stressful as indicated by reductions in body condition, antioxidant defence and metabolic rate, and increases in oxidative damage. Most negative effects of DTFs were only present at a mean of 24 degrees C when too high temperatures were reached during a daily cycle. Notably, while 4 degrees C warming was beneficial in terms of growth rate at both latitudes at a constant temperature regime, this changed in a negative effect at high DTF. Moreover, this modulating effect of the mean temperature by DTF differed between latitudes indicating local thermal adaptation. While 4 degrees C warming at low DTF still caused faster growth in low-latitude larvae, it already slowed growth in high-latitude larvae. This supports the emerging insight that warming would increase growth in high-latitude larvae in the absence of DTF, yet would decrease growth in the more realistic scenarios with DTF. In contrast, a space-for-time substitution approach suggested that under gradual thermal evolution, the evolved high-latitude larvae would no longer suffer a growth reduction in the presence of DTF. Our study provided important proof-of-principle that jointly integrating gradual thermal evolution and the expected increase in DTF generates opposing predictions of effects of global warming on this ectotherm.

AB  - Parasites can enhance their fitness by modifying the behavior of their hosts in ways that increase rates of production and transmission of parasite larvae. We used an antihelminthic drug to experimentally alter infections of lungworms (Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala) in cane toads (Rhinella marina). We then compared subsequent behaviors of dewormed toads versus toads that retained infections. Both in the laboratory and in the field, the presence of parasites induced hosts to select higher body temperatures (thereby increasing rates of lungworm egg production), to defecate in moister sites, and to produce feces with higher moisture content (thereby enhancing survival of larvae shed in feces). Because those behavioral modifications enhance rather than decrease parasite fitness, they are likely to have arisen as adaptive manipulations of host behavior rather than as host adaptations to combat infection or as nonadaptive consequences of infection on host physiology. However, the mechanisms by which lungworms alter cane toad thermal preference and defecation are not known. Although many examples of host manipulation by parasites involve intermediate hosts facilitating their own demise, our findings indicate that manipulation of definitive hosts can be as subtle as when and where to defecate.

AB  - The ability of hatchling turtles to detect environmental temperature differences and to effectively select preferred temperature is a function that critically impacts survival. In some turtle species, temperature preference may be influenced by embryonic and post-hatching conditions, such as egg-incubation and acclimation temperature. We tested for effects of embryonic incubation temperature (27.5 degrees C, 30 degrees C) and acclimation temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C) on the selected temperature and movement patterns of 32 Chrysemys picta bellii (Reptilia: Emydidae) hatchlings in an aquatic thermal gradient of 14-34 degrees C and in single-temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C) control tests. Among 10-11 month old hatchlings, acclimation temperature and egg-incubation temperature influenced temperature selection and movement patterns. Acclimation temperature affected activity and movement: in thermal gradient and single-temperature control tests, 25 degrees C-acclimated turtles relocated between chambers significantly more frequently than individuals acclimated to 20 degrees C. Acclimation temperature also affected temperature selection: 20 degrees C-acclimated turtles selected a specific temperature during gradient tests, but 25 degrees C-acclimated turtles did not. Among 20 degrees C-acclimated turtles, egg-incubation temperature was inversely related to selected temperature: hatchling turtles incubated at 27.5 degrees C selected the warmest temperature available (34 degrees C); individuals incubated at 30 degrees C selected the coldest temperature (14 degrees C). These results suggest that interactions of environmental conditions may influence post-hatching thermo-regulatory behavior in C. picta bellii, a factor that ultimately affects fitness.

AB  - China is the world's largest CO2 emitting country, and coal-fired thermal power generation accounted for over 50% of the total electricity generation in China in 2015. This study reports the changes in the power generation efficiency of coal-fired thermal power plants in China from 2009 to 2011 and elucidates how the differences in the production scale of the power plants and regional heterogeneity affect the power generation efficiency. We propose a metafrontier data envelopment analysis (DEA) decomposition framework to investigate the sources of inefficiency in power generation. The results suggest that, on average, the power generation efficiency of largescale power plants is 13% higher than that of small-scale power plants. Although operational inefficiency is the main source of inefficiency in eastern and central China, the technology gap the differences in the quality of coal consumed for electricity production and in the equipment of the power plants among regions is the main source of inefficiency in western China. This study uses the results of the framework to discuss the scrapping policies for coal-fired thermal power plants in China. For large-scale power plants in western China, the components of inefficiency vary and, thus, policymakers should consider scrapping thermal power plants based not only on the level of inefficiency but also on their components.

AB  - Ocean temperatures will increase significantly over the next 100 years due to global climate change(1). As temperatures increase beyond current ranges, it is unclear how adaptation will impact the distribution and ecological role of marine microorganisms(2). To address this major unknown, we imposed a stressful high-temperature regime for 500 generations on a strain from the abundant marine Roseobacter Glade. High-temperature-adapted isolates significantly improved their fitness but also increased biofilm formation at the air-liquid interface. Furthermore, this altered lifestyle was coupled with genomic changes linked to biofilm formation in individual isolates, and was also dominant in evolved populations. We hypothesize that the increasing biofilm formation was driven by lower oxygen availability at elevated temperature, and we observe a relative fitness increase at lower oxygen. The response is uniquely different from that of Escherichia coli adapted to high temperature(3 )(only 3% of mutated genes were shared in both studies). Thus, future increased temperatures could have a direct effect on organismal physiology and an indirect effect via a decrease in ocean oxygen solubility, leading to an alteration in microbial lifestyle.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of market restructuring initiatives that introduced competition into the United States electricity industry on the thermal efficiency of electricity generation. An empirical model is estimated on annual data for over 950 plants from 1996 to 2006. Model estimates show that access to wholesale electricity markets and retail choice together increased the efficiency of investor-owned plants by about nine percent and that these gains stem from organizational and technological changes within the plant. Although not directly targeted by restructuring initiatives, similar efficiency gains are also found for municipality-owned plants. This result suggests that the potential benefits from competition have spilled over to public electricity generation.

AB  - First feed production continues to be a major barrier to the cultivation of many fish species. Although copepod nauplii are a suitable food, consistency and high production have been difficult. Temporal changes in production in batch cultures of the calanoid copepod, Bestiolina similis, were investigated to develop management strategies for the use of copepod nauplii as a live food. Population abundances and female egg production rates were measured, and recruitment and mortality rates were calculated. Relative expression levels of a molecular biomarker for stress, heat shock protein hsp70, were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The population cycle included a period of rapid increase in abundances, followed by a steep decline and a period of stable but low population densities. Initially, egg production exceeded 25 eggs per female per day and low mortality rates prevailed. The population decline was preceded by upregulation of hsp70 and followed by an 80-90% decline in female fecundity and an increase in mortality rates. Egg production rates remained below four eggs per female per day even after new generations of females reached adulthood. The predictable population cycle provides opportunities to coordinate nauplius production rates with first feed needs of fish larvae.

AB  - With the continuous increase in new energy installed capacity, the slowdown in the growth of social power consumption, the pressure created by high coal prices, and the reduction in on-grid electricity tariffs, the challenges facing the survival and development of thermal power generation enterprises are becoming more severe. Hence, based on the cost-benefit analysis method, this paper proposes a diversified operating benefit analysis and decision model for thermal power generation enterprises that includes four profit models: power sales, peak load regulation (without oil), peak load regulation (with oil), and generation right trading. The opportunity cost of peak load regulation and generation rights trading was considered, and six scenarios were designed. An empirical analysis was conducted by selecting a thermal power enterprise in Ningxia, Northwest China, as an example, using scenario and sensitivity analyses. The results show that under the diversified business model, thermal power generation enterprises can more effectively avoid the risks when the external environment changes and significantly improve its economic benefits. The consumption of new energy can be promoted, and positive social effects will be achieved. Therefore, the findings will help the thermal power generation enterprises to face these challenges.

AB  - The genetic basis for determination of flight capacity in the light brown apple month, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Tortricidae), was investigated by means of heritability estimation, artificial selection and crossbreeding, using samples from two natural populations. The mean heritabilities estimated by offspring-parent regression were 0.559 for offspring on female parents and 0.427 for offspring on male parents. These results were largely consistent with those estimated from paternal half-sibs and with realized heritabilities calculated from selected generations, although the heritability of flight capacity varied, to some extent, with the populations and temperatures to which the individuals were subjected. These estimates indicate the existence of additive genetic variance for flight capacity in the natural populations. The response pattern in the selection experiment indicates that the genetic effect on flight capacity in this species is mainly additive, though the phenotype performance of flights in F1 progeny from crossbreeding 'long-fliers' with 'short-fliers' suggests a weak dominance of short-flying genes and a slight maternal effect.

AB  - We have mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Drosophila mechanosensory bristle number in six recombinant isogenic line (RIL) mapping populations, each of which was derived from an isogenic chromosome extracted from a line selected for high or low, sternopleural or abdominal bristle number and an isogenic wild-type chromosome. All RILs were evaluated as male and female F, progeny of crosses to both the selected and the wild-type parental chromosomes at three developmental temperatures (18degrees, 25degrees, and 28degrees). QTL for bristle number were mapped separately for each chromosome, trait, and environment by linkage to roo transposable element market loci, using composite interval mapping. A total of 53 QTL were detected, of which 33 affected sternopleural bristle number, 31 affected abdominal bristle number, and 11 affected both traits. The effects of most QTL were conditional on sex (27%), temperature (14%), or both sex and temperature (30%). Epistatic interactions between QTL were also common. While many QTL mapped to the same location as candidate bristle development loci, several QTL regions did not encompass obvious candidate genes. These features are germane to evolutionary models for the maintenance of genetic variation for quantitative traits, but complicate efforts to understand the molecular genetic basis of variation for complex traits.

AB  - The edible long-horned grasshopper Ruspolia differens (Serville) is widely distributed and consumed in subSaharan Africa. Efficient mass rearing of the edible grasshopper is critical to ensure their sustainable supply for food and nutritional security. Hence, we investigated the effect of temperature on development, survival and reproduction of R. differens under six constant (15, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures. Using Insect Life Cycle Modeling software we fitted, linear and non-linear models to R. differens development, mortality, longevity, and fecundity. The best-fitted functions were compiled for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which was stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. We used the process-based climatic phenology models, and applied establishment risk index (ERI) and generation index (GI) in a geographic information system to map the potential distribution of R. differens under current and future climates. At optimum temperatures of 30-32 degrees C, egg incubation period was 14-15 days and the developmental time was shortest at 52.5-58 days. Lowest nymphal mortality (3.4-13%) and the highest female fecundity was obtained at 25-30 degrees C. The optimum temperature for the reproduction ranged between 27 and 30 degrees C. Most simulated lifetable parameters were at their maximum at 28 degrees C. Predictive models showed that countries in the East, Central, West, Southern and the Horn of Africa were suitable for establishment of R. differens under current climate scenarios (2000). However, by 2050, climatically suitable areas for the establishment of R. differens were predicted to shrink in the West, Southern and the Horn of Africa than its current distribution. We predict up to three generations per year for R. differens in sub-Saharan Africa under current scenarios which can increase to 4 under future scenarios. The optimum rearing temperatures identified can guide optimization of mass rearing of R. differens.

AB  - Since the thermal condition of living spaces affects the occupants' productivity and their quality of life, it is important to design effective heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) control strategies for better energy efficiency and thermal comfort. An essential step in HVAC control and energy optimization is thermal comfort modeling. Recently, data-driven thermal comfort models have been preferred over the Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model due to higher accuracy and ease of use. However, the unavailability of comprehensive labelled thermal comfort data from the occupants poses a significant modeling challenge. This paper addresses data inadequacy issues by adopting 'transfer learning' to leverage well learned knowledge from source domain (same climate zones) to target domain (different climate zone) where modeling data is sparse. Specifically, a Transfer Learning based Convolutional Neural Networks-Long Short Term Memory neural networks (TL CNN-LSTM) is designed for effective thermal comfort modeling that exploits the spatio-temporal relations in the thermal comfort data. The significant modeling parameters for TL CNN-LSTM are identified using the Chi-squared test. Further, the lack of sufficient samples across all thermal conditions in the available thermal comfort datasets was handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Experiments with two source (ASHRAE RP-884 and Scales Project) and one target (Medium US office) datasets demonstrate the ability of TL CNN-LSTM in achieving an accuracy of >55% with limited data in target buildings. The limitation of TL CNN-LSTM is its continued dependence on intrusive parameters and the challenges in assessing its adaptability to different climate zones.

AB  - Latitudinal clines in the frequency of various chromosomal inversions are well documented in Drosophila subobscura. Because these clines are roughly parallel on three continents, they have undoubtedly evolved by natural selection. Here, we address whether individuals carrying different chromosomal arrangements also vary in their thermal preferences (T-p) and heat stress tolerance (T-ko). Our results show that although T-p and T-ko were uncorrelated, flies carrying "cold-adapted" gene arrangements tended to choose lower temperatures in the laboratory or had a lower heat stress tolerance, in line with what could be expected from the natural patterns. Different chromosomes were mainly responsible for the underlying genetic variation in both traits, which explains why they are linearly independent. Assuming T-p corresponds closely with temperatures that maximize fitness our results are consistent with previous laboratory natural selection experiments showing that thermal optimum diverged among thermal lines, and that chromosomes correlated with T-p differences responded to selection as predicted here. Also consistent with data from the regular tracking of the inversion polymorphism since the colonization of the Americas by D. subobscura, we tentatively conclude that selection on tolerance to thermal extremes is more important in the evolution and dynamics of clinal patterns than the relatively "minor" adjustments from behavioral thermoregulation.

AB  - The relationships between egg production (spawning behavior), larval growth and survival, and environmental conditions that larvae encounter were investigated in the Patuxent River tributary of Chesapeake Bay in 1991. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) eggs and larvae occurred predominantly above the salt front where conductivity was less than or equal to 800 mu mhos cm(-1). There were three prominent peaks in egg production, each coinciding with increasing temperatures. Estimated growth rates of 6-d, otolith-aged cohorts, which ranged from 0.15 mm d(-1) to 0.22 mm d(-1) (mean = 0.17 mm d(-1)), were not demonstrated to differ significantly from each other. Observed zooplankton densities and temperature did not significantly affect growth rates. Stage-specific cumulative mortalities of combined cohorts were calculated for eggs (Z(stage) = 0.20 = 18.1%), yolk-sac larvae (Z(stage) = 5.80 = 99.7%), and first-feeding larvae (Z(stage) = 2.95 = 94.8%). The very high mortality of yolk-sac larvae suggests that dynamics during this stage may have had a major impact on subsequent recruitment. Cohort-specific mortality rates of larvae were variable, ranging from Z = 0.045 d(-1) to 0.719 d(-1), and were strongly temperature-dependent. Cohorts that experienced average temperatures <15 degrees C or >20 degrees C during the first 25 d after hatching had significantly higher mortality rates than those which experienced intermediate temperatures. Estimated hatch-date frequencies of larvae greater than or equal to 8 mm SL indicated good, very good, and very low potential recruitments for cohorts spawned during early-season (April 2-11), mid-season (April 12-24) and late-season (April 25-May 5), respectively. Because seasonal temperature trends and fluctuations are unpredictable, striped bass females cannot select a spawning time that guarantees their offspring will be exposed to optimum temperatures. Consequently, selection may have occurred for spawning over a broad range of temperatures and dates, a behavior insuring that some larval cohorts will encounter favorable temperatures.

AB  - Interspecific hybridization and introgression are of conservation concern because they can lead to lower fitness, and in some cases, extinction of the parental population or species. Alternatively, hybridization can lead to increased fitness (i.e., heterosis) via generation of new genetic combinations and increased adaptive potential. There have been isolated observations of the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) hybridizing with the closely-related bobcat (Lynx rufus), but no comprehensive study has been undertaken of lynx bobcat hybridization across their geographic ranges. The lynx distribution in North America has contracted by 40% from its historical range, and hybridization with bobcats is a potential, uncertain threat to lynx conservation. We conducted a continental-scale assessment of the prevalence of hybridization and genetic introgression between lynx (n = 1776, Canada and Alaska, USA) and bobcat (n = 1075, Canada and conterminous USA). Using control region sequences and clustering of microsatellite data, we found that the prevalence of genetic introgression was relatively low (7 of 2851 individuals (0.24%)). We found evidence of backcrossing to both lynx and bobcat parental types, suggesting that hybrids can be fertile. If the abundance of Canada lynx at the southern extent of its distribution is low relative to bobcat, hybridization and backcrossing with bobcat over several generations could result in the loss of lynx in areas of sympatry. If climate warming results in the bobcat distribution shifting northward towards the southern extent of the lynx distribution, the likelihood of interspecific hybridization could increase.

AB  - Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is technology that can significantly increase the share of renewable energy in final energy supply and are one of essential technologies for the nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB), new build and refurbished. In the article (a) an experimental semitransparent BIPV glazed facade structure with 60% of PV cell coverage is shown; (b) energy efficiency indicators were developed based on identified impact parameters using experimental data; and (c) multi-parametric models of electricity generation, preheating of air for space ventilation, and dynamic thermal insulation features that enable prediction of solar energy utilization in different climate conditions are shown. The modeled efficiency of electricity production of BIPV was in the range between 8% and 9.5% at daily solar radiation above 1500 Wh/day, while low impact of outdoor air temperature and ventilation air flow rate on PV cell cooling was noticed. Between 35% and 75% of daily solar radiation can be utilized by preheating the air for space ventilation, and 4.5% to 7.5% of daily solar radiation can be utilized in the form of heat gains through opaque envelope walls.

AB  - In this study, a modified heat transfer search (MHTS) algorithm is proposed by incorporating sub-population based simultaneous heat transfer modes viz. conduction, convection, and radiation in the basic HTS algorithm. However, the basic HTS algorithm considers only one of the modes of heat transfer for each generation. The multiple natural frequency constraints in truss optimization problems can improve the dynamic behavior of the structure and prevent undesirable vibrations. However, shape and size variables subjected to frequency constraints are difficult to handle due to the complexity of its feasible region, which is non-linear, non-convex, implicit, and often converging to the local optimal solution. The viability and effectiveness of the HTS and MHTS algorithms are investigated by six standard trusses problems. The solutions illustrate that the MHTS algorithm performs better than the HTS algorithm.

AB  - The influence of ambient temperature (295-730 K) and pulsed electric fields (0.5-80 kV/cm) on the electrical properties of high resistivity single-crystal 6H-SiC is reported. It is shown that the resistivity of the undoped 6H-SiC varies strongly, with the ambient temperature following a temperature/field function dominated by an exponential factor containing the activation (ionization) energy of residual boron of 0.35 eV. The dominant activation energy of semi-insulating Vanadium-compensated material (6H-SiC:V) varies with the ambient temperature, increasing from approx. 0 eV at 295-320 K to approx. 0.8 eV at T > 600 K.

AB  - With suitable thermophysical properties and commercial viability, molten chlorides are promising candidates to replace nitrate salts as heat transfer fluids (HTF) and thermal energy storage (TES) materials for next-generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Nevertheless, structural materials including steels and nickel-based alloys experience severe corrosion in molten chlorides. The explicit understanding of the corrosion mechanisms is therefore decisive in order to propose viable technical solutions to increase the durability of these materials. In this work, the corrosion behavior of ferritic-martensitic P91 steel and Inconel 600 nickel-based alloy is investigated in molten NaCI-KCI at 700 degrees C under Ar. The salt mixtures after exposure as well as the corroded samples were simultaneously characterized. The systematic metallographic study after the water-free preparation indicates that electrochemical processes play a major role in the overall corrosion mechanisms. In both P91 steel and Inconel 600, the formation of micro-galvanic pairs between Cr-rich phases (anodic sites) and the alloy matrix (cathode) leads to the selective dissolution of Cr from the alloys resulting in the formation of subsurface voids. The influence of O-2 and of various alloying elements on the corrosion kinetics is discussed. Based on the experimental observations, several corrosion mechanisms combining electrochemical reactions, solid-state diffusion and chloridation-oxidation processes have to be taken into account.

AB  - Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) is a frequent cause of mortality in freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the implementation of a family-based genetic selection program to improve disease resistance has been previously described. To quantify and understand the consequences of selection, three lines of outbred rainbow trout were created by divergent selection: ARS-Fp-R (resistant), ARS-Fp-C (control) and ARS-Fp-S (susceptible). Herein, results from both field and laboratory studies are described comparing survival of third-generation ARS-Fp-R line eggs/fish stocked at equal proportions to control and susceptible lines and reared together in a common environment. The survival of the pooled-line cohort was compared to the survival of an age-matched hatchery line, Fish Lake-DeSmet (FLDS) during early life-stage rearing. A typical BCWD outbreak occurred in the FLDS line while a more limited mortality event occurred in tanks containing the pooled lines. Mortalities from days 42-70 of the trial were saved for pedigree assignment and pathogen load measurement. After accounting for differences in early post-hatch survival, ARS-Fp-R line fish demonstrated two-fold lower BCWD-related mortality while ARS-Fp-S line fish demonstrated two-fold higher mortality; however, there was not a survival advantage of the ARS-Fp-R line fish over ARS-Fp-C line fish. At the end of the trial period, F. psychrophilum was not detected in spleen tissue of live-sampled ARS-Fp-R line fish while 10.3% of the ARS-Fp-C line and 36.4% of the ARS-Fp-S line fish exhibited detectable loads. Experimental challenge of the genetic lines with two different F. psychrophilum strains confirmed significantly higher survival of the ARS-Fp-R line fish as compared to either the ARS-Fp-S or FLDS genetic lines, albeit the susceptibility of the FLDS line was confounded by slower growth rate. These data demonstrate that three generations of artificial selection translated into improved survival following either natural or experimental exposure to F. psychrophilum. These data also suggest that hatchery lines, such as Fish Lake-DeSmet, may have higher relative susceptibility to BCWD thereby contributing to location outbreak severity.

AB  - An accelerator-driven thermal neutron facility for boron neutron capture therapy of skin melanoma is currently under construction at the Legnaro, National Laboratories, Italy. The installation relies on the production of neutrons from a thick beryllium target bombarded with 5 MeV protons. A complete set of double differential data, i.e. angle- and energy-differential neutron spectra produced by the beryllium target, is necessary for the Monte Carlo-based design of the installation. For this purpose, double differential fluence measurements are currently performed with the "BINS" neutron spectrometer using 5 MeV protons at the "CN" Van de Graaf accelerator. This spectrometer uses a superheated emulsion of dichlorotetrafluoroethane which is sequentially operated at 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 55 degrees C and thus provides a series of seven sharp thresholds covering the 0.1-10 MeV neutron energy interval. Deconvolution of the data is performed with the code "MAXED", which is based on the maximum entropy principle. The analysis of our first neutron spectrometry measurements at angles of 0 degrees, 40 degrees, 80 degrees and 120 degrees supports the viability of the BINS spectrometry method for the generation of the required double differential data.

AB  - Hotter is better is a hypothesis of thermal adaptation that posits that the rate-depressing effects of low temperature on biochemical reactions cannot be overcome by physiological plasticity or genetic adaptation. If so, then genotypes or populations adapted to warmer temperatures will have higher maximum growth rates than those adapted to low temperatures. Here we test hotter is better by measuring thermal reaction norms for intrinsic rate of population growth among an intraspecific collection of bacteriophages recently isolated from nature. Consistent with hotter is better, we find that phage genotypes with higher optimal temperatures have higher maximum growth rates. Unexpectedly, we also found that hotter is broader, meaning that the phages with the highest optimal temperatures also have the greatest temperature ranges. We found that the temperature sensitivity of fitness for phages is similar to that for insects.

AB  - Estrogens, such as the 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and the 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), have been regarded as a global threat to aquatic ecosystems due to their pseudo-persistence, their high estrogenic activity and their toxicity towards non-target species. Data regarding their ecotoxicological effects on marine calanoid copepods are very scarce. In this study, the calanoid copepod Acartia clausi was used as a model organism for estrogens exposure in marine pelagic ecosystems. Lethal effects of estrogens on A. clausi life-stages (Embryos, one day old nauplii: N1, three day old nauplii: N3, copepodites: C1-C3 and adults: C6) were investigated using 48 h acute tests. Copepods showed stage-specific responses against E2 and EE2 acute exposure. The most resistant life stage was N1 with LC50 values > 1500 mu g L-1 and >5000 mu g L-1, respectively for E2 and EE2. For N3, C1-C3, and C6, sensitivity to estrogens decreased with age and survival was affected at concentrations above those detected in the environment reflecting low estrogens acute toxicity for these life stages. In contrast, embryonic stage revealed high vulnerability to E2 and EE2 acute effects. Embryos showed non-monotonic dose-response and hatching success was significantly reduced at low realistic concentrations of E2 (0.005, 0.5, and 5 mu g L-1) and EE2 (0.05 and 5 mu g L-1). Survival, development and sex ratio of A. clausi to EE2 exposure at 1 and 100 mu g L-1 were also determined during a life cycle experiment. Fitness of the females of the generation F0 was evaluated by measuring lifespan, prosome length and egg production. The main observed effects were the decrease of females' prosome length, the feminization of the population and the reduction of the egg production for the generation F0 at 100 mu g L-1 of EE2. This concentration is above those reported in the environment indicating the tolerance of A. clausi to EE2 at environmentally relevant concentrations. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Imidacloprid-induced hormesis in the form of stimulated reproduction has previously been reported in green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. Changes in gene expression accompanying this hormetic response have not been previously investigated. In this study, expression of stress response (Hsp60), dispersal (OSD, TOL and ANT), and developmental (FPPS I) genes were examined for two generations during imidacloprid-induced reproductive stimulation in M. persicae. Global DNA methylation was also measured to test the hypothesis that changes in gene expression are heritable. At hormetic concentrations, down-regulation of Hsp60 was followed by up-regulation of this gene in the subsequent generation. Likewise, expression of dispersal-related genes and FPPS I varied with concentration, life stage, and generation. These results indicate that reproductive hormesis in M. persicae is accompanied by a complex transgenerational pattern of up-and down-regulation of genes that likely reflects trade-offs in gene expression and related physiological processes during the phenotypic dose-response. Moreover, DNA methylation in second generation M. persicae occurred at higher doses than in first-generation aphids, suggesting that heritable adaptability to low doses of the stressor might have occurred.

AB  - During the most recent years, among the different forms of renewable energy sources, biomass is playing an important role in the strategic agenda of European Community. Many countries, including Italy, have introduced important incentive schemes to support the use of biomass for electricity, heat and transportation. This has raised considerable interest towards the use of biomass for energy production. Nonetheless, the investment on biomass fuelled power plants presents several critical issues, such as choice of feedstock composition, economic viability with regard to plant size, access to locally available biomass and price of feedstock. This case study attempts at an evaluation of the economies originated by a small scale (<1 MWel) Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine coupled with a biomass fuelled boiler, fed by residual biomass from local cultivations, located in a rural area of a typical Mediterranean semi-arid environment in inland Sicily. A Geographical Information System (GIS) was used as a tool to assess the power plant economic viability with respect to local biomass availability and localization. Plant financial viability was evaluated for a number of different scenarios based on power plant size, number of yearly operational hours, feedstock mix and price. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Solar aided feedwater heating (SAFWH) appears to be a prospective option for using solar thermal energy in existing or new coal-fired thermal power plants. This article deals with the 4-E (namely energy, exergy, environment, and economic) analysis of solar thermal aided coal-fired power plants to establish their techno-economic viability. An operating coal-fired subcritical (SubC) and the first supercritical (SupC) power plant being commissioned in India are considered as reference power plants for SAFWH. The 4-E analysis is reported assuming operation of coal-fired power plants with SAFWH for 8 h/day in either fuel conservation or power boosting mode. An instantaneous reduction of about 14-19% in coal consumption is observed by substituting turbine bleed streams to all the feedwater heaters including deaerator with SAFWH in "fuel conservation mode". The substitution of turbine bleed stream to high pressure feedwater heater alone with SAFWH results in about 5-6% instantaneous improvement in coal consumption and additional power generation for the fuel conservation and power boosting modes, respectively compared with the same values in reference power plants. The annual savings in fuel cost alone correspond to Indian Rupee (INR) 73.5-74.5 millions. The performance of solar thermal aided coal-fired power plants is also measured in terms of energy and exergy performance index and it is observed that the utilization of solar energy for feedwater heating is more efficient based on exergy rather than energy. The environmental analysis shows that about 62,000 and 65,000 t of CO2 are reduced annually from 500 MWe SubC and 660 MWe SupC coal-fired power plants, respectively using the best possible SAFWH option. However, the cost/tonne of CO2 avoided is about 7775-8885 and 8395-9790 INR (similar to 200 USD) for solar thermal aided coal-fired SubC and SupC power plants, respectively far higher than the most mitigation measures under consideration today. Furthermore, SAFWH is found to be a not very cost effective measure based on the cost of saved fuel (coal). (C) 2010 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The egg size of a landlocked goby, Rhinogobius sp. (the orange form), in the Lake Biwa water system was compared between the fluvial-lacustrine and lacustrine types. The former spawned larger eggs than the latter in the laboratory under the same environmental conditions of water temperature and current. This difference in egg size was also found in the field among six local populations from tributary rivers and lake shore. These results suggested that egg size is largely associated with the life history type that has experienced a different selection regimen, such as the risk of larval starvation, associated with their respective life cycles.

AB  - This study investigated behavioural thermoregulation by subyearling fall (autumn) Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in a reservoir on the Snake River, Washington, U.S.A. During the summer, temperatures in the reservoir varied from 23 degrees C on the surface to 11 degrees C at 14 m depth. Subyearlings implanted with temperature-sensing radio transmitters were released at the surface at temperatures > 20 degrees C during three blocks of time in summer 2004. Vertical profiles were taken to measure temperature and depth use as the fish moved downstream over an average of 5.6-7.2 h and 6.0-13.8 km. The majority of the subyearlings maintained average body temperatures that differed from average vertical profile temperatures during most of the time they were tracked. The mean proportion of the time subyearlings tracked within the 16-20 degrees C temperature range was larger than the proportion of time this range was available, which confirmed temperature selection opposed to random use. The subyearlings selected a depth and temperature combination that allowed them to increase their exposure to temperatures of 16-20 degrees C when temperatures < 16 and > 20 degrees C were available at lower and higher positions in the water column. A portion of the subyearlings that selected a temperature c. 17.0 degrees C during the day, moved into warmer water at night coincident with an increase in downstream movement rate. Though subyearlings used temperatures outside of the 16-20 degrees C range part of the time, behavioural thermoregulation probably reduced the effects of intermittent exposure to suboptimal temperatures. By doing so, it might enhance growth opportunity and life-history diversity in the population of subyearlings studied.

AB  - Gene flow has the potential to both constrain and facilitate adaptation to local environmental conditions. The early stages of population divergence can be unstable because of fluctuating levels of gene flow. Investigating temporal variation in gene flow during the initial stages of population divergence can therefore provide insights to the role of gene flow in adaptive evolution. Since the recent colonization of Lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Norway by European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), local populations have been established in over 20 tributaries. Multiple founder events appear to have resulted in reduced neutral variation. Nevertheless, there is evidence for local adaptation in early life-history traits to different temperature regimes. In this study, microsatellite data from almost a decade of sampling were assessed to infer population structuring and its temporal stability. Several alternative analyses indicated that spatial variation explained 2-3 times more of the divergence in the system than temporal variation. Over all samples and years, there was a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance. However, decomposed pairwise regression analysis revealed differing patterns of genetic structure among local populations and indicated that migration outweighs genetic drift in the majority of populations. In addition, isolation by distance was observable in only three of the six years, and signals of population bottlenecks were observed in the majority of samples. Combined, the results suggest that habitat-specific adaptation in this system has preceded the development of consistent population substructuring in the face of high levels of gene flow from divergent environments.

AB  - Solar energy is becoming a promising source of heat and power for electrical generation and desalination plants. In this work, an integrated study of modeling, optimization, and experimental work is undertaken for a parabolic trough concentrator combined with a humidification and dehumidification desalination unit. The objective is to study the design performance and economic feasibility of a solar-driven desalination system. The design involves the circulation of a closed loop of synthetic blend motor oil in the concentrators and the desalination unit heat input section. The air circulation in the humidification and dehumidification unit operates in a closed loop, where the circulating water runs during the daytime and requires only makeup feed water to maintain the humidifier water level. Energy losses are reduced by minimizing the waste of treated streams. The process is environmentally friendly, since no significant chemical treatment is required. Design, construction, and operation are performed, and the system is analyzed at different circulating oil and air flow rates to obtain the optimum operating conditions. A case study in Saudi Arabia is carried out. The study reveals unit capability of producing 24.31 kg/day at a circulating air rate of 0.0631 kg/s and oil circulation rate of 0.0983 kg/s. The tradeoff between productivity, gain output ratio, and production cost revealed a unit cost of 12.54 US$/m(3). The impact of the circulating water temperature has been tracked and shown to positively influence the process productivity. At a high productivity rate, the humidifier efficiency was found to be 69.1%, and the thermal efficiency was determined to be 82.94%. The efficiency of the parabolic trough collectors improved with the closed loop oil circulation, and the highest performance was achieved from noon until 14:00 p.m.

AB  - Environmental problems in urban areas cause a decline in life quality. It is well-known that working in a place where people feel peaceful and comfortable affects productivity positively. Urban green areas and plantation ecosystems have great importance for more healthy generations. The city of Erzurum is located at 1850-2000 m altitude on a dish-like topography. The number and diversity of plant species are limited because of the great difference between day-time and night temperatures as a typical characteristic of the continental climate. The main goal of this study was to assess commonly used Pinus sylvestris (L.) plantations with different densities and ages on urban thermal comfort. This study was carried at four different Pinus sylvestris (L.) plantations established on the same altitude during July, August and September 2016. The measurements were taken between 12:00-14:00 h, at which the air temperature is at its maximum, as an average of at least six different measurement points at each plantation site. The results indicated that air temperature was lower at least 3.4-5.2 degrees C in different plantation sites as compared to that of the city. The effects of Pinus sylvestris (L.) plantations on thermal comfort were evaluated based upon differences in plant ages and plantation spaces. Suggestions on more livable urban design and planning for thermal comfort were also offered for city planners.

AB  - To improve the production of d-lactic acid, atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) was used to generate mutations in Sporolactobacillus sp. Y2-8. An efficient mutant YBS1-5 was rapidly isolated by implanting ARTP twice with a 100W radio-frequency power input, 10 standard liters per minute of the helium flow, and a 2mm treatment distance. Significant improvement of d-lactic acid productivity (1.39gL(-1)H(-1)) by YBS1-5 was achieved, and it was 41.84% higher than the productivity (0.98gL(-1)H(-1)) of Y2-8. Moreover, the dry cell weight of YBS1-5 was 16.7% higher than that of Y2-8. Metabolic activities of concerned substrates related with key enzymes of d-lactic acid fermentation were analyzed by Biolog approach. Results showed that the activities of the key enzymes glucokinase and d-lactate dehydrogenase in mutant YBS1-5 were increased by approximately 45% and 66%, respectively, in comparison with those of the strain Y2-8. Fed-batch fermentation further improved the productivity; 127gL(-1) d-lactic acid in 74H by YBS1-5 with higher productivity (1.72gL(-1)H(-1)) was achieved. The subculture experiments indicated that YBS1-5 was genetically stable after eight generations. (C) 2014 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - The maintenance of males and outcrossing is widespread, despite considerable costs of males. By enabling recombination between distinct genotypes, outcrossing may be advantageous during adaptation to novel environments and if so, it should be selected for under environmental challenge. However, a given environmental change may influence fitness of male, female, and hermaphrodite or asexual individuals differently, and hence the relationship between reproductive system and dynamics of adaptation to novel conditions may not be driven solely by the level of outcrossing and recombination. This has important implications for studies investigating the evolution of reproductive modes in the context of environmental changes, and for the extent to which their findings can be generalized. Here, we use Caenorhabditis elegans-a free-living nematode species in which hermaphrodites (capable of selfing but not cross-fertilizing each other) coexist with males (capable of fertilizing hermaphrodites)-to investigate the response of wild type as well as obligatorily outcrossing and obligatorily selfing lines to stressfully increased ambient temperature. We found that thermal stress affects fitness of outcrossers much more drastically than that of selfers. This shows that apart from the potential for recombination, the selective pressures imposed by the same environmental change can differ between populations expressing different reproductive systems and affect their adaptive potential.

AB  - Marine phytoplankton may adapt to ocean change, such as acidification or warming, because of their large population sizes and short generation times. Long-term adaptation to novel environments is a dynamic process, and phenotypic change can take place thousands of generations after exposure to novel conditions. We conducted a long-term evolution experiment (4 years = 2100 generations), starting with a single clone of the abundant and widespread coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi exposed to three different CO2 levels simulating ocean acidification (OA). Growth rates as a proxy for Darwinian fitness increased only moderately under both levels of OA [+3.4% and +4.8%, respectively, at 1100 and 2200 matm partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2)] relative to control treatments (ambient CO2, 400 matm). Long-term adaptation to OA was complex, and initial phenotypic responses of ecologically important traits were later reverted. The biogeochemically important trait of calcification, in particular, that had initially been restored within the first year of evolution was later reduced to levels lower than the performance of nonadapted populations under OA. Calcification was not constitutively lost but returned to control treatment levels when high CO2-adapted isolates were transferred back to present-day control CO2 conditions. Selection under elevated CO2 exacerbated a general decrease of cell sizes under long-term laboratory evolution. Our results show that phytoplankton may evolve complex phenotypic plasticity that can affect biogeochemically important traits, such as calcification. Adaptive evolution may play out over longer time scales (>1 year) in an unforeseen way under future ocean conditions that cannot be predicted from initial adaptation responses.

AB  - The restructuration of electric power sector has renovated the power system operational planning. In the deregulated market, electricity is treated as an entity unlike in the traditional vertically integrated market model where it is treated as a service provided by the generation companies (GENCOs). The task of GENCO is to perform self-scheduling of available units so as to achieve maximum profit in restructured power sector. Therefore, the problem of profit based unit commitment (PBUC) in deregulated markets can be formulated as a commitment and generation allocation through self-scheduling procedure. The commitment schedule optimization, i.e whether the status of a thermal unit is to be changed to on or off state, is a binary problem. Thus, the PBUC problem requires binary optimization for commitment and real valued optimization for generation allocation. In this paper, three binary grey wolf optimizer (BGWO) models are presented to solve the profit based self-scheduling problem of GENCO. The BGWO models proposed in this paper differ with respect to the transformation function used to map real valued wolf position into a binary variable. The binary mapping of commitment status is carried out using sigmoid and tangent hyperbolic transfer functions. Also, in the sigmoidal transfer function, two binary transformation procedures, namely crossover and conventional sigmoidal transfer function, are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed models in improving the solution quality of PBUC problem is examined using two test systems, a 3 unit and a 10 unit test system. In addition, two cases of GENCO market participation with and without reserve market participation are simulated. In the test case with reserve market participation, two commonly used reserve payment models are examined. Simulation results are presented and compared to existing approaches that have been used to solve the PBUC problem. The simulation results and statistical analysis demonstrate the improved solution quality (profit or fitness value) of the PBUC problem and statistical significance of the BGWO models with respect to solution quality obtained as compared to other established meta-heuristic approaches.

AB  - The developmental thresholds for Marmara gulosa Guillen & Davis (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) were investigated in the laboratory by using 17, 21, 25, 29, and 33 degrees C. The lowest mortality occurred in cohorts exposed to 25 and 29 degrees C. Other temperatures caused > 10% mortality primarily in egg and first and second instar sap-feeding larvae. Linear regression analysis approximated the lower developmental threshold at 12.2 degrees C. High mortality and slow developmental rate at 33 degrees C indicate the upper developmental threshold is near this temperature. The degree-day (DD) model indicated that a generation requires an accumulation of 322 DD for development from egg to adult emergence. Average daily temperatures in the San Joaquin Valley could produce up to seven generations of M. gulosa per year. Field studies documented two, five, and three overlapping generations of M. gulosa in walnuts (Juglans regia L.; Juglandaceae), pummelos (Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr.; Rutaceae), and oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck; Rutaceae), for a total of seven observed peelminer generations. Degree-day units between generations averaged 375 DD for larvae infesting walnut twigs; however, availability of green wood probably affected timing of infestations. Degree-day units between larval generations averaged 322 for pummelos and 309 for oranges, confirming the laboratory estimation. First infestation of citrus occurred in June in pummelo fruit and August in orange fruit when fruit neared 60 mm in diameter. Fruit size and degree-day units could be used as management tools to more precisely time insecticide treatments to target the egg stage and prevent rind damage to citrus. Degree-day units also could be used to more precisely time natural enemy releases to target larval instars that are preferred for oviposition.

AB  - Global warming poses new challenges for insects to adapt to higher temperatures. Trehalose is the main blood sugar in insects and plays an important role in energy metabolism and stress resistance. The transmembrane transport of trehalose mainly depends on the trehalose transporter (TRET1). Plutella xylostella (L.) is a worldwide agricultural pest; however, the effects of the trehalose transport mechanism and trehalose distribution in tissues on the development, reproduction and temperature adaptation of P. xylostella have yet to be reported. In this study, PxTret1-like was cloned and analyzed regarding its expression pattern. It was found that the expression of PxTret1-like was affected by ambient temperature. The knockout mutation of PxTret1-like was generated using a CRISPR/Cas9 system by targeted knockout. The trehalose content and trehalase activity of mutant P. xylostella increased at different developmental stages. The trehalose content increased in the fat body of the fourth-instar P. xylostella, and decreased in the hemolymph, and there was no significant change in glucose in the fat body and hemolymph. Mutant strains of P. xylostella showed a significantly reduced survival rate, fecundity and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. The results showed that PxTret1-like could affect the development, reproduction and temperature adaptability of P. xylostella by regulating the trehalose content in the fat body and hemolymph.

AB  - Scale-up criteria of laser ablation in the liquid phase with nanosecond pulses is studied for efficient generation of pure ceramic nanoparticles in an aqueous environment. Besides high laser fluence and low height of the applied liquid layer, specific pulse overlap and defined laser repetition rate are required for significant enhancement in nanoparticle productivity. The ablation rate increases by 350% by reducing the liquid film from 8 mm to 2.5 mm owing to reduced absorption and scattering of the incident laser beam by previously ablated nanoparticles. The controlled interpulse distance yields a further increase in material removal rate by another 300% compared to machining in the pulse overlap mode. The residual cavitation bubble from the previous laser pulse and the dispersed nanoparticle interaction with the following laser pulse and optimized temperature gradient in the lattice of the target are assumed to alter productivity. This hypothesis is confirmed by varying the repetition rate with equal laser fluence and pulse overlap, which causes a drastic rise in nanoparticle productivity by a factor of 65. A maximum corundum nanoparticle productivity of 1.3 g/h with Feret particle size of 30 nm is gained by 18.5 W of focused laser power at 4 kHz of repetition rate, providing 125 mu m interpulse distance and liquid flow.

AB  - We compared selected thermal indices in their ability to predict heat-related mortality in Prague, Czech Republic, during the extraordinary summer 2015. Relatively, novel thermal indicesUniversal Thermal Climate Index and Excess Heat Factor (EHF)were compared with more traditional ones (apparent temperature, simplified wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), and physiologically equivalent temperature). The relationships between thermal indices and all-cause relative mortality deviations from the baseline (excess mortality) were estimated by generalized additive models for the extended summer season (May-September) during 1994-2014. The resulting models were applied to predict excess mortality in 2015 based on observed meteorology, and the mortality estimates by different indices were compared. Although all predictors showed a clear association between thermal conditions and excess mortality, we found important variability in their performance. The EHF formula performed best in estimating the intensity of heat waves and magnitude of heat-impacts on excess mortality on the most extreme days. Afternoon WBGT, on the other hand, was most precise in the selection of heat-alert days during the extended summer season, mainly due to a relatively small number of false alerts compared to other predictors. Since the main purpose of heat warning systems is identification of days with an increased risk of heat-related death rather than prediction of exact magnitude of the excess mortality, WBGT seemed to be a slightly favorable predictor for such a system.

AB  - Exposure to extreme temperatures is increasingly likely to impose strong selection on many organisms in their natural environments. The ability of organisms to adapt to such selective pressures will be determined by patterns of genetic variation and covariation. Despite increasing interest in thermal adaptation, few studies have examined the extent to which the genetic covariance between traits might constrain thermal responses. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether sex-specific genetic architectures will constrain responses to climatic selection. We used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to examine whether sex-specific genetic architectures and genetic covariances between traits might constrain evolutionary responses to warming climates in a population of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest that the sexes share a common genetic underpinning for heat tolerance as indicated by a strong positive inter-sexual genetic correlation. Further, we found no evidence in either of the sexes that genetic trade-offs between heat tolerance and fitness will constrain responses to thermal selection. Our results suggest that neither trade-offs, nor sex-specific genetics, will significantly constrain an evolutionary response to climatic warming, at least in this population of D.similar to melanogaster.

AB  - An effective method for the synthesis of photochromic diarylethenes through the generation of heteroaryllithiums and subsequent reaction with octafluorocyclopentene has been developed by using integrated flow microreactor systems. Reactions can be conducted without using cryogenic conditions by virtue of effective temperature and residence time control, although much lower temperatures (<-78?degrees C) are needed for batch macroreactions. Moreover, the synthesis of unsymmetrical diarylethenes, which is difficult to achieve when using conventional batch macrosystems, has been accomplished based on the selective introduction of one aryl group to give arylheptafluorocyclopentene followed by the introduction of another aryl group. The productivity of the laboratory-scale system is approximately 0.5 mmol?min-1. Therefore, the present integrated flow microreactor method serves as a practical way of synthesizing various photochromic diarylethene derivatives.

AB  - Natural and sexual selection are classically thought to oppose one another, and although there is evidence for this, direct experimental demonstrations of this antagonism are largely lacking. Here, we assessed the effects of sexual and natural selection on the evolution of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), a character subject to both modes of selection, in Drosophila simulans. Natural selection and sexual selection were manipulated in a fully factorial design, and after 27 generations of experimental evolution, the responses of male and female CHCs were assessed. The effects of natural and sexual selection differed greatly across the sexes. The responses of female CHCs were generally small, but CHCs evolved predominantly in the direction of natural selection. For males, profiles evolved via sexual and natural selection, as well as through the interaction between the two, with some male CHC components only evolving in the direction of natural selection when sexual selection was relaxed. These results indicate sex-specific responses to selection, and that sexual and natural selection act antagonistically for at least some combinations of CHCs.

AB  - In some insects, the finding of oviposition substrate triggers the uptake into oocytes of yolk proteins that are stored in the fat body during post-embryonic development. The main host of the bean weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus (Coleoptera; Chrysomelidae; Bruchinae; Amblycerini), in which larval resources are the sole source for future egg maturation, is Phaseolus vulgaris. Despite not feeding as adults, females of this species are able to lay eggs after encountering host seeds but it is not known how females react to changes in the availability of bean seeds. In the present study, the behaviour of Z. subfasciatus facing two very different environments for oviposition is investigated, as well as how this influences offspring fitness. The results obtained show that females of Z. subfasciatus react to variations in the availability of seeds belonging to the same host species by adjusting egg size and number. Females on low bean seed density lay larger and fewer eggs than those on high bean seed density, demonstrating a trade-off between these reproductive traits. Moreover, females can adjust egg size to changing levels of host availability during the first 4 days of their oviposition period. Although no difference in offspring weight is found, those from small eggs (low competition environment) result in larger adults. No response to selection on these traits after rearing beetles on the same host for 40 generations is observed. This unresponsiveness may indicate that beetle populations behave according to their reaction norm that already allows rapid adaptation to a varying amount of host-seed availability and better exploitation of the environments of this widespread stored-seed pest.

AB  - In this paper the fmancial viability of a novel storage concept, referred to as 'integrated pumped-heat-electricity storage', is assessed for both a coal-fired and a combined cycle (CC) power plant located in Germany, as well as for a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant located in Spain. The rationale of this concept is to use electricity during times of cheap wholesale market prices, e.g. stemming from a high supply of renewable energies, in order to generate thermal energy via a heat pump, since thermal energy can be stored at comparatively low cost. If the electricity demand rises again, the stored thermal energy is used to power a conventional water-steam cycle, thereby reducing the amount of fossil fuels used or enlarging the operating time of a CSP plant. A mixed integer linear program, considering the day-ahead wholesale market electricity prices and remunerations of offering tertiary control power in Germany, is employed to fmd an approximation of the optimal schedule for the generation in the power plant as well as for the purchase and the sale of electricity. The fmancial viability is assessed using net present value (NPV) and real options analysis. Storing electricity to profit from temporal arbitrage is found to be unprofitable, since the (conservatively estimated) costs of thermal storage units are still too high. The largest part of the revenues stems from the remunerations of offering tertiary control power. Therefore, while the utilization of heat pumps, which are estimated to have rather high costs, is not profitable, employing electric heaters without storage units is found to be economically viable for a coalfired and a CC power plant in Germany. Here, NPV and real options analysis yield the same result, i.e. to invest immediately in such an application. In Spain, offering tertiary control power is presently not remunerated, but only the call-offs of tertiary control energy, which are not considered in the mixed integer linear program. Consequently, employing electric heaters in CSP plants in Spain is found to be not financially viable either. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Onshore wind electricity generation is key to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Poorly sited wind farms degrade high carbon soils and habitats, diminishing overall emission reductions. We explore the viability of the Scottish Government's renewable energy plan with respect to land use, natural capital and low carbon storage. With avoidance of sensitive peatlands a main consideration, six constraining factors were combined to determine areas of least habitat and soil sensitivity to onshore wind development in Scotland. Currently, 14 out of 21 terrestrial habitats have been impacted by installation of 389 onshore wind sites. Accounting for 73% of the total area, Coniferous Woodland, Acid Grassland, Bog, and Heather Grassland have been the largest habitats impacted. The most common soils of the least sensitive areas available for installation are brown earth and podzols, and construction of new wind farms on environmentally sensitive areas can be minimised by targeting relatively disturbed habitats such as improved grasslands. Scotland has a potential of 2.75 Mha of relatively low sensitive land, the largest areas sited in the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway and Aberdeenshire. Additional to current installed capacity (13.9 GW), Scotland would require 6.6 GW of installed onshore wind capacity to function without nuclear energy generation and 464 GWh additional storage capacity (provided by 8.2 GW wind capacity). This equates to an installed and additional total of 346.676 ha required for wind electricity generation, potentially satisfied by shared land use with 23% of Scottish improved grasslands. Scotland has the available land area to achieve the Scottish Government's policy to move towards carbon-neutral, nuclear-free electricity generation through the use of renewables alone. Questions remain on which source of low carbon dispatchable (immediately accessible) energy to use in the case of a several day wind lull. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gene expression changes have been recognized as important drivers of adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Little is known about the relative roles of plastic and evolutionary responses in complex gene expression networks during the early stages of divergence. Large gene expression data sets coupled with in silico methods for identifying coexpressed modules now enable systems genetics approaches also in nonmodel species for better understanding of gene expression responses during early divergence. Here, we combined gene coexpression analyses with population genetics to separate plastic and population (evolutionary) effects in expression networks using small salmonid populations as a model system. We show that plastic and population effects were highly variable among the six identified modules and that the plastic effects explained larger proportion of the total eigengene expression than population effects. A more detailed analysis of the population effects using a Q(ST)-F-ST comparison across 16,622 annotated transcripts revealed that gene expression followed neutral expectations within modules and at the global level. Furthermore, two modules showed enrichment for genes coding for early developmental traits that have been previously identified as important phenotypic traits in thermal responses in the same model system indicating that coexpression analysis can capture expression patterns underlying ecologically important traits. We suggest that module-specific responses may facilitate the flexible tuning of expression levels to local thermal conditions. Overall, our study indicates that plasticity and neutral evolution are the main drivers of gene expression variance in the early stages of thermal adaptation in this system.

AB  - One of the major questions in ecology and evolutionary biology is how variation in the genome enables species to adapt to divergent environments. Here, we study footprints of thermal selection in candidate genes in six wild populations of the afrotropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana sampled along a c. 3000 km latitudinal cline. We sequenced coding regions of 31 selected genes with known functions in metabolism, pigment production, development and heat shock responses. These include genes for which we expect a priori a role in thermal adaptation and, thus, varying selection pressures along a latitudinal cline, and genes we do not expect to vary clinally and can be used as controls. We identified amino acid substitution polymorphisms in 13 genes and tested these for clinal variation by correlation analysis of allele frequencies with latitude. In addition, we used two FST-based outlier methods to identify loci with higher population differentiation than expected under neutral evolution, while accounting for potentially confounding effects of population structure and demographic history. Two metabolic enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, UGP and Treh, showed clinal variation. The same loci showed elevated population differentiation and were identified as significant outliers. We found no evidence of clines in the pigmentation genes, heat shock proteins and developmental genes. However, we identified outlier loci in more localized parts of the range in the pigmentation genes yellow and black. We discuss that the observed clinal variation and elevated population divergence in UGP and Treh may reflect adaptation to a geographic thermal gradient.

AB  - Experiments were undertaken to study the combined effects of environmental (prey concentration and photoperiod) and genetic (parental spawning season) factors on growth and survival of herring larvae. During the experimental period, constant prey concentrations were maintained at one of the two nominal levels, under either a spring or an autumn light regime. Eggs of one autumn-spawning North Sea Buchan female herring were fertilized either with cryopreserved sperm from three Norwegian spring-spawning males or with fresh sperm from three Buchan males. Larvae of the two groups (the hybrids marked with alizarin) were mixed in replicated treatment tanks, thus ensuring identical environmental conditions. Mean larval growth rates were mostly influenced by food availability, but the hybrids grew significantly faster than the pure autumn-spawned offspring. In addition, the hybrids experienced a survival advantage at low prey concentrations. Hybrid survival was also somewhat better at high prey concentrations under a spring photoperiod than the corresponding group under an autumn photoperiod, suggesting a possible genetic adaptation to seasonal light conditions. The experiment documents the viability beyond first-feeding of offspring from parents with different spawning periods. The results are discussed in relation to herring metapopulation structure.

AB  - In the present paper the thermodynamic analysis of a cement plant located in Barak Valley has been carried out. The analysis can be used as a precursor to achieve the basic objectives of any cement plant i.e. minimizing energy consumptions, minimizing the cost of production, and maximizing plant productivity. A simple model has been developed on the basis of mass and energy balance and has been applied to BVCL. The various performance parameters of the different components have been evaluated by making use of data collected over a year and First law efficiency of kiln system has been estimated. A heat recovery steam power plant has been proposed for the generation of electricity, which utilizes the waste heat of this plant. The capacity of the steam power plant has been estimated.

AB  - The transmission of detrimental mutations in animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the next generation is avoided by a high level of mtDNA content in mature oocytes. Thus, this maternal genetic material has the potential to mediate adaptive maternal effects if mothers change mtDNA level in oocytes in response to their environment or body condition. Here, we show that increased mtDNA abundance in mature oocytes was associated with fast somatic growth during early development but at the cost of increased mortality in three-spined sticklebacks. We also examined whether oocyte mtDNA and sperm DNA damage levels have interacting effects because they can determine the integrity of mitochondrial and nuclear genes in offspring. The level of oxidative DNA damage in sperm negatively affected fertility, but there was no interacting effect of oocyte mtDNA abundance and sperm DNA damage. Oocyte mtDNA level increased towards the end of the breeding season, and the females exposed to warmer temperatures during winter produced eggs with increased mtDNA copies. Our results suggest that oocyte mtDNA level can vary according to the expected energy demands for offspring during embryogenesis and early growth. Thus, mothers can affect offspring development and viability through the context-dependent effects of oocyte mtDNA abundance.

AB  - Temperature is an important determinant affecting the capacity of disease vectors like mosquitoes (Culicidae) to transmit disease agents. Although the impact of temperature on vector-borne disease dynamics has been studied intensively, the actual temperature encountered by the vector in a heterogeneous landscape is rarely taken into account. If disease vectors have temperature preferences and therefore select specific microhabitats, this would substantially influence key life history traits that determine transmission intensity. The thermal preferences of subtropical Aedes aegypti and temperate Ae. japonicus mosquitoes were investigated in a temperature gradient setup consisting of a Plexiglas box on top of an aluminium plate on two thermal regulators. Blood-fed (one day after feeding) and unfed (non-blood-fed) mosquitoes were released in small (15-20 degrees C, 20-25 degrees C, 25-30 degrees C) and large (15-30 degrees C, 30-45 degrees C) temperature gradients to assess their thermal preferences after 15 min. Additionally, the effect of humidity was investigated in a two-choice chamber setup. Both mosquito species avoided higher temperatures, pronouncedly dangerously high temperatures in the 30-45 degrees C gradient. At lower temperatures, blood-fed mosquitoes preferred the cooler sides of the 20-25 degrees C and 25-30 degrees C gradient, which were all below their rearing temperature. In the lowest gradient of 15-20 degrees C, no preferences were found. The thermal preference of unfed mosquitoes was similar to that of the blood-fed mosquitoes. No humidity preference or effect of humidity on temperature preferences was observed within the tested range (40-90%). The set-up allows for assessing the thermal preference of mosquitoes under controlled conditions. The observed preference of mosquitoes for cooler temperatures would increase their longevity and slow down pathogen development. If similar micmhabitat selection is observed in the field, vector borne disease models should be adjusted accordingly.

AB  - This paper is devoted to assess the possibility of using a hybrid wind/PV system for water pumping in Iraq. A hybrid wind/photovoltaic system was analyzed based on available wind speed records and annual solar radiation in Baghdad terminals, Iraq, as a case study. A small-scale hybrid wind/PV system is considered and modeled with an adapted to reveal the daily water discharge in terms of the operating conditions. To do so, a computer code written in MATLAB was built to simulate the performance of the proposed system. The system was tested on May 21, 2017, in Baghdad (33 degrees 33 ' N 44 degrees 44E). Effect of critical performance parameters such as well depth, ambient temperature, solar radiation intensity and wind turbine rotor configuration was reflected on productivity of the considered system.

AB  - In the field of Laser Additive Manufacturing, modern wire-based laser deposition techniques offer advantageous solutions for combining the high quality level of layer-by-layer fabrication of high value parts with the industry's economical requirements regarding productivity and energy efficiency. A newly developed coaxial wire head allows for omni-directional welding operation and, thus, the use of wire even for complex surface claddings as well as the generation of three-dimensional structures. Currently, several metallic alloys as steel, titanium, aluminium, and nickel are available for the generation of defect-free structures. Even cored wires containing carbide hardmetals can be used for the production of extra wear-resistant parts. Simultaneous heating of the wire using efficient electric energy increases significantly the deposition rate and energy efficiency. Examples of application are light-weight automotive parts, turbine blades of Nickel super alloys, and complex inserts of injection moulds.

AB  - The purpose of the research activities at the Skierniewice geothermal test site is to develop and apply an exploration methodology for low-enthalpy systems in sedimentary formations. Work included seismic and magnetotelluric surveys carried out close to well Kompina-2 to create a detailed structural-geologic model and characterize the anisotropic fracture system around the borehole. The study included the reprocessing of archival data from selected boreholes and 2D seismic lines. The collected data were used to identify formations with high fracture permeability and the presumed flow path of geothermal (similar to 110 degrees C) brine in high productivity zones, and determining rock porosities and salinity distribution in the subsurface. The next stage of the investigations will focus on siting a second borehole and studying the possibility of installing a plant for electrical generation or direct geothermal heat applications.

AB  - Question: Does pond permanency affect life-history traits of endemic anurans from Patagonia?
   Background: Amphibians inhabiting North Patagonia breed at ponds that differ strongly in their water permanency. The role of phenotypic plasticity in adapting to variable environments could be fundamental in these Patagonian anurans.
   Prediction: In comparisons between populations and between species, we predicted that size at metamorphosis and developmental time of three endemic anurans from Patagonia are adaptive traits when these species are exposed to the selective pressure of pond drying.
   Organisms: Pleurodema thaul, Pleurodema bufoninum, and Rhinella spinulosa, the most common species of amphibians in North Patagonia, breed and develop in a gradient of environmental scenarios that include ponds with highly heterogeneous hydroperiods.
   Methods: We recorded age and size at metamorphosis of larvae and metamorphs in 15 natural ponds. To analyse the effect of hydroperiod on these traits, we performed common garden experiments by simulating two different water volumes (decreasing vs. constant).
   Results and conclusion: The anurans responded to the selective pressure of drying environments by reducing size and time to metamorphosis. These responses were also evident in laboratory experiments. Wetlands with shorter hydroperiods resulted in shorter larval periods and smaller metamorphs. Rhinella spinulosa developed faster in the decreasing water treatment, but its metamorphs did not differ in size between treatments. The two Pleurodema species also developed faster in the decreasing water treatment, and metamorphs reached smaller sizes in the decreasing water treatment. Pleurodema species showed strong evidence of adaptive significance of these traits based on comparisons between populations.

AB  - The construction of the Snowy Mountain Hydro Scheme 1949 - 1974, has resulted in large inter-basin water transfer from the Snowy River to the Murray-Darling Basin, profoundly altering the biophysical condition of the river and its associated estuary and wetlands. The decline in health of the Snowy River system has led to the trial use of environmental water to improve river health. It is only by understanding outcomes of environmental flows, over the entirety of the system, that benefits of the watering scheme may be maximised. An extensive physical monitoring program of the entire estuary system was undertaken. This was coupled with the development of a detailed 3D hydrodynamic model capable of predicting effects of flow on selected water parameters (salinity, temperature and level) in the Snowy River estuary. The monitoring information was used to extend the calibration of the model to a wide range of flow, temperature and salinity conditions so that the model may be used to better determine outcomes of environmental flows on selected biota which use the estuary, either permanently or temporarily. As part of the project, the model was used to determine if suitable water parameters (salinity and temperature) exist within the Snowy River estuary to allow spawning of Australian bass Macquaria novemaculeata, a catadromous native fish species. This information aided the development and implementation of the ecological monitoring part of the project. The ecological monitoring aspect on Australian bass was due to the species being comparatively common (within the catchment), having a life-history completed solely within the catchment (i.e. no known marine phase), a catadromous life-history influenced by flows, and due to it being an iconic target species for recreational anglers.

AB  - The expansion of the invasive mosquito Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) towards temperate regions in the Americas is causing concern because of its public health implications. As for other insects, the distribution limits of Ae. aegypti have been suggested to be related to minimum temperatures and to be controlled mainly by cold tolerance. The aim of this study was to assess the daily mortality of immature stages of Ae. aegypti under natural winter conditions in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in relation to preceding thermal conditions. The experiment was performed outdoors, and one cohort of larvae was started each week for 16 weeks, and reared up to the emergence of the adults. Three times a week, larvae, pupae and emerged adults were counted, and these data were used to calculate the daily mortality of larvae, pupae and adults and to analyze their relationship with thermal conditions. The results showed that mortality was generally low, with a few peaks of high mortality after cold front events. The mortality of pupae and larvae showed a higher correlation with the cooling degree hours of previous days than with the minimum, maximum or mean temperatures. Pupae and adults showed to be more vulnerable to low temperatures than larvae. A delay in mortality was observed in relation to the low temperature events, with a proportion of individuals dying in a later stage after the end of the cold front. These results suggest that thermal conditions during cold fronts in Buenos Aires are close to the tolerance limit of the local Ae. aegypti population. The wide range of responses of different individuals suggests that low winter temperatures may constitute a selective force, leading the population to a higher tolerance to low temperatures, which might favor the further expansion of this species towards colder regions.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is normally quantified as a reaction norm which details how trait expression changes across an environmental gradient. Sometime reaction norms are linear, but often reaction norms are assumed to be linear because plasticity is typically quantified as the difference in trait expression measured in two environments. This simplification limits how plastic responses vary between genotypes and may also bias the predictions of models investigating how plasticity influences a population's ability to adapt to a changing environment. Consequently, there is a pressing need to characterize the real shape of reaction norms and their genetic variability across ecologically relevant environmental gradients. To address this knowledge gap we measured the multi-trait plastic response of 7 Daphnia magna clones from the same population across a broad resource gradient. We used a Random Regression Mixed Model approach to characterize and quantify average and clone-specific responses to resource variation. Our results demonstrate that non-linear models outperformed a linear model for all 4 of the life-history traits we measured. The plastic reaction norms of all 4 traits were similar in shape and were often best described by a non-linear asymptotic model. Clonal variation in non-linear plastic responses was detectable for 3 out of the 4 traits that we measured although the nature and magnitude of variation across the resource gradient was trait-specific. We interpret our findings with respect to the impact that plasticity has on the evolutionary potential of a population in different resource environments.

AB  - A multi-generational model of gypsy moth phenology was developed from existing literature and used to assess the risk of establishment of this exotic pest across North America based on the suitability of 4457 locations in satisfying the temperature requirements for seasonal development. Approximately 595 million hectares of North America is estimated to be climatically suitable for gypsy moth establishment. Limits to the potential range exist in the southern United States because of limits to diapause development, and in northern Canada because of slower prediapause and larval development. A 1.5 degreesC increase in mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures, as might occur with global climate change, would result in a range expansion in the north, a range contraction in the south, and a net increase in range of approximately 16%. The model is described and the probable limitations to establishment are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cornops aquaticum (Brunei) is host specific on Eichhornia spp. and Pontederia spp. (Pontederiacae). Its present distribution ranges from Mexico to Argentina. The number of juvenile instars (5-7) apparently mirrors the photoperiod and temperature pulses of different climatical conditions in the respective geographical regions. Based on life-history data, three working hypotheses are proposed for forthcoming studies. These will test whether the varying number of juvenile instars represents a phenotypic plasticity of a single genotype or an adaptation that is genetically fixed, due to an evolutionary relationship of the host with its host-plant.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing techniques, such as RNA sequencing, have provided a wealth of genomic information for nonmodel species. Transcriptomic information can be used to quantify the patterns of gene expression, which can identify how environmental differences invoke organismal stress responses and provide a gauge in predicting species adaptability. In our study, we used RNA sequencing to characterize the first transcriptome from a naupliar tadpole shrimp (Triops newberryi) to identify the genes expressed during the early life history stages and which could be important for future genomic studies. RNA was extracted from naupliar T. newberryi that were reared in a laboratory-controlled setting and in two different water types, a native and a non-native condition. A total of six replicates, three per condition, were sequenced with the Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 achieving 365 M 50-nt reads. High-quality reads were produced and de novo assembly was used to construct a T. newberryi transcriptome that was approximately 24.8 M base pairs. More than 10 000 peptides were predicted from the assembly, and genes were sorted into gene ontology categories. The use of different water conditions allowed for a preliminary differential gene expression analysis in order to compare the changes in gene expression between conditions. There were 299 diff-erentially expressed genes between water conditions that might serve as a focal point for future genomic studies of Triops acclimation to different environments. The Triops transcriptome could serve as vital genomic information for additional studies on Branchiopod crustaceans.

AB  - Temperature adaptability was compared among three different races of ayu Plecoglossus altivelis at 205-220 days of age by recording changes in their tolerance temperatures after acclimation to various temperatures. These races were raised under the same conditions from hatching up to the performance of temperature-tolerance tests to make environment factors uniform. Tolerance temperatures of the fish changed depending on the acclimation temperature within the race and there were significant differences in the indices of temperature tolerance among he races. Average critical thermal maximum and minimum acclimated to 15-23degreesC and ranged from 29.7-32.2degreesC, 2.5-6.0degreesC in amphidromous form, 28.7-31.7degreesC, 2.3-5.3degreesC in landlocked form and 29.7-33.0degreesC, 1.7-5.0degreesC in Setogawa artificial landlocked form. The magnitude of thermal tolerance zones for each race calculated from the upper and lower incipient lethal temperatures against acclimation temperatures were 481degreesC(2), 415degreesC(2) and 517degreesC(2) respectively. These results suggested that a difference may exist in the temperature adaptability among the ayu races.

AB  - With the development of economy, pollutions of energy and environment have severely threatened the survival of human beings. Besides, the increasing population and disordered urban expansion also have aroused the deterioration of urban hardening and heat island effect. Therefore, effective ecological design strategies of landscape will become the key point to deal with the current situation. While microclimate, as one of the most significant elements to improve small-scale landscape, requires much more attention. Based on such thought, the thesis takes pains to analyze the different impacts on thermal comfort caused by soft landscape and hard landscape in urban architectural environment, and to put forward ecological design strategies of pavements in urban architectural landscape from the aspect of feasibility.

AB  - In the present study, we used a 3D Coupled Ecosystem Model of Baltic Sea version 1 (3D CEMBSv1) coupled with a copepod model to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of two representative copepod populations in the Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic Sea) including Acartia spp. and Pseudocalanus minutus elongatus. The annual cycles simulated for 2000 under realistic weather and hydrographic conditions were studied with the three-dimensional version of the coupled ecosystem-copepod model in the south-eastern Baltic Sea. The paper presents the comparison of simulated and observed copepod development at two stations in the Gulf of Gdansk. A validation of influential state variables gives confidence that the model is able to calculate reliably the stage development of dominant species in the southern Baltic Sea. The number of generations was one for P. m. elongatus and 3-5 for Acartia spp.. A mean of five generations for the latter species per year were estimated in the coastal region and ca. three generations at the Gdansk Deep (in the open sea). Food concentration and temperature as the main factors controlling the development of the investigated copepods as well as salinity as a masking factor (i.e. salinity modifies the rate of their development) in the case of Pseudocalanus minutus elongatus are included in the present study.

AB  - Crustacean zooplankton form the keystone link between primary producers and fish stocks along the Norwegian shelf and in the southern part of the Barents Sea. We have established a multi-generation cultivation system for zooplankton in order to perform future experiments on the biological effects of drilling discharges from the offshore petroleum industry. A population of the cold-water species, Calanus finmarchicus, was collected in March 2004 and maintained in a static system of 100 1 polypropylene containers through all stages (Eggs-CVI). The population exhibited an average developmental time of 105 days which corresponds to realistic sub-Arctic to Arctic conditions (water temperatures= 5 degrees C (spring) and 8 degrees C (late summer)). A series of experiments was performed to examine copepod egg production as a function of different food sources and feeding concentrations. Only minor differences in egg production were observed for C. finmarchicus females fed with varying concentrations of the two diatom species Chaetoceros socialis and Thalassiosira weisflogii. In a separate experiment, the response to food availability was examined over time by tracking egg production and fecal pellet production (used as an indicator of food ingestion). Both hatching success and food ingestion were positively correlated with the food concentrations offered to adult females. Through this work we have demonstrated that C finmarchicus populations can be maintained in the laboratory through multiple generations. In addition, methods to control egg production through changes in food availability have been established making it feasible to control the start date of exposure experiments or the timing of the collection of eggs to initiate a new generation.

AB  - In the current paper, the performance of a solar-based multi-generation system was experimentally investigated for one year. The system was composed of a photovoltaic section and a hybrid thermal and desalination section with a linear parabolic solar collector. Results indicate that besides entirely complies with the electricity, drinking water and hot water needs, utilization of the system for a nearly zero-energy park prevents 342 tons of CO2 net annual greenhouse gas emission. Furthermore, the performance of the linear parabolic solar collector was experimentally investigated and compared using both water and Al2O3-water nanofluid as the heat transfer fluids. Results show that using the nanofluid, a noticeable decrease (31%) in the total thermal loss coefficient led to a significant increase (70%) in the thermal efficiency of the system. Calculating the simple and equity paybacks, as well as the Internal Rate of Return, revealed the economic viability of the proposed multi-generation system. The capacity of the proposed system could be easily extended, and the pattern of the nearly zero-energy park in the current study could be applied in other urban areas to pursue a more sustainable future.

AB  - Metabolic functions are generally optimized within a narrow range of body temperatures (T(b)'s), conferring thermoregulation great importance to the survival and fitness of an animal. In lizards, T(b) regulation is mainly behavioral, and the metabolic costs associated with behavioral thermoregulation are primarily locomotory. In reptiles, however, it has been proposed that they thermoregulate less precisely when the associated costs, metabolic or otherwise, are high. Such a strategy enhances fitness by allowing lizards to be more flexible to changing environmental conditions while maximizing the benefits of maintaining a high T(b) and minimizing energy expenditure. We evaluated the behavioral thermoregulation of inland bearded dragons Pogona vitticeps under various thermal quality conditions requiring different locomotory investment for thermoregulation. The selected ambient temperature and preferred T(b) ranges increased at lower environmental thermal qualities, indicating a decrease in thermoregulatory precision in environments where the costs associated with thermoregulation were high. The level of thermoregulation was also affected, exhibiting a decrease in preferred T(b) of similar to 2 degrees C at the lowest-thermal-quality treatment. These data provide important implications for the procedural assessment of preferred T(b) and a better understanding of thermal set points in reptiles in general. Our results emphasize that the precise maintenance and assessment of preferred T(b) is contingent on the quality of the environment, laboratory or natural, that the animal inhabits.

AB  - Using the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) branching model of triggered seismicity, we apply the formalism of generating probability functions to calculate exactly the average difference between the magnitude of a mainshock and the magnitude of its largest aftershock over all generations. This average magnitude difference is found empirically to be independent of the mainshock magnitude and equal to 1.2, a universal behavior known as Bath's law. Our theory shows that Bath's law holds only sufficiently close to the critical regime of the ETAS branching process. Allowing for error bars +/- 0.1 for Bath's constant value around 1.2, our exact analytical treatment of Bath's law provides new constraints on the productivity exponent alpha and the branching ratio n: 0.9 less than or similar to alpha <= 1 and 0.8 less than or similar to n <= 1. We propose a method for measuring alpha based on the predicted renormalization of the Gutenberg-Richter distribution of the magnitudes of the largest aftershock. We also introduce the "second Bath law for foreshocks:" the probability that a main earthquake turns out to be the foreshock does not depend on its magnitude rho.

AB  - This paper investigated the potential and economic validity of wind and solar energy at 17 selected locations in the Red Sea state, Sudan, for the first time. To this aim, the NASA database was utilized. The results demonstrated that vertical axis wind turbines would be a good solution for electricity generation for building in the selected locations. Additionally, it is found that the chosen areas are suitable for installing photovoltaic (PV) systems due to the high-value solar radiation. Moreover, the economic viability of small-scale wind and PV systems for rooftop buildings in the selected regions is investigated. For a financial analysis of wind turbines, the performance of different characteristics of vertical axis winds was evaluated based on the determination of capacity factor and energy production cost. For the economic validity of installing PV systems, RETScreen Expert software was used. The results indicate that the annual production energy from wind turbines and solar power is within the range of 158.50-29,063.93kWh and 6648-15,533 kWh, respectively. This amount of energy output would reduce the effect of global warming and enhance the sustainable technological development of the country. Moreover, the results indicate that model#9 (Vertical Axis Wind Generator-V) with a capacity of 5 kW has the lowest cost value (0.08703-0.01025 $/kWh) compared to the other selected turbines for the studied locations. Besides, the average energy production cost is within the range of 0.036-0.049 $/kWh for PV systems. In the end, it is concluded that using small-scale renewable energy systems will help reduce the electricity bills and the dependency on fossil fuels, the effect of global warming, and enhance the country's sustainable technological development.

AB  - The supercooling point (SCP) and lower lethal temperature (LLT50) of male adult Diamesa mendotae Muttkowski (Diptera: Chironomidae) were determined from field-collected individuals. SCP determined using surface-contact thermometry did not differ statistically from previously reported values for a previous generation of this species. The LLT50 was determined by exposing individuals to -10, -15, -20, -25, and -30 degrees C for one minute. Mean survivorship was 96.7, 91.2, and 71.2% for tests at -10, -15, and -20 degrees C, respectively. Exposure to -25 and -30 degrees C resulted in 100% mortality in all tests. Results show that males of D. mendotae are freeze-intolerant with a mean SCP of -21.6 degrees C which is only 0.1 degrees C lower than its linear interpolated estimated LLT 50 of -21.5 degrees C. Our results confirm that a low SCP, rather than freeze tolerance, is a mechanism that facilitates emergence and adult activity of this species during winter conditions. The implications of SCP and LLT50 with regard to life cycle dynamics are discussed.

AB  - Maturation and fecundity have been examined since the 1970s in 2 putative sub-populations of North Sea haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus. Reproductive investment within the western North Sea haddock sub-population significantly increased between the 1970s and 2000s, as was evident from both a decline in maturation probability and an increase in fecundity with size. A decline in maturation probability was also evident in males from the east North Sea, although the length at 50% probability of maturing (Lp50) at the beginning and end of the study period was much higher than in the west North Sea. The changes in reproductive traits could not be explained as a compensatory response, since the trend for increasing reproductive investment was not reversed when the North Sea stock recovered over the past decade. Indeed increased reproductive investment was accompanied by a reduction in somatic growth rate. Temperature immediately prior to secondary gametogenesis could partially explain inter-annual variation in female maturation probability and may have influenced the difference in sub-population trends. However, declines in maturation probability with cohort were still highly significant after accounting for a temperature effect, and differences in potential fecundity could not be explained by changes in somatic condition. Overall, it appears that west North Sea haddock have increased their reproductive effort, following decades of high mortality, consistent with an evolutionary response.

AB  - Offspring size is a key functional trait that can affect subsequent life history stages; in many species, it exhibits both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. Variation among populations in offspring size may be explained by various factors, including local climatic conditions. However, geographic variation in climate may be partitioned into long-term and interannual sources of variation, which may differ in their effects on population mean offspring size. To assess environmental correlates of offspring size, we evaluated geographic variation in seed mass among 88 populations representing 6 species of Streptanthus (Brassicaceae) distributed across a broad climatic gradient in California. We examined the effects of temperature-mediated growing season length and precipitation on population mean seed mass to determine whether it is best explained by (1) long-term mean climatic conditions; (2) interannual climate anomalies (i.e., deviations in climate from long-term means) during the year of seed development, or (3) interactions between climate variables. Both long-term mean climate and climate anomalies in the year of collection were associated with population mean seed mass, but their effects differed in direction and magnitude. Relatively large seeds were produced at chronically wet sites but also during drier-than-average years. This contrast indicates that these associations may be generated by different mechanisms (i.e., adaptive evolution vs. phenotypic plasticity) and may be evidence of countergradient plasticity in seed mass. In addition, populations occurring in locations characterized by relatively long growing seasons produced comparatively large seeds, particularly among chronically dry sites. This study highlights the need to consider that the responses of seed mass to long-term versus recent climatic conditions may differ and that climate variables may interact to predict seed mass. Such considerations are especially important when using these patterns to forecast the long- and short-term responses of seed mass to climate change. The results presented here also contribute to our broader understanding of how climate drives long-term (e.g., local adaptation) and short-term (e.g., phenotypic plasticity) variation in functional traits, such as offspring size across landscapes.

AB  - Taking as example high-performance parabolic leaves made of the high-strength steel 52CrMoV4 used for the suspension of heavy truck axles, the present paper focuses on the effect of the manufacturing process (heat treatment and stress peening) on their performance under fatigue loading. Investigations of the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the core and the surface of selected prototype specimens reveal the degradation of the mechanical surface properties due to the applied manufacturing process. The results of these investigations have been used as input for analytical fatigue life calculations and the theoretical assessment of every individual life-influencing factor (material, heat treatment, surface treatment, loading). Wohler (S-N) curves for various probabilities of survival were experimentally determined and compared to the calculated ones. The agreement between Experiment and Theory is satisfactory.

AB  - DNA microarray was used as a tool to define the heat- and cold-shock stimulons in Yersinia pestis. Heat shock dramatically enhanced the transcription of genes encoding major heat-shock proteins (MHSPs) that are important for cell survival against the heat. Many other genes were also greatly up-regulated, but their roles in heat-shock response need to be elucidated. Meanwhile, heat shock retarded most of the metabolic processes, i.e. RNA transcription, protein translation, aerobic respiration, energy metabolism, small molecule metabolism, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, sulfate uptake and cysteine biosynthesis. In response to cold shock, Y. pestis has evolved complex adaptive mechanisms by elevating the transcription of a specific set of genes whose protein products are designed to prevent or eliminate cold-induced DNA or RNA structuring, to remodel cell membrane components for maintenance of normal functions, to elevate the energy generation for ensuring ATP-dependent responses during cold adaptation and to synthesize or transport compatible solutes such as cryoprotectants, and at the same time, by repressing the mRNA level of certain genes whose protein products are not needed for bacterial growth at low temperatures, such as the MHSPs. These results provide a set of new candidate genes for hypothesis-based investigations of their roles in stress response, host adaptation and pathogenicity of this deadly pathogen.

AB  - Freeze tolerance is a complex cold-hardiness adaptation that has independently evolved in a diverse group of organisms, including several ectothermic vertebrates. Because little is known about the mechanistic basis for freeze tolerance in reptiles, we compared responses to experimental freezing in winter-acclimatized hatchlings representing nine taxa of temperate North American turtles, including ones that tolerated freezing and others that did not. Viability rates of hatchlings frozen to -3 degrees C for 72 h ranged from 0 to 100%. Tolerance to freezing was poor in Sternotherus odoratus, Graptemys geographica and Trachemys scripta, intermediate in Chelydra serpentina, and high in Emydoidea blandingii, Chrysemys picta bellii, C. p. marginata, Malaclemys terrapin, and Terrapene ornata, and generally reflected the winter thermal ecology of each taxon. Plasma activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a novel in vivo index of freeze/thaw damage, corroborated viability assessments and demonstrated that cryoinjury occurred even in surviving turtles. Irrespective of taxon, cryoinjury tended to be higher in smaller individuals and in those having relatively low water contents; however, bases for these associations were not apparent. Screening for certain organic osmolytes that might promote freezing survival by colligatively reducing ice content and limiting cell dehydration showed that the plasma of unfrozen (control) turtles contained small quantities of glucose (1.3-5.8 mmol l(-1)) and lactate (0.6-3.2 mmol l(-1)) and modest amounts of urea (range of mean values for all taxa 8.2-52.3 mmol l(-1)). Frozen/thawed turtles of all taxa accumulated modest amounts of glucose and lactate that jointly raised the plasma solute concentration by 30-100 mmol l(-1). We conclude that organic osmolytes accumulated both before and during freezing may promote survival in species that have evolved a tolerance to freezing, but are not necessarily accumulated for that purpose.

AB  - High temperature and overheating of photovoltaic panels lead to efficiency losses and eventual degradation. For solar PV systems, this is a significant impediment for achieving economic viability. In this study, a novel Window-Integrated Concentrated Photovoltaic (WICPV) system is proposed for window integration. This offers high (50%) transparency and is fabricated and characterised indoors at an irradiance of 1000 Wm(-2). Its electrical performance is tested (a) without applied cooling (i.e., under natural ventilation) and (b) with a heat sink to accommodate passive cooling media. The results are compared to study the effects of reduction in operating temperature on system performances. The effectiveness of a sensible cooling medium (water) and two latent heat removal media, phase change materials (or PCMs, RT50 and RT28HC), is investigated. This paper reports the passive temperature regulation of this WICPV at ambient testing conditions. The results demonstrate an increase in electrical power output by (i) 17% (RT28HC), (ii) 19% (RT50), and (iii) 25 % (circulating water) compared with the naturally ventilated system. This shows that PCMs are considerably useful for thermal regulation of the WICPV. Any improvement in efficiencies will be beneficial for increasing electrical energy generation and reducing peak energy demands.

AB  - Rising CO2 levels in the oceans are predicted to have serious consequences for many marine taxa. Recent studies suggest that non-genetic parental effectsmay reduce the impact of high CO2 on the growth, survival and routine metabolic rate of marine fishes, but whether the parental environment mitigates behavioural and sensory impairment associated with high CO2 remains unknown. Here, we tested the acute effects of elevated CO2 on the escape responses of juvenile fish and whether such effects were altered by exposure of parents to increased CO2 (transgenerational acclimation). Elevated CO2 negatively affected the reactivity and locomotor performance of juvenile fish, but parental exposure to high CO2 reduced the effects in some traits, indicating the potential for acclimation of behavioural impairment across generations. However, acclimation was not complete in some traits, and absent in others, suggesting that transgenerational acclimation does not completely compensate the effects of high CO2 on escape responses.

AB  - Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants convert solar energy to electricity and can be deployed with a thermal storage capability to shift electricity generation from time periods with available solar resource to those with high electricity demand or electricity price. Rigorous optimization of plant design and operational strategies can improve the market-competitiveness and commercial viability; however, such optimization may require hundreds of annual performance simulations, each of which can be computationally expensive when including considerations such as optimization of dispatch scheduling, sub-hourly time resolution, and stochastic effects due to uncertain weather or electricity price forecasts. This paper proposes a methodology to reduce the computational burden associated with simulation of electricity yield and revenue for CSP plants over a single-or multiyear period. Data-clustering techniques are employed to select a small number of limited-duration time blocks for simulation that, when appropriately weighted, can reproduce generation and revenue over a single year or within each year of a multi-year period. After selection of appropriate data features and weighting factors defining similarity between time-series profiles, the methodology captured annual revenue within 2.3%, 1.7%, or 1.2% using simulation of 10, 30, or 50 three-day exemplar time blocks, respectively, for each of three single-year location/weather/market scenarios and five plant configurations ranging from low to high solar multiple and storage capacity. When applied to multi-year datasets, the proposed methodology can capture inter-year variability that is unavailable from typical meteorological year (TMY) datasets while simultaneously requiring simulation of less than a single year of data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potato tuber moth (PTM), Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a destructive pest of Solanaceae crops worldwide. alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine are toxic steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in Solanaceae crops and are most abundant in potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), accounting for more than 95% of the total SGAs. PTM grows on potatoes with a higher concentration of SGAs. Gut bacteria play an important role in the physiology and behavior of insects. To understand the role of gut bacteria of PTM in host adaptability, we isolated and identified major SGA (alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine)-degrading gut bacteria in the gut of PTM by a selective medium and analyzed their degradability and degradation mechanism.
   RESULTS: The gut Glutamicibacter halophytocola S2 of PTM with high degradation capacity to alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and identified by morphological and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A gene cluster involving alpha-rhamnosidases, beta-glucosidases, and beta-galactosidases was identified by whole-genome sequencing of G. halophytocola S2. These genes had higher expression on the alpha-solanine medium. PTM inoculated with the isolated G. halophytocola S2 obtained higher fitness than antibiotic-treated PTM.
   CONCLUSION: The G. halophytocola S2 in the gut of PTM could degrade the major toxic alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in potatoes. This enhances the fitness of PTM feeding on potatoes with high SGA contents. The results provide a theoretical foundation for the integrated pest management of PTM and provide an effective strain for the treatment of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in potato food.

AB  - Components of phenotypic covariance of fecundity with adult size were examined in the bug Dysdercus fasciatus in benign and stressful moisture environments. In addition, genetic relationships were explored between the character states in different environments. There was a positive and significant genetic association between fecundity and adult size in a benign environment. By contrast, the observed phenotypic covariability of fecundity with adult size in a stressful environment arose entirely from non-additive genetic plus maternal effects. Genetic correlations between the same character across environments were significantly less than unity for both adult size and fecundity. These results suggest that populations in benign and stressful moisture environments would respond to selection on adult size and fecundity in different ways.

AB  - In order to unravel the physiological, endocrine, and behavioral differences between gregarious and solitarious forms of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk.) (Orthoptera, Acrididae), a constant supply of rather large numbers of solitary individuals has to be guaranteed. This represents a bottleneck, mainly because of the intensity of the labor involved and limited laboratory accommodation. The method we describe here substantially reduces the space and manpower needed. The survival rate we obtained in the solitarised population was relatively high, reaching about 55%. The optimal rearing temperature proved to be 32-36degreesC. Cabbage leaves and oat flakes sufficed for feeding all year round. Special racks have been designed that enable high density stacking and easy handling. The solitarisation process was monitored over ten consecutive generations. Changes in morphometrics, eye stripes, color, and behavior were recorded, of which only morphometrics, temperature related development, and mortality are discussed. A shift towards the solitarious phase was recorded, with clear differences between gregarious, 1st generation and 7th to 10th generation solitarious locusts.

AB  - Genetic variability is essential for adaptation and could be acquired via hybridization with a closely related lineage. We use ants to investigate thermal adaptation and the link between temperature and genetic variation arising from hybridization. We test for differences in cold and heat tolerance between Finnish Formica polyctena and Formica aquilonia wood ants and their naturally occurring hybrids. Using workers, we find that the parental individuals differ in both cold and heat tolerances and express thermal limits that reflect their global distributions. Hybrids, however, cannot combine thermal tolerance of parental species as they have the same heat tolerance as F. polyctena but not the same cold tolerance as F. aquilonia. We then focus on a single hybrid population to investigate the relationship between temperature variation and genetic variation across 16 years using reproductive individuals. On the basis of the thermal tolerance results, we expected the frequency of putative F. polyctena alleles to increase in warm years and F. aquilonia alleles to increase in cold years. We find support for this in hybrid males but not in hybrid females. These results contribute to understanding the outcomes of hybridization, which may be sex specific or depend on the environment. Furthermore, genetic variability resulting from hybridization could help hybrid wood ants cope with changing thermal conditions.

AB  - The paper provides a performance analysis assessment of a novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) liquid desiccant tri-generation system for building applications. The work presented serves to build upon the current literature related to experimental evaluations of SOFC tri-generation systems, particularly in domestic built environment applications. The proposed SOFC liquid desiccant tri-generation system will be the first-of-its-kind. No research activity is reported on the integration of SOFC, or any fuel cell, with liquid desiccant air conditioning in a tri-generation system configuration. The novel tri-generation system is suited to applications that require simultaneous electrical power, heating and dehumidification cooling. There are several specific benefits to the integration of SOFC and liquid desiccant air conditioning technology, including; very high operational electrical efficiencies even at low system capacities and the ability to utilise low-grade thermal energy in a (useful) cooling process. Furthermore, the novel tri-generation system has the potential to increase thermal energy utilisation and thus the access to the benefits achievable from on-site electrical generation, primarily; reduced emissions and operating costs.
   Using empirical SOFC and liquid desiccant component data, an energetic, economic and environmental performance analysis assessment of the novel system is presented. Significant conclusions from the work include: (1) SOFC and liquid desiccant are a viable technological pairing in the development of an efficient and effective tri-generation system. High tri-generation efficiencies in the range of 68-71% are attainable. (2) The inclusion of liquid desiccant provides an efficiency increase of 9-15% compared to SOFC electrical operation only, demonstrating the potential of the system in building applications that require simultaneous electrical power, heating and/or dehumidification/cooling. (3) Compared to an equivalent base case system, the novel tri-generation system is currently only economically viable with a government's financial support. SOFC capital cost and stack replacement are the largest inhibitors to economic viability. Environmental performance is closely linked to electrical emission factor, and thus performance is heavily country dependent. (4) The economic and environmental feasibility of the novel tri-generation system will improve with predicted SOFC capital cost reductions and the transition to clean hydrogen production.

AB  - Extreme high temperatures in summer become more and more universal. However, the effects of high temperature on fitness and performance of different developmental stages in most biological control agents are very limited. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of heat stress and exposure duration on the survival characteristics of immature and adult stages of Propylaea japonica, a dominant aphidophagous ladybeetle in China. Here, we investigated the survival characteristics of different developmental stages in P. japonica when subjecting to high temperatures, 35, 37, 39, 41 and 43 degrees C for exposure durations of 1, 2, 4 and 6 h, respectively, and 25 degrees C is the control. The results indicated that egg survival greatly decreased only at 43 degrees C for 4 h or 6 h, and had no significant difference from 25 to 41 degrees C for any exposure duration. The younger larvae were the most vulnerable stage with the minimum survival exposure to high temperature but older larvae showed stronger resistance to heat stress. The survivals of pupae and adult stages rapidly decreased only at 43 degrees C for exceeding 2 h. These results suggest that different developmental stages of P. japonica possess different degrees of heat resistance, which ensures its survival in summer. Moreover, according to the heat resistance of several natural enemy insects in our previous reports and the present results, a comprehensive utilization strategy of aphid biological control was constructed to restrain aphid damage and population growth in challenging environment.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of optimal allocation of spare modules in large series-redundant systems in order to obtain a required reliability under cost constraints. Both cases of active and standby redundancy are considered. Moreover, for a subsystem with standby redundancy, two cases are examined: in the first case, all the spares are maintained in cold state (cold standby redundancy) and, in the second one, to reduce the time needed to put a spare into operation when the active one fails, one of the spares is maintained in warm conditions. To solve this optimization problem, for the simpler case of active redundancy an analytical method based on the Lagrange multipliers technique is first applied. Then the results are improved by using Pairwise Hill Climbing, an original fine-tuning algorithm. An alternative approach is an innovative evolutionary algorithm, RELIVE, in which an individual lives for several generations and improves its fitness based on local search. These methods are especially needed in case of very large systems.

AB  - The effectiveness of insecticides differs with changes in temperature, but insecticide toxicities are determined at constant temperatures. Constant thermal conditions do not occur in the field, where insects can change their behaviors to achieve a preferred temperature. The aim of this study was to assess whether the choice of ambient temperature affects the mortality rate of intoxicated firebugs and Colorado potato beetles. The insects' mortality following insecticide exposure was monitored at constant temperatures (15, 25, and 35 degrees C) as well as in a thermal gradient system, where the insects could freely select their preferred ambient temperature. Firebugs treated with oxadiazine showed 58% higher mortality when held at a constant temperature post-treatment compared to mortality levels seen when able to choose a preferred temperature in a thermal gradient. Similar results were seen in Colorado potato beetles treated with oxadiazine (15%-33% higher mortality in constant vs. preferred temperature) or organophosphate (36% higher mortality in constant vs. preferred temperature). The insects' ability to mitigate the impacts of pesticide exposure by selecting more beneficial thermal conditions is an important consideration for pest management. Therefore, the application rates of insecticides used under field conditions should be additionally analyzed to take this factor into account.

AB  - Encarsia guadeloupae Viggiani is an important parasitoid of Aleurodicus dispersus Russell. The effects of temperature (16, 20, 24, 28, and 32A degrees C) on development and reproduction of this parasitoid on A. dispersus were studied in laboratory experiments. The developmental duration of E. guadeloupae varied from 14.9 (32A degrees C) to 54.4 days (16A degrees C). The developmental threshold and thermal constant for an entire generation were 10.52A degrees C and 308.85 degree-days, respectively. The highest survival rate (63.8%) of immature E. guadeloupae was recorded at 28A degrees C. The average adult longevity ranged from 6.0 (32A degrees C) to 15.1 days (16A degrees C). The highest fecundity was observed at 28A degrees C. The intrinsic rate of increase (r (m) ), net reproduction rate (R (o) ), and finite rate of increase (lambda) were the highest at 28A degrees C, which were 0.18, 54.25 and 1.21, respectively. We concluded that 28A degrees C is the most suitable temperature for development and reproduction of E. guadeloupae.

AB  - In addition to their application in the production of F-1 hybrids in rape (Brassica napus L.), cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS) systems may be used to produce synthetic varieties with much higher levels of heterozygosity than those expected in conventional rape synthetics. CMS synthetics are produced by compositing a CMS A-line with several male-fertile (MF) B-lines lacking nuclear alleles for fertility restoration, and increasing the resulting mixture by natural pollination. Over generations of increase, pollination of the CMS component by the MF component of the synthetic results in the progressive loss of A-line nuclear genes from the population. The initial proportions of CMS and MF plants are expected to be preserved over several generations of natural pollination if CMS and MF plants are equal in yield. Methods for estimating the heterozygosity level of CMS synthetics, taking into account the proportion of CMS plants, number of MF parents in Syn 0, and selfing rate (s) of MF plants, are presented. If completely inbred Syn 0 parents and s of 0 and 0.75 for CMS and MF plants respectively, are assumed, the heterozygosity level (1-F) of a synthetic derived from four inbred MF parents each comprising 6.25% of Syn 0 and one inbred CMS parent comprising 75% of Syn 0 is predicted to be 0.66 in Syn 5, compared to 0.30 in synthetics derived from four MF parents only. CMS synthetics offer a novel, low-cost approach to the exploitation of heterosis in rape and other species with mixed mating systems in which self-pollination predominates.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the biological characteristics of Trichogramma pretiosum (Riley 1879) under room temperature and temperature stress by successive generations. The evaluation was carried out in split-plot in the time. The temperature (25 degrees C - room temperature and 33 degrees C - temperature stress) was the Factor 1 and the Generations (n = 15) were the Factor 2. The biological characteristics evaluated were: longevity; posterior tibia length; number of parasitized eggs; emergence; egg-adult period; sexual ratio and deformed individuals. The increase in temperature, from the first generations of T pretiosum, caused an influence in all observed variables. However, for the emergence and sex ratio variables, there was no significant difference between heat stress and control (room temperature) as of the 14th generation, which suggests an adaptability of the species. This adaptability may imply obtaining more aggressive natural enemies in relation to their host (insect pest) and consequently in the greater efficiency of biological control.

AB  - The workplace influences the safety, health, and productivity of workers at multiple levels. To protect and promote total worker health, smart hardware, and software tools have emerged for the identification, elimination, substitution, and control of occupational hazards. Wearable devices enable constant monitoring of individual workers and the environment, whereas connected worker solutions provide contextual information and decision support. Here, the recent trends in commercial workplace technologies to monitor and manage occupational risks, injuries, accidents, and diseases are reviewed. Workplace safety wearables for safe lifting, ergonomics, hazard identification, sleep monitoring, fatigue management, and heat and cold stress are discussed. Examples of workplace productivity wearables for asset tracking, augmented reality, gesture and motion control, brain wave sensing, and work stress management are given. Workplace health wearables designed for work-related musculoskeletal disorders, functional movement disorders, respiratory hazards, cardiovascular health, outdoor sun exposure, and continuous glucose monitoring are shown. Connected worker platforms are discussed with information about the architecture, system modules, intelligent operations, and industry applications. Predictive analytics provide contextual information about occupational safety risks, resource allocation, equipment failure, and predictive maintenance. Altogether, these examples highlight the ground-level benefits of real-time visibility about frontline workers, work environment, distributed assets, workforce efficiency, and safety compliance.

AB  - Balancing selection has been invoked to explain the apparent maintenance of polymorphisms at the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi) loci in a diverse array of organisms. However, in many cases the agents of selective stress and the gram size of environmental heterogeneity necessary to preserve genetic variation remain uncertain. In the barnacle Sennbalanus balanoides, differing selection regimes have been proposed across the species' range. To test whether or not fitness differences segregate with Mpi and Gpi polymorphisms near the southern range limit, barnacles from Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, were subjected to physiological challenges in the laboratory. Survivorship was measured in barnacles exposed to an orthogonal combination of salinity, thermal and dietary stresses. Cirral length and genotype frequency shifts at Mpi and Gpi were assessed in low salinity treatments. Mortality from thermal stress was greatly enhanced under low salinity. Across all low salinity treatments there was a nonsignificant trend of decreased fitness associated with the Mpi-SS genotype. Cirral length variation was significantly correlated with Mpi genotypes in a pattern consistent with survivorship data.

AB  - Using a statistical-mechanical model of spins, the evolution of phenotype dynamics is studied. Configurations of spins and their interaction J represent the phenotype and genotype, respectively. The fitness for selection of J is given by the equilibrium spin configurations determined by a Hamiltonian with J under thermal noise. The genotype J evolves through mutational changes under selection pressure to raise its fitness value. From Monte Carlo simulations we find that the frustration around the target spins disappears for J evolved under temperature beyond a certain threshold. The evolved Js give the funnel-like dynamics, which is robust to noise and also to mutation.

AB  - Winter hardiness is a quantitative trait and the lack of it limits geographic distribution of ryegrass. Improving winter hardiness is an important breeding goal in ryegrass breeding programs. An understanding of the genetic basis for the component traits of winter hardiness would allow more efficient selection. A three-generation interspecific population of an annual x perennial ryegrass consisting of 152 progenies was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control winter hardiness-related traits including fall growth (FG), freezing tolerance (FT), and winter survival (WS) over 2 years. A total of 39 QTL were identified for the three traits from both the female parental (MFA) and the male parental (MFB) maps, of which 13 were for FG, 6 for FT, and 20 for WS. The proportion of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 10.4 to 22.1%. Both FG and FT were positively correlated with WS. Common QTL were detected between FG, FT, and WS. The QTL associated with WS on linkage groups (LGs) 4 and 5, and the QTL for FT on LG 5 were consistently identified over years and maps. These consistent QTL might serve as potential tools for marker-assisted selection to improve ryegrass winter hardiness.

AB  - The principal female reproductive variates were studied in the cold-water loliginid squid Loligo gahi d'Orbigny, 1835 from Falkland Islands' waters. Ripe egg size ranged from 1.4 x 1.9 to 1.8 x 2.8 mm with average diameters on random axes of 1.66-2.39 mm. The egg size of autumn-winter spawners was larger than that of spring-summer spawners. Ripe egg size increases with female size in individuals from the same cohort. During maturation the initially unimodal size distribution of oocytes in the ovary becomes bimodal due to the formation of a batch of ripe eggs (540-13,820 oocytes). The total yolk oocyte stock ranges from 1100 to 21,000, and potential fecundity varies from 1800 to 35,200 oocytes. Larger females have higher potential fecundity. The actual fecundity was estimated to be about 50% of the potential fecundity. The main adaptations to cold water maturation and spawning in L. gahi females are the high proportion of yolk oocytes in the ovary and a shift of the main spawning peak to spring.

AB  - The genetic gains from eucalypt breeding programs have decreased compared to previous decades while productivity reduced in recent years. This decrease is mainly attributed to climate change that, according to studies, has been limiting productivity and changing the adaptation of forest species. But other aspects can be listed, as pests and diseases and decreasing gains with the advance of breeding programs. The objective of this work is to investigate the genotype x site x age interaction in a multi-environment trial with eucalypt clones to verify the adaptability and stability of the genotypes and, finally, to identify mega-environments over time, as well as the influence of climate variables on the genotype performances. The trait diameter at breast height (DBH) of 11 Eucalyptus commercial clones at 11 sites (range from -0.84 to -24.23 latitude and from -39.60 to -52.59 longitude) and three evaluated ages (Age 1 - ranging from 13 to 17 months after planting; Age 2 - from 31 to 34 months; Age 3 - from 48 to 53 months old) was measured and analyzed by factor analytic multiplicative mixed (FAMM) model associated with the GGE biplot and multivariate regression tree using climate variables. A significant G x E interaction and genotypes with different performance across environments and ages were observed. There are clones with high adaptability to specific sites while others show good stability. The results clustered the sites into three mega-environments according to a latitude gradient, over time. The performance of Eucalyptus clones over time indicate precisely either roughly similar or extremely contrasting environments. Temperature affected the most the clustering of the studied sites followed by the latitudinal gradient, impacting productivity negatively, regardless of age. These results may help future studies on the development of selection strategies in tropical regions to address climate change and assist forest breeding programs to deal with the effect of climate change on eucalypt productivity.

AB  - Knowledge of the degree to which corals undergo physiological acclimatization or genetic adaptation in response to changes in their thermal environment is crucial to the success of coral reef conservation strategies. The potential of corals to acclimatize to temperatures exceeding historical thermal regimes was investigated by reciprocal transplantation of Acropora millepora colonies between the warm central and cool southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) for a duration of 14 months. Colony fragments retained at native sites remained healthy, whereas transplanted fragments, although healthy over initial months when temperatures remained within native thermal regimes, subsequently bleached and suffered mortality during seasonal temperature extremes. Corals hosting Symbiodinium D transplanted to the southern GBR bleached in winter and the majority suffered whole (40%; n = 20 colonies) or partial (50%) mortality at temperatures 1.1 degrees C below their 15-year native minimum. In contrast, corals hosting Symbiodinium C2 transplanted to the central GBR bleached in summer and suffered whole (50%; n = 10 colonies) or partial (42%) mortality at temperatures 2.5 degrees C above their 15-year native maximum. During summer bleaching, the dominant Symbiodinium type changed from C2 to D within corals transplanted to the central GBR. Corals transplanted to the cooler, southern GBR grew 74-80% slower than corals at their native site, and only 50% of surviving colonies reproduced, at least partially because of cold water bleaching of transplants. Despite the absence of any visual signs of stress, corals transplanted to the warmer, central GBR grew 52-59% more slowly than corals at their native site before the summer bleaching (i.e., from autumn to spring). Allocation of energy to initial acclimatization or reproduction may explain this pattern, as the majority (65%) of transplants reproduced one month earlier than portions of the same colonies retained at the southern native site. All parameters investigated (bleaching, mortality, Symbiodinium type fidelity, reproductive timing) demonstrated strong interactions between genotype and environment, indicating that the acclimatization potential of A. millepora populations may be limited by adaptation of the holobiont to native thermal regimes.

AB  - Fresh wood chips with natural moisture (wet chips) have been used for energy generation. Wood chip drying is an alternative of pretreatment aimed to improve quality, but its viability needs to be tested, since this process is energetically and economically expensive. This work presents an assessment of a local industry that dries wood chips utilizing a rotary dryer, allowing it to establish a base case scenario for biomass drying. From this, different alternatives of energy and raw material consumption scenarios were established. Risk and sensitivity analyzes were performed to measure the impact on economic indicators. The risk analysis was carried out via Monte Carlo simulations. The results showed that the project is economically viable, with a payback period of 1.67 years, an Internal Rate Return of 60.2% and a Benefit Cost Ratio of 1.39. The sensitivity analysis showed that even with a 28.6% increase in purchase price and a 21.4% decrease in the sale price of wood chips, the economic indicators remained viable. Under the conditions evaluated, no significant risk (p < 0.1%) to the project viability was identified.

AB  - The availability of fresh water is essential for human being lives existence. But most of the time, it is not a naturally guaranteed and accessible option for nearly all the world's countries. As a mission to maintain the presence of freshwater, the aim of this paper is to provide and examine a new humidification-dehumidification (HDH) water desalination system. The provided HDH system is equipped with the fogging nozzles technique that is experimentally proofed, when compared to other HDH systems, to impacting the performance positively in terms of reducing the exergy destruction of the desalination process. A regular jet nozzle and two fogging nozzles with different droplet sizes (20 and 30 microns) were used to examine the effect of the droplet size on the amount of entropy generation. For all air flow rates, using the fogging nozzles reduces the total specific entropy generation greatly in comparison with the regular jet nozzle. The 20-micron nozzle shows a higher ability in reducing the specific entropy generation when compared to the 30-micron nozzle. The performance of the HDH system was judged using the gained-output ratio (GOR). The maximum GOR value of 3.4, and the minimum specific entropy generation value of 0.235 were achieved at a 0.78 mass flow rate ratio, which indicates that using the fogging nozzles technique increases the recovered energy from the humidifier's freshwater outlet. The entropy generation curve for the humidifier and the dehumidifier experienced no change under the variations of the mass flow rate ratio. Therefore, the fogging nozzles technique limits the entropy generation in the HDH system even at higher seawater inlet flow rates due to the larger contact area and the smaller water droplets that generate higher evaporation and condensation rates at the humidifier and dehumidifier units, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that increasing the inlet air temperature has positive effects on the HDH system by reducing slightly the total amount of entropy generation.

AB  - Quadrupoles in the fragment separator region of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) will be subjected to very large heat loads (over 200 Watts) and an intense level of radiation (similar to 10 MGy per year) into the coils of just the first magnet. Magnets made with High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) are advantageous over conventional superconducting magnets since they can remove these heat loads more efficiently at higher temperatures. The proposed design is based on second generation (2G) HTS which allows operation at similar to 50 K. 2G has been found to be highly radiation tolerant. The latest test results are summarized. The goal of this R&D program is to evaluate the viability of HTS in a real machine with magnets in a challenging environment where HTS offers a unique solution.

AB  - Localized areas of intense biological activity, or hot spots, in the deep sea are infrequent but important features in an otherwise sparsely occupied habitat (1). Hydrothermal vents, methane cold seeps, and the tops of seamounts are well documented areas where dense communities persist for generations (2-5). Reproductive aggregations where conspecifics concentrate for the purposes of spawning or egg brooding could be thought of as transient hot spots. It is likely that they occur in populations with low densities to maximize mate location and increase reproductive success (6). However, only a few deep-sea reproductive aggregations have ever been documented (7-9), demonstrating the paucity of present-day information regarding reproductive behavior of deep-sea animals. In this paper we describe a unique multispecies reproductive aggregation located on the Gorda Escarpment, California. We document some of the highest fish and octopus densities ever reported in the deep sea, with most individuals of both species brooding eggs. We describe the nesting behavior of the blob sculpin, Psychrolutes phrictus, and the egg-brooding behavior of an octopus, Graneledone sp. observed during annual dives of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) on the Gorda Escarpment. The animals are concentrated at the crest of the local topography and near cold seeps where they may benefit from enhanced current flow and local productivity. These findings provide new information on the reproductive behaviors of deep-sea animals. More importantly, they highlight how physical and bathymetric heterogeneity in the environment can result in reproductive hot spots, which may be a critical resource for reproductive success in some deep-sea species.

AB  - Several relationships between air temperature and work performance have been published. We reanalysed the one developed in 2006 by Seppa center dot nen et al.; which is probably the best known. We found that even when significant, its prediction accuracy is very low (R2 = 0.05, MAE = 1.9%, RMSE = 3.1%). We consequently reviewed the literature and found 35 studies on the effects of temperature on office work performance. We used Seppa center dot nen et al.'s approach to normalise the data reported in these studies and explored the feasibility to develop a new relationship using regression models, models based on the Maximal Adaptability framework, and machine learning. We could not find a relationship between temperature and office work performance neither for the range of temperatures measured in most of the office buildings (20 degrees C-30 degrees C) or a wider range (18 degrees C-34 degrees C). Plausible reasons are discussed including the variety of methods used to assess performance, the multiple uncontrolled confounders, and the fact that temperature alone may not fully describe how the thermal environment affects building occupants. We do not recommend the use in practice of any of the models relating temperature to office work performance examined in the present study. The lack of relationships does not necessarily refute that temperature affects the performance of office work. Coordinated research predicated on a shared protocol enabling integrated analysis in the modelling of the relationships between the indoor thermal environment and office work performance is proposed to be carried out before using them in practice. We made the database opensource and developed an application for data exploring.

AB  - Renewable energy can be produced from a number of sources, including plant biomass. One of the most efficient technologies to generate bioenergy from plant biomass is on-farm anaerobic digestion (AD) producing biogas. Biogas can be used as an equal substitute to natural gas for industrial, commercial and residential use, and/or can be converted to electricity, heat or vehicle fuel using established technologies. Using purified biogas for transport is a highly effective greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. Various organic feed stocks can be converted into biogas: we have identified a large variety of purpose-grown bioenergy crop species (such as Jerusalem artichoke, forage sorghum, whole triticale) under New Zealand conditions, but feedstocks can also include farm and orchard waste streams (reject fruit, clippings, thinning and so on), groundcover biomass and other locally sourced organic municipal and industrial bio-waste as well. A novel biofuel cropping system was developed based on AD technology. It makes full use of the nutrients in the digestate with a unique closed-loop nutrient supply feature that conserves nutrients in the feedstock and recycles them back to the farm and orchard as bio-fertiliser. This eliminates the need for external fertilizer. This paper will explore the considerable potential for bioenergy generation and nutrient recycling in horticultural production systems in New Zealand.

AB  - In a changing environment, small RNAs (sRNAs) play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and can vary in abundance depending on the conditions experienced by an individual (phenotypic plasticity) and its parents (non-genetic inheritance). Many sRNAs are unusual in that they can be produced in two ways, either using genomic DNA as the template (primary sRNAs) or existing sRNAs as the template (secondary sRNAs). Thus, organisms can evolve rapid plastic responses to their current environment by adjusting the amplification rate of sRNA templates. sRNA levels can also be transmitted transgenerationally by the direct transfer of either sRNAs or the proteins involved in amplification. Theory is needed to describe the selective forces acting on sRNA levels, accounting for the dual nature of sRNAs as regulatory elements and templates for amplification and for the potential to transmit sRNAs and their amplification agents to offspring. Here, we develop a model to study the dynamics of sRNA production and inheritance in a fluctuating environment. We tested the selective advantage of mutants capable of sRNA-mediated phenotypic plasticity within resident populations with fixed levels of sRNA transcription. Even when the resident was allowed to evolve an optimal constant rate of sRNA production, plastic amplification rates capable of responding to environmental conditions were favored. Mechanisms allowing sRNA transcripts or amplification agents to be inherited were favored primarily when parents and offspring face similar environments and when selection acts before the optimal level of sRNA can be reached within the organism. Our study provides a clear set of testable predictions for the evolution of sRNA-related mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity and transgenerational inheritance.
   Author summary
   Small RNAs (sRNA) are produced by a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. These molecules are involved in the response to environmental stress (e.g., temperature, pathogens) and can be transmitted across generations. We developed a model to explore the dynamics of sRNA production (phenotypic plasticity) and inheritance in a fluctuating environment. We tested whether different sRNA mutants can invade a population where individuals produce sRNA at a constant optimal transcription rate. In our simulations, plastic amplification rates capable of responding to environmental conditions were favored and the transmission of sRNA transcripts or amplification agents across generations was particularly advantageous when parents and offspring faced similar environments. sRNA amplification alone is not favored except when optimal sRNA levels are not reached within a generation. Our model provides novel predictions for the molecular mechanisms of sRNA production and guidance for future empirical studies on mutations that impair the mechanisms of sRNA production and their fitness consequences.

AB  - Organisms in nature are both proximate (operating by rules of thumb) and adapted (the rules influenced by natural selection). We introduce new methods that can be used to study in silico versions of organisms behaving according to proximate adapted rules. Our approach goes beyond neural networks and offers an alternative to optimization methods. It is based on the idea that organisms receive signals from the environment, that the signals are modified by internal (state-dependent) factors to create feelings (which we refer to as hedonic tones), and that behavioural processes (decisions) are a response to the hedonic tones. We illustrate these ideas through a model of a fish moving in a vertically structured environment, subject to predation and competition from conspecifics. The fish in our model responds to food, light, temperature and conspecifics, without any reference to current or future fitness. We use a combination of hedonic modelling to process the response, and genetic algorithms to modify the response via natural selection, according to internal needs and evolutionary history. We show that many different combinations of genes can lead to similar fitnesses, so that this approach generates genetic diversity. We compare our results with those of a variety of empirical studies and show that our approach can lead to new links between empirical and simulation studies.

AB  - Background: Most clinical and natural microbial communities live and evolve in spatially structured environments. When changes in environmental conditions trigger evolutionary responses, spatial structure can impact the types of adaptive response and the extent to which they spread. In particular, localized competition in a spatial landscape can lead to the emergence of a larger number of different adaptive trajectories than would be found in well-mixed populations. Our goal was to determine how two levels of spatial structure affect genomic diversity in a population and how this diversity is manifested spatially.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We serially transferred bacteriophage populations growing at high temperatures (40 degrees C) on agar plates for 550 generations at two levels of spatial structure. The level of spatial structure was determined by whether the physical locations of the phage subsamples were preserved or disrupted at each passage to fresh bacterial host populations. When spatial structure of the phage populations was preserved, there was significantly greater diversity on a global scale with restricted and patchy distribution. When spatial structure was disrupted with passaging to fresh hosts, beneficial mutants were spread across the entire plate. This resulted in reduced diversity, possibly due to clonal interference as the most fit mutants entered into competition on a global scale. Almost all substitutions present at the end of the adaptation in the populations with disrupted spatial structure were also present in the populations with structure preserved.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results are consistent with the patchy nature of the spread of adaptive mutants in a spatial landscape. Spatial structure enhances diversity and slows fixation of beneficial mutants. This added diversity could be beneficial in fluctuating environments. We also connect observed substitutions and their effects on fitness to aspects of phage biology, and we provide evidence that some substitutions exclude each other.

AB  - The ability of perennial species to adapt their phenology to present and future temperature conditions is important for their ability to retain high fitness compared to other competing plant species, pests, and pathogens. Many transplanting studies with forest tree species have previously reported substantial genetic differentiation among populations within their native range. However, the question of how local is local is still highly debated in conservation biology because studies on genetic patterns of variation within and among populations at the local scale are limited and scattered. In this study, we compare the level of genetic differentiation among populations of six different perennial plant species based on their variation in spring flushing. We assess the level of additive genetic variation present within the local population. For all six species, we find significant differentiation among populations from sites with mean annual temperature ranging between 7.4 degrees C and 8.4 degrees C. The observed variation can only be partly explained by the climate at the site of origin. Most clear relationship between early flushing and higher average spring temperature is observed for the three wind-pollinated species in the study, while the relations are much less clear for the three insect-pollinated species. This supports that pollination system can influence the balance between genetic drift and natural selection and thereby influence the level of local adaptation in long-lived species. On the positive side, we find that the native populations of woody plant species have maintained high levels of additive genetic variation in spring phenology, although this also differs substantially among the six studied species.

AB  - Stem borer Stromatium barbatum has recently emerged as a serious pest problem of grapevines in India. Hidden biology and lack of effective chemical control of stem borer warranted finding out weak links in its life cycle which aids in formulating effective management strategies. Being a monovoltine pest with annual life cycle, the systematic studies on developmental biology and stage specific mortality of stem borer in grapes are limited. In present study, a cohort life table was constructed for S. barbatum by rearing it on grapevine wood logs in the laboratory at 27 +/- 1 celcius temperature and 65 +/- 5% RH. The life cycle of S. barbatum was tracked from egg hatching through larval and pupal stages till adult emergence and observations were recorded on stage specific developmental durations and mortality of immature stages, and longevity and fecundity of adult stages. The results revealed that the mean durations of egg, larvae and pupae were 6.60 +/- 0.28 days, 296.10 +/- 1.06 days and 19.70 +/- 1.17 days, respectively. The adults after emerging from pupae could survive up to 36.40 +/- 0.81 days. The egg hatching and adult emergence from pupae were 42.51% and 83.02%, respectively. S. barbatum population attained a net reproductive rate of 64.96 females/female/generation and a gross reproductive rate of 72.93 females/female/generation in her mean oviposition period of 9.80 +/- 0.13 days. The data indicated that, S. barbatum population potentially might increase with an intrinsic rate (r(m)) of 0.087 females/female/day and a finite rate (lambda) of 1.09 females/female/day with a doubling time of 9.98 days and a mean generation time of 324.30 days. The mortality was relatively higher during the egg and larval stages, which was then gradually decreased for rest of the life span when S. babatum was reared on grapevine wood logs under laboratory conditions. Generation mortality for S. barbatum was 90.72%. The present study has generated detailed information on critical life events such as days to egg hatch, adult longevity and fecundity, time required for adults to oviposit after mating, and age-stage specific mortality. This could facilitate formulation and implementation of effective management strategies for S. barbatum in grape vineyards.

AB  - Aim: The evolution of key innovations promotes adaptive radiations by opening access to new ecological opportunity. The acquisition of viviparity (live-bearing reproduction) has emerged as one such innovation explaining reptile proliferations into extreme climates. By evolving viviparity, females provide embryos with internally stable environments to complete development. The classical hypothesis suggests that natural selection for viviparity arises from low temperatures in cold climates, which promote prolonged egg retention in the mother's body. An alternative hypothesis proposes that declines in atmospheric oxygen at high elevations create natural selection for embryo retention to provide them with optimal oxygen levels during development. However, although experimental studies support the negative effects of low oxygen on egg development, this hypoxia' hypothesis has never been tested quantitatively. Here, we compete the hypoxia hypothesis against the cold-climate' hypothesis, using a highly diverse lizard genus.
   Location: South America.
   Major taxa: Liolaemus lizards.
   Methods: We use a multivariate dataset covering 121 species varying extensively in geographical and climatic distribution (including extreme thermal and oxygen gradients) and parity mode. Based on a new molecular phylogeny for the genus, we use phylogenetic logistic regressions to generate a range of models ranking environmental factors as a function of their effects on parity mode transitions.
   Results: Elevation and oxygen declines were almost perfectly correlated, and both were identified as the dominant predictors of oviparity-to-viviparity transitions, whereas the role for temperature (dominated by the coldest winter temperatures and daily fluctuations) was significant but secondary. Overall, we showed that oxygen deprivation and low temperatures both play a role in the evolution of viviparity.
   Main conclusions: Our findings support the role for selection from declines in oxygen concentrations as the primary driver behind viviparity. However, selection arising from cold temperatures and from reduced fluctuations in daily temperatures contributes to the evolution of these transitions by creating multivariate selection on parity mode.

AB  - Predicting how populations will respond to ocean change across generations is critical to effective conservation of marine species. One emerging factor is the influence of parental exposures on offspring phenotype, known as intergenerational carryover effects. Parental exposure may deliver beneficial or detrimental characteristics to offspring that can influence larval recruitment patterns, thus shaping how populations and community structure respond to ocean change. Impacts of adult exposure to elevated winter temperature and pCO(2) on reproduction and offspring viability were examined in the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) using three populations of adult, hatchery-reared O. lurida, plus an additional cohort spawned from one of the populations. Oysters were sequentially exposed to elevated temperature (+4 degrees C, at 10 degrees C), followed by elevated pCO(2) (+2,204 mu atm, at 3,045 mu atm) during winter months. Male gametes were more developed after elevated temperature exposure and less developed after high pCO(2) exposure, but there was no impact on female gametes or sex ratios. Oysters previously exposed to elevated winter temperature released larvae earlier, regardless of pCO(2) exposure. Those exposed to elevated winter temperature as a sole treatment released more larvae on a daily basis but, when also exposed to high pCO(2), there was no effect. These combined results indicate that elevated winter temperature accelerates O. lurida spermatogenesis, resulting in earlier larval release and increased production, with elevated pCO(2) exposure negating effects of elevated temperature. Altered recruitment patterns may therefore follow warmer winters due to precocious spawning, but these effects may be masked by coincidental high pCO(2). Offspring were reared in common conditions for 1 yr, then deployed for 3 months in four estuarine bays with distinct environmental conditions. Offspring of parents exposed to elevated pCO(2) had higher survival rates in two of the four bays. This carryover effect demonstrates that parental conditions can have substantial ecologically relevant impacts that should be considered when predicting impacts of environmental change. Furthermore, Olympia oysters may be more resilient in certain environments when progenitors are pre-conditioned in stressful conditions. Combined with other recent studies, our work suggests that the Olympia may be more equipped than other oysters for the challenge of a changing ocean.

AB  - Population dynamics of Meloidogyne chitwoodi were studied for 2 years in a commercial potato field and microplots. Annual second-stage juvenile (J2) densities peaked at harvest in midfall, declined through the winter, and were lowest in early summer. In the field and in one microplot study, population increase displayed trimodal patterns during the 1984 and 1985 seasons. Over-wintering nematodes produced egg masses on roots by 600-800 degree-days base 5 C (DD5) after planting. Second-generation and third-generation eggs hatched by 950-1,100 DD5 and 1,500-1,600 DD5, respectively, and J2 densities rapidly increased in the soil. A fourth generation was observed at 2,150 DD5 in 1985 microplot studies. Tubers were initiated by 450-500 DD5, but J2 were not observed in the tubers until after the second generation hatched at 988-1,166 DD5. A second period of tuber invasion was observed when third generation J2 hatched. The regional variation in M. chitwoodi damage on potato may be explained by degree-day accumulation in different potato production regions of the western United States.

AB  - The ability of plant species to colonize new habitats and persist in changing environments depends on their ability to respond plastically to environmental variation and on the presence of genetic variation, thus allowing adaptation to new conditions. For invasive species in particular, the relationship between phenotypic trait expression, demography, and the quantitative genetic variation that is available to respond to selection are likely to be important determinants of the successful establishment and persistence of populations. However, the magnitude and sources of individual demographic variation in exotic plant populations remain poorly understood. How important is plasticity versus adaptability in populations of invasive species? Among environmental factors, is temperature, soil nutrients, or competition most influential, and at what scales and life stages do they affect the plants? To investigate these questions we planted seeds of the exotic annual plant Erodium brachycarpum into typical pasture habitat in a spatially nested design. Seeds were drawn from 30 inbred lines to enable quantification of genetic effects. Despite a positive population growth rate, a few plants (0.1 %) produced > 50 % of the seeds, suggesting a low effective population size. Emergence and early growth varied by genotype, but as in previous studies on native plants, environmental effects greatly exceeded genetic effects, and survival was unrelated to genotype. Environmental influences shifted from microscale soil compaction and litter depth at emergence through to larger-scale soil nutrient gradients during growth and to competition during later survival and seed production. Temperature had no effect. Most demographic rates were positively correlated, but emergence was negatively correlated with other rates.

AB  - The perceived temperature has been changing rapidly under global warming, and its related extremes have significant impacts on labor productivity and human health. Although numerous thermal indices have been developed to quantify the perceived temperature, impact assessments have not been conducted comprehensively. The lack of exploring the nonlinearity and linearity inherent in thermal indices will lead to biased conclusions. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of 161 indices to create an ensemble of selected thermal indices that represent the linear and nonlinear relationships of climatic conditions and quantify the changes in the perceived temperature and related extremes. Here we find that the increase in the mean perceived temperature can be strongly exaggerated by using nonlinear indices or linear indices that only consider the combined effect of high temperature and humidity. Wind speed incorporated into the schemes of linear indices can largely offset the increase in the perceived temperature induced by the high relative humidity. These two divergent changes can be further enhanced in future exposure to heat stress. Furthermore, our findings reveal an amplification of heatwave durations induced by the combined effects of multiple variables for all thermal indices. Such an amplification leads to a cascade of relatively short-duration heatwaves evolving into super long-lasting heatwaves which are particularly pronounced over low-latitude areas.

AB  - The proteostasis network (PN) regulates protein synthesis, folding, and degradation and is critical for the health and function of all cells. The PN has been extensively studied in the context of aging and age-related diseases, and loss of proteostasis is regarded as a major contributor to many age-associated disorders. In contrast to somatic tissues, an important feature of germ cells is their ability to maintain a healthy proteome across generations. Accumulating evidence has now revealed multiple layers of PN regulation that support germ cell function, determine reproductive capacity during aging, and prioritize reproduction at the expense of somatic health. Here, we review recent insights into these different modes of regulation and their implications for reproductive and somatic aging.

AB  - Background: Environmental temperature has profound consequences for early amphibian development and many field and laboratory studies have examined this. Most laboratory studies that have characterized the influence of temperature on development in amphibians have failed to incorporate the realities of diel temperature fluctuations (DTF), which can be considerable for pond-breeding amphibians.
   Results: We evaluated the effects of different ecologically relevant ranges of DTF compared with effects of constant temperatures on development of embryos and larvae of the Korean fire-bellied toad (Bombina orientalis). We constructed thermal reaction norms for developmental stage, snout-vent length, and tail length by fitting a Gompertz-Gaussian function to measurements taken from embryos after 66 hours of development in 12 different constant temperature environments between 14 degrees C and 36 degrees C. We used these reaction norms as null models to test the hypothesis that developmental effects of DTF are more than the sum of average constant temperature effects over the distribution of temperatures experienced. We predicted from these models that growth and differentiation would be positively correlated with average temperature at low levels of DTF but not at higher levels of DTF. We tested our prediction in the laboratory by rearing B. orientalis embryos at three average temperatures (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) and four levels of thermal variation (0 degrees C, 6 degrees C, 13 degrees C, and 20 degrees C). Several of the observed responses to DTF were significantly different from both predictions of the model and from responses in constant temperature treatments at the same average temperatures. At an average temperature of 24 degrees C, only the highest level of DTF affected differentiation and growth rates, but at both cooler and warmer average temperatures, moderate DTF was enough to slow developmental and tail growth rates.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that both the magnitude of DTF range and thermal averages need to be considered simultaneously when parsing the effects of changing thermal environments on complex developmental responses, particularly when they have potential functional and adaptive significance.

AB  - Pacific salmon provide critical sustenance for millions of people worldwide and have far-reaching impacts on the productivity of ecosystems. Rising temperatures now threaten the persistence of these important fishes(1,2), yet it remains unknown whether populations can adapt. Here, we provide the first evidence that a Pacific salmon has both physiological and genetic capacities to increase its thermal tolerance in response to rising temperatures. In juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a 4 degrees C increase in developmental temperature was associated with a 2 degrees C increase in key measures of the thermal performance of cardiac function(3,4). Moreover, additive genetic effects significantly influenced several measures of cardiac capacity, indicative of heritable variation on which selection can act. However, a lack of both plasticity and genetic variation was found for the arrhythmic temperature of the heart, constraining this upper thermal limit to a maximum of 24.5 +/- 2.2 degrees C. Linking this constraint on thermal tolerance with present-day river temperatures and projected warming scenarios(5), we predict a 17% chance of catastrophic loss in the population by 2100 based on the average warming projection, with this chance increasing to 98% in the maximum warming scenario. Climate change mitigation is thus necessary to ensure the future viability of Pacific salmon populations.

AB  - We have generated a life-extending mutation, yw23, tl Caenorhabditis elegans The mutation is in what appears to be a new aging gene, which we have designated age-2. When homozygous, yw23 produces an increase of mean and maximum life span of about 20% over that of the wild-type strain, N2. Strain HG23 [age-2(yw23)] was obtained by screening for longer life spans among 430 lines of nematodes two generations after exposure to the mutagen ethylmethanesulfonate. Strain HG231 [age-2(yw23)] was obtained after a single oat-crossing of HG23 to NZ. When compared with N2, HG231 exhibits normal motility, slightly higher swimming rates, reduced fertility (especially at higher temperatures), somewhat longer development times, and a slightly larger size at the time of first egg laying. A Gompertz analysis suggests that HG231 extends life span by reducing the initial mortality rate. In generic crosses, yw23 complements other known aging mutants in C. elegans genes-age-1, daf-2, spe-26, clk-1, clk-2, clk-3, and gro-1. A double-mutant strain, HG284, combining mutations in age-1 and age-2, fires longer than animals with individual mutations in either age-1 or age-2, and exhibits a longer life span at 25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C.

AB  - Ocean acidification can reduce the growth and survival of marine species during their larval stages. However, if populations have the genetic capacity to adapt and increase their tolerance of low pH and high pCO(2) levels, this may offset the harmful effects of ocean acidification. By combining controlled breeding experiments with laboratory manipulations of seawater chemistry, we evaluated genetic variation in tolerance of ocean acidification conditions for a nearshore marine fish, the California Grunion (Leuresthes tenuis). Our results indicated that acidification conditions increased overall mortality rates of grunion larvae, but did not have a significant effect on growth. Groups of larvae varied widely with respect to mortality and growth rates in both ambient and acidified conditions. We demonstrate that the potential to evolve in response to ocean acidification is best described by considering additive genetic variation in fitness-related traits under both ambient and acidified conditions and by evaluating the genetic correlation between traits expressed in these environments. We used a multivariate animal model to estimate additive genetic (co)variance in larval growth and mortality rates under both ambient and acidified conditions (low pH/high pCO(2)). Our results suggest appreciable genetic variation in larval mortality rates (h(Ambient)(2) = 0.120; h(Acidified)(2) = 0.183; r(G) = 0.460), but less genetic variation in growth (h(Ambient)(2) = 0.092; h(Acidified)(2) = 0.101; r(G) = 0.135). Maternal effects on larval mortality rates accounted for 26%-36% of the variation in phenotypes, but maternal effects accounted for only 8% of the variation in growth. Collectively, our estimates of genetic variation and covariation suggest that populations of California Grunion have the capacity to adapt relatively quickly to long-term changes in ocean chemistry.

AB  - Penguins are adapted to live in extreme environments, but they can be highly sensitive to climate change, which disrupts penguin life history strategies when it alters the weather, oceanography and critical habitats. For example, in the southwest Atlantic, the distributional range of the ice-obligate emperor and AdElie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted, while the ice-intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward. In the Southern Ocean, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem, ultimately affecting penguins. The interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time, so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly, complicating our understanding of their future population processes. Penguins have long life spans, which slow microevolution, and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming. Therefore, in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges, they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity. However, past species-specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology, and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions. Thus, the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation. Ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions, where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance; species with low adaptability, particularly the ice-obligates, may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats. While future sea-ice contraction around Antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice-obligate penguins, understanding the responses of the ice-intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions, which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models.

TI  - Biomass Power Generation through Direct Integration of Updraft Gasifier and Stirling Engine Combustion System
T2  - ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - Biomass is the largest renewable energy source in the world. Its importance grows gradually in the future energy market. Since most biomass sources are low in energy density and are widespread in space, small-scale biomass conversion system is therefore more competitive than a large stand-alone conversion plant. The current study proposes a small-scale solid biomass power system to explore the viability of direct coupling of an updraft fixed bed gasifier with a Stirling engine. The modified updraft fixed bed gasifier employs an embedded combustor inside the gasifier to fully combust the synthetic gas generated by the gasifier. The flue gas produced by the synthetic gas combustion inside the combustion tube is piped directly to the heater head of the Stirling engine. The engine will then extract and convert the heat contained in the flue gas into electricity automatically. Output depends on heat input. And, the heat input is proportional to the flow rate and temperature of the flue gas. The preliminary study of the proposed direct coupling of an updraft gasifier with a 25 kW Stirling engine demonstrates that full power output could be produced by the current system. It could be found from the current investigation that no auxiliary fuel is required to operate the current system smoothly. The proposed technology and units could be considered as a viable solid biomass power system.

AB  - Joule heating effect is substantial in an electromagnet system due to high density current from current-carrying conductor for high magnetic field generation. In Lab-on-chip (LoC) Magnetically Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) device, Joule heating effect generating high temperature and affecting the biological cells viability is investigated. The temperature rise of the integrated system was measured using resistance temperature detector, RTD Pt100. Three temperature rise conditions which are from the bare spiral-shaped magnet wire, the combination of magnet wire and on-chip magnetic core and combination of magnet wire, on-chip magnetic core and 150 mu m polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer have been investigated. The combination of electromagnet of spiral-shaped magnet wire coil and on-chip magnetic core has reduced the temperature significantly which are, similar to 38 % and similar to 26 % with magnet wire winding, N = 10 (I-DC = 3.0 A, t = 210 s) and N = 20 (I-DC = 2.5 A, t = 210 s) respectively. The reduced Joule heating effect is expected due to silicon chip of high thermal conductivity material enable fast heat dissipation to the surrounding. Therefore, the integration of electromagnet system and on-chip magnetic core has the potential to be used as part of LoC MACS system provided the optimum operating conditions are determined.

AB  - For semiconductor manufacturing, a mature industry, a number of laser techniques are employed in production. Diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) lasers are used in applications that cannot be performed by mechanical, chemical, or other laser fabrication methods as well as where they add value through increased throughput and/or improved process quality. Applications such as edge isolation, wafer scribing/dicing, via formation, laser doping and annealing for Semicon are being applied to crystalline silicon PV manufacture as well as research and development for the next generation of high efficiency cells. Similarly, selective material removal for exposing underlying layers without thermal damage is vital in the production of thin film PV panels. In this paper, some of the most important applications of lasers along with experimental results will be reviewed to illustrate how laser methods can have a significant impact on the development and productivity of the photovoltaic industry.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity has created unique environmental drivers, which may interact to produce unexpected effects. My aim was to conduct a systematic review of the interactive effects of anthropogenic drivers on endocrine responses in non-human animals. The interaction between temperature and light can disrupt reproduction and growth by impacting gonadotropins, thyroid hormones, melatonin, and growth hormone. Temperature and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) interact to modify reproduction with differential effects across generations. The combined effects of light and EDCs can be anxiogenic, so that light-at-night could increase anxiety in wildlife. Light and noise increase glucocorticoid release by themselves, and together can modify interactions between individuals and their environment. The literature detailing interactions between drivers is relatively sparse and there is a need to extend research to a broader range of taxa and interactions. I suggest that incorporating endocrine responses into Adverse Outcome Pathways would be beneficial to improve predictions of environmental effects.

AB  - Unlike most anadromous salmonids, summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss overwinter in rivers rather than the ocean for 6-10 months prior to spring spawning. Overwintering in rivers may make summer steelhead more vulnerable to harvest and other mortality sources than are other anadromous populations, but there has been little systematic study of this life history strategy. Here, we used a large-scale radiotelemetry study to examine the overwintering behaviors and distributions of 26 summer steelhead stocks within the regulated lower Columbia-Snake River hydrosystem. Over 6 years, we monitored 5,939 fish, of which 3,399 successfully reached spawning tributaries or the upper Columbia River basin and were assigned to specific populations. An estimated 12.4% of fish that reached spawning areas overwintered at least partially within the hydrosystem (annual estimates = 6.8-19.6%), while the remainder overwintered in tributaries. Across all populations, later-arriving fish were more likely to overwinter in the hydrosystem; overwintering percentages ranged from less than 1% for fish tagged in June to over 40% for those tagged in October. Proportionately more interior-basin steelhead (Clearwater, Salmon, and Snake River metapopulations) overwintered in the hydrosystem than did fish from lower-river populations. Steelhead were distributed in mixed-stock assemblages throughout the hydrosystem during winter, usually in reservoirs closest to their home rivers but also in nonnatal tributaries. Overwintering fish moved upstream and downstream between reaches in all months; a nadir occurred in early January and peak egress into spawning tributaries was in March. The estimated survival to tributaries was higher for fish that overwintered in the hydrosystem (82%) than for fish that did not (62%); this difference was largely attributable to low winter harvest rates. Our results suggest that large main-stem habitats, including reservoirs, may be widely used by overwintering summer steelhead. The complex migration behaviors of steelhead indicate both the potential for adaptation and possible susceptibility to future river environment changes.

AB  - Many organisms have complex life cycles with distinct life stages that experience different environmental conditions. How does the complexity of life cycles affect the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to climate change? We address this question by exploring several recent case studies and synthetic analyses of insects. First, different life stages may inhabit different microhabitats, and may differ in their thermal sensitivities and other traits that are important for responses to climate. For example, the life stages of Manduca experience different patterns of thermal and hydric variability, and differ in tolerance to high temperatures. Second, life stages may differ in their mechanisms for adaptation to local climatic conditions. For example, in Colias, larvae in different geographic populations and species adapt to local climate via differences in optimal and maximal temperatures for feeding and growth, whereas adults adapt via differences in melanin of the wings and in other morphological traits. Third, we extend a recent analysis of the temperature-dependence of insect population growth to demonstrate how changes in temperature can differently impact juvenile survival and adult reproduction. In both temperate and tropical regions, high rates of adult reproduction in a given environment may not be realized if occasional, high temperatures prevent survival to maturity. This suggests that considering the differing responses of multiple life stages is essential to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change.

AB  - The speed at which species adapt depends partly on the rates of beneficial adaptation generation and how quickly they spread within and among populations. Natural rates of adaptation of corals may not be able to keep pace with climate warming. Several interventions have been proposed to fast-track thermal adaptation, including the intentional translocation of warm-adapted adults or their offspring (assisted gene flow, AGF) and the ex situ crossing of warm-adapted corals with conspecifics from cooler reefs (hybridization or selective breeding) and field deployment of those offspring. The introgression of temperature tolerance loci into the genomic background of cooler-environment corals aims to facilitate adaptation to warming while maintaining fitness under local conditions. Here we use research on selective sweeps and connectivity to understand the spread of adaptive variants as it applies to AGF on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), focusing on the genus Acropora. Using larval biophysical dispersal modeling, we estimate levels of natural connectivity in warm-adapted northern corals. We then model the spread of adaptive variants from single and multiple reefs and assess if the natural and assisted spread of adaptive variants will occur fast enough to prepare receiving central and southern populations given current rates of warming. We also estimate fixation rates and spatial extent of fixation under multiple release scenarios to inform intervention design. Our results suggest that thermal tolerance is unlikely to spread beyond northern reefs to the central and southern GBR without intervention, and if it does, 30+ generations are needed for adaptive gene variants to reach fixation even under multiple release scenarios. We argue that if translocation, breeding, and reseeding risks are managed, AGF using multiple release reefs can be beneficial for the restoration of coral populations. These interventions should be considered in addition to conventional management and accompanied by strong mitigation of CO2 emissions.

KW  - OPTIMIZATION
AB  - The sensor placement problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem with Boolean decision variables. A new multi objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is proposed for approximating and analyzing the set of Pareto optimal solutions. The evaluation of the objective functions requires the execution of a hydraulic simulation model of the network. To organize the simulation results a data structure is proposed which enables the dynamic representation of a sensor placement and its fitness as a heatmap. This allows the definition of information spaces, in which the fitness of a placement can be represented as a matrix or, in probabilistic terms as a histogram. The key element in the new algorithm is this probabilistic representation which is embedded in a space endowed with a metric based on a specific notion of distance. Among several distances between probability distributions the Wasserstein (WST) distance has been selected: WST has enabled to derive new genetic operators, indicators of the quality of the Pareto set and criteria to choose among the Pareto solutions. The new algorithm has been tested on a benchmark water distribution network with two objective functions showing an improvement over NSGA-II, in particular for low generation counts, making it a good candidate for expensive black-box multi-objective optimization

AB  - This biology of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley and T. exiguum Pinto & Platner in Plutella xylostella (L.) eggs was studied at seven constant temperatures, and the thermal requirements and number of generations of both parasitoids was determined for some crucifers producers of the states of Espirito Santo and Pernambuco. Eggs of P. xylostella were submitted to parasitism by T pretiosum and T exiguum for 5h, and transferred to climatic chambers regulated to 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30 and 32degreesC. The developmental time was influenced by the temperature varying from 6.8 to 23.1 days for T pretiosum and 6.9 to 22.0 days for T exiguum at 32 and 18degreesC, respectively. The percentage of emergence was higher at 28degreesC, reaching 86% for both species. The sex ratio was always 1 for T pretiosum and varied from 0.6 to 0.9 for T exiguum. The thermal constant (K) and base temperature (Tb) were higher for T exiguum (129.99 days degrees and 13.13degreesC) when compared with T pretiosum (123.03 days degrees and 12.52degreesC).

AB  - Partitioning of the niche space is a mechanism used to explain the coexistence of similar species. Ectotherms have variable body temperatures and their body temperatures influence performance and, ultimately, fitness. Therefore, many ectotherms use behavioral thermoregulation to avoid reduced capacities associated with body temperatures far from the optimal temperature for performance. Several authors have proposed that thermal niche partitioning in response to interspecific competition is a mechanism that allows the coexistence of similar species of ectotherms. We reviewed studies on thermal resource partitioning to evaluate the evidence for this hypothesis. In almost all studies, there was insufficient evidence to conclude unequivocally that thermal resource partitioning allowed species coexistence. Future studies should include sites where species are sympatric and sites where they are allopatric to rule out alternative mechanisms that cause differences in thermal traits between coexisting species. There is evidence of conservatism in the evolution of most thermal traits across a wide range of taxa, but thermal performance curves and preferred temperatures do respond to strong selection under laboratory conditions. Thus, there is potential for selection to act on thermal traits in response to interspecific competition. Nevertheless, more stringent tests of the thermal resource partitioning hypothesis are required before we can assess whether it is widespread in communities of ectotherms in nature.

AB  - It has frequently been suggested that trait heritabilities are environmentally sensitive, and there are genetic trade-offs between tolerating different environments such as hot and cold or constant and fluctuating temperatures. Future climate predictions suggest an increase in both temperatures and their fluctuations. How species will respond to these changes is uncertain, particularly as there is a lack of studies which compare genetic performances in constant vs. fluctuating environments. In this study, we used a nested full-sib/half-sib breeding design to examine how the genetic variances and heritabilities of egg-to-adult viability differ at high and low temperatures with and without daily fluctuations in temperatures using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. Although egg-to-adult viability was clearly sensitive to developmental temperatures, heritabilities were not particularly sensitive to developmental temperatures. Moreover, we found that egg-to-adult viabilities at different developmental temperatures were positively correlated, suggesting a common genetic background for egg-to-adult viability at different temperatures. Finding both a uniform genetic background coupled with rather low heritabilities insensitive to temperatures, our results suggest evolutionary responses are unlikely to be limited by temperature effects on genetic parameters or negative genetic correlations, but by the direct effects of stressful temperatures on egg-to-adult viability accompanied with low heritabilities.

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the number of generations and cycle duration of the southern red mite, coffee berry borer, and coffee leaf miner using the thermal index to assist in controlling these main coffee pests in the state of Parana, Brazil. The data of maximum and minimum air temperature (degrees C) and precipitation (mm) of all municipalities in the state from 1984 to 2018 were collected from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA/ POWER). The reference evapotranspiration was estimated using the (Camargo Campinas IAC Boletim 116:9, 1971) method and the water balance was calculated using the method of (Thornthwaite C, Mather J (1955) The water balance publications in climatology, 8 (1). DIT, Laboratory of climatology, Centerton, NJ, USA). The basal temperature of each pest minus the average temperature of the years was used to calculate the degrees-day, the duration of the pest cycle, and the number of generations per year. The influence of altitude on the development of coffee pests was measured using the Pearson correlation. The thermal index is able to estimate the damage caused by coffee pests in the state of Para, Brazil. Coffee pests show greater severity in the north of Parana, in the regions with the highest temperatures. It is the same region that concentrates most of the coffee production of the state. The results of the life cycle and number of generations were interpolated for the entire state using the kriging method. Coffee pests showed the highest severity in the north region of the state of Parana, more specifically in the Northwest, North Central, and West Central mesoregions. These regions have concentrated most of the state's coffee production. Mesoregions with the highest coffee production in the state showed higher susceptibility to coffee pests. Altitude showed a high correlation (r> 0.6) with the cycle variability and number of generations of coffee pests. The average cycles of the coffee berry borer, coffee leaf miner, and southern red mite are 24.13 (+/- 8.34), 45.64 (+/- 18.61), and 21.51 (+/- 3.51) days, respectively. The average annual generation was 16.67 (+/- 4.77), 9.02 (+/- 2.75), and 17.32 (+/- 2.63) generations, for the coffee berry borer, the coffee red mite, and the southern red mite, respectively.

AB  - Survival to old age in natural populations is enhanced by high vitality and resilience which depends upon substantial homeostasis and energetic amd metabolic efficiency underlain by genes for stress resistance. Under this assumption increased longevity follows from primary selection for stress resistance where stress targets energy carriers. Furthermore old and young fitness should be correlated irrespective of age under the stressful selection regime of natural populations. In contrast, antagonistic pleiotropy is most likely under the less rigorous selection regime of well-nourished humans and laboratory populations surviving to old age. Similarly, hormesis for longevity, for example from a mild temperature stress or restricted food intake is most likely under benign environmental conditions. Assuming that aging in natural populations depends upon ecological circumstances, large evolutionary increases in life span are unlikely under the stress theory of aging since organisms are frequently close to their limits of survival where metabolic efficiency is at a premium. Exceptions can occur in island populations and for mutants under laboratory conditions since the risks from environmental hazards are reduced, and life span becomes extended as a consequence. In modern human populations, selection for stress resistance is less intense than in earlier times which should be permissive of the accumulation of stress-sensitive mutants under the mutation-accumulation theory of aging. However, this process is ultimately likely to restrict the evolution of life-span extensions in the future especially if abiotic conditions deteriorate, when survival would depend more directly on metabolic efficiency under stress.

AB  - The present work contributes to an accurate quantification method of the parameters of the biotic potential of Encarsia formosa Gahan (Hymenoptera Aphelinidae), applicable to other species of whitefly parasitoids. The oviposition devices are easy to make and they allow standardisation of a whitefly parasitoid Study by daily observations of the main parameters Such as fecundity, longevity and host-feeding by adult parasitoids, which are important for the parasitoids mass-production and biological control of whiteflies. Results show that two physical parameters determine the expression of biotic potential: the confinement induces all important decrease of the fecundity and longevity off. formosa the position of plant leaf with nymphs of Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Homoptera Aleyrodidae) that the parasitoid female call explore for oviposition and host-feeding influences Oil the biotic potential. The heterogeneity observed in the replicates suggests that during their mass-processing the parasitoids suffer abiotic conditions leading to changes in the biotic potential of progeny.
   Under strictly constant laboratory conditions of temperature, hygrometry and photoperiod, an identical trend is observed for mother and daughter generations: fecundity and longevity are higher in aired oviposition devices and exploitable host-nymphs oil leaf situated on top of device. In these laboratory conditions, results for fecundity and longevity are better, and the same trend is observed for host-feeding of mother and daughter generations.
   The above defined standardised methodology will allow comparison of the biotic potential of other species of whitefly parasitoids because it reduces variations of abiotic origin.

AB  - Crustacean larvae have served as distinguished models in the field of Ecological Developmental Biology ("EcoDevo") for many decades, a discipline that examines how developmental mechanisms and their resulting phenotype depend on the environmental context. A contemporary line of research in EcoDevo aims at gaining insights into the immediate tolerance of organisms and their evolutionary potential to adapt to the changing abiotic and biotic environmental conditions created by anthropogenic climate change. Thus, an EcoDevo perspective may be critical to understand and predict the future of organisms in a changing world. Many decapod crustaceans display a complex life cycle that includes pelagic larvae and, in many subgroups, benthic juvenile-adult stages so that a niche shift occurs during the transition from the larval to the juvenile phase. Already at hatching, the larvae possess a wealth of organ systems, many of which also characterise the adult animals, necessary for autonomously surviving and developing in the plankton and suited to respond adaptively to fluctuations of environmental drivers. They also display a rich behavioural repertoire that allows for responses to environmental key factors such as light, hydrostatic pressure, tidal currents, and temperature. Cells, tissues, and organs are at the basis of larval survival, and as the larvae develop, their organs continue to grow in size and complexity. To study organ development, researchers need a suite of state-of-the-art methods adapted to the usually very small size of the larvae. This review and the companion paper set out to provide an overview of methods to study organogenesis in decapod larvae. This first section focuses on larval rearing, preparation, and fixation, whereas the second describes methods to study cells, tissues, and organs.

AB  - Although natural populations can harbor evolutionary potential to adapt genetically to chemical stress, it is often thought that natural selection leads to a general reduction of genetic diversity and involves costs. Here, a 10 week microevolution experiment was conducted with a genetically diverse and representative sample of one natural Daphnia magna population that was exposed to copper and zinc. Both Cu- and Zn-selected populations developed a significantly higher metal tolerance (i.e., genetic adaptation), indicated by higher reproduction probabilities of clonal lines in Cu and Zn exposures than observed for the original and control populations. The complete recovery of the population densities after 10 weeks of Zn selection (following an initial decrease of 74%) illustrates an example of evolutionary rescue. Microsatellite genotyping revealed a decrease in clonal diversity but no change in allelic richness, and showed an excess in heterozygosity in the Cu- and Zn-selected populations compared to the control and original populations. The excess heterozygosity in metal-selected populations that we observed has important consequences for risk assessment, as it contributes to the maintenance of a higher allelic diversity under multigenerational chemical exposure. This study is, to our knowledge, the first report of an increase in heterozygosity following multigenerational exposure to metal stress, despite a decline in clonal diversity. In a follow-up study with the Zn-selected populations, we observed no effect of Zn selection on the tolerance to heat and cyanobacteria. However, we observed higher tolerance to Cd in the Zn-selected than in the original and control populations if the 20% effective concentration of Cd was considered (cross-tolerance). Our results suggest only limited costs of adaptation but future research is needed to evaluate the adaptive potential of metal-selected populations to novel stressors and to determine to what extent increased heterozygosity is preserved after genetic recombination following periods of sexual reproduction.

AB  - Thermoelectric generators have strong potential for aerospace and aircraft applications. However, traditional manufacturing methods for thermoelectric devices severely limit device adaptability and consequently marketability. Laser powder bed fusion is an additive manufacturing method which shows promising potential for producing thermoelectric devices. Thermoelectric materials pose unique challenges compared to metals because of low thermal conductivity, brittle fracture characteristics, and irregular powder particle morphologies. Herein, we communicate processing procedures to fabricate thermoelectric parts of Bi2Te3 through laser powder bed fusion. We identify the successful combination of key process parameters-laser power, scan speed, hatch distance, and powder layer thickness-to achieve high-quality parts in terms of density and physical properties, and we demonstrate the impact of process parameter variation on built part quality. While it cannot exclusively determine part quality, the volumetric energy density is a useful guide in deciding process parameters for thermoelectric materials, and the optimal value is between 9 and 11 J/mm(3) for Bi2Te3. We demonstrate successful fabrication of different freeform geometries of Bi2Te3 powders. The results suggest it is possible to extend this method more broadly to other semiconductor materials, including thermoelectric power generation materials applicable for space applications.

AB  - P>1. Physiological and evolutionary responses underlying thermal adaptation and acclimation are often investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Such studies may fail to assess ecologically relevant parameters as they do not account for the complexity of the natural environment.
   2. We investigated a population of Drosophila melanogaster for performance at low temperature conditions in the field using release recapture assays and in the laboratory using standard cold resistance assays. The aim of the study was to get a better understanding of the nature and underlying mechanisms of the trait measured in field recapture studies and the association between field performance and fitness measures estimated in the laboratory.
   3. We performed one generation of selection on the ability to reach a resource at low temperature under field conditions. Flies that reached a resource ('mobile') and those that never left the release site ('stationary') were reared to the F1 and F2 generation in the laboratory. Subsequent field releases with these flies demonstrated a clear genetic differentiation between mobile and stationary flies in their ability to reach resources at low temperatures in the field. This indicates that mobility at low temperature is under additive genetic influence. In contrast mobile and stationary flies were generally indistinguishable when tested in standard laboratory tests of cold performance. The genetic differentiation between the two sub-populations was not linked to allelic variation in known candidate genes for cold adaptation. However, using transcriptomics we identified new candidate genes (transcripts) and pathways that differed between the mobile and stationary flies.
   4. The current study reveals an irregular relationship between cold performance in the field and in the laboratory. Based on these results, we suggest that the ecological relevance of laboratory assays should be evaluated more critically in studies of thermal adaptation and hardening/acclimation.

AB  - Increasing temperatures are likely to impact ectothermic pests of fruits and nuts. This paper aims to assess changes to pest pressure in California's US$0.7 billion walnut industry due to recent historic and projected future temperature changes. For two past (1950 and 2000) and 18 future climate scenarios (2041-2060 and 2080-2099; each for three General Circulation Models and three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios), 100 years of hourly temperature were generated for 205 locations. Degree-day models were used to project mean generation numbers for codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.), navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella Walker), two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and European red mite (Panonychus ulmi Koch). In the Central Valley, the number of codling moth generations predicted for degree days accumulated between April 1 and October 1 rose from 2-4 in 1950 to 3-5 among all future scenarios. Generation numbers increased from 10-18 to 14-24 for two-spotted spider mite, from 9-14 to 14-20 for European red mite, and from 2-4 to up to 5 for navel orangeworm. Overall pest pressure can thus be expected to increase substantially. Our study did not include the possibility of higher winter survival rates, leading to higher initial pest counts in spring, or of extended pest development times in the summer, factors that are likely to exacerbate future pest pressure. On the other hand, initiation of diapause may prevent an extension of the season length for arthropods, and higher incidence of heat death in summer may constrain pest population sizes. More information on the impact of climate change on complex agroecological food webs and on the response of pests to high temperatures is needed for improving the reliability of projections.

AB  - Mediterranean benthic ecosystems have been deeply impacted by thermal anomalies during the last decades. Adaptive capacities for marine species facing climate change can include individual acclimatization (during the individual life-span) and genetic selection (considered at the population level). The Mediterranean red coral, Corallium rubrum, is well suited to study adaptive evolution in heterogeneous environment. This is a sessile species, which inhabits contrasted environments with a strong genetic structure, and differential responses to thermal stress between populations. This study proposes an integrative study of the adaptive response of C. rubrum to thermal stress. To understand the underlying mechanisms of thermal adaptation in this species, we studied three populations of C rubrum from different depths (5 m, 20 m and 40 m depths) and therefore different thermal regimes in the same area. We first surveyed in situ the thermal environment and the corresponding stress levels at the different depths studied here. Then we submitted red coral colonies to different heat shocks in aquaria that mimicked in situ stresses (common garden conditions). We measured the expression levels of several candidate genes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) showed significant differences of expression depending on the depth of origin of the individuals and of their thermal history. Based on a complementary analysis of genetic structure, our study shows the evolution of a differential response at a local scale which might be explained by local adaptation or acclimatization. Our results also underline the trade-off between fitness and potential deleterious consequences linked to heat stress response. It also strongly emphasizes the conservation value of populations living at the edge of the species' range, as they represent an irreplaceable genetic pool for evolutionary rescue.

AB  - Slag accounts for most of the residuals or by-products of the steel manufacturing process and represents a not inconsiderable amount of energy waste and CO2 emissions. Energy recovery from steel mill slags is not actually performed because of the difficulty of the industrial implementation, but the actual demand and the incentives for new electricity generation plants based on renewable energies and on industrial waste heat recovery offer a new opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of this process. This article presents a review of the slag energy potential on a global scale, and a proposal for a recovery plant in the factories of Arcelor-Mittal in Asturias (Spain), based on a steam Rankine cycle for electricity production in a turbine. The plant production and viability have been analyzed using the typical technical and economic values for this kind of plant. Also, a parametric study has been performed on the heat recuperator efficiency and investment rate.

KW  - damselflies

KW  - survival

AB  - Morphological variation is widespread, and one case is that of female morphs in damselfly insects. Current knowledge indicates that these female morphs are maintained by a fitness balance whereby male-like, clear-colored females (i.e. andromorphs) are more likely to "escape" from male harassment given their male mimicking compared to dark females (i.e. gynomorph). However, males can learn to distinguish the more frequent morph, leading to a frequency-dependent selection. Alternative to frequency-dependent selection, we tested whether temperature plays a role in driving female morph activity and survival. We used Ischnura denticollis damselflies to test for differences between female morphs and males in: (a) daily activity; (b) time to resume activity following a chilling event (10 degrees C); and, (c) survival at 30, 35 and 40 degrees C. There was no difference in activity among groups after a chilling event. However, gynomorph females were more active early in the day (ca. 17 degrees C) and less active by 1600 hrs (after reaching 32 degrees C), and had lower thermal tolerance than andromorph females. Thus, high temperatures may act against gynomorph females. This implies a role for high temperatures in the maintenance of female polymorphism.

AB  - Chiles hydroelectric industry was privatized in 1985, but required to operate within a regulatory framework designed to achieve a competitive outcome. A centralized dispatch center was established to ensure production at minimum cost, subject to constraints on minimum release and minimum reservoir stock. A reluctance to rapidly reduce the industry work force may also have existed. We develop a constrained cost-minimization model for thermal and hydro generation to obtain the shadow price of water and to determine the qualitative effect of these constraints on allocative efficiency. Using panel data from 1986-1997, we assess the economic efficiency of the hydro industry by estimating a stochastic distance frontier and price equations from the dual cost-minimization problem. We find dramatic increases in technical change and productivity change, with positive efficiency change for all years but the last. We also observe a dramatic decline in allocative inefficiencies over our sample period. The share of hydro generation from run-of-river and thermal plants relative to reservoir plants has increased, presumably in reaction to the water release and reservoir stock constraints, reducing the relative over-utilization of capital to water from the pre-1985 regime. Further, the over-utilization of labor to capital and water has fallen over time. However, considerable allocative inefficiencies remain, consistent with our finding of industry-wide scale economies. Substantial cost savings would result if technical and allocative efficiency were eliminated.

AB  - The outdoor establishment of non-native biocontrol agents released for inundative control of glasshouse pests is determined primarily by two factors: ecophysiological compatibility with local climate, particularly winter cold tolerance, and ability to locate and utilise wild prey. Observations on the number and diversity of acceptable wild prey as part of an assessment of establishment potential therefore overlap with more focused studies to determine host range. This study investigated two aspects of the interactions between biocontrol agents and non-target prey that are rarely considered in tests for establishment or host range: the role of different host plant-prey associations in modifying the development and reproduction of biocontrol agents, and the longer term sustainability of such relationships beyond the single generation observed in most laboratory studies. Using the glasshouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) predator Macrolophus caliginosus Wagner (Hemiptera: Miridae) as a case study, the mirid was able to sustain viable populations over three generations on the related cabbage whitefly Aleyrodes proletella (Linnaeus) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), including when these prey were feeding on different host plants (Chinese cabbage, cabbage and Brussels sprout). However, the rate of development, fecundity and mortality of the predator varied between the different prey and host plant combinations, and in all cases differed than when feeding on its glasshouse prey T. vaporariorum reared on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The results are discussed in the light of the current debate on methods for conducting host range testing as part of an environmental risk assessment.

Males and females were exposed separately to beta-cyfluthrin (one tenth of the calculated LC50 value) mixed in the diet for 24, 48 and 72 h. Fecundity, hatchability, pupation, adult emergence, larval, pupal and total developmental periods were evaluated in the F, generation after various cross combinations. A reduction in fecundity, egg hatching, number of larvae, pupae, adults and prolongation of larval, pupal and total developmental periods was observed. A significant reduction (p<0.05) in fecundity was observed only on the treated diet after treatment of both the sexes. Maximum effects were observed after 72 h treatment followed by 48 and 24 h. Males were found to be more susceptible to beta-cyfluthrin as compared to the females.

AB  - Background: A cylindrical piezoelectric element and a specific multi-channel circular microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-transducer array of ultrasonic system were used for ultrasonic energy generation and ablation. A relatively long time is required for the heat to be conducted to the target position. Ultrasound thermal therapy has great potential for treating deep hyperplastic tissues and tumors, such as breast cancer and liver tumors. Methods: Ultrasound ablation technology produces thermal energy by heating the surface of a target, and the heat gradually penetrates to the target's interior. Beamforming was performed to observe energy distribution. A resonance method was used to generate ablation energy for verification. Energy was generated according to the coordinates of geometric graph positions to reach the ablation temperature. Results: The mean resonance frequency of Channels 1-8 was 2.5 MHz, and the cylindrical piezoelectric ultrasonic element of Channel A was 4.2546 omega at 5.7946 MHz. High-intensity ultrasound has gradually been applied in clinical treatment. Widely adopted, ultrasonic hyperthermia involves the use of high-intensity ultrasound to heat tissues at 42-45 degrees C for 30-60 min. Conclusion: In the ultrasonic energy method, when the target position reaches a temperature that significantly reduces the cell viability (46.9 degrees C), protein surface modification occurs on the surface of the target.

AB  - An alternative method for fire smoke toxicity testing using human lung cells has been investigated. A laboratory-scale vertical tube furnace was used for the generation of combustion products. Experiments were conducted under isothermal oxidative non-flaming conditions. A range of building and train interiors including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), fiberglass reinforced polymer (FRP), and melamine-faced plywood (MFP) were studied. The exposure of combustion toxicants to human lung cells (A549) at the air/liquid interface was acquired using a Harvard Navicyte Chamber. Cytotoxic effects on human cells were assessed based on cell viability using the MTS assay (Promega). Cytotoxicity results were expressed as NOAEC (No Observable Adverse Effect Concentration), IC10 (10% inhibitory concentration), IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) and total lethal concentration (TLC) values (mg/L). These cytotoxicity results were compared to published combustion toxicity data. Mass loss data and toxic product yield were also determined. The following toxicity ranking was observed from the most toxic to the least toxic: PVC > PE > PP > FRP-10 > PC > FRP-16 > MFP. The method described here could potentially be an alternative to current fire toxicity standard test methods. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reproductive isolation is often achieved when genes that are neutral or beneficial in their genomic background become functionally incompatible in a foreign genomic background, causing inviability, sterility or other forms of low fitness in hybrids. Recent studies suggest that mitonuclear interactions are among the initial incompatibilities to evolve at early stages of population divergence across taxa. Yet, the genomic architecture of mitonuclear incompatibilities has rarely been elucidated. We employ an experimental evolution approach starting with low-fitness F-2 interpopulation hybrids of the copepod Tigriopus califomicus, in which frequencies of compatible and incompatible nuclear alleles change in response to an alternative mitochondrial background. After about nine generations, we observe a generalized increase in population size and in survivorship, suggesting efficiency of selection against maladaptive phenotypes. Whole genome sequencing of evolved populations showed some consistent allele frequency changes across three replicates of each reciprocal cross, but markedly different patterns between mitochondria! backgrounds. In only a few regions (similar to 6.5% of the genome), the same parental allele was overrepresented irrespective of the mitochondrial background. About 33% of the genome showed allele frequency changes consistent with divergent selection, with the location of these genomic regions strongly differing between mitochondrial backgrounds. In 87% and 89% of these genomic regions, the dominant nuclear allele matched the associated mitochondrial background, consistent with mitonuclear co-adaptation. These results suggest that mitonuclear incompatibilities have a complex polygenic architecture that differs between populations, potentially generating genome-wide barriers to gene flow between closely related taxa.

AB  - Maternally transmitted endosymbionts of insects are ubiquitous in nature and play diverse roles in the ecology and evolution of their hosts. To persist in host lineages, many symbionts manipulate host reproduction to their advantage (e. g. cytoplasmic incompatibility and male-killing), or confer fitness benefits to their hosts (e. g. metabolic provisioning and defense against natural enemies). Recent studies suggest that strains of the bacterial genus Spiroplasma protect their host (flies in the genus Drosophila) against parasitoid attack. The Spiroplasma-conferred protection is partial and flies surviving a wasp attack have reduced adult longevity and fecundity. Therefore, it is unclear whether protection against wasps alone can counter Spiroplasma loss by imperfect maternal transmission and any possible fitness costs to harboring Spiroplasma. To address this question, we conducted a population cage study comparing Spiroplasma frequencies over time (host generations) under conditions of high wasp pressure and no wasp pressure. A dramatic increase of Spiroplasma prevalence was observed under high wasp pressure. In contrast, Spiroplasma prevalence in the absence of wasps did not change significantly over time; a pattern consistent with random drift. Thus, the defensive mechanism may contribute to the high prevalence of Spiroplasma in host populations despite imperfect vertical transmission.

AB  - Postharvest quarantine treatments using high temperatures have been developed for various commodities. There are a wide range of insect pests that are the target of these treatments. In order to make heat treatments effective against these pests, the effects of high temperatures on insect physiology must be understood. Insects, being poikilothermic, are particularly sensitive to heat. Nearly every system studied in insects has demonstrated sensitivity to heat. Studies on the effects of heat in insect metabolism demonstrate some adaptability to thermally challenging environments. Respiration, as to be expected, is also effected by heat, and as the body temperature of the insect increases, there are concomitant increases in both metabolism and respiration up to a critical thermal limit. The effects of heat on the nervous and endocrine systems is another area where elevated temperatures wreck havoc. Changes in behavior and development have been documented as resulting from heat treatments. Among the most studied responses of insects to heat is the elicitation of heat shock proteins. The impact of these proteins on thermotolerance are still being investigated. Models of thermal damage leading to the death of the insect are discussed as well as current studies in describing the events of thermal death. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A stable association of the stress-tolerant zooxanthellae, Symbiodinium clade D, with the low-temperature-tolerant coral, Oulastrea crispata (Scleractinia: Faviidae) in subtropical non-reefal coral communities. Zoological Studies 42(4): 540-550. We examined spatial and temporal zooxanthellae diversity in a low-temperature-tolerant coral, Oulastrea crispata, from 2 subtropical non-reefal coral communities, the Penghu Islands (the Pescadores), Taiwan and from Hong Kong, China using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of partial nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (nssrDNA) and large subunit ribosomal DNA (nlsrDNA), together with phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. Oulastrea crispata occurs commonly on shallow reef depressions and on turbid bay bedrock inhabited by only a few other corals, and is a pioneer coral colonizing artificial substrates where environmental disturbance is high. This study demonstrates that the zooxanthellae associated with O. crispata, in Penghu and in Hong Kong belong to Symbiodinium clade D, a clade of zooxanthellae formally proposed to be stress tolerant in marginal habitats (Toiler et al. 2001a). Analyses of zooxanthellae diversity showed no apparent symbiosis polymorphism on either a spatial or temporal scale, suggesting that the association with Symbiodinium clade D is stable in O. crispata. Oulastrea crispata possesses opportunistic life history traits, including a variety of reproductive strategies and physiological tolerances, enabling it to colonize a variety of substrata unfavorable to other corals. Our finding showed a stable association with a stress-tolerant symbiont which may provide a key to how O. crispata can achieve such physiological adaptability.

AB  - The effect of inbreeding on two reproductive traits (number of birth per clutch and percentage of sexually mature animals per clutch) on three consecutive generations of full sibs of edible snail raised under laboratory conditions (20-25degreesC temperature; 70-90% relative humidity) was studied. Inbreeding effect was negative for both traits. When F values increased from 0.25 to 0.50, percentages of sexually mature animals after 120 days from birth, decreased from 59 to 18% and the number of birth per clutch decreased from 94 to 53. Population size of at least 100 non related mating snail replaced after 10 generations to avoid inbreeding effect is recommended.

AB  - This paper provides a technology overview of integrated motor drives (IMDs), with a focus on thermal management of high-specific-output and high-efficiency electrical machines. The early examples of integrating electronics with electrical machines were introduced in the 1960's. Here, both passive and active cooling techniques were employed to provide compact and robust electronics-motor systems, predominantly for automotive and aerospace applications. The latest examples of IMDs share the same generic concepts of thermal management, where dedicated or shared cooling of the individual IMD subsystems is used. However, the modern IMDs illustrate a more comprehensive integration approach, where the complete power electronics inverter and electrical machine are frequently accompanied by other subsystems, e.g. mechanical transmission, suspension, clutching, braking and others. Again, the automotive and aerospace industries have been paving the way towards high-specific-output and high-efficiency IMDs, but it is important to note that the low-power applications, e.g. consumers electronics, health and beauty goods, home appliances, garden and power tools, personal mobility vehicles and many others have been adopting the IMDs for decades now. Interestingly, some of the generic concepts first successfully introduced in low-power devices found their use in more demanding high-power applications.In general, thermal management of electrical machines in IMDs is analogous to that used in discrete motor drives (DMDs). The continuous drive towards high-specific-output and high-efficiency electrical machines have been imposing ever more demanding challenges associated with effective heat removal from the machine composite structure, with multiple localised and non-homogenous heat sources. It is important to note that balancing both generated power losses (heat), and available heat removal is essential for successful implementation of a specific machine design. The existing examples of advanced motor cooling offer a more targeted approach for removing heat directly or indirectly from the individual heat sources, e.g. direct winding oil spray cooling, forced air rotor cooling, and indirect stator-winding heat exchanger cooling, stator-winding heat guide transport. Some of the concepts originate from high-power and high-efficiency electrical machines for power generation, others are enabled by the developments in new materials and manufacturing techniques. It is evident that a more focused thermal management aiming at specific heat sources is the most effective. Here, the use of additive manufacturing, highly integrated heat exchangers, multi-functional composite materials and phase change heat transport and heat storage are some of the solutions, which have already shown a great promise for the next generation of IMDs.

AB  - The potential to liberate steam production capacity for power generation has been assessed using actual energy consumption data and the recorded seasonal consumption fluctuations for a kraft pulp mill. The revenues from power production are compared with possible energy savings, achieved through enhancement of the process efficiency using an absorption heat pump (AHP). Bunker oil, wood bark and black liquor, the fuels used, have very different costs and heating values. The net present value (NPV) was used with a simple payback time (SPB) for the comparison of three cases: (i) power production from liberated steam capacity using a cogeneration unit, (ii) maximised energy savings using an AHP and (iii) power production combined with heat upgrading and cold production using a trigeneration unit. The results show economic viability of all options investigated. The stand-alone AHP achieves the shortest SPB time, whereas the trigeneration option reaches the highest NPV and therefore the best overall economics. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A fundamental question in life-history evolution is how organisms cope with fluctuating environments, including variation between stressful and benign conditions. For short-lived organisms, environments commonly vary between generations. Using a novel experimental design, we exposed wild-derived Drosophila melanogaster to three different selection regimes: one where generations alternated between starvation and benign conditions, and starvation was always preceded by early exposure to cold; another where starvation and benign conditions alternated in the same way, but cold shock sometimes preceded starvation and sometimes benign conditions; and a third where conditions were always benign. Using six replicate populations per selection regime, we found that selected flies increased their starvation resistance, most strongly for the regime where cold and starvation were reliably combined, and this occurred without decreased fecundity or extended developmental time. The selected flies became stress resistant, displayed a pronounced increase in early life food intake and resource storage. In contrast to previous experiments selecting for increased starvation resistance in D. melanogaster, we did not find increased storage of lipids as the main response, but instead that, in particular for females, storage of carbohydrates was more pronounced. We argue that faster mobilization of carbohydrates is advantageous in fluctuating environments and conclude that the phenotype that evolved in our experiment corresponds to a compromise between the requirements of stressful and benign environments.

AB  - This study determined the effect of cadmium (Cd) toxicity comparatively on two copepods, Eurytemora affinis (Poppe 1880) from a temperate region (Seine Estuary, France) and Pseudodiaptomus annandalei (Sewell 1919) from a subtropical region (Danshuei Estuary, Taiwan), according to their sex and reproductive stages. In addition, the effect of Cd to their life cycle traits was quantified. In the first experiment, both copepod sexes were exposed to 40, 80, 150, 220, and 360 A mu g/L of Cd and a control cultured in salinity 15, except that the temperature was 18 A degrees C for E. affinis and 26 A degrees C for P. annandalei. This allowed calculating median lethal concentration (LC50) of Cd after 96 h. This was 120.6 A mu g/L Cd for P. annandalei males which were almost twice as sensitive as P. annandalei females (LC50 = 239.5 A mu g/L Cd). For E. affinis females, the LC50 was 90.04 A mu g/L Cd, reflecting a 1.4 times higher sensitivity of females than of males (LC50 = 127.75 A mu g/L Cd). The males of both species were similarly sensitive; however, the E. affinis females were 2.7 times more sensitive than the P. annandalei females. We also compared the sensitivity of ovigerous females (OVF) and non-ovigerous females (NOF) of both species to Cd. Mortality was higher in NOF than in OVF of both copepod species in both the control and the 40 A mu g/L Cd treatment. Finally, the total population, fecundity and female morphology of both copepod species were estimated after exposing one generation cycle (nauplius to adult) to 40 mu g/L Cd (for E. affinis) and 160 mu g/L Cd (for P. annandalei). A significant decrease in cohort production, survival and clutch size but no significant difference in the prosome length of both copepod species exposed to Cd were detected. The ratio of OVF:NOF was high in both copepod species exposed to Cd. Cd toxicity did not significantly affect the M:F sex ratio and % OVF of E. affinis. However, the effect of Cd toxicity in P. annandalei was significant in the M:F sex ratio and was in favor of females and their reproductive activities due to an increase in % OVF. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in total production of P. annandalei due to high mortality in their nauplii and copepodid developmental stages. Toxicity to Cd appears to be affected by multiple factors including sex, reproductive life stage and species. The ecological implication of Cd toxicity on E. affinis and P. annandalei copepod ecology is more related to a skewed sex ratio, low egg production, reduced hatchability and reduced survival that affects the recruitment potential of the copepod nauplii resulting in a decreasing copepod population. Mortality, reproduction and population growth of model species may provide important bio-indicators for environmental risk assessment.

AB  - The remaining carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will probably be exhausted within this decade(1,2). Carbon debt(3) generated thereafter will need to be compensated by net-negative emissions(4). However, economic policy instruments to guarantee potentially very costly net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) have not yet been devised. Here we propose intertemporal instruments to provide the basis for widely applied carbon taxes and emission trading systems to finance a net-negative carbon economy(5). We investigate an idealized market approach to incentivize the repayment of previously accrued carbon debt by establishing the responsibility of emitters for the net removal of carbon dioxide through 'carbon removal obligations' (CROs). Inherent risks, such as the risk of default by carbon debtors, are addressed by pricing atmospheric CO2 storage through interest on carbon debt. In contrast to the prevailing literature on emission pathways, we find that interest payments for CROs induce substantially more-ambitious near-term decarbonization that is complemented by earlier and less-aggressive deployment of CDR. We conclude that CROs will need to become an integral part of the global climate policy mix if we are to ensure the viability of ambitious climate targets and an equitable distribution of mitigation efforts across generations.

AB  - Environmental cues in an ecological niche are often temporal in nature. For instance, in temperate climates, temperature is higher in daytime compared to during night. In response to these temporal cues, bacteria have been known to exhibit anticipatory regulation, whereby triggering response to a yet to appear cue. Such an anticipatory response in known to enhance Darwinian fitness, and hence, is likely an important feature of regulatory networks in microorganisms. However, the conditions under which an anticipatory response evolves as an adaptive response are not known. In this work, we develop a quantitative model to study response of a population to two temporal environmental cues, and predict variables which are likely important for evolution of anticipatory regulatory response. We follow this with experimental evolution of Escherichia coli in alternating environments of rhamnose and paraquat for similar to 850 generations. We demonstrate that growth in this cyclical environment leads to evolution of anticipatory regulation. As a result, pre-exposure to rhamnose leads to a greater fitness in paraquat environment. Genome sequencing reveals that this anticipatory regulation is encoded via mutations in global regulators. Overall, our study contributes to understanding of how environment shapes the topology of regulatory networks in an organism.

AB  - Carbon capture by adsorption is supposed to be an effective method to reduce CO2 emissions, among which Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) can utilize low-grade thermal energy even from renewable energy source. At present, TSA technology still has several challenges to be practical application, such as intensive energy-consumption and low energy-efficiency. Thermodynamics could be a powerful method to explore the energy conversion mechanism of TSA, among which entropy analysis could further provide a clear picture on the irreversible loss, even with a possible strategy of energy-efficient improvement. Based on the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the entropy analysis of TSA cycle is conducted, using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The physical model and conservation equations are established and calculation methods for entropy generation are presented as well. The entropy generation of each process in cycle is analyzed, and the influence from the main parameters of desorption process is presented with optimization analysis. Finally, the performance of the cycle with regeneration is compared with that of the cycle without regeneration, and the method of reducing the entropy generation is obtained as well. This paper provides possible directions of performance improvement of TSA cycle with regards on energy utilization efficiency and the reduction of irreversible loss.

AB  - Microdera punctipennis Kaszab (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is an endemic species in Guerbantonggut desert in China. To explore the ways that M. punctipennis egg adapts to dry desert environment, morphological characteristics of the egg was investigated along with the egg of the nondesert beetle Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Water loss rate and survival rate of these eggs under different dry treatments (relative humidity0, 10, and 20%) were measured to evaluate the desiccation resistance of the eggs at different developmental stages (day 0, 2, and 5 eggs). Our results showed that the 50-egg weight in T. molitor was heavier than M. punctipennis, while the 50-first-instar larva weight in T. molitor was almost the same as in M. punctipennis. The water loss rate of M. punctipennis egg under dry conditions was significantly lower than T. molitor, and the egg survival rate was significantly higher than T. molitor. The estimated developmental threshold temperature of M. punctipennis egg was 18.30 degrees C, and the critical thermal maximum of M. punctipennis egg is above 39 degrees C. These features partly account for the adaptability of M. punctipennis to desert environment in egg stage.

AB  - Dietary restriction (DR) is a potent forerunner in aging studies capable of influencing lifespan and improving health in various model organisms even in their old age. Despite the importance of protein and carbohydrates in the diet (regulation of fecundity and body maintenance respectively), different ratio based combinations of these components has played a major role in lifespan extension studies. In spite of differences existing in dietary protocols across laboratories, diet manipulations have evolved as a major area of research in Drosophila lifespan studies, prominently shedding light on the multi-faceted process over the last two decades. Here, we review various advances and technicalities involved in understanding the DR-mediated lifespan alongside discussing the pros and cons of various existing approaches/diets used across labs. The current review also focuses on the importance of life-stage specific DR implementation and their influence on the life-history traits including lifespan and fecundity, by taking examples of results from different studies comprising diet dilution, calorie restriction, protein restriction, carbohydrate: protein ratios and the modulations in various minor diet components. We thereby intend to gather the major advances made in these fields alongside reviewing the practical implementations that need to be made to get a better view of the DR-mediated lifespan studies.

AB  - The potential to liberate steam production capacity for power generation has been assessed using actual energy consumption data and the recorded seasonal consumption fluctuations for a kraft pulp mill. The revenues from power production are compared with possible energy savings, achieved through enhancement of the process efficiency using an absorption heat pump (AHP). Bunker oil, wood bark and black liquor, the fuels used, have very different costs and heating values. The net present value was used with a simple pay back time for the comparison of three cases, i) power production from liberated steam capacity using a cogeneration unit, ii) maximized energy savings using an AHP and iii) power production combined with heat upgrading and cold production using a trigeneration unit. The results show economic viability of all options investigated. The stand alone AHP achieves the shortest simple pay back time, whereas the trigeneration option reaches the highest net present value and therefore the best overall economics.

AB  - Only a few industries worldwide use solar heat for industrial processes, despite the fact that it is a proven and cleaner solution. More over, Small-scale industries need hot water and low-enthalpy steam, but such systems receive scant attention due to the active nature of Parabolic Trough Collectors as well as the use of less efficient flat plate technology in this temperature range. This delineate the opportunity for research focus in efficient passive technologies especially in low temperature range. In this regard a novel dual mode Parabolic Trough Collector based on an Open Natural Circulation Loop (PTC-ONCL) is proposed here.
   Focus of this work is to assess the proposed system's suitability for process heating applications requiring hot water/low enthalpy steam, especially in rural areas. Experiments are conducted on an in-house prototype. A novel methodology for correlating actual solar data to the input heat load for the in-house test facility is developed. Five representative solar days are considered for individual tests. Startup, transient, and efficiency parameters are evaluated. Productivity, industrial viability, and environmental impact are also accessed.
   Throughout the test, the loop maintained a stable flow, where the start-up oscillations, thermal oscillations and type-I instabilities are observed. The system operates at an unprecedented efficiency of 72 +/- 4% in hot water mode and 70 +/- 5% in Steam generation over a 7 h period. The economic analysis shows an ambitious Levelized Cost of Heat of 2.8 cents/kWh, with a payback period of 3.21 years. Moreover environmental study shows its huge potential in reducing the CO2 emissions. A dimensionless index is proposed to represent the solar day and is correlated to predict the average water temperature and steam generated with RMSE values of 0.98 degrees C and 0.125 kg respectively. The solar day index comprehends the total irradiation, wind velocity and the ambient temperature. The proposed PTC-ONCL system is capable of producing an annual average of 8.67 kgday(-1) and/or 150 L of hot water at an average temperature of 89.07 degrees C. The results, and the system's low cost and near-maintenance-free nature demonstrates its capability in the desired application, both technologically and economically.

AB  - There is accumulating evidence to show that environmental stressors can regulate a variety of phenotypes in descendants through germline-mediated epigenetic inheritance. Studies of model organisms exposed to environmental cues (e.g., diet, heat stress, toxins) indicate that altered DNA methylations, histone modifications, or non-coding RNAs in the germ cells are responsible for the transgenerational effects. In addition, it has also become evident that maternal provision could provide a mechanism for the transgenerational inheritance of stress adaptations that result from ancestral environmental cues. However, how the signal of environmentally-induced stress response transmits from the soma to the germline, which may influence offspring fitness, remains largely elusive. Small RNAs could serve as signaling molecules that transmit between tissues and even across generations. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that neuronal mitochondria! perturbations induce a transgenerational induction of the mitochondria! unfolded protein response mediated by a Wnt-dependent increase in mitochondria! DNA levels. Here, we review recent work on the molecular mechanism by which parental experience can affect future generations and the importance of soma-to-germline signaling for transgenerational inheritance.

AB  - We used a horizontal temperature gradient to investigate the effect of alternate life history strategies and nutritional state on the preferred temperature of overwintering juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Contrary to our prediction, there was no significant difference in final preferred temperature between juvenile Atlantic salmon that will migrate to sea the following spring (early migrants) and those that show reduced growth and delay migration for at least another year (delayed migrants). Both migrant groups preferentially selected relatively low temperatures (< 10 degreesC), likely owing to their low appetite and growth rates. Food deprivation resulted in a significant increase, rather than our predicted decrease, in the final preferred temperature of the juvenile Atlantic salmon of approximately 2 degreesC. We suggest that this is due to the need for an increased foraging effort to offset the projected energy deficit later in the winter. The final preferred temperature of delayed migrants increased from winter to spring, as predicted, coincident with increases in natural food availability and endogenous seasonal increases in appetite and growth rates. We conclude that the preferred temperature of overwintering juvenile Atlantic salmon may be influenced by future energetic requirements rather than the current level of energy reserves.

AB  - Macrophages play a central role during infection, inflammation and tissue homeostasis maintenance. Macrophages have been identified in all organs and their core transcriptomic signature and functions differ from one tissue to another. Interestingly, macrophages have also been identified in the peritoneal cavity and these cells have been extensively used as a model for phagocytosis, efferocytosis and polarization. Peritoneal macrophages are involved in B-cell IgA production, control of inflammation and wound healing following thermal-induced liver surface injury. These cells presumably require and interact with the omentum, where milky spot stromal cells have been proposed to secrete CSF1 (colony stimulating factor 1). Peritoneal macrophages depend on CSF1 for their generation and survival, but the identity of CSF1 producing cells inside the large peritoneal cavity remains unknown. Here we investigated peritoneal macrophage localization and their interaction with mesothelial cells, the major cell type predicted to secrete CSF1. Our data revealed that mesothelial cells produce membrane bound and secreted CSF1 that both sustain peritoneal macrophage growth.

AB  - Organisms regularly encounter unfavorable conditions and the genetic adaptations facilitating survival have been of long-standing interest to evolutionary biologists. Winter is one particularly stressful condition for insects, during which they encounter low temperatures and scarcity of food. Despite dormancy being a well-studied adaptation to facilitate overwintering, there is still considerable controversy about the distribution of dormancy among natural populations and between species in Drosophila. The current definition of dormancy as developmental arrest of oogenesis at the previtellogenic stage (stage 7) distinguishes dormancy from general stress related block of oogenesis at early vitellogenic stages (stages 8 - 9). In an attempt to resolve this, we scrutinized reproductive dormancy in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. We show that dormancy shows the same hallmarks of arrest of oogenesis at stage 9, as described for other stressors and propose a new classification for dormancy. Applying this modified classification, we show that both species express dormancy in cosmopolitan and African populations, further supporting that dormancy uses an ancestral pathway induced by environmental stress. While we found significant differences between individuals and the two Drosophila species in their sensitivity to cold temperature stress, we also noted that extreme temperature stress (8 degrees C) resulted in very strong dormancy incidence, which strongly reduced the differences seen at less extreme temperatures. We conclude that dormancy in Drosophila should not be considered a special trait, but is better understood as a generic stress response occurring at low temperatures.

AB  - Summer mortality (SM), a disease caused by an interaction between biotic and abiotic environmental factors at high water temperatures (> 22 degrees C), impacts health, growth and mortality (up to 50%) of larger (>= 60 mm) cultured abalone in southern Australia. We aimed to determine if dietary intervention could alleviate mortality demonstrated by abalone at high water temperatures. As this issue is most relevant to farm production, we aimed to demonstrate that different mortality patterns are evident for 2- and 3-year-old greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata Donovan), irrespective of reproductive state, and to provide potential, practical solutions to this issue. Growth rate, feed intake and haemolymph variables were measured. To test if dietary intervention could minimise mortality at high water temperatures, we selected a commercial diet routinely fed on-farm when SM occurred, as a negative survival control, and live macroalgae (Ulva lactuca Linnaeus) as a positive survival control. In Experiment 1, 30 mm 2-year-old and 70 mm 3-year-old abalone were subjected to water temperatures of 18, 22 and 26 degrees C for 36 days. In Experiment 2, 60 mm 3-year-olds were subjected to 22 and 26 degrees C for 38 days. In Experiment 1, survival was > 95% for all treatments at 18 and 22 degrees C (P > 0.05); whereas, survival was significantly reduced by 35% in 3-year-olds fed the commercial diet at 26 degrees C compared to all other treatments (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, there was no mortality at 22 degrees C. At 26 degrees C, survival was significantly reduced by 50% (P < 0.05) for the commercial diet, whereas, survival was > 97% for the U. lactuca diet. We demonstrated that dietary intervention reduced mortality in larger abalone at 26 degrees C. We also demonstrated a pattern of mortality in response to high water temperatures that differed for age classes. This information is invaluable for further systematic research to alleviate on-farm abalone mortality associated with high summer water temperatures, particularly in the areas of nutritional or therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Endemic and relict species are often confined to ecological refugia or over fragmented distributions, representing priority conservation subjects. Within these sites, the individual population may realize distinct niches to a varying degree of specialization. An emblematic example is provided by freshwater species segregated in thermal-mineral springs, where individuals may face highly diverse microclimates in limited geographic areas. Downscaling the characterization of physiological traits to microclimatic niches becomes pivotal to adopt effective conservation measures in these heterogeneous habitats. Melanopsis etrusca (Brot, 1862) is an endangered relict snail endemic to a small number of thermal-mineral streams in central Italy. Here we describe the thermal tolerance of two populations of M. etrusca inhabiting streams with distinctly different thermal regimes, investigating the extent of physiological and behavioural specialization to such diverse microclimatic niches. The comparison of oxygen consumption rates of a population dwelling in temperate streams, characterized by seasonal temperature fluctuations (12-27 degrees C), with a population experiencing constantly hot water (35-38 degrees C) revealed the absence of any seasonal or geographic effect on metabolic compensation. Conversely, mobility performances were maximized in the population inhabiting the hot stream. Interestingly, here, the snails exhibited emersion behaviour outside the water, triggered by temperatures above 37 degrees C. In the field, individuals of this population are observed inactive on stream banks, conceivably to minimize the metabolic cost that otherwise would be induced by remaining in the hot water. Only a few individuals from the temperate stream exhibited the same behaviour when exposed to elevated temperatures, suggesting the exaptation of a preexisting trait during the evolutionary process of adaptation to hot waters. The present results provide elements for the best practice in future programmes aimed at reintroducing stocks of threatened species across heterogeneous habitats. Our study further underlines the relevance of downscaling data collection for endangered species conservation in order to recognize microclimatic specializations.

AB  - Pairs of platinum mesh or graphite fiber-based electrodes, one embedded in marine sediment (anode), the other in proximal seawater (cathode), have been used to harvest low-level power from natural, microbe established, voltage gradients at marine sediment-seawater interfaces in laboratory aquaria. The sustained power harvested thus far has been on the order of 0.01 W/m(2) of electrode geometric area but is dependent on electrode design, sediment composition, and temperature. It is proposed that the sediment/anode-seawater/cathode configuration constitutes a microbial fuel cell in which power results from the net oxidation of sediment organic matter by dissolved seawater oxygen. Considering typical sediment organic carbon contents, typical fluxes of additional reduced carbon by sedimentation to sea floors < 1000 m deep, and the proven viability of dissolved seawater oxygen as an oxidant for power generation by seawater batteries, it is calculated that optimized power supplies based on the phenomenon demonstrated here could power oceanographic instruments deployed for routine long-term monitoring operations in the coastal ocean.

AB  - Adaptive thermal plasticity plays a key role in mitigating the effects of seasonal and diurnal thermal fluctuations among ectotherms at various life-stages. While the role of thermal history in conferring such plasticity is widely documented, its interaction with relative humidity (RH), another important driver of ectotherm survival and activity, is relatively underexplored. Yet the potential responses to these combinational stressors across ontogeny remain largely neglected. Against this background, we used a full-factorial design to test the combined acclimation effects of RH (45%, 65% and 85%) and temperature (23, 28 and 33 degrees C) on various indices of thermal sensitivity of laboratory reared spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) following acclimation beginning at larval, pupal and adult life-stages. Traits measured included critical thermal limits (CTLs), supercooling points (SCPs), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat knockdown time (HKDT). Larval acclimation at 23 degrees C; 85% RH recorded the lowest critical thermal minima (CTmin) whereas adult acclimation at 28 degrees C; 45% RH recorded the highest critical thermal maxima (CTmax. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in SCPs across all temperature x RH acclimations. Larval and pupal acclimations at 23 degrees C; 85% RH and adult acclimation at 23 degrees C; 45% RH significantly improved CCRT. Similarly, commencing acclimation at larval, pupal and adult stages at 28 degrees C; 85% RH improved HKDT whereas larval and pupal acclimations at 33 degrees C; 45% RH impaired it. Our results indicate that combinational interactions of temperature and RH have significant thermal fitness costs and benefits and are dependent on the life-stage acclimation timing. Results also imply that both the vulnerability and adaptive potential of C. partellus populations under rapid climate variability varies with ontogeny. This therefore calls for the consideration of the role of ontogeny and multi-factors in better understanding the impact of environmental stress on ectotherms.

AB  - To improve the ability of managers to make appropriate decisions, we analyzed chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta data from central British Columbia and evaluated alternative escapement goals and the potential impacts of environmental change on Fishery performance. Fishery performance was expressed in terms of mean catch and the probability of annual catches exceeding 100,000 fish. We investigated Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationships and tested if environmental variation as reflected by sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) improved these relationships. Uncertainties associated with stock-recruitment model parameters were evaluated using a Bayesian approach. Posterior distributions of the parameters were generated using Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedures. Our data set was relatively informative as reflected by the well defined probability distributions of the stock-recruitment parameters. Fishery performance was assessed through stochastic projections over three generations (12 years) under various scenarios of escapement goals and climate conditions. Sea surface temperature anomalies significantly improved both models and recruitments were higher for chum salmon that entered the sea during cold years than in warm years. Recruitments tended to be more correlated with SSTA from north of the point of fry sea entry than from where fry actually entered the sea. Using a Ricker model, an escapement goal of roughly 100,000-150,000 spawners (depending of the climate scenario) yielded the highest probability of a projected yearly catch of at least 100,000 chum, while with the Beverton-Holt model, only similar to 45,000 spawners were needed. Since the Ricker model was insensitive to the type of priors and is more precautionary than the Beverton-Holt, we conclude that it is the most appropriate.

AB  - Before its establishment in Estonia at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say was a notifiable quarantine pest for many years. In high- latitude environments it encounters strong evolutionary pressure to adapt to low temperatures due to high overwintering mortality and periodic influx of new individuals from more southern populations. Our study focused on gathering evidence for such a range shift leading to the formation of a permanent local population. The phenology and overwintering success of beetles was investigated from 2008 to 2015. Depending on weather conditions in the different years, the overwintered beetles emerged from the soil from the beginning of May to mid- June. Over 700 degree days accumulated in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 exceeding the limit needed for development of two generations. However, food supply and temperature distribution in the growing period enabled development of the second complete generation only in 2010 and 2013. Survival of overwintering beetles in field conditions varied between 18% and 47% in the different years. Winter mortality was not associated with low air temperature in any year as snow cover provided the necessary protection and winter soil temperatures at the depth of 30 cm remained at around 0 degrees C for the duration of the whole observation period, with only some records as low as -3.5 degrees C. The survival of overwintering beetles is more likely defined by factors other than low temperature. As a result of periodic invasions of beetles with naturally lower cold resistance originating from southern regions, the structure of the overwintering population in Nordic temperate conditions is not homogeneous. Moreover, this may also be derived from cultural practices, as commercial producers regularly apply agrochemicals while organic growers avoid them.

AB  - Recent theoretical studies of mid-ocean ridge (MOR) accretion have shown that the density differences between silicate melt and solid phases and between fertile and residual mantle may be important controls on the upward flow of upper mantle and separation of melt from the upwelling matrix.  Both compositional and thermal buoyancy may play an important role.  To assess quantitatively the magnitude of these effects, we have compiled the available data for calculating densities of silicate melts and solid phases as a function of composition, temperature (1000-1500-degrees-C), and pressure (1 atm to any pressure where the solid phases of interest remain stable).  We include measured and calculated values of thermal expansion and compressibility for both solids and liquids.  Our calculations for mantle material undergoing decompression-induced melting show that density differences between instantaneous melt and residual solids increase toward the surface, implying an increasing melt migration rate with continuing upwelling and melting.  However, the density difference is significantly less than the value of approximately 0.5 g-cm-3 commonly assumed in theoretical models.  In agreement with previous studies, we also find that residual mantle is less dense than unmelted mantle; however, using realistic pressures for MORB generation, the difference is small.

AB  - The voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSC) are complex membrane proteins responsible for generation and propagation of the electrical signals through the brain, the skeletal muscle and the heart. The levels of sodium channels affect behavior and physical activity. This is illustrated by the maleless mutant allele (mle(napts)) in Drosophila, where the decreased levels of voltage-gated Na+ channels cause temperature-sensitive paralysis.
   Here, we report that mle(napts) mutant flies exhibit developmental lethality, decreased fecundity and increased neurodegeneration. The negative effect of decreased levels of Na+ channels on development and ts-paralysis was more pronounced at 18 and 29 degrees C than at 25 degrees C, suggesting particular sensitivity of the mle(napts) flies to temperatures above and below normal environmental conditions. Similarly, longevity of mle(napts) flies was unexpectedly short at 18 and 29 degrees C compared with flies heterozygous for the mle(napts) mutation. Developmental lethality and neurodegeneration of mle(napts) flies was partially rescued by increasing the dosage of para, confirming a vital role of Na+ channels in development, longevity and neurodegeneration of flies and their adaptation to temperatures

AB  - Zeugodacus cucurbitae is an important pest of fruit and vegetable crops in tropical and subtropical regions, and high-temperature stress can have different effects on the development and reproduction of successive generations of Z. cucurbitae. To clarify the multigenerational effects of short-time high temperature on the development and reproduction of Z. cucurbitae, the newly emerged adults of the contemporary (F-1 generation) and the next generation (F-2 generation) were exposed to short-term high temperatures of 25 degrees C, 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 41 degrees C, and 45 degrees C for 1 h, and the multigenerational (F-1, F-2, and F-3 generation) effects of these temperatures on the development and reproduction of Z. cucurbitae were evaluated. The results showed that (1) when the F-1 was exposed to short-term high temperature, the egg production and lifespan of the F-1 decreased continuously with the increasing temperature, except for the 45 degrees C treatment for 1 h, which stimulated egg production. Only the 41 degrees C group had significantly higher egg production and lifespan than the control group in the F-3. (2) In the F-1 and F-2 that were exposed to short-term high temperature, the F-1 and F-3 were consistent with the results of F-1 that were exposed to short-term high temperature. In conclusion, the effects of high-temperature intensity and frequency on multiple generations of Z. cucurbitae were different. The results of this study can elucidate the effects of short-term high-temperature stress on the growth, development, and reproduction of Z. cucurbitae in different generations, and provide a reference basis for the integrated control of Z. cucurbitae.

AB  - Although climate envelope models are used increasingly to predict the response of species to climate change, these models may perform poorly when species are comprised of locally adapted populations with differing environmental tolerances. Despite this concern, little is known about how tolerance traits vary across a species' geographic range. In this study, we tested whether the upper thermal limits of a direct- developing intertidal snail, Nucella canaliculata, varied among populations distributed along the northeastern Pacific coast. Snails from 7 sites in central California, northern California, and Oregon (USA) were reared through 2 generations in a common laboratory environment to minimize the potential influence of field acclimatization and other non-genetic effects. Laboratory assays of acute lethal temperature tolerance (LT50) indicated that newly hatched N. canaliculata from central California were less heat tolerant than their conspecifics from Oregon. These differences in upper thermal limits likely have a genetic basis and are consistent with a mosaic of potential thermal stress in rocky intertidal habitats along the northeastern Pacific coast. In particular, some northern sites experience longer exposures to stressful midday low tides than southern sites, due to variation among regions in the timing of low tides. Persistent regional differences in tidal regimes, climate, and other environmental factors may act as selective forces that influence the physiology of intertidal species with broad latitudinal ranges. The resulting geographic distribution of thermally tolerant genotypes may be spatially complex, and may thus alter predictions regarding the effects of climate change on local extinctions and species' geographic range shifts.

AB  - The opposite slopes of "Evolution Canyon" in Israel have served as a natural model system of adaptation to a microclimate contrast. Long-term studies of Drosophila melanogaster populations inhabiting the canyon have exhibited significant interslope divergence in thermal and drought stress resistance, candidate genes, mobile elements, habitat choice, mating discrimination, and wing-shape variation, all despite close physical proximity of the contrasting habitats, as well as substantial interslope migration. To examine patterns of genetic differentiation at the genome-wide level, we used high coverage sequencing of the flies' genomes. A total of 572 genes were significantly different in allele frequency between the slopes, 106 out of which were associated with 74 significantly overrepresented gene ontology (GO) terms, particularly so with response to stimulus and developmental and reproductive processes, thus corroborating previous observations of interslope divergence in stress response, life history, and mating functions. There were at least 37 chromosomal "islands" of interslope divergence and low sequence polymorphism, plausible signatures of selective sweeps, more abundant in flies derived from one (north-facing) of the slopes. Positive correlation between local recombination rate and the level of nucleotide polymorphism was also found.

AB  - The use of renewable fuels, such as the biodiesel, can ease the demand of fossil fuel for the power generation and transportation fields in rural area. In this work, the performance impact of the application of castor oil biodiesel is evaluated with an automotive and a stationary diesel engine. The application of B20 and B10 biodiesel blends and pre-heated net biodiesel is considered. The viability of the employment of B10 and B20 blends to mobility and power generation was observed from dynamometric bench tests, where this blends performed similar to fossil diesel. With the pre-heated net biodiesel, however, a brake torque loss and a specific consumption increase were observed with relation to diesel fuel.

AB  - A thermally selected strain of rainbow trout has been established by selective breeding since 1966 in Miyazaki, Japan. In the present study, we compared the critical thermal maxima (CTMs), the temperatures at which organisms reach a predefined sublethal endpoint and lose their equilibrium, between a thermally selected and two normal (Donaldson) strains of rainbow trout. The CTM of one normal strain from Nikko (Nikko strain) acclimated to 20 A degrees C (29.7 A degrees C) was significantly lower than those of the thermally selected strain (30.0 A degrees C) and the other Donaldson strain from Aomori (29.9 A degrees C) (P < 0.05). The F1 generations, F1T and F1N, were produced by crossing thermally selected strain females with Nikko strain males and Nikko strain females with thermally selected strain males, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the CTM between F1T [30.1 +/- 0.15 A degrees C (n = 30)] and F1N [30.1 +/- 0.16 A degrees C (n = 30)] (P > 0.05) for fish acclimated to 20 A degrees C, suggesting that the F1 offspring inherited the thermal tolerance trait from one thermally selected strain parent irrespective of whether it was the male or female. F2 offspring of F1T or F1N also showed the thermal tolerance trait. The coefficients of variation for CTM were also compared among all the datasets obtained in the present study and their values for F1 hybrids were lower than those of the parental generation of the Nikko strain (P < 0.05). In contrast, the coefficients of variation of F2s were the same as those of their parental generation. Furthermore, the thermally selected strain and Nikko strain as a reference family provide a F2 generation for segregating phenotypes, which is required for in-depth genetic analysis of the thermally selected rainbow trout strain.

T2  - FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - To facilitate fuel interchangeability for industrial gas turbines, various kinds of fossil fuels including syngas from coal gasification and steel mill gases including Blast Furnace Gas (BFG) have been investigated by previous researchers to determine their viability as alternative fuels for power generation. In the present study, various syngas components produced from coal gasification were combined to produce a simulated mixed gas, which was fed into a pressurized gas turbine combustion test rig to determine the combustion characteristics. A scaled model of the 7EA combustor from GE was used to conduct a basic comparative study on the emission trend (NOx), exhaust gas temperature distribution according to the combustor pressure, syngas composition and dilution ratio at the fuel side. The major findings were that modification of the empirical formula for pressure affects NOx emission and nitrogen dilution ratio affects the temperature profile uniformity on the fuel side.

AB  - A thermoacoustic heat engine (TAHE) is a type of regenerative heat engine that converts external heat into mechanical power in the form of an acoustic wave with no moving mechanical components. One significant application of the TAHE is the generation of electricity by coupling an acoustic-to-electric conversion unit such as a linear motor or a piezoelectric ceramic assembly. However, present-day conversion technologies have considerable drawbacks, including structural complexity, high cost, and low reliability. The advent of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offers an alternative means to overcoming these shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a thermoacoustically driven TENG (TA-TENG) that continuously harvests external heat. A test rig involving a standing-wave TAHE and a contact-separation mode TENG was fabricated to demonstrate this concept.

AB  - Hypoxia is a pressing environmental problem in both marine and freshwater ecosystems globally, and this problem will be further exacerbated by global warming in the coming decades. Recently, we reported that hypoxia can cause transgenerational impairment of sperm quality and quantity in fish (in F0, F1, and F2 generations) through DNA methylome modifications. Here, we provide evidence that female fish (Oryzias melastigma) exposed to hypoxia exhibit reproductive impairments (follicle atresia and retarded oocyte development), leading to a drastic reduction in hatching success in the F2 generation of the transgenerational group, although they have never been exposed to hypoxia. Further analyses show that the observed transgenerational impairments in ovarian functions are related to changes in the DNA methylation and expression pattern of two gene clusters that are closely associated with stress-induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. The observed epigenetic and transgenerational alterations suggest that hypoxia may pose to the sustainability of natural fish populations.

AB  - In this study, a solar parabolic trough collector combined with a Kalina cycle, multi-stage flash desalination unit, a proton exchange membrane electrolyser for hydrogen production, and a micro-combined cooling, heating, and power system is presented. Systematic energy, exergy, and exergo-environmental evaluation are used to analyse the viability of the integrated systems as the most effective approach for performance assessment of integrated systems. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the overall system is observed to be 50.51% and 3.27% respectively. The rate of exergy destruction of each component and the overall cycle is determined where the parabolic trough collector is shown to have an exergy destruction rate of 234.4 kW, which is the highest among all the components. The performance of the proposed systems is also checked through a parametric study of the different key parameters.

AB  - To reduce local air pollution, many ports in developed countries require berthed ships to use shore-based electricity instead of burning diesel to meet their electricity requirement for loads such as lights, cargo-handling equipment, and air conditioning. The benefits of this strategy in developing countries remain understudied. Based on government data for all major ports in India, we find that switching from high-sulfur fuel to shore power reduces hoteling emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5) by 88%; SO2 by 39%; NO (x) by 85%; but increases CO2 emissions by 12%. Switching from low-sulfur fuel reduces hoteling emissions of PM2.5 by 46% and NO (x) by 84% but increases SO2 emissions by 240% and CO2 emissions by 17%. The lifetime cost savings from the switch to electricity are $73 M for high-sulfur fuel and $370 M for low-sulfur fuel. We estimate that switching from high-sulfur fuel to shore power might avoid at most a couple of dozen premature deaths each year, whereas switching from low-sulfur fuel could lead to a slight increase in premature mortality. Therefore, policymakers must first clean up power generation for shore power to be a viable strategy to improve air quality in Indian port cities.

AB  - The ideal free distribution concept predicts that organisms will distribute themselves between habitats in a density-dependent manner so that individuals, on average, achieve the same fitness in each habitat. In ectotherms, environmental temperature has a strong impact on fitness, but temperature is not depletable and thus not density dependent. Can density-dependent habitat selection occur in ectotherms when habitats differ in thermal quality? We used an observational study of habitat selection by small snakes in field and forest, followed by manipulative habitat selection and fitness experiments with common gartersnakes in enclosures in field and forest to test this hypothesis. Snakes were much more abundant in the field, the habitat with superior thermal quality, than in the forest. Gartersnakes in our controlled experiment only used the forest habitat when snake density was highest and when food was more abundant in the forest; habitat selection was largely density independent, although there was weak evidence of density dependence. No female gartersnake gave birth in the forest enclosures, whereas half of the females gave birth in the field enclosures. Growth rates of females were higher in field than in forest enclosures. Overall, our data indicate that temperature appears to be the most important factor driving the habitat selection of gartersnakes, likely because temperature was more limiting than food in our study system. Snakes, or at least temperate snakes, may naturally exist at population densities low enough that they do not exhibit density-dependent habitat selection.

AB  - This study evaluated: 1) the time required for anaesthesia induction and recovery of oysters Crassostrea rhizophorae, Crassostrea gasar and Crassostrea gigas using magnesium chloride (MgCl2); 2) the survival after anaesthesia and gonad sampling; and 3) the D-larvae generation after anaesthesia. For each species, three groups of 10 animals were kept in 50 g L-1 MgCl2, salinity of 36 and temperature of 22 degrees C. One control group was kept in solution without MgCl2. Every 1 h anaesthetised oysters were recorded, sampled to determine sex and placed in clean seawater to assess recovering every 30 min. Gonad samplings were made beside the posterior adductor muscle, using 1 mL syringes and needles (0.60 x 25 mm). Factorial crosses were generated within and between anaesthetised and non-anaesthetised oyster groups to produce D-larvae in C. gigas. The survival after 10 days of anaesthesia was 100% for the three studied species. For C. rhizophorae and C. gigas, 100% of the animals were anaesthetised after 360 min and were recovered after 240 and 150 min, respectively. For C. gasar, 87% were anesthetised after 720 min and recovered after >240 min. There were no significant differences in D-larvae numbers between factorial crosses. The salt MgCl2 served as an efficient relaxant and caused no deleterious effect on the survival of the three studied species, or on the D-larvae generation in C. gigas.

AB  - The present paper constitutes a first contribution of a series devoted to the importance of fundamental evolutionary biology for applied purposes in acarology. It presents the main life history traits which play a role in the control of pests and in our knowledge of potential of mites as biological control agents.
   The mites, or Acari, constitue a group of minute Arachnida which exhibits one of the highest biodiversity among Arthropods. Originating from the soil, they colonised then almost all the niches of the biosphere, including fresh and salt waters. In addition, contrarily to the other Arachnida, which are all predators, mites adopted a large range of feeding habits: saprophagy, fungivory, phytopagy, carnivory and parasitic nutrition. In the course of their evolution they adapted to numerous human settlements. As a consequence, mites are involved in many economical activities: public health, veterinary medicine, forestry, stored products and agriculture.
   The effectiveness of the dispersal strategies developed by these small wingless animals - anemochory, phoresy and parasitic infestation - is the prevalent reason of their success in colonizing so diverse environments.
   Parthenogenesis - thelytoky, arrhenotoky and pseudoarrhenotoky - play also a major role in the dynamics of scattered populations and the foundation of new colonies, even in perturbed conditions. The sex ratio biased in favour of dispersant females, is an important feature of the effectiveness of the predatory biocontrol agents. The genetic characteristics of arrhenotokous and pseudoarrhenotokous mites play a role in pesticide resistance.
   One can observe a general trend towards abbreviated postembryonic developments in the less conservative forms. This, associated to the other demographic assessments, especially the intrinsic rate of increase, r(m), are widely studied in pests and biocontrol agents.
   All these life traits in the dynamics of the mite pests, but also in the predator/prey models and the feasibility of mass rearing of beneficial mites.

AB  - Strong sexual selection has been reported to both enhance and hinder the adaptive capacity and persistence of populations when exposed to novel environments. Consequently, how sexual selection influences population adaption and persistence under stress remains widely debated. Here, we present two empirical investigations of the fitness consequences of sexual selection on populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, exposed to stable or gradually increasing temperatures. When faced with increasing temperatures, strong sexual selection was associated with both increased fecundity and offspring survival compared with populations experiencing weak sexual selection, suggesting sexual selection acts to drive adaptive evolution by favouring beneficial alleles. Strong sexual selection did not, however, delay extinction when the temperature became excessively high. By manipulating individuals' mating opportunities during fitness assays, we were able to assess the effect of multiple mating independently from the effect of population-level sexual selection, and found that polyandry has a positive effect on both fecundity and offspring survival under increasing temperatures in those populations evolving with weak sexual selection. Within stable temperatures, there were some benefits from strong sexual selection but these were not consistent across the entire experiment, possibly reflecting changing costs and benefits of sexual selection under stabilizing and directional selection. These results indicate that sexual selection can provide a buffer against climate change and increase adaptation rates within a continuously changing environment. These positive effects of sexual selection may, however, be too small to protect populations and delay extinction when environmental changes are relatively rapid.

AB  - Morphological and physiological plasticity is often thought to represent an adaptive response to variable environments. However, determining whether a given pattern of plasticity is in fact adaptive is analytically challenging, as is evaluating the degree of and limits to adaptive plasticity. Here we describe a general methodological framework for studying the evolution of plastic responses. This framework synthesizes recent analytical advances from both evolutionary ecology and functional biology, and it does so by integrating field experiments, functional and physiological analyses, environmental data, and genetic studies of plasticity. We argue that studies of plasticity in response to the thermal environment may be particularly valuable in understanding the role of environmental variation in the evolution of plasticity: not only can thermally-relevant traits often be mechanistically and physiologically linked to the thermal environment, but also the variability and predictability of the thermal environment itself can be quantified on ecologically relevant time scales. We illustrate this approach by reviewing a case study of seasonal plasticity in the extent of wing melanization in Western White Butterflies (Pontia occidentalis). This review demonstrates that 1) wing melanin plasticity is heritable, 2) plasticity does increase fitness in nature, but the effect varies between seasons and between Sears, 3) selection on existing variation in the magnitude of plasticity favors increased plasticity in one melanin trait that affects thermoregulation, but 4) the marked unpredictability of short-term (within-season) weather patterns substantially limits the capacity of plasticity to match optimal wing phenotypes to the weather conditions actually experienced. We complement the above case study with a casual review of selected aspects of thermal acclimation responses. The magnitude of thermal acclimation ("flexibility") is demonstrably modest rather than fully compensatory. The magnitude of genetic variation (crucial to evolutionary responses to selection) in thermal acclimation responses has been investigated in only a few species to date. In conclusion, we suggest that an understanding of selection and evolution of thermal acclimation will be enhanced by experimental examinations of mechanistic links between traits and environments, of the physiological bases and functional consequences of acclimation, of patterns of environmental variability and predictability, of the fitness consequences of acclimation in nature, and of potential genetic constraints.

AB  - Sexual reproduction in cyclically parthenogenetic rotifers results in the production of diapausing, fertilized (resting) eggs, which can survive for decades in sediment egg banks. Stem females hatching from these eggs can differ from genetically identical ones produced in subsequent parthenogenetic generations. Differences involve the inhibition of sexual reproduction, which may persist for many parthenogenetic generations; reduced morphology (apterous Polyarthra, shorter-spined Brachionus); and larger stores of lipid. These features of stem females may facilitate colonization by favoring population growth via female parthenogenesis and by decreasing food requirements for survival and reproduction. Fertilized eggs in dried sediments probably hatch soon after being flooded by rising water levels. Eggs in permanently submerged sediments may be in environments that inhibit hatching (e.g., darkness, low water temperature, low dissolved oxygen) and hatch only when brought to the sediment surface or resuspended into the water column by currents or bioturbation. Laboratory experiments show that the hatching of diapausing, fertilized eggs can require light and temperatures suitable for population development or specific changes in temperature consistent with a new growing season. The limited data that exist on their emergence from fertilized eggs in natural systems come from sediment traps, from the occurrence in the water column of apterous Polyarthra or empty egg shells, and from calculations of negative mortality rates of planktonic populations. Fertilized eggs often hatch at the beginning of the growth season but may continue to hatch intermittently thereafter. The extremely high genotypic diversity of some natural rotifer populations indicates extensive hatching of stem females from the sediment egg bank.

AB  - Polypores are mushrooms which are rich in bioactivities and for generations, they have been widely used as herbal remedies. Despite their significant importance in treatments of various health issues, only a few local species have been reported for their pharmacological potentials. The present study was carried out to establish cytotoxicity potentials of Donkioporiella mellea, a local polypore species collected from forested areas in Malaysia at cellular levels on normal human lung (MRC5) and human lung carcinoma (A549) cell lines. Survival and inhibition rates were analyzed by 3-(4, 5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y-l)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) while monitoring changes on cellular shapes by inverted phase contrast microscopy. Survival rates of MRC5 cells were observed to be significantly higher than A549 after treatments with various concentrations of polypore extracts. MRC5 cells showed excellence in survival performance when treated with hot and cold aqueous extracts. Cold aqueous extract showed higher cytotoxicity activities compared to hot aqueous extract (p<0.0001) with inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 414.29 mu g/ml and >1000 mu g/ml, respectively. Treatments with tamoxifen as a control exhibited necrotic features in both cell lines. The results suggest that D. mellea possesses pharmacological potentials that can be utilized for human consumption as a new bioresource alternative, thus encouraging research advancement in mycological and nutraceutical studies.

AB  - The northern corn rootworm, Diabrotica barberi Smith & Lawrence, has a univoltine life cycle that typically produces one generation a year. When rearing the northern corn rootworm in the laboratory, in order to break diapause, it is necessary to expose eggs to a five month cold period before raising the temperature. By selective breeding of the small fraction of eggs that hatched without cold within 19-32 days post oviposition, we were able to develop a non-diapausing colony of the northern corn rootworm within five generations of selection. Through selection, the percentages of adult emergence from egg hatch without exposure to cold treatment significantly increased from 0.52% +/- 0.07 at generation zero to 29.0% +/- 2.47 at generation eight. During this process, we developed an improved method for laboratory rearing of both the newly developed non-diapausing strain as well as the diapausing strain. The development of the non-diapausing colony along with the improvements to the rearing system will allow researchers to produce up to six generations of the northern corn rootworm per year, which would facilitate research and advance our knowledge of this pest at an accelerated rate.

AB  - Green ammonia production is facing increasing interest on a global scale as a hydrogen carrier for power generation as well as fertilizer for food production. The conventional Haber-Bosch method for ammonia synthesis is energy demanding, requires high purity hydrogen, and is based on fossil fuels. A preliminary techno-economic model for electrochemical ammonia synthesis at near ambient pressure using feed rates of 32 metric ton/day for hydrogen and 135 metric ton/day for nitrogen is presented in this study. Various pathways using different methods for nitrogen generation and hydrogen production were investigated to gain insight into added energy savings per metric ton of ammonia. Electrochemical synthesis using electrolysis for hydrogen and cryogenic nitrogen was found to be a potentially viable pathway for green ammonia. The profitability metrics including discounted cash flow rate of return, net present value and discounted payback period were estimated to be 8%, $40 MM, and 4-6 years respectively for this pathway. The cost of electricity, conversion rate, and conversion efficiency dominate the tonnage cost of ammonia and were used to assess the feasibility of the model. A life cycle assessment was also conducted to assess the environmental impact of a well to product ammonia process. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Humans are rapidly altering thermal landscapes, so a central challenge to organismal ecologists is to better understand the thermal niches of ectotherms. However, there is much disagreement over how we should go about this. Some ecologists assume that a statistical model of abundance as a function of habitat temperature provides a sufficient approximation of the thermal niche, but ecophysiologists have shown that the relationship between fitness and temperature can be complicated, and have stressed the need to elucidate the causal mechanisms underlying the response of species to thermal change. Towards this end, we studied the distribution of two crayfishes, Euastacus woiwuru and Euastacus armatus, along an altitudinal gradient, and for both species conducted experiments to determine the temperature-dependence of: (1) aerobic scope (the difference between maximum and basal metabolic rate; purported to be a proxy of the thermal niche); and (2) burst locomotor performance (primarily fuelled using anaerobic pathways). E. woiwuru occupied cooler habitats than E. armatus, but we found no difference in aerobic scope between these species. In contrast, locomotor performance curves differed significantly and strongly between species, with peak locomotor performances of E. woiwuru and E. armatus occurring at similar to 10 and similar to 18 A degrees C, respectively. Crayfish from different thermal landscapes may have similar aerobic thermal performance curves but different anaerobic thermal performance curves. Our results support a growing body of literature implying different components of ectotherm fitness have different thermal performance curves, and further challenge our understanding of the ecology and evolution of thermal niches.

AB  - Non-aqueous emulsions are peculiar cases of emulsions, however with a much broader range of applications than the traditional oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions. A quasi-infinite number of solvents can be used for the generation of such emulsions. Applications of non-aqueous emulsions include water-sensitive reactions (e. g. some ionic polymerization in miniemulsion), and reactions that require high temperatures to be carried out.

AB  - Water scarcity is a global issue, and its severity is expected to worsen in the near future, prompting further efforts to find new sources of freshwater. Solar-Powered Atmospheric Water Harvesting (SPAWH) is a promising passive approach for atmospheric water generation. This study aims to examine the thermal performance of different glazing materials and water production in SPAWH. The research consists of two phases: a laboratory test of various glazing materials and an experimental study to assess system efficiency in producing water in the tropics. The preliminary results indicated that glass demonstrated better thermal performance than acrylic in the lab, with higher thermal conductivity and less heat loss. The experimental findings showed that the maximum water produced by the proposed SPAWH (60 cm length, 60 cm width and 30 cm height) placed on a 30 degrees tilt angle using glass (3 mm) and acrylic (3 mm) was 0.61 L/m(2)/day and 0.44 L/m(2)/day, respectively. The cost analysis revealed that produced water costs $0.18/kg for glass and $0.40/kg for acrylic, respectively. Atmospheric water could be harvested using SPAWH in the tropics, which would help to provide new opportunities for sustainable water supplies and development in these regions.

AB  - Miniaturization is the central theme in modern fabrication technology. Many of the components used in modern products are becoming smaller and smaller. The applicability of the standard lithographic technologies to processing the new functional materials is crucial for their successful wide implementation in practice. Recently we have reported experimental design and test of the new generation for nanomecanical devices like nano-tweezers based on original bilayer Ti2NiCu/Pt composite structures. In the present paper it is demonstrated that standard ion beam nano-fabrication technology is quit suitable for full cycle of production operational stages of practical nano-tweezers production. The technological experiments were done on realizing by usage of a novel focused ion beam instrument Raith ionLiNE (TM) device. This device is a novel focused ion beam instrument for low dose nanolithography and nano-fabrication. ionLiNE (TM) Raith was applied for experimental composite nano-tweezers production on the base of Ti2NiCu/W with length - 30 mu m, gap width 0.9 mu. The tests showed high quality of reproduction and long term operation under thermal control at temperature change only 14 K

AB  - The Neoproterozoic provides an important record of glacial-postglacial paleoenvironments, organic carbon cycling, and hydrocarbon accumulation. Here, to better understand the environmental, sedimentary, and petroleum geological potential of the Neoproterozoic, we summarize and review research on paleoenvironment and hydrocarbon prospectivity during the era for regions worldwide and also present a case study of the Marinoan postglacial Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in the Sichuan Basin, upper Yangtze region, China. Sediments that were deposited during the Neoproterozoic postglaciations generally have hydrocarbon-generating potential. In some places, the sediments have reached stages of burial and thermal evolution appropriate for hydrocarbon generation, with some sites having been exploited for commercial production. In the Sichuan Basin, the distribution and thickness of Doushantuo Formation sediments were controlled by glacially eroded topography and/or extension-related subsidence. Abundant organic matter was produced through paleo-productivity (Ba/Al and Cu/Al proxies can reach up to 181.08 and 8.94, respectively) and anoxia (U-EF and Mo-EF proxies can reach up to 5.45 and 14.00, respectively) governed by marine transgression. In South China, many depocenters of the Doushantuo Formation sediments have a strip-shaped geometry in the plane and are expected to be prospective for oil and gas. The reported findings can be used as a reference for further studies of glacial and postglacial deposits with organic matter accumulation of the Neoproterozoic and other periods.

AB  - Braking systems are importance of motor vehicle components. The kinetic energy of the motor vehicle is converted to heat energy by friction between the brake lining and the rotating brake disc. Brake discs work under very difficult thermo-mechanical conditions due to high temperature and wear. As most of commercial discs have high wear rate and low braking performance there is a need for development and manufacturing of new discs-brake linings to reduce wear and to increase braking performance in motor vehicles. In this study, a sample cast iron disc with ventilation channels, coated with NiCrBSi powder by the flame spraying method was investigated. The braking performance of original and the coated discs was tested according to SAE J2430 test standard. It was found out that the NiCrBSi coated disc exhibited less wear and a higher coefficient of friction than the original disc. The NiCrBSi coated disc exhibited less wear, a higher coefficient of friction and longer life than the original disc. As a result, the NiCrBSi coated disc could be a much better alternative for new generation brake discs in the motor vehicles than the original one.

AB  - Simple Summary Global warming caused by the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is becoming a major environmental issue. Lipaphis erysimi is one of the most damaging pests of cruciferous crops worldwide, and L. erysimi has strong adaptability to the environment and reproductive capacity. The age-stage, two-sex life table is currently used by many researchers in place of the traditional age-specific life table, providing many details such as fitness and potential damage. In this study, the individual fitness and population dynamics parameters of three successive generations of L. erysimi were analyzed using the age-stage, two-sex life table. The results show that a high CO2 concentration had a cumulative effect on the survival rate and fecundity of L. erysimi, and elevated CO2 had a negative effect on the individual fitness parameters of L. erysimi. The life expectancy (e(xj)) is significantly lower in elevated CO2 than that in ambient CO2 treatment in the three successive generations, indicating that L. erysimi was more sensitive to CO2 concentration and the life of L. erysimi was shortened under elevated CO2. Additionally, we can find that elevated CO2 has a short-term effect on the population parameters, including the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) in L. erysimi. Through the data from this experiment, we believe that the individual and population fitness of L. erysimi will be decreased under elevated CO2, which indicates that the damage caused by L. erysimi may be reduced in the future with increasing CO2 levels. To assess the effect of elevated CO2 on the development, fecundity, and population dynamic parameters of L. erysimi, the age-stage, two-sex life table was used to predict the individual fitness and population parameters of three successive generations of L. erysimi in this study. The results show that a significantly longer total pre-adult stage before oviposition (TPOP) was observed in the third generation compared with the first generation of L. erysimi under the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment. The fecundity is significantly lower in the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment than that in the 400 mu L/L CO2 treatment in the third generation of L. erysimi, which indicates that elevated CO2 had a negative effect on the individual fitness parameters of L. erysimi. Additionally, the life expectancy (e(xj)) is significantly lower under the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment than that under the 400 mu L/L CO2 treatment in the three successive generations. A significantly higher intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were found in the second generation compared with those in the first and third generations of L. erysimi under the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment. Moreover, significantly lower r and lambda were observed under the 800 mu L/L CO2 treatment compared with those under the 400 mu L/L and 600 mu L/L CO2 treatments in the first generation of L. erysimi, which indicates that elevated CO2 has a short-term effect on the population parameters (r and lambda) of L. erysimi. Our experiment can provide the data for the comprehensive prevention and control of L. erysimi in the future with increasing CO2 levels.

AB  - Acclimation refers to reversible, nongenetic changes in phenotype that are induced by specific environmental conditions. Acclimation is generally assumed to improve function in the environment that induces it (the beneficial acclimation hypothesis). In this study, we experimentally tested this assumption by measuring relative fitness of the bacterium Escherichia coli acclimated to different thermal environments. The beneficial acclimation hypothesis predicts that bacteria acclimated to the temperature of competition should have greater fitness than do bacteria acclimated to any other temperature. The benefit predicted by the hypothesis was found in only seven of 12 comparisons; in the other comparisons, either no statistically demonstrable benefit was observed or a detrimental effect of acclimation was demonstrated. For example, in a lineage evolutionarily adapted to 37 degrees C, bacteria acclimated to 37 degrees C have a higher fitness at 32 degrees C than do bacteria acclimated to 32 degrees C, a result exactly contrary to prediction; acclimation to 27 degrees C or 40 degrees C prior to competition at those temperatures confers no benefit over 37 degrees C acclimated forms. Consequently, the beneficial acclimation hypothesis must be rejected as a general prediction of the inevitable result of phenotypic adjustments associated with new environments. However, the hypothesis is supported in many instances when the acclimation and competition temperatures coincide with the historical temperature at which the bacterial populations have evolved. For example, when the evolutionary temperature of the population was 37 degrees C, bacteria acclimated to 37 degrees C had superior fitness at 37 degrees C to those acclimated to 32 degrees C; similarly, bacteria evolutionarily adapted to 32 degrees C had a higher fitness during competition at 32 degrees C than they did when acclimated to 37 degrees C. The more surprising results are that when the bacteria are acclimated to their historical evolutionary temperature, they are frequently competitively superior even at other temperatures. For example, bacteria that have evolved at either 20 degrees C or 32 degrees C and are acclimated to their respective evolutionary temperatures have a greater fitness at 37 degrees C than when they are acclimated to 37 degrees C. Thus, acclimation to evolutionary temperature may, as a correlated consequence, enhance performance not only in the evolutionary environment, but also in a variety of other thermal environments.

AB  - For a number of generations, we followed the frequency, performance and fecundity of an initial mixture (50:50) of triazine resistant (R) and susceptible (S) but otherwise near-isogenic lines of Brassica rapa (for 3 yr) and of Chenopodium album (for 2 yr) in neighbouring experimental garden plots, which differed in aspect (north-facing versus south-facing), shading, and transparent cover from precipitation. Each of eight treatments was replicated four times per species. Seed from each plot was kept separate and sown back in its plot of origin to provide the next generation. For both Brassica and Chenopodium, R frequency changed between generations. In Brassica R frequency declined consistently from an initial 0.5 and, after 2 yr, R plants had disappeared in all replicates in two treatments and averaged <0.126 in the remaining treatments. However, R frequencies in the smaller second generation samples in each year were less consistent. In Chenopodium R frequency increased consistently from an initial 0.5 in all treatments and replicates during 1995 to average 0.772 on south-facing sites and 0.675 on north-facing sites. However, in 1996 Chenopodium R frequency did not change significantly from that in 1995 for any treatment. Brassica S plants were more fecund that R plants, except in shaded conditions, and south-facing plots produced significantly more S seeds than north-facing plots. Both Brassica plants and plots were more productive in 1996 than in 1995. By contrast, Chenopodium was much less productive in 1996, a season with more climatic extremes between plots than 1995. In 1995, R plants were more fecund than S plants in south-facing plots and in covered conditions, but this difference was not detected in 1996. South-facing Chenopodium plots were more productive than north-facing plots in 1995, but the reverse was the case in 1996. Cover resulted in an increase in seed production in Chenopodium on south-facing plots in 1995, but a decline in 1996. We conclude that st lection might act against triazine-resistant plants in B. rapa under the climatic conditions in the UK, but in C. album, which is more susceptible to extreme conditions of light and water stress, triazine-resistant phenotypes might predominate in lo iv stress cool moist conditions. We suggest that a relationship might exist between the overall climatic tolerance of a species, and climate thresholds beyond which herbicide-resistant phenotypes might spread. Thus, in the absence of herbicide, it is not inevitable that the frequency of R phenotypes will decline in field conditions.

AB  - 1 Taxocenes - monophyletic ecological assemblages - are a key focus of macroecology. Abundance (individuals per area) is a basic property of taxocenes but has received less attention than diversity, although the two are probably related. Abundance reflects a taxocene's ability to harvest and sequester available energy and divide it among individuals. This paper explores how two properties of all taxocenes - trophic makeup and taxonomic level (e.g. genus, tribe, subfamily, family...)- may contribute to patterns of local abundance at geographical scales.
   2 Forty-nine ground ant taxocenes, in habitats ranging from New World deserts to rain forests, were surveyed along a three-orders of magnitude productivity gradient using transects of 30 1-m(2) quadrats at each site. Abundance - the number of nests per transect - varied over two orders of magnitude.
   3 Over 80% of the genera collected were omnivores. However, herbivore, omnivore, and predator taxa were added to ant taxocenes in roughly 1 order of magnitude steps up the productivity gradient. Specialist detritivores were added last.
   4 Net primary productivity and mean monthly temperature both consistently entered regression models predicting abundance. However, while productivity was the dominant predictor of abundance for higher taxa (families, subfamilies), temperature was the dominant predictor of abundance for lower taxa (tribes, genera). The answer to the question 'What regulates the abundance of a taxocene?' is thus sensitive to the taxonomic level of analysis.
   5 These data support the following scenario. Lower taxa are abiotic specialists given the insufficient number of genomes and generations required for the exploration of the entire abiotic envelope. Higher taxa, in contrast, consist of suites of abiotic specialists arrayed along the entire productivity gradient, with access to productivity everywhere the taxon occurs. If this scenario is true, individual species may respond to global changes in temperature; the higher taxa they belong to may most respond to global changes in productivity.

AB  - As cancer usually follows reproduction, it is generally assumed that cancer does not select. Graham has however argued that juvenile cancer, which precedes reproduction, could during evolution have implemented a "cancer selection" that resulted in novel traits "that suppress this juvenile cancer; an example is protection against UV sunlight-induced cancer, required for the emergence of terrestrial animals from the sea. We modify the cancer selection mechanism to the posited "cancer adaptation" mechanism, in which juvenile mortality is enhanced through the diminished care received by juveniles from their (grand) parents when these suffer from cancer in old age.
   Moreover, it is posited that the cancer adaptation selects against germline "dissipative genes", genes that result in enhanced free energy dissipation. Cancer's progression is interpreted as a cascade at increasing scale of repeated amplification of energy dissipation, a cascade involving heat shock, the Warburg effect, the cytokine IL-6, tumours, and hypermetabolism. Disturbance of any physiological process must enhance energy dissipation if the animal remains functioning normally, what explains multi causality, why "everything gives you cancer".
   The hypothesis thus comprises two newly invoked partial processes diminished (grand) parental care and dissipation amplification and results in a "selection against enhanced energy dissipation" which gives during evolution the benefit of energy conservation. Due to this benefit, cancer would essentially be an adaptation, and not a genetic disease, as assumed in the "somatic mutation theory". Cancer by somatic mutations is only a side process.
   The cancer adaptation hypothesis is substantiated by (1) cancer's extancy, (2) the failure of the somatic mutation theory, (3) cancer's initiation by a high temperature, (4) the interpretation of cancer's progression as a thermal process, and (5) the interpretation of tumours as organs that implement thermogenesis. The hypothesis could in principle be verified by monitoring in a population over several generations (1) the presence of dissipative genes, (2) the incidence of cancer, and (3) the beneficial effect of dissipative gene removal by cancer on starvation/famine survival.

AB  - In oviparous species that lack parental care, fitness of the mother depends on the selection of a high-quality nest site, as mothers do not compensate for poor incubation environment post-hatching. Near the northern range limit of Glyptemys insculpta (Wood Turtle), short summers and cool temperatures may be factors that limit population persistence because potential nest sites may not provide adequate conditions for successful egg incubation in some years. We quantified nest-site selection by examining soil temperature and substrate composition of real Wood Turtle nests (n = 5) and constructed false nests. False nests comprised two treatments: negative-test false nests (n = 5) constructed on beaches not used by females, and positive-test false nests (n = 5) constructed on beaches used by females but in microsites not chosen by females. Temperature was measured as total thermal units and mean temperature during the diel cycle. Soil composition was quantified using moisture content, organic content, and grain-size distribution. Soil temperature was the most important factor in nest-site selection. Temperatures and total thermal units were significantly higher and more variable in real nests than in false nests, except during the night. Soil composition was not significantly different among treatments. Grain sizes ranged from fine to gravel, and real nests contained mainly (58% to 96%) medium sand or larger grains. There was little variation in soil moisture among real nests, suggesting that females were choosing specific humidity conditions for nesting. Our findings can be directly applied to protecting nesting beaches for Wood Turtles, which are considered a species at risk.

AB  - To elucidate the mechanisms of thermal adaptation and acclimation in ectothermic aquatic organisms from differing climates, we used a common-garden experiment for thermal stress to investigate the heat shock response of redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) from desert and montane populations. Evidence for adaptation was observed as expression of heat shock genes in fish from the desert population was more similar to control (unstressed) fish and significantly different (P0.05) from those from the montane population, while F1 crosses were intermediate. High induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in the montane strain appeared to improve short-term survival during first exposure to high water temperatures, but high physiological costs of Hsp production may have led to lower long-term survival. In contrast, the desert strain had significantly lower heat shock response than the montane fish and F1 crosses, suggesting that these desert fish have evolved alternative mechanisms to deal with thermal stress that provide better balance of physiological costs. Genomewide tests of greater than 10000SNPs found multiple SNPs that were significantly associated with survival under thermal stress, including Hsp47 which consistently appeared as a strong candidate gene for adaption to desert climates. Candidate SNPs identified in this study are prime targets to screen more broadly across this species' range to predict the potential for adaptation under scenarios of climate change. These results demonstrate that aquatic species can evolve adaptive responses to thermal stress and provide insight for understanding how climate change may impact ectotherms.

AB  - We used 94 RAPD primers of different nucleotide composition to probe the genomic differences between a highly virulent P. multocida strain and an attenuated vaccine strain derived from the virulent strain after culturing the latter under increasing temperature for 14,400 generations. The GC content of the vaccine strain is significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of the virulent strain, contrary to the popular hypothesis of covariation between the GC content and temperature. The frequencies of AA, TA, and TT dinucleotides were higher, and those of AT, GC, and CG dinucleotides were lower, in the vaccine strain than in the virulent strain. A statistic called genomic RAPD entropy is formulated to measure the randomness of the genome, and the genome of the vaccine strain is more random than that of the virulent strain. These differences between the virulent and vaccine strains are interpreted in terms of mutation and selection under increased culturing temperature. A method for estimating substitution rates is developed in the APPENDIX.

AB  - It has been broadly accepted worldwide that global warming, indeed, is the greatest threat of the time to the environment. Renewable energy (RE) is expected as a perfect solution to reduce global warming and to endorse sustainable development. Progressive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) from increasing energy-intensive industries has eventually caused human civilization to suffer. Realizing the exigency of reducing emissions and simultaneously catering to needs of industries, researchers foresee the RE as the perfect entrant to overcome these challenges. RE provides an effective option for the provision of energy services from the technical point of view while biomass, a major source of energy in the world until before industrialization when fossil fuels become dominant, appears an important renewable source of energy and researches have proven from time to time its viability for large-scale production. Being a widely spread source, biomass offers the execution of decentralized electricity generation gaining importance in liberalized electricity markets. The decentralized power is characterized by generation of electricity nearer to the demand centers, meeting the local energy needs. Researchers envisaged an increasing decentralization of power supply, expected to make a particular contribution to climate protection. This article investigates the progress and challenges for decentralized electricity generation by palm oil biomass according to the overall concept of sustainable development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper deals with the development of a material structure called 'solar foam' with double layered structure of exfoliated graphite flakes and reticulated PU foam for solar steam generation at low solar intensity and keeping the bulk liquid at low temperature with no vacuum. Solar desalination is a one such technology which uses direct sunlight for purification of water at low cost and with less space occupied. This approach requires either costly high optical intensity parabolic reflectors leading to heat loss by the hot bulk liquid and heated surfaces. To decrease these losses new solar receiver concepts such as nano fluids or volumetric receivers have been proposed. But their conversion efficiency is comparatively lower (30%). To harvest solar energy for a broad range of phase-change applications this new structure will be novel approach. Suitable modifications have done to solar still to increase its productivity.

AB  - In this study we investigated the sensitivity of Deinococcus radiodurans to contact-free cold atmospheric plasma treatment as part of a project to establish new efficient procedures for disinfection of inanimate surfaces. The Gram-positive D. radiodurans is one of the most resistant microorganisms worldwide. Stationary phases of D. radiodurans were exposed to cold atmospheric plasma for different time intervals or to ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation at dose rates of 0.001-0.0656 J cm(-2), respectively. A methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA) served as control for Gram-positive bacteria. The surface microdischarge plasma technology was used for generation of cold atmospheric plasma. A plasma discharge was ignited using ambient air. Surprisingly, D. radiodurans was sensitive to the cold atmospheric plasma treatment in the same range as the MRSA strain. Survival of both bacteria decreased with increasing plasma exposure times up to 6 log(10) cycles (> 99.999 %) within 20 s of plasma treatment. In contrast, UVC radiation of both bacteria demonstrated that D. radiodurans was more resistant to UVC treatment than MRSA. Cold atmospheric plasma seems to be a promising tool for industrial and clinical purposes where time-saving is a critical point to achieve efficient disinfection of inanimate surfaces and where protection from corrosive materials is needed.

AB  - Microbes exhibit short and long term responses when exposed to challenging environmental conditions. To what extent these responses are correlated, what their evolutionary potential is and how they translate to cross-stress fitness is still unclear. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the response of Escherichia coli populations to four abiotic stresses (n-butanol, osmotic, acidic, and oxidative) and their combinations by performing genome-scale transcriptional analysis and growth profiling. We performed an analysis of their cross-stress behavior which identified 15 cases of cross-protection and one case of cross vulnerability. To elucidate the evolutionary potential of stress responses to individual stresses and stress combinations, we re-sequenced E. coli populations evolved in those four environments for 500 generations. We developed and applied a network-driven method that integrates mutations and differential expression to identify core and stress-specific gene communities that are likely to have a phenotypic impact. Our results suggest that beyond what is expected from the general stress response mechanisms, cross-stress behavior arises both from common pathways, several including metal ion binding and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and stress-specific expression programs. The stress-specific dependences uncovered, argue that cross-stress behavior is ubiquitous and central to understanding microbial physiology under stressful conditions.

AB  - Continents are underlain by thick, cold thermal boundary layers. Thermal contraction should render these boundary layers negatively buoyant and unstable; this is why old, cold oceanic lithospheres subduct. However, the ancient lithospheric roots of many continents appear to have existed for billions of years. In the common view, this preservation is due to the fact that the thermal boundary layers are compositionally distinct from the ambient mantle in that they are highly melt-depleted and dehydrated; the former provides positive buoyancy and the latter provides strength. Here, we show using mantle xenoliths that the Precambrian South China Block originally was underlain by highly depleted mantle, but has been refertilized via silicate melts generated from the asthenosphere. It is now more fertile than the ambient convecting mantle and is intrinsically denser by more than 1.5%. Achieving sufficient melt generation for refertilization is only possible if the lithosphere is thin enough to provide "headspace" for decompression melting. Thus, continental boundary layers thinner than the maximum depth of melting should experience refertilization, whereas thicker continents would altogether suppress melting and hence the potential for refertilization. We propose that refertilization, once initiated, will destabilize the base of the continent; this in turn will increase the amount of "headspace" and promote further refertilization, resulting in a positive feedback that could culminate in lithospheric destruction. By contrast, continents that are thick enough may not experience significant refertilization. This suggests that initial lithospheric thickness, as well as lithospheric composition, may be important for defining the fate of continents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Efficient integration of increasing shares of renewable resources into electricity supply requires information about spatial and temporal variations in the availability of energy carriers. Regarding biomass, the spatial variation is crucial for the estimation of the regional potential and costs of biomass for electricity generation. Described in this paper is the examination of the applicability of net primary productivity data for improving the quality of a high resolution inventory of potentials of biomass energy. The net primary productivity is simulated with remotely sensed input data taking into account site-specific information such as precipitation, irradiation and temperature. For the examples of forest wood and surplus straw, two different methods of inventorying were applied and compared: 1) disaggregating biomass potentials derived from statistical crop data using a land cover map and 2 additionally weighting the distribution with the net primary productivity, We found that in the case of surplus straw, this method yielded better results than only disaggregating the potential with the land cover data. No clear conclusions could be drawn from the statistical test applied regarding forest wood, because the sample size of reference values was too small. Based on a critical reflection of the data which is input to the NPP simulation, it was concluded that the distribution of forest wood potentials should not be weighted with the NPP data unless more appropriate satellite input data is available.

AB  - The growing energy demand in the world and the concern for environmentally damaging energy sources have led to an increased interest in seeking alternative renewable energy sources, such as wind energy. Furthermore, choosing effective locations for wind power plants has become a key issue in project planning. However, prior to implementation, such projects should be confirmed as economically viable. This article is a systematic review of the literature carried out with the aim to identify the main factors that impact the economic feasibility of wind energy investments. The search was performed in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) electronic database, from which 120 papers were extracted after a selection process, and were analyzed individually. As a result of the review analysis, 23 factors that have an impact on feasibility analysis were identified and organized in five categories: location (surface roughness, turbine location), economic (investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, avoided energy cost, depreciation, land rent), political (interest rates and taxes, energy sales price, inflation, financing conditions), climatic (wind speed, air density, temperature, air pressure), and technical (turbine height, installed wind power, lifetime, efficiency, rotor diameter, operation time, number of turbine blades, construction time). These factors can directly impact the cost of capital and/or energy production, affecting the economic viability of wind farms. In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth in publications about economic feasibility of wind investments. The wind investments growth has been accompanied by financial studies about this subject. This study provides insights on the main variables used in wind energy feasibility studies. The results may assist researchers and investors to identify the key parameters that are being examined in the literature, and to evaluate which ones should be considered in their study to ensure a sustainable development of power generation through the wind source.

AB  - A brief review is provided in some advances in understanding the ecology of pike Esox lucius Linnaeus over the last 10 years. Based on long-term studies and manipulative, often short-term experiments (laboratory, field and mesocosms) several established theories have been supported, as well as new concepts developed. Despite their wide distribution pike show low levels of polymorphism and divergence indicative of a recent common ancestral population. Recent genetic studies, however, indicate a single refugium in North America compared to several refugia in Europe. Pike are found in rivers, lakes and weakly saline waters. Variables such as growth and mortality are mainly affected by factors such as temperature, water transparency, productivity, availability of prey and density of pike and other predators. In choice of habitat pike have been shown to support the ideal free-distribution theory. The importance of macrophyte habitat in the life history of pike has been reconfirmed and pike have been shown to be flexible in response to water clarity. Pike are extremely 'plastic' in choice of prey types, prey size and in response to prey behaviour (e.g. they are unaffected by shoal size). Predation by pike not only affects abundance and biomass of prey (including younger and smaller pike through cannibalism which plays a major role in population dynamics, other fishes and invertebrates) but also evolution and adaptation of their morphology (in particular body shape) and behaviours. There appears to be no relationship between stock and recruitment. Recruitment is influenced by several abiotic factors in lakes and rivers. Pike play a major role in structuring freshwater communities and have been used in stocking programmes to improve water quality (biomanipulation). Many new concepts have been developed in pike behaviour in maximizing these stocking programmes both in biomanipulation and fisheries management. Despite many recent advances in understanding the ecology of pike, particularly at the individual level, developments in quantifying and modelling the role of pike as a top predator in large ecosystems have been limited, probably due to the difficulties of sampling natural populations.

AB  - Animals have a considerable variation in their longevity. This fundamental life-history trait is shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic mortality pressures, influenced by multiple parameters including ecological variables and mode-of-life traits. Here, we examined the distribution of maximum age at multiple taxonomic ranks (class, order and family) in Chordata, and identified species with exceptional longevity within various taxa. We used a curated dataset of maximum longevity of animals from AnAge database, containing a total of 2542 chordates following our filtering criteria. We determined shapes of maximum age distributions at class, order and family taxonomic ranks, and calculated skewness values for each distribution, in R programming environment. We identified species with exceptional longevity compared to other species belonging to the same taxa, based on our definition of outliers. We collected data on ecological variables and mode-of-life traits which might possibly contribute, at least in part, to the exceptional lifespans of certain chordates. We found that 23, 12 and 4 species have exceptional longevity when we grouped chordates by their class, order and family, respectively. Almost all distributions of maximum age among taxa were positively skewed (towards increased longevity), possibly showing the emergence of longer lifespans in contrast to shorter lifespans, through the course of evolution. However, potential biases in the collection of data should be taken into account. Most of the identified species in the current study have not been previously studied in the context of animal longevity. Our analyses point that certain chordates may have evolved to have longer lifespans compared to other species belonging to the same taxa, and that among taxa, outliers in terms of maximum age have always longer lifespans, not shorter. Future research is required to understand how and why increased longevity have arose in certain species.

AB  - During evolution, Muller's ratchet permanently generates deleterious germline mutations that eventually must be defused by selection. It seems widely held that cancer and aging-related diseases (ARDs) cannot contribute to this germline gene selection because they tail reproduction and thus occur too late, at the end of the life cycle. Here we posit however that by lessening the offspring's survival by proxy through diminishing parental care, they can still contribute to the selection.
   The hypothesis in detail: The widespread occurrence of aging in animals suggests that it is an adaptation. But to what benefit? Aging seems to have only drawbacks. In humans, ARDs cause today almost all mortality; they include heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, kidney disease and cancer. Compensation seems unthinkable.
   For cancer, the author proposed in a previous study a benefit to the species: purifying selection against deleterious germline genes that when expressed enhance intracellular energy dissipation. This multicausal energy dissipation, posited as the universal origin of cancer initiation, relates to cellular heat generation, disrupted metabolism, and inflammation. The organism reproduces during cancer's dormancy, and when approaching its end of life, the onset of cancer is accelerated in proportion to the cancer-initiating signal. Through cancer, the organism, now a parent, implements the self-actuated programmed death of Skulachev's phenoptosis. This "first death" enhances by proxy the offspring's chance of "second death" (or "double death") through diminished parental care. Repetition over generations realizes a purifying selection against genes causing energy dissipation.
   The removal of the deleterious germline gene mutations permanently generated by Muller's ratchet gives a benefit. We generalize, motivated by the parallels between cancer and aging, the purifying selection posited for cancer to aging. An ARD would be initiated in the organ by multicausal disruption of homeostasis, and be followed by dormancy and senescence until its onset near the end of the life cycle. Just as for cancer, the ARD eventually enhances double death, and the realized permanent selection gives a benefit to the species through the selection against germ line genes that disrupt homeostasis.
   Given their similarities, cancer and aging are combined in the posited Unified Cancer-Aging Adaptation (UCAA) model, which may be confirmed by next-generation sequencing data. Also because of the emerging important role of cellular senescence, the hypothesis may guide the development of therapies against both cancer and aging.

AB  - Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels have made the use of renewable sources the world's most important energy challenge. Among renewable energies, geothermal energy has a special place due to its sustainable resources and shallow environmental impacts. These energy sources are classified as low-grade thermal energy sources, so they cannot independently provide a high amount of thermal energy. Therefore, extensive studies have been conducted on practical methods of using geothermal energy for multigeneration productions. Studies on geothermal energy-based systems to supply energy to various systems such as chillers, electrolyzers, turbines, and desalination units are reviewed in this study. As the methods, scenarios, and practical possibilities of multigenerational system (MGS) are limited, in this study, while expressing the limitations and problems of these systems, the most critical issues raised in this issue are examined and analyzed, and compatibility, products, Levelized cost of energy, energy and exergy efficiencies, and technical issues are summarized. Also, due to the limitations of geothermal energy sources in recent studies, their combination with other renewable energy sources has been evaluated. Therefore, the classification of studies conducted to combine renewable energy sources with the geothermal system to achieve multigeneration productions is thrown in the last part of this study. The results of the studies show that the combination of geothermal energy with other renewable energy sources is used in 90% of cases to provide heat and cold load and in 10% of cases to generate electrical power. These systems also improve energy and exergy efficiency and economic viability by increasing stability.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to highlight the link between climatic conditions and the developmental stages of the species Cydalima perspectalis. If the temperature is low the evolution in days of the development stages increase and vice versa. For the population studied in 2020, the first flight of adults took place on May 18, and the last on October 14. It is clear that it completed 2 generations and the amount of effective temperature for the first generation is 646.7 degrees C and for the second generation it was 628.3 degrees C. The amount of effective temperature (degrees-days)in the period 2019-2020 for the egg stage varies between 62.8 degrees C in 2020 and 48.6 degrees C in 2019, for the larval stage is between 444.8 degrees C (2020) and 403.4 degrees C (2019) and for the pupae stage the values are between 139.1 degrees C (2020) and 74.1 degrees C (2019).Under the natural influence of climatic factors, the number of generations of the species Cydalima perspectalis in the Craiova area varies from one year to another, this suggests that this species is directly dependent on temperature.

AB  - The evolutionary potential and ecological importance of interspecific hybrids continues to be a controversial issue. Traditionally, hybridization often associated with polyploidy and clonal reproduction was considered an important mechanism for speciation in plants, but not in animals. More recently, investigations have shifted to the question: Under which genetic and ecological conditions do hybrid taxa and different ploidies arise and succeed, and when and where do they fail? Finding answers to this question is aggravated by the fact that suitable taxa for such studies are often far apart on the phylogenetic tree. Hence, results are influenced by many confounding variables. In this study, we reduce this problem by investigating the fitness within a complex of three closely related water frog taxa consisting of the two sexually reproducing parental species Pelophylax lessonae (genotype LL) and P.ridibundus (RR) plus their interspecific hybrid P.esculentus which comes in three ploidy types (LR, LLR and LRR), as well as with sexual and hemiclonal reproduction. Offspring of all five genotypes were produced by artificially crossing adults sampled from populations in Slovakia, Germany and Switzerland. This created genetic variation. They were then raised at two temperature levels: 18 and 24 degrees C. This created ecological variation. Larval performance under the two temperature regimes was analysed with respect to three fitness-related parameters: survival rate, days to metamorphosis and weight at tail resorption. Survival rate was significantly higher for offspring of the three hybrid types (LR, LLR and LRR) compared with those of the parental species (LL, RR), at both rearing temperatures. For days to metamorphosis and weight at metamorphosis, we found an interaction between offspring type and temperature. In both cases, performance of hybrid and parental offspring did not differ at 24 degrees C, but at 18 degrees C hybrids metamorphosed faster and at a lower weight than parentals. We discuss these results in relation to those from other studies and conclude that under cold conditions hybrids (especially the two triploid types) have higher fitness than both parental species. This genotypexenvironment interaction could be one reason why all-hybrid populations mainly occur at the cooler northern range of the water frog distribution.

KW  - ENDOMETRIAL ABLATION
AB  - Endometrial ablation has gained significant clinical acceptance over the last decade as a minimally invasive treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding. To improve upon current thermal injury modeling, it is important to better characterize the myometrium's thermotolerance. The extent of myometrial thermal injury was determined across a spectrum of thermal histories/doses (time-temperature combinations). Fresh extirpated human myometrium was obtained from 13 subjects who underwent a previous scheduled benign hysterectomy. Within two hours of hysterectomy, the unfixed myometrium was treated in a stabilized saline bath with temperatures ranging from 45-70 degrees C and time intervals from 30-150 seconds. The time-temperature combinations were selected to simulate treatment times under 2.5 minutes. A total of six such thermal matrices, each comprised of 45 time-temperature combinations, were prepared for evaluation. The treated myometrium was cryosectioned for nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining to assess for thermal respiratory enzyme inactivation. Image analysis was subsequently used to quantitatively assess the stained myometrium's capacity to metabolize the tetrazolium at each time-temperature combination. This colorimetric data was then used as marker of cellular viability and determine survival parameters with implications for developing minimally invasive uterine therapies.

AB  - Environmental awareness and sustainable development based on long-term diversification of energy sources are key points on the agenda of energy policy-makers. As part of electrical power systems UDNs are evolving from the present traditional electricity supply network towards more decentralized system with smaller, more efficient generation unit normally connected directly to the network at consumer sites. Combined Heat & Power (CHP) generation is the most efficient way of energy supply in urban area available today. It delivers significant benefits to its host facilities and urban distributed network (UDN) to which is connected. Economic viability of CHP generation for many sites requires integration with the UDN for backup and supplementary power needs and in some case the export of excess power to the UDN. CHP system integration into existing UDN entail installation costs. How these integration costs are distributed will have considerable impact on development and implementation of CHP generation in urban areas. The objective of this paper is to use analytical and statistical methods to develop an algorithm that provide means of determining the optimum capacity of a CHP generating plant that can be accommodated within the UDN, which correspond to Least Cost Technically Acceptable (LCTA) principle, and the UDN long term network planning policy. In order to determine optimal size of CHP generating plant that could be connected at any particular busbar on the UDN without causing a significant adverse impact on performance of the UDN and with minimum connection cost an algorithm is created that incorporates an analytical and multiple regression analysis model. It is tested using data obtained from ERAC power analysing software incorporating load flow, fault current level and power losses analysis. Additional data needed for effective algorithm creation was obtained via surveys of local UDN operators and planners. These analyses are performed on a 34 busbar network resembling part of the real UDN of Cork city for validation purposes and accuracy of the algorithm proposed.

AB  - Biological aspects of Chrysoperla raimundoi Freitas & Penny (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae). The green lacewings are important predators and are found in several agroecosystems. The temperature is one of the decisive factors for the development of insects. and there is an acceptable variation gradient for each species. Therefore, the purpose of this Study was not only to check the influence of different temperatures on the embryonic and postembryonic development of Chrysoperla raimundoi, as well as check the consequences in the different generations. The immature stages were reared at four different environmental conditions, three of them with constant temperatures (19,0, 25,0 e 31,0 degrees C) and the fourth rearing place was external to the laboratory without control of the abiotic factors. The duration of the embryonic period, first. second and third larval instar, pupal stage, and front egg to adult were evaluated; also the survival rate of each instar and stage and the emergence rate were calculated. The embryonic and post embryonic development differed between the generations F, and F, Also, the influence of different temperatures for the generation F-2 among individuals created at 31,0 degrees C showed reduction on the development rate regarding the other two environments. It was possible to observe that the generation, has its development influenced by different temperatures, and the 19,0 degrees C temperature prolonged its development.

AB  - This study compares the performance of three different approaches to modeling namely the classical pore-blocking models, artificial neural networks (ANN) and the novel genetic programming (GP) approach. Among the available models proposed by Hermia, standard pore-blocking and cake filtration models were opted because of their better fitness with experimental measurements. A feedforward backpropagation network using Bayesian Regulation as well as Levenberg-Marquardt training methods was developed based on the experimental results. Network inputs include the controlling parameters of permeate flux namely: temperature, transmembrane pressure, crossflow velocity, pH, and filtration time. The architecture and internal parameters of the network have substantial effect on the prediction performance of the ANN. Hidden layers and neuron numbers were regulated using trial-and-error approach. The individual program proposed by GP, which has satisfied the required fitness value after 500 generations, had a depth of 10 among a population of 700 individuals. Relative error with respect to experimental results was used to compare the aforementioned models. It was found that ANN outperformed pore-blocking and GP models. The GP-based model had an acceptable coincidence with the experimental data and its ability to correlate the input and target variables by a mathematical relation showed the high potentiality of GP as a modeling tool.

The objective of this study was to select alternative hosts to rear the parasitoid Palmistichus elaeisis Delvare & LaSalle, 1993 (Hymenoptera: Eulophiclae). Pupae of the lepidopterans Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, 1818 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Bombyx mori Linnaeus, 1 758 (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) and Thyrinteina arnobia (Stoll, 1782) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) were exposed to parasitism by females of P. elaeisis. The duration of the life cycle of P. elaeisis was 21.60 +/- 0.16 and 24.15 +/- 0.65 days on pupae of A. gemmatalis and B. mori, respectively, with 100.0% parasitism of the pupae and 71.4 and 100.0% emergence of parasitoids from the first and second hosts, respectively. The offspring number of P. elaeisis was 511.00 +/- 49.70 and 110.20 +/- 19.37 individuals per pupa of B. mori and A. gemmatalis, respectively. The reproduction of P. elaeisis from pupae of T. arnobia after six generations was similar to the other hosts.

AB  - We compared temperature selection, growth and reproductive output between two populations, and movement and home range size among three populations of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentine serpentine) occupying habitats with different productivities in Ontario, Canada. We examined the hypothesis that primary productivity constrains growth, reproductive effort, and thermal and home range behavior. We predicted that individuals in a habitat with high productivity would grow faster, produce larger clutches of eggs, select warmer temperatures, and maintain smaller home ranges than individuals in a less productive habitat. As expected, turtles in the more productive habitat grew more rapidly and had a higher reproductive output than those in the less productive habitat. Turtles maintained higher body temperatures at the more productive site, but this may have been because ambient temperatures were higher at the productive site rather than because turtles were selecting higher temperatures. Size of home range and distances moved did not differ among study populations, which suggests that productivity was not a good proximate measure of home range behavior. Differences among sites in ambient temperature, type and distribution of prey, and turtle density made it difficult to separate the effect of each factor on growth and reproduction. Future research should measure variation among individuals in energy now, particularly to improve our understanding of variation in home range behavior.

AB  - In this chapter, we present a series of four articles derived from a Introductory Workshop on Biological Rhythms presented at the 72nd Annual Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology: Clocks and Rhythms. A diverse range of species, from cyanobacteria to humans, evolved endogenous biological clocks that allow for the anticipation of daily variations in light and temperature. The ability to anticipate environmental variation promotes optimal performance and survival.

AB  - In many Baltic regions, short-rotation willow (Salix spp.) is used as a vegetation filter for wastewater treatment and recycling of valuable nutrients to upsurge bioeconomy development. In this context, a four-year field trial (2016-2019) was carried out near a wastewater treatment plant in eastern Finland (Outokumpu) to investigate the effect of the processed wastewater (WW) on biomass production as well as the nutrients uptake capability (mainly N and P) by a willow variety (Salix schwerinii). Results indicated that WW irrigation expressively increased the willow diameter growth and biomass yield around 256% and 6510%, respectively, compared to the control treatment site (without WW). The willow was also able to accumulate approximately 41-60% of the N and 32-50% of the P in two years (2018-2019). Overall, willow showed a total 20% mortality rate under WW irrigation throughout the growing periods (2017-2019) as compared to control (39%). The results demonstrate that willow has the potential to control eutrophication (reducing nutrients load) from the wastewater with the best survival rate and can provide high biomass production for bioenergy generations in cold climatic conditions.

AB  - In nature, organisms are simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses (i.e. complex environments) that often fluctuate unpredictably. Although both these factors have been studied in isolation, the interaction of the two remains poorly explored. To address this issue, we selected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli under complex (i.e. stressful combinations of pH, H2O2 and NaCl) unpredictably fluctuating environments for similar to 900 generations. We compared the growth rates and the corresponding trade-off patterns of these populations to those that were selected under constant values of the component stresses (i.e. pH, H2O2 and NaCl) for the same duration. The fluctuation-selected populations had greater mean growth rate and lower variation for growth rate over all the selection environments experienced. However, whereas the populations selected under constant stresses experienced trade-offs in the environments other than those in which they were selected, the fluctuation-selected populations could bypass the across-environment trade-offs almost entirely. Interestingly, trade-offs were found between growth rates and carrying capacities. The results suggest that complexity and fluctuations can strongly affect the underlying trade-off structure in evolving populations.

AB  - Overwinter mortality of juvenile northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria, is a major impediment to the aquaculture industry from the mid-Atlantic US through Atlantic Canada. Mortality occurs during prolonged exposures to low temperatures and/or during the winter-spring transition when water temperatures are rising. Recent efforts to overwinter juveniles of Mercenaria mercenaria produced from native Maine (ME, USA) broodstock in eastern ME have found high survival while using a newly adopted methodology (i.e. cages in the water column rather than the standard practice of bottom planting) for overwintering. The current study aimed to determine if the high survivorship was a result of the culture methodology or if the ME genetic stock is better adapted for overwinter survival. Field studies were performed across two consecutive winters in ME, NewYork (NY) and NewJersey (NJ, USA) to compare survivorship of two size classes of juvenile Mercenaria mercenaria using the new methodology to the standard practice of bottom planting, and to compare the survival and physiological condition of the ME stock vs. the NY and NJ stocks across a latitudinal gradient. The ME stock had greater survival than the NY and NJ stock at all sites and in both study years. Both of the ME size classes exhibited lower mortality (<12%) through the onset of winter and when temperatures were <5 degrees C suggesting greater tolerance to low temperatures, while the NY and NJ stocks experienced very high mortality (up to 87%). However, the ME stock did experience significant mortality in the spring when water temperatures were rising in NY and NJ in both years and in ME during the second study year which was abnormally warm. Mortality of all stocks coincided with a decline in carbohydrate reserves. Survival was greater in field plots as compared to the overwintering cages in NY and NJ but no significant difference was observed in ME. The results demonstrate that alternate methodologies used to successfully overwinter juvenile Mercenaria mercenaria in eastern Maine cannot be applied effectively to more southern locations. However, the results suggest that selective breeding programs may be able to develop aquaculture stocks that are better adapted to overwintering conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biology of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera. Trichogrammatidae) "strain bonagota" reared in eggs of Bonagota salubricola (Meyrick)) (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) was studied in laboratory estimating the thermal requirements and the number Of annual generations in some apple production regions of the Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina States. Eggs of H. salubricola were submitted to parasitism by T pretiosum for 24h, and transferred to incubators regulated to 18, 20, 22. 25, 28, 30 and 32 degrees C. The duration of the biological cycle (egg-adult) was influenced by temperature ranging from 8.18 to 18.12 days at 32 and 18 degrees C, respectively. The parasitoid emergency was higher (66.2%) at 22 degrees C. The sex ratio of T pretiosum ranged from 0.61 to 0.72 being not influenced by temperature. The highest relation of parasitoids/egg Was found at 30 degrees C (1.41). The thermal constant (k) and the threshold temperature (Tb) was 187.7 degrees days and 7.42 degrees C. respectively. The number of annual generations estimated for T pretiosum for Fraiburgo and Sao Joaquim, SC and Vacaria. RS was 17.5 11.6 and 16.8, respectively.

AB  - This paper addresses the viability of converting single-family residential buildings in Brazil into zero energy buildings (ZEBs). The European Union and the United States aim ZEBs implementation to address 'peak oil' and environmental concerns. However, literature shows no agreement on a consensual definition of ZEB. Seeking a Brazilian ZEB definition, this paper addresses PassivHaus and thermal comfort standards for hot climates, source metrics for ZEB, Brazil's energy mix, residential energy end uses and Brazilian legal framework for residential photovoltaic (PV) generation. Internal Rate of Return for PV systems in two Brazilian cities is calculated under various scenarios. It shows grid parity was reached from April 2012 to November 2012 assuming residential electric tariffs of that period and the financial conditions given by the Brazilian government for the construction of new dams in the Amazon and the lowest rates offered by Brazilian banks to private individuals. Governmental decision to lower electric residential tariffs in November 2012 reduced the scope of grid parity. Later revocation of a tax exemption in April 2013 ended grid parity in Brazil. It concludes, conversely to developed countries, it is the volatile Brazilian energy policy, instead of economical barriers, the main obstacle for ZEB viability in Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the survival at temperatures considerably exceeding the optimum is supported by intense synthesis of the so-called heat shock proteins (HSPs), which act to overcome the adverse effects of heat stress. Among mycoplasmas (class Mollicutes), which have significantly reduced genomes, only some members of the Acholeplasmataceae family possess small HSPs of the a-crystallin type. Overproduction of a recombinant HSP IbpA (Hsp20) from the free-living mycoplasma Acholeplasma laidlawii was shown to increase the resistance of Escherichia coli to short-term heat shock. It has been long assumed that IbpA prevents protein aggregation and precipitation thereby increasing viability of E. coli cells. Several potential target proteins interacting with IbpA under heat stress were identified, including biosynthetic enzymes, enzymes of energy metabolism, and components of the protein synthesis machinery. Statistical analysis of physicochemical properties indicated that IbpA interaction partners significantly differ in molecular weight, charge, and isoelectric point from other members of the E. coli proteome. Upon short-term exposure to increased temperature, IbpA was found to preferentially interact with high-molecular-weight proteins having a pI of about 5.1, significantly lower than the typical values of E. coli proteins.

AB  - This paper presents topology optimization for thermal cloaks expressed by level-set functions and explored using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Designed optimal configurations provide superior performances in thermal cloaks for the steady-state thermal conduction and succeed in realizing thermal invisibility, despite the structures being simply composed of iron and aluminum and without inhomogeneities caused by employing metamaterials. To design thermal cloaks, a prescribed objective function is used to evaluate the difference between the temperature field controlled by a thermal cloak and when no thermal insulator is present. The CMA-ES involves searches for optimal sets of level-set functions as design variables that minimize a regularized fitness involving a perimeter constraint. Through topology optimization subject to structural symmetries about four axes, we obtain a concept design of a thermal cloak that functions in an isotropic heat flux. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB  - Unit commitment problem (UCP) aims at optimizing generation cost for meeting a given load demand under several operational constraints. We propose to use fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL) approach for efficient and reliable solution to the unit commitment problem. In particular, we cast UCP as a multiagent fuzzy reinforcement learning task wherein individual generators act as players for optimizing the cost to meet a given load over a twenty-four-hour period. Unit commitment task has been fuzzified, and the most optimal unit commitment solution is generated by employing RL on this fuzzy multigenerator setup. Our proposed multiagent RL framework does not assume any a priori task or system knowledge, and the generators gradually learn to produce most optimal output solely based on their collective generation. We look at the UCP as a sequential decision-making task with reward/penalty to reduce the collective generation cost of generators. To the best of our knowledge, ours is a first attempt at solving UCP by employing fuzzy reinforcement learning. We test our approach on a ten-generating-unit system with several equality and inequality constraints. Simulation results and comparisons against several recent UCP solution methods prove superiority and viability of our proposed multiagent fuzzy reinforcement learning technique.

AB  - Considerable efforts have been devoted to enhancing thermoelectric performance, by employing phonon scattering from nanostructural architecture, and material design using phonon-glass and electron-crystal concepts. The nanostructural approach helps to lower thermal conductivity but has limited effect on the power factor. Here, we demonstrate selective charge Anderson localization as a route to maximize the Seebeck coefficient while simultaneously preserving high electrical conductivity and lowering the lattice thermal conductivity. We confirm the viability of interface potential modification in an n-type Bi-doped PbTe/Ag2Te nanocomposite and the resulting enhancement in thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT. The introduction of random potentials via Ag2Te nanoparticle distribution using extrinsic phase mixing was determined using scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. When the Ag2Te undergoes a structural phase transition (T > 420 K) from monoclinic beta-Ag2Te to cubic alpha-Ag2Te, the band gap in the alpha-Ag2Te increases due to the p-d hybridization. This results in a decrease in the potential barrier height, which gives rise to partial delocalization of the electrons, while wave packets of the holes are still in a localized state. Using this strategic approach, we achieved an exceptionally high thermoelectric figure-of-merit in n-type PbTe materials, a ZT greater than 2.0, suitable for waste heat power generation.

AB  - In this paper, a method is derived for evaluating the thermo-economic performance of solar aided power generation (SAPG) hybrid systems. These systems can achieve emissions reduction and energy savings compared to conventional coal-fired power generation systems. In the discussed model of SAPG hybrid system, various stages of heating feed-water in a conventional coal-fired power plant steam Rankine system are replaced by steam injected from solar direct steam generation (DSG). In order to determine the thermo-economic viability of SAPG compared to conventional power generation, convenient methods are required for evaluating the performance of SAPG systems. Therefore, an analysis method is developed which involves defining a generalized steam-water distribution matrix equation. This matrix approach simplifies the traditional thermal calculation and has a one-to-one correspondence with the system structure. As a case study, the proposed method is successfully used to solve the case of a 600 MW power generation system with the integration of DSG. A comparison of the case study system with (SAPG) and without (non-SAPG) the integration of the solar DSG shows thermo-economic benefits to the hybridised system. If the state parameters are taken as variables, this method can be used to study the effects of changes in system, equipment, operation, and load on the thermal economy of the integrated system.

AB  - How did human intelligence evolve to be so high? Lynn [Lynn, R. (199 1). The evolution of race differences in intelligence. Mankind Quarterly, 32, 99-173] and Rushton [Rushton, J.P. (1995). Race, evolution, and behavior: A life history perspective. New Brunswick: Transaction] suggest that the main forces behind the evolution of human intelligence were the cold climate and harsh winters, which selected out individuals of lower intelligence. In contrast, Kanazawa [Kanazawa, S. (2004). General intelligence as a domain-specific adaptation. Psychological Review, 111, 512-523] contends that it is the evolutionary novelty of the environment which increased general intelligence. Multiple regression analyses support both theories. Annual mean temperature and evolutionary novelty (measured by latitude, longitude, and distance from the ancestral environment) simultaneously have independent effects on average intelligence of populations. Temperature and evolutionary novelty together explain half to two-thirds of variance in national IQ. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A fertile hexaploid oat plant was obtained after several generations of selection for seed set and plant type from a colchicine-produced decaploid hybrid, Avena abyssinica (2n = 4x = 28, AABB) x A. sativa (2n = 6x = 42, AACCDD). The selected line proved to be stably fertile and in many characteristics equal or superior to the hexaploid parent. The grain protein fractions showed two qualitative differences from those of the pollen parent and several differences from the maternal parent. The fractionating extraction used was new for oats. The fatty acid composition of grains of the hybrid derivative was similar to that of the pollen parent, but different from that of the maternal parent. The maternal parent (A. abyssinica) had a relatively high 16:0 fatty acid content (ca. 20.5 mol%) compared with the level of the hexaploid parent and the hybrid derivation (ca. 17.5 mol% each) in field-grown grain. However, in grain produced in the greenhouse, the hexaploids had ca. 20.5 mol% of 16:0 fatty acid and a decrease in 18:1 fatty acid, whereas seed of the A. abyssinica parent showed only a slight increase (ca. 21.5 mol%) in 16:0 fatty acid. These and other responses statistically significant may be due to adaptation to temperature conditions being wider in the hexaploids than in the East-African A. abyssinica. A new method of grain lipid extraction was introduced and showed good reproducibility. The derived hexaploid oat can be crossed with A. sativa for breeding purposes and due to its early maturity might also have direct use in northern or high-altitude cultivation.

AB  - The possibility was examined whether the pool of sequence variants of HLVd which accumulated as progeny of "thermomutants" induced upon heat-treatment of hop could initiate infection of non-host solanaceous plants. It was found that HLVd microevolution led to the appearance of HLVd population in tomato. This viroid population was maintained at levels detectable by molecular hybridisation, showing the highest concentration in apical leaves. HLVd was further transferred from tomato to Nicotiana benthamiana, where distinct HLVd sequence variants appeared and were stably maintained at low levels. Our results show that replication of HLVd under heat stress resulted in the production of viroid quasispecies, potentially important for viroid evolution in so-called non host plants.

AB  - Sex determination is a complex process that can be influenced by environment in various taxa. Disturbed environments can affect population sex ratios and thus threaten their viability. Emerging evidences support a role of epigenetic mechanisms, notably DNA methylation, in environmental sex determination (ESD). In this work, using zebrafish as model and a transgenerational experiment comprising 4 successive generations, we report a strength link between the promotor methylation level of three genes in female gonads and population sex ratio. One generation of zebrafish was exposed throughout its lifetime to cadmium (Cd), a non-essential metal, at an environmentally relevant concentration. The subsequent generations were not exposed. At the first and the third generation a subset of individuals was exposed to an elevated temperature, a well-known masculinizing factor in zebrafish. While heat was associated to an increase in the methylation level of cyp19a1a gene and population masculinization, foxl2a/dmrt1 methylation levels appeared to be influenced by Cd and fish density leading to offspring feminization. Ancestral Cd exposure indeed led to a progressive feminization of the population over generations and affected the sex plastic response of zebrafish in response to heat. The effect of Cd on the methylation level of foxl2a was observed until the third generation, supporting potential transgenerational inheritance. Our results support (i) a key role of cyp19a1a methylation in SD in zebrafish in response to environmental cues and (ii) the fact that the environment experienced by parents, namely mothers in the present case, can affect their offspring sex ratio via environment-induced DNA methylation changes in gonads.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity can be it passive response to fluctuating environmental conditions or an active and presumably adaptive (evolved) response selected for in different environments. Here we ask if the larval decision to enter diapause when reared on a host plant associated with a colder habitat is an active or a passive response to host-plant quality or suitability. We compare plasticity in larval propensity to enter diapause of the habitat generalist butterfly Leptidea sinapis and the meadow specialist Leptidea reali in a range of temperatures and long day length oil a forest plant, Lathyrus linifolius, and a meadow-associated plant, Lathyrus pratensis. The warmer meadow habitat promotes direct development whereas the colder forest habitat is conducive to dispause. Larvae of L. sinapis had a higher propensity to enter diapause when reared on the forest plant L. linifolius across all temperatures. Conversely, the propensity of L. reali to enter diapause was consistently lower and did not differ between host plants. Larval growth rates were similar between and within butterfly species and between host plants. Hence, we conclude that larval pathway decision-making in L. sinapis is an active response mediated by information from their host plants.

First published April 29, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.90562.2008.-Microbes have been widely used in experimental evolutionary studies because they possess a variety of valuable traits that facilitate large-scale experimentation. Many replicated populations can be cultured in the laboratory simultaneously along with appropriate controls. Short generation times and large population sizes make microbes ideal experimental subjects, ensuring that many spontaneous mutations occur every generation and that adaptive variants can spread rapidly through a population. Another highly useful experimental feature is the ability to preserve and store ancestral and evolutionarily derived clones. These can be revived in parallel to allow the direct measurement of the competitive fitness of a descendant compared with its ancestor. The extent of adaptation can thereby be measured quantitatively and compared statistically by direct competition among derived groups and with the ancestor. Thus, fitness and adaptation need not be matters of qualitative speculation, but are quantitatively measurable variables in these systems. Replication allows the quantification of heterogeneity in responses to imposed selection and thereby statistical distinction between changes that are systematic responses to the selective regimen and those that are specific to individual populations.

AB  - Understanding how thermal selection affects phenotypic distributions across different time scales will allow us to predict the effect of climate change on the fitness of ectotherms. We tested how seasonal temperature variation affects basal levels of cold tolerance and two types of phenotypic plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster. Developmental acclimation occurs as developmental stages of an organism are exposed to seasonal changes in temperature and its effect is irreversible, while reversible short-term acclimation occurs daily in response to diurnal changes in temperature. We collected wild flies from a temperate population across seasons and measured two cold tolerance metrics (chill-coma recovery and cold stress survival) and their responses to developmental and short-term acclimation. Chill-coma recovery responded to seasonal shifts in temperature, and phenotypic plasticity following both short-term and developmental acclimation improved cold tolerance. This improvement indicated that both types of plasticity are adaptive, and that plasticity can compensate for genetic variation in basal cold tolerance during warmer parts of the season when flies tend to be less cold tolerant. We also observed a significantly stronger trade-off between basal cold tolerance and short-term acclimation during warmer months. For the longer-term developmental acclimation, a trade-off persisted regardless of season. A relationship between the two types of plasticity may provide additional insight into why some measures of thermal tolerance are more sensitive to seasonal variation than others.

AB  - Due to the high dependency on hydroelectric power generation, Brazil faced a power shortage in 2001. In order to remedy the situation and avoid more severe power crises in the future, the Brazilian Government launched incentive programmes to encourage thermal and renewable power generation. The Programme of Incentives to Alternative Sources (PROINFA) is mainly devoted to the utilisation of biomass. The success of PROINFA depends on the availability of reliable studies for assessing existing biomass resources and the viability of their utilisation for power generation. In this study, energy potentials of the main biomass resources in the northeastern region of Brazil have been assessed. The economy of the north-eastern region of Brazil is heavily dependent on its sugar industry. Biomass available from sugarcane cultivation and processing represents an annual regional energy resource of 40.5 TWh at an average cost of US$ 0.005/kWh. Bamboo, cultivated as a dedicated energy crop, has the second largest annual energy potential of 30.8 TWh at an average cost of US$ 0.009/kWh. Municipal solid waste, generated in the region, has an annual energy potential of about 16.7 TWh. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomass gasification streams typically contain a mixture of CO, H-2, CH4, and CO(2 )as the majority components and frequently require conditioning for downstream processes. Herein, we investigate the catalytic upgrading of surrogate biomass gasifiers through the generation of syngas. Seeking a bifunctional system capable of converting CO2 and CH4 to CO, a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalyst based on Fe/MgAl(2)O(4 )was decorated with an increasing content of Ni metal and evaluated for producing syngas using different feedstock compositions. This approach proved efficient for gas upgrading, and the incorporation of adequate Ni content increased the CO content by promoting the RWGS and dry reforming of methane (DRM) reactions. The larger CO productivity attained at high temperatures was intimately associated with the generation of FeNi3 alloys. Among the catalysts' series, Ni-rich catalysts favored the CO productivity in the presence of CH4, but important carbon deposition processes were noticed. On the contrary, 2Ni-Fe/MgAl2O4 resulted in a competitive and cost-effective system delivering large amounts of CO with almost no coke deposits. Overall, the incorporation of a suitable realistic application for valorization of variable composition of biomass-gasification derived mixtures obtaining a syngas-rich stream thus opens new routes for biosyngas production and upgrading.

AB  - 1. In many reptile species, females oviposit communally (i.e. many clutches are laid within the same nest). This behaviour might result from constraint (scarcity of nest-sites offering suitable incubation conditions) or adaptation (direct fitness benefits accruing from the proximity of other eggs).
   2. To test between these alternatives, we gathered field and laboratory data on montane scincid lizards Bassiana duperreyi from south-eastern Australia. Our data support the adaptationist hypothesis.
   3. In the field, communal vs. solitary clutches were laid in similar sites, and the relative frequency of communal nesting was not predictable from nest-site availability. Thermal regimes for incubation did not differ between communal vs. solitary nests, nor between eggs at the core vs. periphery of a communal nest. In the laboratory, females selectively oviposited beside existing eggs rather than in otherwise identical potential nesting sites.
   4. From cycling-temperature incubation in the laboratory, eggs incubated within a cluster of other eggs took up less water, but produced hatchlings that were larger and faster-running than were hatchlings from eggs incubated alone.
   5. Hydric modifications of incubation conditions within a cluster of tightly packed eggs thus may provide a direct fitness benefit to communal oviposition.

AB  - Understanding tolerance of thermal extremes by pest insects is essential for developing integrated management strategies, as tolerance traits can provide insights into constraints on activity and survival. A major question in thermal biology is whether thermal limits vary systematically with microclimate variation, or whether other biotic or abiotic factors can influence these limits in a predictable manner. Here, we report the results of experiments determining thermal limits to activity and survival at extreme temperatures in the stalk borer Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), collected from either Saccharum spp. hybrids (sugarcane) (Poaceae) or Cyperus papyrus L. (Cyperaceae) and then reared under standard conditions in the laboratory for 1-2 generations. Chill-coma temperature (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), lower lethal temperatures (LLT), and freezing temperature between E.saccharina collected from the two host plants were compared. CTmin and CTmax of E.saccharina moths collected from sugarcane were significantly lower than those from C.papyrus (CTmin=2.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C; CTmax=44.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 44.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C). By contrast, LLT of moths and freezing temperatures of pupae did not vary with host plant [LLT for 50% (LT50) of the moth population, when collected from sugarcane: -3.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C, from C.papyrus: -3.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C]. Freezing temperatures of pupae collected from C.papyrus were -18.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C and of those from sugarcane -17.5 +/- 1.8 degrees C. The E.saccharina which experienced the lowest minimum temperature (in C.papyrus) did not have the lowest CTmin, although the highest estimate of CTmax was found in E.saccharina collected from C.papyrus and this was also the microsite which reported the highest maximum temperatures. These results therefore suggest that host plant may strongly mediate lower critical thermal limits, but not necessarily LLT or freezing temperatures. These results have significant implications for ongoing pest management and thermal biology of these and other insects.

AB  - Seawater temperature is projected to increase globally due to climate change, affecting physiological responses, fitness and survival of marine organisms. Thermal tolerance studies are critical to determine the ability of animals to adapt to future environmental conditions. In this study, we aimed to determine if the thermal limits of the New Zealand Evechinus chloroticus would shift with animal's thermal history. We tested the effect of six thermal regimes on the righting ability, temperature of loss of righting (T-LOR), median lethal temperature (LT50), lethal temperature (LT) and the gene expression of the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) of the New Zealand sea urchin E. chloroticus when exposed to a thermal shock of 1 degrees C day(-1) (duration of 7-16 days depending on the treatment). Treatments consisted of laboratory acclimation for one and four weeks to 18 degrees C and 24 degrees C (mean winter (15 degrees C) and summer temperature (21 degrees C) + 3 degrees C of warming, respectively), compared to non-acclimated sea urchins collected during winter (14.6 degrees C) and summer seasons (20.4 degrees C). Thermal history did not have a significant effect on the righting ability of E. chloroticus (T-LOR ranged between 28 and 29 degrees C for all treatments) and LT50 (ranged between 29 and 30 degrees C for all treatments). However, LT of E. chloroticus collected during winter season was significantly lower than animals acclimated for one week at 18 degrees C. Maximum expression of hsp70 mRNA (T-max) was observed at around 27-28 degrees C regardless of treatment; however, relative hsp70 mRNA levels were significantly higher in animals acclimated for four weeks at 24 degrees C. Despite proving to be a thermotolerant species with LTs around 30 degrees C, E. chloroticus was unable to increase thermal tolerance and Tmax when acclimated to high temperatures, suggesting that E. chloroticus may have a limited adaptive capacity to modify its phenotype; however, evolutionary adaptations may allow E. chloroticus to adapt to future ocean temperatures.

AB  - Cyclic multi-thermal fluid stimulation (i.e., huff and puff) in a horizontal well is an effective way to recover offshore heavy oil reservoirs. To rapidly predict reservoir production performance, an analytical model for predicting the productivity of a cyclic multi-thermal fluid stimulation in a horizontal well was developed in this study. The underlying assumption in this study is that multi-thermal fluids spread around the horizontal well cylindrically at the beginning of injection and then along the top or bottom as the fluids contact those regions; this creates a composite reservoir with hot and cold zones. First, a production formula for a horizontal well in the composite reservoir described was derived using the equivalent flow resistance method from the water electric analogy principle. A heat diffusion model of multi-thermal fluids was then used to describe how the fluids spread out in the reservoir. Then, an evolution model of the physical fields was built by considering the enhanced oil recovery mechanism of multi-thermal fluids, which describes the evolution of temperature, pressure, oil viscosity, relative permeability curves, etc. during the huff-and-puff process. A new formula was used to determine the reduction in viscosity caused by carbon dioxide present in the fluid. The desired production prediction model was then established by coupling the developed production formula, heat diffusion model and evolution model. The analytical model was verified by numerical simulations and application to an offshore oil field. This study described an effective and quick method for productivity prediction, reservoir dynamic analysis and injection optimization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, Levy flight and Fitness Distance Balance (FDB)-based coyote optimization algorithm (LRFDBCOA) is proposed to improve the performance of automatic generation control (AGC) of three different PV-based interconnected power systems. First, the achievement of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the two-area PV-reheat thermal power system with PI controller, which is widely used in the literature, and the results are compared with the results obtained using genetic algorithm (GA), firefly algorithm (FA), and modified whale optimization algorithm (M-WOA) introduced in previous studies. Then, the control performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the newly constructed two-area PV-non-reheat thermal power system with governor dead band (GDB) and two-area PV-multi-source power system with electrolyser and fuel cell. As the costs of solar energy systems decrease, the microgrids containing these resources increase. Therefore, such a study will make an important contribution to the literature. For the AGC of these two systems, proportional-integral-derivative (PID), tilt-integral-derivative (TID) and fractional order PID (FOPID) controllers are used. Thus, both the performance of the proposed algorithm on AGC and the compatibility of the two newly tested systems with PID, TID and FOPID controllers are revealed. As a result, the proposed LRFDBCOA algorithm outperforms algorithms such as GA, FA, M-WOA and arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) in interconnected two-area power systems controlled by PID, TID and FOPID, and it shows superior control performance in terms of settling time, maximum/minimum peak value of Delta f(1), Delta f(2) and Delta P-tie under varying load conditions and perturbed system parameters.

AB  - The products of acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) have great economic and cultural importance in Brazil with a growing consumer market. Seeking to provide a basis for the expansion of this crop in other states, we sought to develop the agroclimatic zoning for this crop in the state of Espirito Santo. Therefore, we used data from 110 meteorological stations and governmental geotecnologic's tool ArcGIS 10.1 for spatialize temperature data, precipitation and water deficit and then reschedule them for the generation of zoning. The results showed that 20.74% of the total area of the Espirito Santo has areas suitable to this culture, located in the Northeastern, Southern and mountainous, with Linhares the municipality with the highest fitness. Although most of the state has some kind of constraint that limits the cultivation, whether the variable is water deficit precipitation, some techniques can minimize such restrictions. Thus, it becomes feasible to implement the culture of acai in the state of Espirito Santo according to the variables temperature, precipitation and water deficit.

AB  - Climate change may affect plant-herbivore interactions and their associated ecosystem functions. In an experimental evolution approach, we subjected replicated populations of the invasive Ambrosia artemisiifolia to a combination of simulated warming and herbivory by a potential biocontrol beetle. We tracked genomic and metabolomic changes across generations in field populations and assessed plant offspring phenotypes in a common environment. Using an integrated Bayesian model, we show that increased offspring biomass in response to warming arose through changes in the genetic composition of populations. In contrast, increased resistance to herbivory arose through a shift in plant metabolomic profiles without genetic changes, most likely by transgenerational induction of defences. Importantly, while increased resistance was costly at ambient temperatures, warming removed this constraint and favoured both vigorous and better defended plants under biocontrol. Climate warming may thus decrease biocontrol efficiency and promote Ambrosia invasion, with potentially serious economic and health consequences.

AB  - Mediterranean vipers are ecologically very similar. When in contact, they constitute an exceptional model to study the effects of competitive interactions and niche segregation mechanisms. In High Ebro, distinct methodologies (random visual encounter, road sampling and radio-tracking surveys, captive maintenance, standardized transects and ad hoc field observations) were used to compare ecological traits (diet, micro-habitat, activity, reproductive and demographic) of V. aspis, V. latastei and hybrids among both species and determine competitive advantages of each form. Diet preferences were similar but few differences were found in feeding frequency and annual variation in diet consumption. Males of the three forms compete for areas with similar characteristics but differences were found mainly during summer. Significant differences in average movement rates and home range size were found among males. Fecundity and new-borns fitness were lower in V. aspis than in V. latastei, whereas hybrids had intermediate values. Male and female adult hybrids were more abundant than parental forms, whereas female and juvenile V. latastei and juvenile hybrids had high road-mortality. The three forms seem to be competing intensely for resources but the segregation on the spatial and temporal axes of their niches could be reducing interspecific competition and allowing coexistence. The use of different resources probably confers reproductive and demographic advantages for V. latastei and hybrids, respectively. Moreover, reproductive fitness of hybrids suggests the occurrence of endogenous selection. Comparative thermal and genetic studies are needed to clarify the limiting factors of vipers and to establish a model of the hybrid zone.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to measure Chinese regional thermal industries' evolution.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) and global Malmquist-Luenberger productivity (GMLP) index.
   Findings The results reveal that the development of Chinese thermal power industry varies significantly in different regions, and it is highly correlated with the level of local economic development. Although the change of technical efficiency and scale efficiency had different impacts on different regions from year to year, the overall GMLP index change shows a close relationship with the contemporaneous frontier shift.
   Practical implications The results indicate that the Chinese Government should make efforts to promote its policy implementations and regulations in thermal industries so that the contemporaneous frontier will shift toward the global technology frontier with more desirable outputs and less undesirable outputs.
   Originality/value As an application, this study uses DEA and GMLP index to measure the productivity of Chinese thermal industries in 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2013. The results have the meaningful policy implications for decision makers in charge of Chinese thermal industries.

AB  - Classical ecological studies discussing specialization usually focus on species' performance along one niche axis. This approach may overlook niche differentiation evident in another dimension which could explain species co-occurrence. The present research exemplifies a comprehensive approach to examining local adaptation. Specifically, we examined multiple niche axes by subjecting a model organism to various experimental conditions to monitor responses to extreme stress associated with heat, desiccation and starvation. Our model system comprised two pit-building antlions: the habitat generalist Myrmeleon hyalinus and the habitat specialist Cueta lineosa. Previous research has shown that the foraging performance of the generalist is better than that of the specialist, even in the latter's characteristic habitat. We illustrate that this apparent superiority of the habitat generalist does not manifest itself along other niche axes; rather, the habitat specialist holds a set of traits that provide an advantage under harsh environmental conditions. Specifically, C. lineosa has an advantage over M. hyalinus at high temperatures, exhibiting a higher survival rate and improved foraging success (i.e., high-temperature specialist). C. lineosa is also more efficient in its energy budget, losing less mass during starvation and gaining mass more efficiently during feeding. This superior efficiency is a result of physiological adaptations as well as behavioural responses to harsh conditions. In conclusion, our results imply that the habitat specialization of C. lineosa has not led it towards an evolutionary dead-end.

AB  - Stress resistance characters are valuable tools for the study of acclimation potential, adaptive strategies and biogeographic patterns in species exposed to environmental variability. Water stress is a challenge to terrestrial arthropods because of their small size and relatively high area: volume ratio. Fruit flies have been investigated to record adaptive morphological and physiological traits, as well as to test their responses to stressful factors. In this study, we investigate the ability to cope with water stress, by examining variation in desiccation resistance in a species that lives mainly in desert lands. Specifically, we explored the genetic and ecological basis of desiccation resistance in populations of Drosophila buzzatii from Northern Argentina. We used a common garden experiment with desiccation treatments on a number of isofemale lines from four populations along an aridity gradient. Our results revealed significant among-population differentiation and substantial amounts of genetic variation for desiccation resistance. We also detected significant genotype-by-environment and genotype-by-sex interactions indicative that desiccation resistance responses of the lines assayed were environment- and sex-specific. In addition, we observed clinal variation in female desiccation resistance along gradients of altitude, temperature and humidity; that desiccation resistance is a sexually dimorphic trait, and that sexual dimorphism increased along the aridity and altitudinal gradients. Based on current evidence, we propose that the observed sex-specific responses may reflect different life history traits, and survival and reproductive strategies in different ecological scenarios.

AB  - Among the concentrated solar power technologies, those based on Organic Rankine Cycles have a very low market presence. However they have favorable characteristics for applications with low temperature and small/medium size (<10 MW), such as off-grid applications or distributed power generation.
   In this paper is analyzed a 5 MW parabolic trough plant integrated with an Organic Rankine cycle power block and thermal storage. On this purpose, two different thermal storage integrations are analyzed. They are based on two different heat storage layouts: direct system using Hitec XL both as Heat Transfer Fluid and as storage medium; indirect system using Therminol VP-1 as Heat Transfer Fluid and Hitec XL as storage medium.
   Full system performance at rated and off-design conditions is presented operating with different organic working fluids. Its potential application and main challenges for its development are discussed in terms of performance and costs. Among the analyzed working fluids, the best results were obtained for the cycle working with Toluene with an efficiency at the power block of 31.5% and an estimated power block cost of 825 (sic)/kW. The indirect storage layout was the most interesting from the point of view of Levelized Electricity Cost (16.19 c(sic)/kW) and productivity (28.2 GW 11/y for a 5 MWel plant) for 10 h of storage However, it results in a storage tanks volume 26% greater than the obtained for the equivalent direct storage layout. The results show the competitiveness and the potential of the proposed integrated small size parabolic trough designs for isolated applications as mines or for some distributed generation uses where grid capacity is limited.

AB  - Background Although bioethanol production has been gaining worldwide attention as an alternative to fossil fuel, ethanol productivities and yields are still limited due to the susceptibility of fermentation microorganisms to various stress and inhibitory substances. There is therefore an unmet need to search for multi-stress-tolerant organisms to improve ethanol productivity and reduce production cost, particularly when lignocellulosic hydrolysates are used as the feedstock. Results Here, we have characterized a previously isolated Pichia kudriavzevii LC375240 strain which is thermotolerant to high temperatures of 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C. More excitingly, growth and ethanol productivity of this strain exhibit strong tolerance to multiple stresses such as acetic acid, furfural, formic acid, H2O2 and high concentration of ethanol at 42 degrees C. In addition, simple immobilization of LC375240 on corncobs resulted to a more stable and higher efficient ethanol production for successive four cycles of repeated batch fermentation at 42 degrees C. Conclusion The feature of being thermotolerant and multi-stress-tolerant is unique to P. kudriavzevii LC375240 and makes it a good candidate for second-generation bioethanol fermentation as well as for investigating the molecular basis underlying the robust stress tolerance. Immobilization of P. kudriavzevii LC375240 on corncobs is another option for cheap and high ethanol productivity.

AB  - Crystalline silicon was obtained from the ash of wheat (husk and spike), which was fertilized by a system of controlled release of urea. The method used was a thermal reduction (550 degrees C, 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C). Temperature (TGA), morphological (SEM-EDX), FTIR, XRD, and RAMAN characterizations were performed. Silicon was used to build a solar cell with this configuration ITO/CdS/Si/CP/Au, which was characterized by J-V curves. In the present work, we obtained highly crystalline silicon, which could be used for energy generation at low temperatures of magnesium-reduction. The increase of silica in wheat could be attributed to the type of fertilization. We are using an environmentally friendly system due to the reduction reaction to silicon from the ashes of what is feasible to contribute to clean energy generation at a low cost.

AB  - Adaptability is the key word when referring to the social history of opera, its institutions, its protagonists, its sponsors, its audiences and publics. This paper intends to illuminate only a limited number of certain historical aspects of opera's social life in terms of its publics, audiences, consumers, appreciators and supporters. Opera's social power has been for centuries in service to legitimate the power of authorities, to ensure the prestige of elites, and to heat the passion of masses. By referring to relevant literature and illustrative examples, it will be established at the end of this article that the element that ensured opera's success and long survival was and remains its adaptability to whatever historical contexts, social conditions, economic situations, political regimes and cultural milieus surrounded it.

AB  - The movement of adult muskellunge, Esox masquinongy Mitchill, has been investigated in a variety of systems, but temperature selection by muskellunge has not been examined where well-oxygenated waters were available over a range of temperatures for much of the year. Thirty subadult and adult muskellunge tagged internally with temperature-sensing radio tags were tracked from March 2010 to March 2011 in a Tennessee reservoir. Mean tag temperatures were 18.9 degrees C in spring (March to May), 22.1 degrees C in summer (June to August), 16.5 degrees C in autumn and 9.8 degrees C in winter (December to February). When the greatest range in water temperatures was available (7.1-33.3 degrees C; May to early August 2010), their realised thermal niche (mean +/- 1SD) was 22.3 degrees C +/- 1.8; the realised thermal niche was affected by fish size (smaller fish selected slightly warmer temperatures) but not sex. An electric generating steam plant discharging warm water resumed operation in January 2011, and most (86%) tagged fish occupied the plume where temperatures were approximate to 10 degrees C warmer than ambient water temperatures. No mortalities were observed 15days later when plant operations ceased. Their affinity for the heated plume prompted concerns that muskellunge will be too easily exploited when the plant operates during winter.

AB  - Lack of tree fecundity data across climatic gradients precludes the analysis of how seed supply contributes to global variation in forest regeneration and biotic interactions responsible for biodiversity. A global synthesis of raw seedproduction data shows a 250-fold increase in seed abundance from cold-dry to warm-wet climates, driven primarily by a 100-fold increase in seed production for a given tree size. The modest (threefold) increase in forest productivity across the same climate gradient cannot explain the magnitudes of these trends. The increase in seeds per tree can arise from adaptive evolution driven by intense species interactions or from the direct effects of a warm, moist climate on tree fecundity. Either way, the massive differences in seed supply ramify through food webs potentially explaining a disproportionate role for species interactions in the wet tropics.

AB  - 1. This paper describes the results of an investigation of the relationship between mortality from cerebrovascular disease (hereafter called stroke) and the indoor thermal environment in two selected towns with different socioeconomic compositions: Shiwahime, an agricultural town with relatively high stroke mortality, and Karakuwa, a fishing town with relatively low stroke mortality, using a case-control research design.
   2. The measurement of the indoor thermal environments were conducted and the surveyed with a questionnaire during the winter of 1986.
   3. The findings are summarized as detailed below.
   4. Room temperatures in the control households were generally higher than those in the case households by up to 1.3 degrees C.
   5. The thermal conditions of the housing in the case households were a little inferior to those in the control households.
   6. Despite much lower room temperatures than the so-called comfort temperature, members of both the case and the central households did not express feelings of being cold in the rooms.
   7. It is concluded, including the survey results from other literature, that improvements in the indoor thermal environment should receive more attention with respect of the reduction in stroke mortality, particularly in areas of cold climates.

AB  - We analyzed genetic variation among geographically diverse populations of Drosophila and showed that tropical flies are more tolerant than temperate ones to heat-induced male sterility, as assessed by the presence of both motile sperm and progeny production. In tropical populations, the temperature inducing 50% sterility (median threshold) is 1 C above the value for temperate populations (30.4 vs. 29.4degreesC). When transferred to a mild permissive temperature (21 C), males recover fertility. Recovery time is proportional to pre-adult culture temperature. At these temperatures, recovery time is greater for temperate than for tropical populations. Crosses between a temperate and a tropical strain (F-1, F-2 and successive backcrosses) revealed that the Y chromosome was responsible for much of the geographic variation. Sterile males exhibited diverse abnormalities in the shape and position of sperm nuclei. However, impairment of the spermatid elongation seems to be the major factor responsible for sperm inviability. Heat-induced male sterility seems to be quite a general phenomenon in Drosophilid species and variation of threshold temperatures may be important for explaining their geographic distributions.

AB  - The ability to tolerate environmental stress may determine invasion success of alien species. Comparative data on physiological thermal tolerance between native and invasive vertebrates are quite limited. Here, we assessed the difference in thermal tolerance between a native (Mauremys reevesii) and an invasive (Trachemys scripta elegans) freshwater turtle species. We incubated eggs of M. reevesii and T. scripta elegans from different cohorts at 29 degrees C, and measured the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax) of hatchlings. Our results preliminarily showed that the hatchlings of T. scripta elegans had a greater high-temperature tolerance and wider tolerance range than the hatchlings of M. reevesii; in the two-cohort system, individuals from the high-latitude cohort seemed to have greater low-temperature tolerance but similar high-temperature tolerance compared with those from the low-latitude cohort. Relatively greater thermal tolerance ability for T. scripta elegans might reflect its environmental adaptability to thermal stress.

AB  - There is considerable understanding about how laboratory populations respond to predictable (constant or deteriorating environment) selection for single environmental variables such as temperature or pH. However, such insights may not apply when selection environments comprise multiple variables that fluctuate unpredictably, as is common in nature. To address this issue, we grew replicate laboratory populations of Escherichia coli in nutrient broth whose pH and concentrations of salt (NaCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were randomly changed daily. After similar to 170 generations, the fitness of the selected populations had not increased in any of the three selection environments. However, these selected populations had significantly greater fitness in four novel environments which have no known fitness-correlation with tolerance to pH, NaCl or H2O2. Interestingly, contrary to expectations, hypermutators did not evolve. Instead, the selected populations evolved an increased ability for energy-dependent efflux activity that might enable them to throw out toxins, including antibiotics, from the cell at a faster rate. This provides an alternate mechanism for how evolvability can evolve in bacteria and potentially lead to broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance, even in the absence of prior antibiotic exposure. Given that environmental variability is increasing in nature, this might have serious consequences for public health.

AB  - Environmental changes may stress organisms and stimulate an adaptive phenotypic response. Effects of inbreeding often interact with the environment and can decrease fitness of inbred individuals exposed to stress more so than that of outbred individuals. Such an interaction may stem from a reduced ability of inbred individuals to respond plastically to environmental stress; however, this hypothesis has rarely been tested. In this study, we mimicked the genetic constitution of natural inbred populations by rearing replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations for 25 generations at a reduced population size (10 individuals). The replicate inbred populations, as well as control populations reared at a population size of 500, were exposed to a benign developmental temperature and two developmental temperatures at the lower and upper margins of their viable range. Flies developed at the three temperatures were assessed for traits known to vary across temperatures, namely abdominal pigmentation, wing size, and wing shape. We found no significant difference in phenotypic plasticity in pigmentation or in wing size between inbred and control populations, but a significantly higher plasticity in wing shape across temperatures in inbred compared to control populations. Given that the norms of reaction for the noninbred control populations are adaptive, we conclude that a reduced ability to induce an adaptive phenotypic response to temperature changes is not a general consequence of inbreeding and thus not a general explanation of inbreeding-environment interaction effects on fitness components.

AB  - The physiology and behaviour of ectotherms are strongly influenced by environmental temperature. A general hypothesis is that for performance traits, such as those related to growth, metabolism or locomotion, species face a trade-off between being a thermal specialist or a thermal generalist, implying a negative correlation between peak performance and performance breadth across a range of temperatures. Focusing on teleost fishes, we performed a phylogenetically informed comparative analysis of the relationship between performance peak and breadth for aerobic scope (AS), which represents whole-animal capacity available to carry out simultaneous oxygen-demanding processes (e.g. growth, locomotion, reproduction) above maintenance. Literature data for 28 species indicate that peak aerobic capacity is not linked to thermal performance breadth and that other physiological factors affecting thermal tolerance may prevent such a trade-off from emerging. The results therefore suggest that functional links between peak and thermal breadth for AS may not constrain evolutionary responses to environmental changes such as climate warming.

AB  - The viability of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792) culture is being challenged progressively by global warming. Previous trials with Australian and Japanese rainbow trout lines suggested that improvements in thermal performance may be possible. Here, we hypothesized that strain-related differences in physiological response to temperature exist between a north Patagonian hatchery stock (CENSALBA), a Neotropical one (Criadero Boca de Rio), and a thermal stream (Valcheta) population of wild introduced rainbow trout. This was tested by comparing, at 20 degrees C, the thermal preference, specific metabolic rate, thermal tolerance, growth, and condition on juveniles of the three strains, and on a Valcheta stream male x CENSALBA female F1 cross. Preferred temperature (PT) and loss of equilibrium temperature (LET, a measure of thermal tolerance) of Valcheta stream and F1 were significantly higher than those of CENSALBA, and the average PTs of Valcheta stream and F1 were higher than the 95% confidence interval of available reference data for rainbow trout. These results suggest that the F1, reared under standard hatchery conditions and selected by growth and thermal preference, presents higher thermal preference and higher thermal tolerance than the current CENSALBA hatchery stock. Introduction of this naturally adapted strain to hatchery stocks would likely result in the improvement of their temperature resistance to warmer waters. Current studies on adults of this F1 generation are underway.

AB  - Robustness is considered to be an important feature of biological systems which may evolve when the functionality of a trait is associated with higher fitness across multiple environmental conditions. Thus, the ability to maintain stable biological phenotypes across environments is thought to be of adaptive value. Previously, we have reported higher intrinsic activity levels (activity levels of free-running rhythm in constant darkness) and power of rhythm (as assessed by amplitude of the periodogram) in Drosophila melanogaster populations (stocks) reared in constant darkness (DD stocks) as compared to those reared in constant light (LL stocks) and 12:12-h light-dark cycles (LD stocks) for over 19 years (similar to 330 generations). In the current study, we intended to examine whether the enhanced levels of activity observed in DD stocks persist under various environments such as photoperiods, ambient temperatures, non-24-h light-dark (LD) cycles, and semi-natural conditions (SN). We found that DD stocks largely retain their phenotype of enhanced activity levels across most of the above-mentioned environments suggesting the evolution of robust circadian clocks in DD stocks. Furthermore, we compared the peak activity levels of the three stocks across different environmental conditions relative to their peaks in constant darkness and found that the change in peak activity levels upon entrainment was not significantly different across the three stocks for any of the examined environmental conditions. This suggests that the enhancement of activity levels in DD stocks is not due to differential sensitivity to environment. Thus, these results suggest that rearing in constant darkness (DD) leads to evolution of robust circadian clocks suggesting a possible adaptive value of possessing such rhythms under constant dark environments.

AB  - Automation and Internet-of-Things (IoT) open doors to achieve increased productivity and efficiency. Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is a type of Auto-identification technique that identifies, locates, authenticates, and engages with other IoT devices to efficiently perform one or more tasks. The concept of the digital twin is enhanced by UHF RFID for the fourth-generation industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. UHF RFID antennas are one of the key endpoint components that are deployed throughout factories, facilitating automation. Antennas predominantly used in industrial environment requires enormous durability to handle vibration, shock, impact, and thermal shocks without trading-off the radiofrequency (RF) performance. This article proposes a novel durable dual-virtual patch antenna design and manufacturing technique for industrial UHF RFID application. The durability of the antenna is offered by the non-conventional RF substrate, galvanized steel backplate and the polyurethane resin-filled plastic radome. The antenna is designed to be assembled by full and semi-robotic process automation.

AB  - Understanding how species can thrive in a range of environments is a central challenge for evolutionary ecology. There is strong evidence for local adaptation along large-scale ecological clines in insects. However, potential adaptation among neighbouring populations differing in their environment has been studied much less. We used RAD sequencing to quantify genetic divergence and clustering of ten populations of the field cricket Gryllus campestris in the Cantabrian Mountains of northern Spain, and an outgroup on the inland plain. Our populations were chosen to represent replicate high and low altitude habitats. We identified genetic clusters that include both high and low altitude populations indicating that the two habitat types do not hold ancestrally distinct lineages. Using common-garden rearing experiments to remove environmental effects, we found evidence for differences between high and low altitude populations in physiological and life-history traits. As predicted by the local adaptation hypothesis, crickets with parents from cooler (high altitude) populations recovered from periods of extreme cooling more rapidly than those with parents from warmer (low altitude) populations. Growth rates also differed between offspring from high and low altitude populations. However, contrary to our prediction that crickets from high altitudes would grow faster, the most striking difference was that at high temperatures, growth was fastest in individuals from low altitudes. Our findings reveal that populations a few tens of kilometres apart have independently evolved adaptations to their environment. This suggests that local adaptation in a range of traits may be commonplace even in mobile invertebrates at scales of a small fraction of species' distributions.

AB  - Over large wheat growing areas of India, a rise in minimum temperature (T-n) is occurring at a faster rate (@ 0.32 degrees C 10 yr(-1)) than maximum temperature (T-x) (@ 0.28 degrees C 10 yr(-1)). During February, coinciding with post-anthesis period of wheat, about 79.4% area showed significant warming in T-n (@ 0.37 degrees C 10 yr(-1)) for 1970-2012 period. Indian wheat yields were observed to be prone to continual heat stress and especially to short-term temperature extremes. Wheat yields appear to be becoming more sensitive to Tn, especially during post-anthesis period. Mean wheat yields for the period 1980-2011 declined by 7% (204 kg ha(-1)) for a 1 degrees C rise in T-n. Exposure to continual T-n exceeding 12 degrees C for 6 days and terminal heat stress with T-x exceeding 34 C for 7 days during post-anthesis period are the other thermal constraints in achieving high productivity. Improved understanding from this study on the role of Tn during post-anthesis period may further reduce the uncertainties in anthropogenic climate change assessments on Indian wheat yields. There is a need to consider inclusion of early maturing, high yielding and heat tolerant wheat lines in the breeding program for Indian conditions. Thermally sensitive areas evolved from this study may guide the researchers to identify such wheat lines for their adaptability in to future climates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate influences population genetic variation in marine species. Capturing these impacts remains challenging for marine fishes which disperse over large geographical scales spanning steep environmental gradients. It requires the extensive spatial sampling of individuals or populations, representative of seascape heterogeneity, combined with a set of highly informative molecular markers capable of revealing climatic-associated genetic variations. We explored how space, dispersal and environment shape the genomic patterns of two sympatric fish species in the Mediterranean Sea, which ranks among the oceanic basins most affected by climate change and human pressure. We hypothesized that the population structure and climate-associated genomic signatures of selection would be stronger in the less mobile species, as restricted gene flow tends to facilitate the fixation of locally adapted alleles. To test our hypothesis, we genotyped two species with contrasting dispersal abilities: the white seabream Diplodus sargus and the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus. We collected 823 individuals and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to detect 8,206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the seabream and 2,794 for the mullet. For each species, we identified highly differentiated genomic regions (i.e. outliers) and disentangled the relative contribution of space, dispersal and environmental variables (climate, marine primary productivity) on the outliers' genetic structure to test the prevalence of gene flow and local adaptation. We observed contrasting patterns of gene flow and adaptive genetic variation between the two species. The seabream showed a distinct Alboran sea population and panmixia across the Mediterranean Sea. The mullet revealed additional differentiation within the Mediterranean Sea that was significantly correlated to summer and winter temperatures, as well as marine primary productivity. Functional annotation of the climate-associated outlier SNPs then identified candidate genes involved in heat tolerance that could be examined to further predict species' responses to climate change. Our results illustrate the key steps of a comparative seascape genomics study aiming to unravel the evolutionary processes at play in marine species, to better anticipate their response to climate change. Defining population adaptation capacities and environmental niches can then serve to incorporate evolutionary processes into species conservation planning.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Seed size is a critical life history attribute with fitness effects that cascade throughout the lifespan of plants. Interspecific studies repeatedly report a negative correlation between seed mass and latitude. Yet, despite its importance, little is known about geographic variation in seed size within species' ranges.
   METHODS: To improve our understanding of intraspecific geographic variation in seed size, we collected and weighed seeds by maternal line from 8 to 17 populations of seven herbaceous plant species spanning large geographic areas, and measured a dispersal trait, awn length, for two grass species. We examined the overall relationship between seed mass and latitude, then divided the data into species-specific subsets to compare the fit of three models to explain seed mass and awn length: (1) latitude and longitude, (2) long-term climate, and (3) collection-year weather.
   KEY RESULTS: Like previous work, we found a negative relationship between interspecific seed mass and latitude. However, the best-fit models explaining seed size and awn length differed between individual species and often included significant interaction terms. For all species, the best model was either long-term or collection-year climate data instead of latitude and longitude.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraspecific geographic patterns for seed traits were remarkably inconsistent, covarying both negatively and positively with temperature and precipitation. The only apparent generalization is that annual species' seed mass corresponded more with collection-year weather while perennial species covaried more with long-term climate. Overall, this study suggests that the scale of climate variation that molds seed traits is highly species-specific.

AB  - We developed the high voltage type modules for these renewal energy systems such as the Wind Turbine systems, Mega solar systems and "AC690V system". The high voltage type modules are consisted of the 6th generation 1700V IGBT and FWD and 2nd generation 1200V RB-IGBT. There was a problem in the 1200V RB-IGBT for its productivity with conventional structure, because it is necessary to have long doping process time. In this time a new hybrid through-silicon isolation process was developed for 2nd generation 1200V RB-IGBT (RB-IGBT by combining wafer front-side Boron diffusion and back-side V-groove etching). Collector layer was implanted into the back-side and the surface of the V-groove, and electrically connected to the front-side Boron diffusion after activation. Thermal budget for the surface depth of Boron diffusion was thereby significantly shortened more than half for 1200V devices. This paper explains the 2nd generation 1200V RB-IGBT process flow and the experimental results of electrical characteristics. We had achieved that the power conversion efficiency of A-NPC 3-level inverter using RB-IGBTs was 98.57%, which total loss is 15% and 31% smaller than that of NPC 3-level and normal 2-level inverters, respectively.

AB  - Transcriptomic resources for coral species can provide insight into coral evolutionary history and stress-response physiology. Goniopora columna, Galaxea astreata, and Galaxea acrhelia are scleractinian corals of the Indo-Pacific, representing a diversity of morphologies and life-history traits. G. columna and G. astreata are common and cosmopolitan, while G. acrhelia is largely restricted to the coral triangle and Great Barrier Reef. Reference transcriptomes for these species were assembled from replicate colony fragments exposed to elevated (31 degrees C) and ambient (27 degrees C) temperatures. Trinity was used to create de novo assemblies for each species from 92-102 million raw Illumina Hiseq 2 x 150 bp reads. Host-specific assemblies contained 65 460-72 405 contigs, representing 26 693-37 894 isogroups (similar to genes) with an average N50 of 2254. Gene name and/or gene ontology annotations were possible for 58% of isogroups on average. Transcriptomes contained 93.1-94.3% of EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups comprising the core eukaryotic gene set, and 89.98-91.92% of the single-copy metazoan core gene set orthologs were complete, indicating fairly comprehensive assemblies. This work expands the complement of transcriptomic resources available for scleractinian coral species, including the first reference for a representative of Goniopora spp. as well as species with novel morphology.

AB  - 1. Simple models were developed to explore the interaction between the lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) pest Sitona discoideus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and its introduced braconid parasite Microctonus aethiopoides Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in New Zealand.
   2. A model for the population dynamics of S. discoideus demonstrated that observed levels of parasitism account for a decline in pest abundance, in spite of strong density-dependent mortality in the host.
   3. An empirical model for changes in parasitism from year to year, spanning five to six parasitoid generations each year, suggested that control is likely to be maintained in the long term and that the interaction is stable.
   4. Tentative values were established for the average searching efficiency of M. aethiopoides (approximately 0.25 m2  per parasitoid per generation) and for parameters governing pseudo-interference and a functional response to host density, based on analysis of discrete parasitoid generations.
   5. Based on experimental data and field temperatures, a simulation model of daily parasitoid behaviour over summer, when generations overlap, supported the hypothesis that atypically developing parasitoids are those oviposited in newly emerged adult weevils. The model accounted for the observed atypical summer build-up of parasitism which is essential for the success of biological control.
   6. The models suggested that biological control of S. discoideus is complementary to other forms of control, including other biological control agents, because subsequent levels of parasitism appear little affected by changes in pest density.
   7. It is argued that quantitative analysis of specific biological control case studies, both successful and unsuccessful, is a vital prerequisite for improvements in general biocontrol theory and practice.

AB  - The interaction between inbreeding and high-temperature stress was examined in the cactsphilic fruit fly, Drosophila buzzatii. Embryos of four inbreeding levels (F=0, F=0.25, F=0.375, F=0.5) were either maintained at 25 degrees C throughout egg-to-adult development or were exposed to 41.5 degrees C for 110 min at an age of 20 h. Hatching, larva-to-pupa survival, pupato-adult survival, and egg-to-adult survival were estimated. Heat shock reduced hatching rates, but survival to adulthood for individuals that hatched was unaffected by the heat shock. Inbreeding reduced the proportion of eggs hatching in the 25 degrees C control group only. For larva-to-pupa and pupa-to-adult survival there was no interaction between inbreeding and stress. The effect of inbreeding on egg-to-adult survival was stronger in the 25 degrees C control group compared with the group exposed to heat shock. The results imply environmental dependency of inbreeding depression and suggest that stress tolerance may not always be reduced by inbreeding. The thermal microenvironment of cactus rots in the field was assessed by measuring temperatures inside 17 rots. Internal rot temperatures varied with a maximum temperature of 48 degrees C during the day. Selection for temperature tolerance in nature may have depleted genetic variation for this trait limiting the effect of inbreeding on thermal resistance.

AB  - The effects of salinity on survival, fecundity and sex ratio were studied in Dinophilus gyrociliatus; a small polychaete with a short lifespan, semicontinuous reproduction and progamic sex determination. The experiment was performed on two groups, originally collected as one sample, from the port of Genoa in November 1995. The specimens were separated into two groups, differing only in their diet: the first was fed with frozen spinach and the other with Tetramin Mikromin. The experiment was performed in 1998 after numerous generations had been maintained under laboratory conditions. The maximum expectation of life at birth varied with salinity level, and both groups showed a better tolerance towards a salinity below 35 psu than above 35 psu. The influence of both salinity and diet on fecundity had statistical significance even though the greatest differences were due to diet; animals fed with Tetramin had a two- or even threefold higher fecundity than those fed with spinach. Diet and salinity also had a statistically significant influence on the sex ratio. These results, as well as all the experimental observations carried out up to date, indicate that in D. gyrociliatus the determination of the sex ratio has a strong phenotypic component.

AB  - Multiple pathways exist for species to respond to changing climates. However, responses of dispersal-limited species will be more strongly tied to ability to adapt within existing populations as rates of environmental change will likely exceed movement rates. Here, we assess adaptive capacity in Plethodon cinereus, a dispersal-limited woodland salamander. We quantify plasticity in behavior and variation in demography to observed variation in environmental variables over a 5-year period. We found strong evidence that temperature and rainfall influence P. cinereus surface presence, indicating changes in climate are likely to affect seasonal activity patterns. We also found that warmer summer temperatures reduced individual growth rates into the autumn, which is likely to have negative demographic consequences. Reduced growth rates may delay reproductive maturity and lead to reductions in size-specific fecundity, potentially reducing population-level persistence. To better understand within-population variability in responses, we examined differences between two common color morphs. Previous evidence suggests that the color polymorphism may be linked to physiological differences in heat and moisture tolerance. We found only moderate support for morph-specific differences for the relationship between individual growth and temperature. Measuring environmental sensitivity to climatic variability is the first step in predicting species' responses to climate change. Our results suggest phenological shifts and changes in growth rates are likely responses under scenarios where further warming occurs, and we discuss possible adaptive strategies for resulting selective pressures.

AB  - We constructed a Lotka-Volterra-like competition model to study the role of environmental generalists in maintaining ecosystem function under a range of species richnesses and environmental conditions. Ecosystem function was quantified as community biomass, proportion of initial species that coexist through time, and resilience and resistance to perturbation. Generalist and specialist species were created that differed in their realized growth rates under suboptimal environmental conditions. Generalists were more tolerant of suboptimal conditions but specialists grew faster when conditions were optimal. Model simulations were performed involving generalist-only and specialist-only communities comprised of 4-100 species under constant and cyclical environmental conditions. We used pulses applied to biomass to estimate resilience and pulses applied to the environment to estimate resistance. We also simulated 4-species and 100-species mixed communities of generalists and specialists under the same cyclical environmental conditions. Analysis of model predictions was performed after all simulations reached quasi-equilibrium. Comparisons of total community biomass, proportion of initial species coexisting through time, resilience, and resistance under constant and cyclical environmental conditions showed that, in some situations, a species-poor community of generalists can have equal or greater ecosystem function than a species-rich community of specialists. Results from the mixed community simulations confirmed these results. Our analyses suggest that the environmental tolerances of species can be an important consideration in determining ecosystem function, and should be considered in asking whether all species, or certain key species, drive the positive relationship between diversity and ecosystem function.

AB  - Thermal pollution from power plants degrades riverine ecosystems with ramifications beyond the natural environment as it affects power supply. The transport of thermal effluents along river reaches may lead to plant-to-plant interferences by elevating condenser inlet temperatures at downstream locations, which lower thermal efficiencies and trigger regulatory-forced power curtailments. We evaluate thermal pollution impacts on rivers and power supply across 128 plants with once-through cooling technologies in the Mississippi River watershed. By leveraging river network topologies with higher resolutions (0.05.) than previous studies, we reveal the need to address the issue in a more spatially resolved manner, capable of uncovering diverse impacts across individual plants, river reaches and sub-basins. Results show that the use of coarse river network resolutions may lead to substantial overestimations in magnitude and length of impaired river reaches. Overall, there is a modest limitation on power production due to thermal pollution, given existing infrastructure, regulatory and climate conditions. However, tradeoffs between thermal pollution and electricity generation show important implications for the role of alternative cooling technologies and environmental regulation under current and future climates. Recirculating cooling technologies may nearly eliminate thermal pollution and improve power system reliability under stressed climate-water conditions. Regulatory limits also reduce thermal pollution, but at the expense of significant reductions in electricity generation capacity. However, results show several instances when power production capacity rises at individual plants when regulatory limits reduce upstream thermal pollution. These dynamics across energy-water systems highlight the need for high-resolution simulations and the value of coherent planning and optimization across infrastructure with mutual dependencies on natural resources to overcome climate-water constraints on productivity and bring to fruition energy and environmental win-win opportunities.

AB  - Trigger factor (TF) in Escherichia coli is a molecular chaperone with remarkable properties: it has prolyl-isomerase activity, associates with nascent polypeptides on ribosomes, binds to GroEL, enhances GroEL's affinity for unfolded proteins, and promotes degradation of certain polypeptides, Because the latter effects appeared larger at 20 degrees C, we studied the influence of temperature on TF expression, Unlike most chaperones (e.g., GroEL), which are heat-shock proteins (hsps), TF levels increased progressively as growth temperature decreased from 42 degrees C to 16 degrees C and even rose in cells stored at 4 degrees C, Upon temperature downshift from 37 degrees C to 10 degrees C or exposure to chloramphenicol, TF synthesis was induced, like that of many cold-shock proteins, We therefore tested if TF expression might be important for viability at low temperatures, When stored at 4 degrees C, E, coli lose viability at exponential rates, Cells with reduced TF content die faster, while cells overexpressing TF showed greater viability, Although TF overproduction protected against cold, it reduced viability at 50 degrees C, while TF deficiency enhanced viability at this temperature, By contrast, overproduction of GroEL/ES, or hsps generally, while protective against high temperatures, reduced viability at 4 degrees C, which may explain why expression of hsps is suppressed In the cold. Thus, TF represents an example of an E. coli protein which protects cells against low temperatures, Moreover, the differential induction of TF at low temperatures and hsps at high temperatures appears to provide selective protection against these opposite thermal extremes.

AB  - This paper reports on the current UK scenario of islanded operation of active distribution networks with renewable distributed generators (RDGs). Different surveys indicate that the present scenario does not economically justify islanding operation of active distribution networks with RDGs. Anti-islanding protection schemes currently enforce the renewable distributed generators (RDGs) to disconnect immediately and stop generation for grid faults through loss of grid (LOG) protection system. This greatly reduces the benefits of RDG deployment. With rising RDG penetration, much benefit would be lost if the RDGs are not allowed to island only due to conventional operational requirement of utilities. For preventing disconnection of RDGs during LOG, several islanding operation, control and protection schemes are being developed. Technical studies clearly indicate the need to review parts of the ESQCR (Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations) for successful islanded operations. Commercial viability of islanding operation must be assessed in relation to enhancement of power quality, system reliability and supply of potential ancillary services through network support. Demonstration projects under Registered Power Zone and Technical Architecture Projects should be initiated to investigate the usefulness of DG islanding. However these efforts should be compounded with a realistic judgement of the associated technical and economic issues for the development of future power networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Stress response: how cells wrestle with SUMO disruption Cellular stress caused by disrupting attachment of the ubiquitous small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, which are present in most organisms and regulate numerous DNA processes and stress responses by attaching to key proteins, results in some remarkable adaptations. Mark Hochstrasser at Yale University, New Haven, USA, and co-workers review how this "sumoylation" is reversed by protease enzymes, and how imbalances between sumoylation and desumoylation may be linked to diseases including cancer. When certain SUMO proteases are deliberately disrupted, the cells quickly become aneuploid, i.e., carry an abnormal number of chromosomes. These cells show severe growth defects, but over many generations they regain the normal number of chromosomes. They also undergo genetic changes that promote alternative mechanisms that compensate for losing the SUMO protease and facilitate the same efficient stress responses as the original cells.
   The ubiquitin family member SUMO is a covalent regulator of proteins that functions in response to various stresses, and defects in SUMO-protein conjugation or deconjugation have been implicated in multiple diseases. The loss of the Ulp2 SUMO protease, which reverses SUMO-protein modifications, in the model eukaryoteSaccharomyces cerevisiaeis severely detrimental to cell fitness and has emerged as a useful model for studying how cells adapt to SUMO system dysfunction. Both short-term and long-term adaptive mechanisms are triggered depending on the length of time cells spend without this SUMO chain-cleaving enzyme. Such short-term adaptations include a highly specific multichromosome aneuploidy and large changes in ribosomal gene transcription. While aneuploidulp2 Delta cells survive, they suffer severe defects in growth and stress resistance. Over many generations, euploidy is restored, transcriptional programs are adjusted, and specific genetic changes that compensate for the loss of the SUMO protease are observed. These long-term adapted cells grow at normal rates with no detectable defects in stress resistance. In this review, we examine the connections between SUMO and cellular adaptive mechanisms more broadly.

AB  - Background Traditional vector control approaches such as source reduction and insecticide spraying have limited effect on reducing Aedes aegypti population. The endosymbiont Wolbachia is pointed as a promising tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission and has been deployed worldwide. Models predict a rapid increase on the frequency of Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in local settings, supported by cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and high maternal transmission rate associated with the wMelBr strain.
   Methodology/principle findings Wolbachia wMelBr strain was released for 20 consecutive weeks after receiving >87% approval of householders of the isolated community of Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro. wMelBr frequency plateued40% during weeks 7-19, peaked 65% but dropped as releases stopped. A high (97.56%) maternal transmission was observed. Doubling releases and deploying mosquitoes with large wing length and low laboratory mortality produced no detectable effects on invasion trend. By investigating the lab colony maintenance procedures backwardly, pyrethroid resistant genotypes in wMelBr decreased from 68% to 3.5% after 17 generations. Therefore, we initially released susceptible mosquitoes in a local population highly resistant to pyrethroids which, associated with the over use of insecticides by householders, ended jeopardizing Wolbachia invasion. A new strain (wMelRio) was produced after backcrossing wMelBr females with males from field to introduce mostly pyrethroid resistance alleles. The new strain increased mosquito survival but produced relevant negative effects on Ae. aegypti fecundity traits, reducing egg clutche size and egg hatch. Despite the cost on fitness, wMelRio successful established where wMelBr failed, revealing that matching the local population genetics, especially insecticide resistance background, is critical to achieve invasion.
   Conclusions/significance Local householders support was constantly high, reaching 90% backing on the second release (wMelRio strain). Notwithstanding the drought summer, the harsh temperature recorded (daily average above 30 degrees C) did not seem to affect the expression of maternal transmission of wMel on a Brazilian background. Wolbachia deployment should match the insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to achieve invasion. Considering pyrethroid-resistance is a widely distributed phenotype in natural Ae. aegypti populations, future Wolbachia deployments must pay special attention in maintaining insecticide resistance in lab colonies for releases.
   Author summary Traditional vector control methods have been showing limited success in managing arboviruses disease outbreaks in endemic areas. The endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia was microinjected on the mosquito Aedes aegypti and later showed the ability to block dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses' development on vector body. Nowadays, Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti has been deployed in twelve countries as an attempt to mitigate arboviruses transmission. Herein, we report the failure of Wolbachia releases on a suburban isolated district of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. For the first time, we demonstrated that the insecticide resistance profile of released and wild mosquitoes is a critical feature for achieving Wolbachia invasion. Special consideration must be given to avoid releasing susceptible mosquitoes where native populations are resistant, since local householders might rely on domestic use of spraying insecticides (mostly pyrethroids) to protect themselves from mosquito bites.

AB  - The overall system efficiency of a microturbine generator system, and hence the economic viability, are greatly enhanced through co-generation. The utilization of the exhaust energy for heating needs is well understood and has been extensively implemented. Potentially more desirable but having found far less implementation is the integration of microturbines with absorption chillers to generate cold water. Long recognized as a tremendous opportunity in HVAC systems, the integration of a microturbine with an absorption chiller is complicated by the relatively low quality and quantity of heat available from the traditionally recuperated microturbine system.
   This paper address the design process and the issues encountered in developing a 160 ton absorption chiller system integrated with an array of eight, 60-kW Capstone microturbines. The designed system is not a pre-packaged turbine/chiller system but rather a system that integrates a mix of existing and new microturbines with a commercial gas-to-liquid heat exchanger and a commercial single effect Li-Br absorption chiller. The goal of the effort is demonstrate a cost effective retrofit installation of an absorption chiller with existing microturbines to effectively provide base load chilling for the building's HVAC needs.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes of the genus Heterorhabditis are a suitable alternative to chemical insecticides because of their high control effect against insects in cryptic environments and their environmental safety. The availability of H. bacteriophora hybrid strains with increased tolerance to environmental extremes could be a driving force for a more widespread use of nematode-based plant protection products. However, increase in heat and desiccation tolerance of hybrid strains could compromise their fitness regarding virulence, host penetration and reproductive capacity. The fitness of heat and desiccation tolerant hybrid strains was compared to the commercial strain EN 01. Only the heat tolerant strains were superior or similar in fitness to strain EN 01. The strains with increased desiccation tolerance were usually less fit, a possible result of a trade-off effect of selection for desiccation tolerance. Hybrid strains selected for enhanced tolerance after an adaptation to stress were generally better in fitness ranking compared to those for which adaptation prior to stress exposure was excluded. This might be a result of pleitropy. Host penetration and virulence was not correlated. The commercial strain had the highest reproduction per mean number of nematodes penetrating the host insect, which is a result of automatic selection of inbred lines with high reproduction potential during the commercial production process in liquid culture.

AB  - Salinity tolerance limits during the ontogenetic development of Farfantepenaeus paulensis postlarvae (PL) were determined at different temperatures. Initially, PL 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 80 maintained in 30 pot (parts per thousand) salinity, 22-25 C, were directly transferred to 15 combinations of salinity (2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ppt) and temperature (15, 20 and 30 C) for 96 h. Irrespective of age or salinity, higher survival rates were registered at 25 C, PL 10 suffered high mortality, especially at low salinities combined with low (15 C) or high (30 C) temperatures. From PL 20 to PL 40, an increase in survival was observed in all combinations. For PL 60 and 80, tolerance to low salinity was reduced, suggesting that PL have a maximum age by which they are able to develop adaptability to low salinities. In general, the effect of temperature contributed more significantly to mortality in PL 10 and PL 30, but its influence decreased afterwards. From PL, 40, salinity becomes the main factor determining mortality. In order to examine the effects of acclimation to salinity on the tolerance limits, a second set of experiments was performed with PL 5, 10, 15 and 25 acclimated to 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ppt, 25 C, over a 5-d period. Postlarvae were then transferred to different salinity levels (2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ppt) and kept for 96 h. High mortality of PL 10 occurred after direct transfer from high to intermediate/low salinity levels. Although the acclimation to salinity increased survival, it was still Door. An increase in the salinity tolerance was observed from PL 15 to 30, even with no acclimation. Results indicate that PL 10 do not have a fully developed osmoregulatory capacity to cope with low and/or abrupt changes of salinity. It is recommended that non-acclimated PL 10 should only be released in environments with salinity at or above 20 pot. If acclimation is carried out, PL may be released in salinities above 10 ppt. The release of PL 10 in salinities below 5 ppt may result in mortality rates of up to 70%. The best age for the release of non-acclimated F. paulensis PL in environments with low and, or wide fluctuations of salinity would be PL 15-30.

AB  - The potential of selection to improve resistance to streptococcosis was evaluated in a commercial population of Nile tilapia in Thailand. The base generation (G0) consisted of offspring from 98 sires and 149 dams using a partly nested design. At 60 days post-hatch, 30 fish from each family were injected intraperitoneally with a Streptococcosis agalactiae solution (1 x 10(9) CFU/ml) and evaluated for 14 days. Disease resistance was recorded as the number of days from challenge until death (DD) and as a binary (BIN) trait (dead/alive) on day 14. Three models were used for genetic analyses: Cox frailty model for DD; animal model for DD; and animal model for BIN. Age at challenge was fitted as a covariate and contemporary group as fixed or random effect, depending on the model. Fish from the 18 most resistant families were selected to produce the first generation (G1). Heritability estimates for G0 were 0.22, 0.14 +/- 0.02 and 0.11 +/- 0.02 for the Cox, linear DD and linear BIN models, respectively. Selection response indicated that the risk of death decreased to 54%, survival time increased to 3.4 days and survival rate increased to 21%. These results suggest that genetic improvement is possible for this population.

AB  - The Short-Term Hydrothermal Scheduling (STHTS) is one of the most prominent exercise in the field of power system. It advocates the scheduling of hydro and thermal generations so as to minimize the fuel cost over the planning period by satisfying standard system constraints. The problem of scheduling of a generation mixture of thermal and hydro problems are modelled as a non linear, non convex problems comprising valve point loading effects and a set of equality and inequality constraints. The interpretation of hydrothermal systems with hydro predominance is significantly more complex than hydro system. This problem is extremely difficult to deal using classical techniques. This paper presents a simple and novel concept of improved Teaching Learning based Optimization (ITLBO) algorithm for the solution of short term hydro thermal scheduling problem. The TLBO algorithm is an exceptional distinct optimization algorithm stimulated by the effect of influence of a teacher on the productivity of learners in the domain. The proposed methodology has been applied on a standard test system consisting of four hydro an equivalent thermal unit for 24 hours. The results are evolved in terms of water discharge, reservoir storage volume and fuel cost of thermal units with/without valve point loading effects. The performance of the proposed method is validated by comparing with other methods available in the literature. From the findings, it is obvious that ITLBO based approach is able to provide a better solution.

AB  - Observations have reported on the high correlation of Pc 1 events with magnetospheric compressions. A number of mechanisms have been suggested for the generation of the Pc 1 waves. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism which leads to the generation of Pc 1 waves. The interaction of a dynamic pressure pulse (DELTA-rho-v2) with the Earth's bow shock leads to the formation of a weak fast mode shock propagating into the magnetosheath. The shock wave can pass right through a tangential discontinuity (magnetopause) and into the magnetosphere, without disturbing either of the structures. In a quasi-perpendicular geometry, the shock wave exhibits anisotropic heating with T perpendicular-to > T parallel-to. This anisotropy drives unstable ion cyclotron waves which we believe can contribute to the generation of the Pc 1 waves which are detected. The viability of the mechanism is demonstrated with simulations. This mechanism could explain peak in the occurrence of observed Pc 1 waves in the postnoon sector where a field-aligned discontinuity in the solar wind would most often be parallel to the magnetopause surface due to the average Parker spiral magnetic field configuration.

AB  - Nitrogen fertilizers have been identified in energy crops LCAs as the main contributors to global warming, as well as to many other environmental impacts. The distinct production process and application emissions of nitrogen fertilizer types for top dressing produce different GHG savings when energy crops value chains are compared to fossil energy alternatives. In this study, three types of fertilizers (calcium ammonium nitrate, urea and ammonium sulphate) at N top dressing rates of 80 kg N/ha are used to grow rye for electricity generation under the conditions of the Continental Mediterranean climate of central-northern Spain. Complete LCAs for the whole value chain based on real data were performed in conjunction with soil nitrogen balances (SNBs) to assess the accomplishment of European Union (EU) GHG savings sustainability criteria, as well as the sustainability of fertilization practices for soil nitrogen stocks. The results obtained can provide interesting insights for policy making, since calcium ammonium nitrate, the most common fertilizer for rye crops, led to 66% GHG savings, as opposed to the 69% achieved when applying urea and 77% when ammonium sulphate was used. Nevertheless, the three fertilizers produced annual soil deficits greater than 50 kg N/ha. In order to ensure savings above 80%, as required by the EU sustainability criteria, and sustainable SNBs, additional optimization measures should be taken at key points of the value chain.

AB  - For organisms with overlapping generations that occur in metapopulations, uncertainty remains regarding the spatiotemporal scale of inference of estimates of the effective number of breeders ((N) over cap (b)) and whether these estimates can be used to predict generational N-e. We conducted a series of tests of the spatiotemporal scale of inference of estimates of N-b in nine consecutive cohorts within a long-term study of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). We also tested a recently developed approach to estimate generational Ne from (N) over cap (b) and compared this to an alternative approach for estimating (N) over cap (e) that also accounts for age structure. Multiple lines of evidence were consistent with (N) over cap (b) corresponding to the local (subpopulation) spatial scale and the cohort-specific temporal scale. We found that at least four consecutive cohort-specific estimates of (N) over cap (b) were necessary to obtain reliable estimates of harmonic mean (N) over cap (b) for a subpopulation. Generational (N) over cap (e) derived from cohort-specific (N) over cap (b) was within 7%-50% of an alternative approach to obtain (N) over cap (e), suggesting some population specificity for concordance between approaches. Our results regarding the spatiotemporal scale of inference for Nb should apply broadly to many taxa that exhibit overlapping generations and metapopulation structure and point to promising avenues for using cohort-specific (N) over cap (b) for local-scale genetic monitoring.

AB  - Hypoxia can have adverse effects on recruitment of marine copepods via its effects on egg hatching and survival of nauplii. This study investigated the effects of hypoxia on in situ hatching success of calanoid copepods in Gamak Bay, Korea, a shallow (9-m) microtidal coastal bay with long water residence times exceeding a month. Plankton emergence trap/chambers were placed into seafloor-surface sediments in July at a hypoxic site (mean = 0.6 mL L-1) in the inner part of the bay and at a normoxic site in the mid bay. Nauplii that hatched and left the sediment were collected daily for 12 days, and the top 1 cm of sediment was preserved at the end of incubation. The number of eggs in the sediment was >3 X 10(5) eggs m(-2) at the hypoxic site, about six times that at the normoxic site. Most of the eggs appeared to be subitaneous. Egg-hatching rate in the hypoxic site, however, was only 4% of that at the normoxic site, where 57% of the eggs present hatched. Cumulative numbers of eggs hatching into the hypoxic chambers were about half the numbers hatching into the normoxic chambers. The pH level in the sediment was 7.1 to 7.3 at the hypoxic site, slightly lower than in the normoxic sediment (pH > 7.5). That difference seemed to have little effect on egg hatching. High sulfide concentration at the hypoxic site (> 300 mu M), combined with low dissolved oxygen in summer were likely responsible for the depressed egg hatching. However, the cumulative number of eggs that hatched in the hypoxic chambers was still about half of that in the normoxic chambers. Thus, it appears that the hypoxic site might still be a significant source of juveniles for the next generation of the copepods.

AB  - Fever; the rise in body temperature set point in response to infection or injury, is a highly conserved trait among vertebrates, and documented in many arthropods. Fever is known to reduce illness duration and mortality. These observations present an evolutionary puzzle: why has fever continued to be an effective response to fast-evolving pathogenic microbes across diverse phyla, and probably over countless millions of years? Framing fever as part of a more general thermal manipulation strategy that we term defensive hyperthermia, we hypothesize that the solution lies in the independent contributions to pathogen fitness played by virulence and infectivity. A host organism deploying defensive hyperthermia alters the ecological environment of an invading pathogen. To the extent that the pathogen evolves to be able to function effectively at elevated temperatures, it disadvantages itself at infecting the next (thermonormative) host, becoming more likely to be thwarted by that host's immune system and outcompeted by wild ecotype conspecifics (a genetically distinct strain adapted to specific environmental conditions) that, although more vulnerable to elevated temperatures, operate more effectively at the host's normal temperature. We evaluate this hypothesis in light of existing evidence concerning pathogen thermal specialization, and discuss theoretical and translational implications of this model.

AB  - Fluctuations in water temperature can have important physiological consequences for fishes. Effects of daily thermal cycles are well studied and can be beneficial, increasing prey consumption and growth rates when mean and maximum temperatures of the fluctuations are at or below the species' optimum temperature. While less studied, subdaily temperature fluctuations are also common in many aquatic habitats and can be caused by both natural and anthropogenic processes. We performed laboratory experiments to examine how two fish species (yellow perch, Perca flavescens, and walleye, Sander vitreus) with similar thermal preferences respond to chronic exposure to subdaily temperature variability. We selected temperature treatments that reflected observed thermal variation after examining water temperature data from multiple aquatic systems. We then separately exposed yellow perch and walleye to a stable 23 degrees C treatment and 12-h cycles of 23 +/- 2 degrees C or 23 +/- 4 degrees C for 45days. Adult yellow perch exposed to fluctuations of 23 +/- 4 degrees C over 12h expressed higher consumption, growth and food conversion efficiency than fish experiencing stable 23 degrees C. Temperature fluctuations, though, resulted in mortalities and the development of skin ulcers in yellow perch that did not occur under stable temperatures. In contrast, the same 12-h temperature fluctuations did not result in mortalities or stress responses in juvenile walleye. Moreover, unlike yellow perch, growth rates of walleye were lower under 12-h temperature fluctuations compared with the stable 23 degrees C treatment. Our results indicate that species with similar thermal preferences can respond differently to the same subdaily temperature fluctuations.

AB  - The climatic factors are changing very rapidly in Malaysia. For the farmers to adapt with the changes, government and other external agencies are providing several supports. But still there is a gap between farmers' adaptability with climate change and current level of supports. This study uses descriptive statistics, ordinal regression, and percentile analysis to measure the level of farmers' adaptability to climate change as a result of the various existing supports and encouragements provided by the government and other external agencies, and new supports expected by farmers. The data were collected through questionnaire survey on 198 paddy producing farmers in the area of Integrated Agricultural Development Area (IADA), North-West Selangor, Malaysia. The study found that among current types of supports provided by different agencies, only farmers' accessibility in the market is statistically significant for influencing their current adaptability to climatic changes. Though 58.6% of the farmers agree that government supports are enough to cope properly with climate change, 12.1% of farmers are not able to cope with climate change with the current level of supports. Farmers' expectations of several new supports has no statistically significant influences on their current adaptability with climatic changes, but their priority ranking for these expected supports will help policymakers to determine the future supports for climatic change adaptation for agriculture sustainability and livelihood sustainability under adverse climatic changes scenarios, especially for Malaysia.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV, Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus introduced to North America in 1999. Since 1999, the Earth's average temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees C. Mosquitoes are ectothermic organisms, reliant on environmental heat sources. Temperature impacts vector-virus interactions which directly influence arbovirus transmission. RNA viral replication is highly error-prone and increasing temperature could further increase replication rates, mutation frequencies, and evolutionary rates. The impact of temperature on arbovirus evolutionary trajectories and fitness landscapes has yet to be sufficiently studied. To investigate how temperature impacts the rate and extent of WNV evolution in mosquito cells, WNV was experimentally passaged 12 times in Culex tarsalis cells, at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Full-genome deep sequencing was used to compare genetic signatures during passage, and replicative fitness was evaluated before and after passage at each temperature. Our results suggest adaptive potential at both temperatures, with unique temperature-dependent and lineage-specific genetic signatures. Further, higher temperature passage was associated with significantly increased replicative fitness at both temperatures and increases in nonsynonymous mutations. Together, these data indicate that if similar selective pressures exist in natural systems, increases in temperature could accelerate emergence of high-fitness strains with greater phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - A new buck-boost based single phase transformerless grid connected photo voltaic (PV) inverter which is having the capability to operate two serially connected subarrays at their respective maximum power point is proposed in this paper. The series connection of the two subarrays and the buck-boost nature of the inverter reduces the number of serially connected modules in a subarray. Further, independent operation of the two subarrays enhances the overall power extraction from the subarrays while they are experiencing significant mismatch at their operating conditions, e.g. insolation level and/or operating temperature. The topological structure of the inverter and its control technique ensures negligible amount of high frequency components in its common mode voltage. As a consequence the overall leakage current associated with the subarrays are restricted well within the permissible limit specified in the standard, VDE 0126-1-1. The operating principle of the proposed scheme along with its rigorous analysis has been presented. The reference current generation for the buck-boost inductor and the controller configuration of the proposed inverter have been elaborated in detail. Detailed simulation study with a 1.3 kW PV system has been carried out to show the viability of the proposed scheme.

AB  - The translocation of populations within their natural distribution ranges to instigate crossings between genetic stocks may enhance adaptive potential and resilience. Colonies of the reef-building coral, Acropora millepora, collected in the warmer central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) were experimentally crossed with conspecific colonies from the cooler southern GBR. Fertilisation success was high in all purebred and regional hybrid crosses (> 83 %). After 4 months in the field at the southern location, survival rates differed as follows: native purebreds > regional hybrids > central GBR purebreds. The southern GBR purebreds were smaller at settlement compared with the other groups, but this difference disappeared towards the end of the grow-out period. While no benefit of genetic mixing in the F1 generation of this species was evident from our work, it is possible that hybrid vigour exists for other traits, such as thermal tolerance, and over different spatial scales, for different species, or in later generations.

AB  - Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) has a high ecological and social value and supplies raw materials for the cork industry, a relevant contributor to the economies of Mediterranean countries. Understanding the adaptation potential of cork oak populations to cope with different environmental conditions is a key issue of forest management, particularly for selecting the most adapted genetic material for (re)forestation and assuring the long-term sustainability of the cork industry. Intraspecific variation in fitness surrogate traits (survival, height and stem diameter) was investigated in thirty-five cork oak populations sampled from the entire range of the natural distribution of the species. The study was conducted in two provenance field trials, established in Portugal under different edaphoclimatic conditions. Each trial was surveyed at four tree ages (two ages, 11 and 14 years, were sampled simultaneously in both trials). The trial located at a lower altitude, which had higher mean winter and annual temperatures, exhibited higher growth and survival rates. In both trials, significant genetic variation among cork oak populations was observed for the analyzed traits and evaluated ages. Moroccan populations displayed a higher probability of survival and higher growth rates, while local populations exhibited an intermediate performance. Low to moderate correlations were found between the analyzed traits and the environmental variables of seed origin, suggesting that factors other than climate are likely to be relevant for cork oak adaptation. Moderate to high values of population mean-basis broad-sense heritability (H-2 >= 0.44) and high genetic correlations between traits (0.88-0.95) were found for growth traits. This information is crucial for the establishment of a breeding program for the species. With this study, we have improved the knowledge regarding how cork oak performs for fitness surrogate traits in different environments.

AB  - This review deals with the complex sex determining system of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, governed by the interactions between a genetic determination and the influence of temperature, shown in both domestic and wild populations. Naturally sex reversed individuals are strongly suggested in two wild populations. This can be due to the masculinising temperatures which some fry encounter during their sex differentiation period when they colonise shallow waters, and/or to the influence of minor genetic factors. Differences regarding a) thermal responsiveness of sex ratios between and within Nile tilapia populations, b) maternal and paternal effects on temperature dependent sex ratios and c) nearly identical results in offspring of repeated matings, demonstrate that thermosensitivity is under genetic control. Selection experiments to increase the thermosensitivity revealed high responses in the high and low sensitive lines. The high-line showed similar to 90% males after 2 generations of selection whereas the weakly sensitive line had 54% males. This is the first evidence that a surplus of males in temperature treated groups can be selected as a quantitative trait.

AB  - Improvement of internal combustion engine emissions and performance by the introduction of a reducing gas such as hydrogen has been the subject of research in recent years. The approach reduces engine exhaust emissions and improves fuel consumption. The gas may be introduced into the engine intake or upstream of the exhaust catalyst for different effects. To date, the technique has not been implemented due to the need for onboard storage or generation of hydrogen that complies with suitability for automotive applications.
   In industrial processes and stationary applications, reforming reactors are well known, highly efficient, and durable means to convert liquid fuels such as diesel into hydrogen or other reducing gas mixtures (synthesis gas). Efficiency and durability for thousands of hours is required for these applications for economic viability. For an automotive application, however, in addition to the above features, fast transient response (e.g. during start up and turndown), compactness, and low cost are also required while maintaining sufficient durability for the application. Also, the need for liquid water common to reactions such as steam reforming or auto-thermal reforming are impractical for automotive applications. A waterless catalytic partial oxidation approach avoids this shortcoming but is not without its own set of problems. Material durability, fuel/air mixing, coke avoidance and reliable ignition means are among the challenges for a practical automotive hydrogen production solution. The catalyst for reacting the fuel must be tolerant to sulfur content common to fuels in use today, and must have resistance to fouling by carbon formation.
   To overcome these challenges, Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) has developed a diesel-fueled waterless catalytic partial oxidation reformer with efficiency and size suitable for onboard synthesis gas production at low cost. The goal of the development effort was to produce a novel mechanical design with the high efficiency of stationary reformers in a small package which could be operated with low parasitic loss from balance of plant components to maintain high engine efficiency. The reactor design (size, form factor) is discussed, along with performance data showing transient and steady state response of the prototype reactor. Catalytic partial oxidation (CPDX) of heavy fuels such as diesel poses unique challenges, relating to coking and fuel conversion efficiency, which have been addressed and presented in this paper.

AB  - The thermo-optic constants of the flux grown RbTiOAs4 (RTA) have been measured from 0.4577 to 0.7931 mum. These results were fitted to the temperature phase-matching bandwidths (FWHM) for harmonic generation of the Nd:YAG laser and the Nd:YAG laser-pumped KTiOAsO4 (KTA) optical parametric oscillator (OPO), and were used to construct the thermo-optic dispersion formula that can be used for good reproduction of the temperature-dependent phase-matching conditions in the 0.459-3.129 mum range. Applications to the quasi phase-matching are presented.

AB  - Living, working and exercising in extreme terrestrial environments are challenging tasks even for healthy humans of the modern new age. The issue is not just survival in remote environments but rather the achievement of optimal performance in everyday life, occupation, and sports. Various adaptive biological processes can take place to cope with the specific stressors of extreme terrestrial environments like cold, heat, and hypoxia (high altitude). This review provides an overview of the physiological and morphological aspects of adaptive responses in these environmental stressors at the level of organs, tissues, and cells. Furthermore, adjustments existing in native people living in such extreme conditions on the earth as well as acute adaptive responses in newcomers are discussed. These insights into general adaptability of humans are complemented by outcomes of specific acclimatization/acclimation studies adding important information how to cope appropriately with extreme environmental temperatures and hypoxia.

AB  - Salmonella cells in two sugar-rich media were heat treated at various constant temperatures in the range of 55 to 80 degreesC and their survival ratios determined at various time intervals. The resulting nonlinear semilogarithmic survival curves are described by the model log(10)S(t) = -b(T)t(n(T)) where S(t) is the momentary survival ratio N(t)/N-0, and b(T) and n(T) are coefficients whose temperature dependence is described by two empirical mathematical models. When the temperature profile, T(t), of a nonisothermal heat treatment can also be expressed algebraically, b(T) and n(T) can be transformed into a function of time, i.e., b[T(t)] and n[T(t)]. If the momentary inactivation rate primarily depends on the momentary temperature and survival ratio, then the survival curve under nonisothermal conditions can be constructed by solving a differential equation, previously suggested by Peleg and Penchina, whose coefficients are expressions that contain the corresponding b[T(t)] and n[T(t)] terms. The applicability of the model and its underlying assumptions was tested with a series of eight experiments in which the Salmonella cells, in the same media, were heated at various rates to selected temperatures in the range of 65 to 80 degreesC and then cooled. In all the experiments, there was an agreement between the predicted and observed survival curves. This suggests that, at least in the case of Salmonella in the tested media, survival during nonisothermal inactivation can be estimated without assuming any mortality kinetics.

AB  - Habitat temperature is a major determinant of performance and activity in fish. We summarize published studies of 173 North American freshwater fish species to examine the interrelationships among thermal response metrics associated with three types of individual performance: growth (optimal growth temperature (OGT), final temperature preferendum (FTP)), survival (upper incipient lethal temperature (UILT), critical thermal maximum (CTMax)), and reproduction (optimum spawning temperature (OS), optimum egg development temperature (OE)). We found that all metrics were highly correlated, especially those associated with a specific performance type. Differences in thermal metrics were also significantly linked to traditional thermal guild classifications, spawning season, and strategy. We found an overall decline in correlation strength when we used phylogenetically independent contrasts to control for the effect of phylogeny. This decline was much greater for growth and survival metrics than for reproduction. This suggests that the role of evolutionary history in determining thermal sensitivity at the species level varies greatly across the range of performance types that can be used to characterize the behaviour of an individual.

AB  - Background: Environmental stressors induce changes in endocrine state, leading to energy re-allocation from reproduction to survival. Female Drosophila melanogaster respond to thermal and nutrient stressors by arresting egg production through elevation of the steroid hormone ecdysone. However, the mechanisms through which this reproductive arrest occurs are not well understood.
   Results: Here we report that stress-induced elevation of ecdysone is accompanied by decreased levels of ecdysis triggering hormone (ETH). Depressed levels of circulating ETH lead to attenuated activity of its targets, including juvenile hormone-producing corpus allatum and, as we describe here for the first time, octopaminergic neurons of the oviduct. Elevation of steroid thereby results in arrested oogenesis, reduced octopaminergic input to the reproductive tract, and consequent suppression of ovulation. ETH mitigates heat or nutritional stress-induced attenuation of fecundity, which suggests that its deficiency is critical to reproductive adaptability.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, as a dual regulator of octopamine and juvenile hormone release, ETH provides a link between stress-induced elevation of ecdysone levels and consequent reduction in fecundity.

AB  - The genetic architecture of many phenotypic traits is such that genes often contribute to multiple traits, and mutations in these genes can therefore affect multiple phenotypes. These pleiotropic interactions often manifest as tradeoffs between traits where improvement in one property entails a cost in another. The life cycles of many pathogens include periods of growth within a host punctuated with transmission events, such as passage through a digestive tract or a passive stage of exposure in the environment. Populations exposed to such fluctuating selective pressures are expected to acquire mutations showing tradeoffs between reproduction within and survival outside of a host. We selected for individual mutations under fluctuating selective pressures for a ssDNA microvirid bacteriophage by alternating selection for increased growth rate with selection on biophysical properties of the phage capsid in high-temperature or low-pH conditions. Surprisingly, none of the seven unique mutations identified showed a pleiotropic cost; they all improved both growth rate and pH or temperature stability, suggesting that single mutations even in a simple genetic system can simultaneously improve two distinct traits. Selection on growth rate alone revealed tradeoffs, but some mutations still benefited both traits. Tradeoffs were therefore prevalent when selection acted on a single trait, but payoffs resulted when multiple traits were selected for simultaneously. We employed a molecular-dynamics simulation method to determine the mechanisms underlying beneficial effects for three heat-shock mutations. All three mutations significantly enhanced the affinities of protein-protein interfacial bindings, thereby improving capsid stability. The ancestral residues at the mutation sites did not contribute to protein-protein interfacial binding, indicating that these sites acquired a new function. Computational models, such as those used here, may be used in future work not only as predictive tools for mutational effects on protein stability but, ultimately, for evolution.

AB  - Diapause that extends across multiple years is considered a bet-hedging strategy in insect species that are exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions. The dynamics of extended diapause in herbivores can be complicated when their parasitoids can also extend diapause, although our knowledge of these dynamics is based primarily on pest species. Here, we report on regional variation in the phenology and life history of Trogus parasitoids of Papilio machaon group swallowtail butterflies in western Canada. We observed flexible phenological patterns in this interaction, with both hosts and parasitoids undergoing extended diapause. Additionally, we documented parasitism of earlier instar larvae in these Trogus species, which to our knowledge has not been observed in North America. Our observations provide a foundation for studying the potential evolutionary consequences of extended diapause in these multispecies interactions.

AB  - The many components of seasonal adaptations in insects are reviewed, especially from the viewpoint of aspects that must be studied in order to understand the structure and purposes of the adaptations. Component responses include dispersal, habitat selection, habitat modification, resistance to cold, dryness, and food limitation, trade-offs, diapause, modifications of developmental rate, sensitivity to environmental signals, life-cycle patterns including multiple alternatives in one species, and types of variation in phenology and development. Spatial, temporal, and resource elements of the environment are also reviewed, as are environmental signals, supporting the conclusion that further understanding of all of these seasonal responses requires detailed simultaneous study of the natural environments that drive the patterns of response.

AB  - Cold resistance in insects has traditionally been measured in terms of survival following a stress, but alternative methods are increasingly being used because of their relevance to the ecology of organisms and their utility in characterizing variation among species, populations and individuals. One such method capable of discriminating among Drosophila species and conspecific Drosophila populations from different environments is adult chill coma recovery time, the time taken for adults to become active again after being knocked down by a cold stress. Here we characterized the chill coma response of D. melanogaster in detail. Adults were exposed to a range of temperatures and stressful periods prior to measuring recovery. Recovery from chill coma in D. melanogaster was biphasic; as flies were stressed under cooler temperatures, recovery times leveled off and then decreased before sharply increasing again as mortality starts to occur. This biphasic response has previously been observed in D. subobscura where it has a somewhat different shape. A second mechanism therefore acts at relatively lower temperatures to ameliorate the effects of the cold stress. When D. melanogaster were reared at 19 and 25degreesC for two generations, the shape of the curve relating temperature to recovery time was similar, but flies from the warmer temperature had longer recovery times and showed responses that leveled off and then decreased at relatively higher temperatures. As exposure time to cold stress was increased, recovery times also increased except at mild stress levels. Chill coma recovery in D. melanogaster is a complex trait and likely to reflect multiple underlying components. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change increases the risk of severe alterations to essential wildlife habitats. The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus (Linnaeus, 1758)) uses dens as shelters against cold temperatures and predators. These dens, needed for successful reproduction, are generally dug into the active layer on top of permafrost and reused across multiple generations. We assessed the vulnerability of Arctic fox dens to the increasing frequency of geohazards (thaw settlement, mass movements, and thermal erosion) that is arising from climate change. On Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada) we developed, and calculated from field observations, a qualitative vulnerability index to geohazards for Arctic fox dens. Of the 106 dens studied, 14% were classified as highly vulnerable, whereas 17% and 69% had a moderate and low vulnerability, respectively. Vulnerability was not related to the probability of use for repro- duction. Although climate change will likely impact Arctic fox reproductive dens, such impact is not a major threat to foxes of Bylot Island. Our research provides the first insights into the climate-related geohazards potentially affecting Arctic fox ecology in the next decades. The developed method is flexible and could be applied to other locations or other species that complete their life cycle in permafrost regions.

AB  - 1. Migration timing in animals has important effects on life-history transitions. Human activities can alter migration timing of animals, and understanding the effects of such disruptions remains an important goal for applied ecology. Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) inhabit fresh water as juveniles before migrating to the ocean where they gain >90% of their biomass before returning to fresh water as adults to reproduce. Although construction of dams has delayed juvenile migration for many populations, we currently lack a synthesis of patterns in migration timing and how they relate to subsequent survival to adulthood for Pacific salmon, especially for at-risk populations.
   2. We studied two groups of Pacific salmon from the Columbia River basin in the northwestern United States currently listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. We examined how the proportion of juveniles surviving to return as adults varied with year of migration, date of arrival in the estuary, water temperature and coastal ocean upwelling using data from over 40 000 individually tagged Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss.
   3. In general, models with year, day and day(2) had much better support from the data than those with temperature and upwelling. For Chinook salmon, we also found a residual effect of temperature after controlling for day, but the effect was small for steelhead.
   4. For both species, juveniles migrating from early to mid-May survived 4-50 times greater than those migrating in mid-June. As expected, however, the estimated peak in survival varied among years, presumably reflecting interannual variation in the nearshore physical environment and trophic dynamics that affect salmon during the critical juvenile life stage.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a possible management objective would be to speed arrival to the estuary by increasing springtime river flows. These findings also provide some insight into the mechanisms underlying seasonal differences in survival patterns, but additional studies are needed to better resolve the issue. Future changes to river flow and water temperature associated with climate change and human activities may further alter migration timing, and thus this phenomenon deserves further attention.

AB  - We assess the viability of energy generation with depleted uranium irradiated with fast neutrons from the reaction of DT fusion driven by a tokamak reactor. Since existing nuclear power plants employ uranium fuel enriched to 4.5% U-235, over 90% of natural uranium currently goes to nuclear waste and is no longer used for power generation. The amount of depleted uranium with the U-235 content of 0.2-0.3% accumulated in the world exceeds 1 500 000 t and is continually increasing owing to the operation of thermal neutron power plants. Industrial fast neutron power plants using depleted uranium as nuclear fuel are still at the development stage. Therefore, alternative approaches to utilizing depleted uranium for power generation should be considered. Compared to fast reactors with a closed cycle utilizing plutonium, the proposed facility involves less radiation hazard since the irradiated fuel has to be reprocessed and reloaded less frequently. Apart from that, the proposed hybrid power reactor operates in the deeply subcritical regime, which provides a high level of nuclear safety. A tokamak reactor similar to that of the ITER project is selected as a source of a high-power flux of fusion neutrons whereby a reactor blanket of depleted uranium is irradiated. The heat will be removed with a liquid metal coolant rather than with water as in the ITER reactor. This will help maintain the hardness of the neutron spectrum, thereby maximizing the rate of U-238 fission. With such a neutron source and a blanket of natural uranium with an optimized thickness of similar to 20 cm, each fission of uranium (with an energy release of 200 MeV) is estimated to finally produce four Pu-239 atoms in the blanket (see the 2009 proceedings of the ROSATOM commission on optimizing the development of power generation with tokamaks). This estimate equally applies to a reactor blanket of depleted uranium. According to estimates, an "ideal" reactor with a blanket of depleted uranium operating in a stationary mode with a capacity factor of 70% would generate nearly 1.5 GW of electric power. However, only an estimated one-third of the total power can actually be delivered to the electrical network since the rest is required for breeding tritium and powering the facility itself. Toward maximizing the capacity factor, the first wall of the fusion reactor will be coated with lithium for protection against plasma-induced erosion.

AB  - Photoperiod and temperature conditions known to induce diapause in tropical arthropods were tested on two generations (G(0) and G(1)) of the phytoseiid, Enseius fustis. Failure to lay eggs or a pre-oviposition period longer than 15 days were the criteria used to determine whether females were in diapause. Females reared from egg to adult and held throughout adult life under cyclic temperatures of 29/20 degrees C in combination with long photophases of 16L:8D and 14L:10D showed no indication of aestival diapause. Similarly, hibernal diapause was not induced in females reared under a constant temperature of 18 degrees C and a photophase of 8L:16D. Under the various test conditions, females initiated oviposition within an average of 4 days. Overall, pre-oviposition patterns for G(0) and G(1) females were similar under the same test conditions. Reproductive patterns based on the mean number of eggs per female per day varied only slightly between generations for the same treatments.

AB  - Performance analyses are carried out for the palladium membrane fuel processor for catalytic generation of high purity hydrogen. The reactor model includes detailed particle-scale multi-component diffusion, multiple reversible reactions, flow, and membrane transport. Using methanol steam reforming on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst as the test reaction, a systematic examination of the effects of operating and reactor design parameters on key performance metrics is presented. Single particle simulations reveal a complex interplay between nonisobaric transport and the reversible reactions (methanol reforming and decomposition, and water-gas shift), which impact overall reactor performance. An analysis of characteristic times helps to identify four different productivity controlling regimes: (i) permeation control, encountered with thick membranes and/or insufficient membrane area; (ii) catalyst pore diffusion control encountered with diffusion of reacting species in larger particles; (iii) reaction control, encountered when intrinsic catalytic rates are too low because of inadequate activity or catalyst loading; and (iv) feed control, encountered when the limiting reactant feed rate is inadequate. The simulations reveal that a maximum in the hydrogen productivity occurs at an intermediate space velocity, while the hydrogen utilization is a decreasing function of space velocity, implying a trade-off between productivity and hydrogen utilization. The locus of productivity maxima itself exhibits a maximum at an intermediate membrane surface to volume ratio, the specific value of which is dependent on the particle size, membrane thickness and reaction conditions. At moderate temperature and total pressure (260 degrees C, 10 bar), particles smaller than 2 mm diameter, Pd membranes with thickness less than 10 mu m, and membrane surface to volume ratio exceeding 500 m(2)/m(3) are needed to achieve viable productivity (> 50 mol H-2/m(3) s). A comparison between the packed-bed membrane reactor and conventional packed-bed reactor indicates a modest improvement in the conversion and productivity due to in situ hydrogen removal.

AB  - In many ectotherms, selection of environmental thermal niches may positively affect growth, nutrient assimilation rates, immune system function, and ultimately survival. Temperature preference in some turtle species may be influenced by environmental conditions, including acclimation temperature. We tested for effects of acclimation temperature (22 degrees C, 27 degrees C) on the selected temperature and movement patterns of 14 juvenile Malaclemys terrapin (Reptilia: Emydidae) in an aquatic thermal gradient of 14-34 degrees C and in single-temperature (22 degrees C, 27 degrees C) control tests. Among 8-10 month old terrapins, acclimation temperature influenced activity and movement patterns but did not affect temperature selection. In thermal gradient and single-temperature control tests, turtles acclimated to 27 degrees C used more tank chambers and relocated between chambers significantly more frequently than individuals acclimated to 22 C. However, acclimation temperature did not affect temperature selection: both 22- and 27 degrees C-acclimated turtles selected the warmest temperature (34 degrees C), and avoided the other temperatures available, during thermal gradient tests. These results suggest that young M. terrapin are capable of detecting small temperature increments and prefer warm temperatures that may positively influence growth and metabolism.

AB  - The research field of perovskite based solar cells has recently been developed as the most promising candidate for next-generation because of their high efficiency solar cell technology that is compatible with low-cost, low-temperature processing, long-term stability and simple structure of solar cells production such as the hybrid halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 in solar cells have high power conversion efficiency exceeding 22%. However, the unstable nature of perovskite was observed when exposing it to continuous moisture, illumination and high temperature obstructing the commercial development in the long run and thus becoming the main problem that needs to be solved immediately. In this work, the preparation of organic - inorganic halide perovskite by mixing halide group between iodide with bromide, CH3NH3PbIxBr3-x compound under the annealing temperature condition was investigated. The structure of the product was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, High Resolution SEM image was used to study the presence morphology of crystalline domains within the sample. We examine the thermal properties of samples using Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (STA). To check the variation of optical properties in these compounds, we measured the UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) which showed the survival of organic group. It is concluded that the annealing affects phase formation and thermal stability of CH3NH3PbIxBr3-x compounds. A small powder amount of lead bromide (PbBr2), a product of the degradation, was observed with increasing annealing temperature. Accordingly, appropriate annealing temperature should be chosen to produce a high efficiency photovoltaic.

KW  - GENETIC CORRELATION
AB  - The relative efficiency of several methods of studying genotype-environment interactions has been illustrated, considering some performance traits In laying hens as a model. The comparison involved methods of classifying, detecting the existence, and estimating the magnitude of genotype-environment interactions. The environments consisted of warm (32 degrees C) and temperate (20 degrees C) climatic conditions.
   Classification and qualitative description of interactions is useful when very few genotypes and environments are involved. The illustration with an example suggested that a classification based on comparison of relative magnitudes of average genotypic, environmental and interaction effects would be most meaningful. The interactions carry greater significance if they exceed the average genotypic effects.
   A factorial analysis of variance followed by an F-test can be useful in detecting the existence of interactions, but statistical significance should not be overemphasized for biological relevance. Invariably, the magnitude of interactions muse be estimated to derive useful conclusions.
   The seven methods of estimating this correlation mainly involved principles of intraclass correlation, rank correlation and product-moment correlation. An analysis of data revealed that the intraclass correlation methods, in general, yielded higher estimates compared to the rest of the methods. Among them, the formula given by DICKERSON (1962) was found more appropriate in mixed-model analysts with unbalanced data while the method given be YAMADA (1962) resulted in negative estimates when the interaction variance was large. The least reliable among the methods were estimations directly utilizing the mean squares from factorial analysis of variance as suggested by ROBERTSON (1959). Rank correlations were similar for phenotypic as well as genetic rankings and also coincided to some extent with the correlation among the breeding values, revealing distinct changes in ranks of genotypes in those traits where the interactions were larger.
   Product-moment correlations between the breeding values of sires in the two environments should be the most reliable and suitable for predicting selection response when the sires are selected in one environment and their progeny is required to perform under different conditions. Ho wever, their expectations were lower than 1, depending upon the genetic foundation of the traits and effective progeny size.

AB  - A high particle to infectivity ratio is a feature common to many RNA viruses, with similar to 90-99% of particles unable to initiate a productive infection under low multiplicity conditions. A recent publication by Brooke et al. revealed that, for influenza A virus (IAV), a proportion of these seemingly non-infectious particles are in fact semi-infectious. Semi-infectious (SI) particles deliver an incomplete set of viral genes to the cell, and therefore cannot support a full cycle of replication unless complemented through co-infection. In addition to SI particles, IAV populations often contain defective-interfering (DI) particles, which actively interfere with production of infectious progeny. With the aim of understanding the significance to viral evolution of these incomplete particles, we tested the hypothesis that SI and DI particles promote diversification through reassortment. Our approach combined computational simulations with experimental determination of infection, co-infection and reassortment levels following co-inoculation of cultured cells with two distinct influenza A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2)-based viruses. Computational results predicted enhanced reassortment at a given % infection or multiplicity of infection with increasing semi-infectious particle content. Comparison of experimental data to the model indicated that the likelihood that a given segment is missing varies among the segments and that most particles fail to deliver >= 1 segment. To verify the prediction that SI particles augment reassortment, we performed co-infections using viruses exposed to low dose UV. As expected, the introduction of semi-infectious particles with UV-induced lesions enhanced reassortment. In contrast to SI particles, inclusion of DI particles in modeled virus populations could not account for observed reassortment outcomes. DI particles were furthermore found experimentally to suppress detectable reassortment, relative to that seen with standard virus stocks, most likely by interfering with production of infectious progeny from co-infected cells. These data indicate that semi-infectious particles increase the rate of reassortment and may therefore accelerate adaptive evolution of IAV.

AB  - Short episodic high temperature events can be lethal for migrating adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). We downscaled temperatures for the Fraser River, British Columbia to evaluate the impact of climate warming on the frequency of exceeding thermal thresholds associated with salmon migratory success. Alarmingly, a modest 1.0 degrees C increase in average summer water temperature over 100 years (1981-2000 to 2081-2100) tripled the number of days per year exceeding critical salmonid thermal thresholds (i.e. 19.0 degrees C). Refined thresholds for two populations (Gates Creek and Weaver Creek) of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were defined using physiological constraint models based on aerobic scope. While extreme temperatures leading to complete aerobic collapse remained unlikely under our warming scenario, both populations were increasingly forced to migrate upriver at reduced levels of aerobic performance (e.g. in 80% of future simulations, >= 90% of salmon encountered temperatures exceeding population-specific thermal optima for maximum aerobic scope; T-opt=16.3 degrees C for Gates Creek and T-opt=14.5 degrees C for Weaver Creek). Assuming recent changes to river entry timing persist, we also predicted dramatic increases in the probability of freshwater mortality for Weaver Creek salmon due to reductions in aerobic, and general physiological, performance (e.g. in 42% of future simulations >= 50% of Weaver Creek fish exceeded temperature thresholds associated with 0-60% of maximum aerobic scope). Potential for adaptation via directional selection on run-timing was more evident for the Weaver Creek population. Early entry Weaver Creek fish experienced 25% (range: 15-31%) more suboptimal temperatures than late entrants, compared with an 8% difference (range: 0-17%) between early and late Gates Creek fish. Our results emphasize the need to consider daily temperature variability in association with population-specific differences in behaviour and physiological constraints when forecasting impacts of climate change on migratory survival of aquatic species.

AB  - Changes in temperature associated with climate change can alter species' distributions, drive adaptive evolution, and in some cases cause extinction. Research has tended to focus on the direct effects of temperature, but changes in temperature can also have indirect effects on populations and species. Here, we test whether temperature can indirectly affect the fitness of Drosophila santomea and Drosophila yakuba by altering the nature of interspecific competition. We show that when raised in isolation, both D. santomea and D. yakuba display similar variation in relative fitness across temperatures of 18 degrees, 22 degrees, and 25 degrees C. However, D. santomea has higher fitness than D. yakuba when experiencing interspecific competition at 18 degrees C, while the inverse is true at 25 degrees C. Patterns of fitness across thermal and competitive environments therefore indicate that the outcome of interspecific competition varies with temperature. We then use a coexistence experiment to show that D. santomea is rapidly (within eight generations) extirpated when maintained with D. yakuba at 25 degrees C. By contrast, D. santomea remains as (or more) abundant than D. yakuba over the course of similar to 10 generations when maintained at 18 degrees C. Our results provide an example of how the thermal environment can affect interspecific competition and suggest that some species may become more prone to extinction under scenarios of climate change through indirect effects of the thermal environment on competitive advantages between species.

AB  - With implication of developments of plasmonic biochips, we investigated laser trapping of cyanobacteria (CB) on a gold nanostructure, where a nanopyramidal dimer array was integrated. Upon near-infrared (808 nm) laser irradiation of the sample solution, CB cells were immediately collected, trapped, and permanently fixed onto the irradiated area of the nanostructure. About 15 CB cells were fixed to form a ring pattern. Because bubble generation was always necessary for CB fixation, the fixation was not because of a plasmon-enhanced optical force but because of hydrodynamic pressure modulation and Marangoni convection around the bubble. The bubble was generated by a photothermal effect to boil water. The fixation mechanism would be analogous to that of bubble nanolithography. We examined bioactivity and viability of CB cells using fluorescence microspectroscopy. Our method would be applicable to develop living-cell-based biodevices.

AB  - Average and extreme temperatures will increase in the near future, but how such shifts will affect mortality in natural populations is still unclear. We used a dynamic model to predict mortality under variable temperatures on the basis of heat tolerance laboratory measurements. Theoretical lethal temperatures for 11 Drosophila species under different warming conditions were virtually indistinguishable from empirical results. For Drosophila in the field, daily mortality predicted from ambient temperature records accumulate over weeks or months, consistent with observed seasonal fluctuations and population collapse in nature. Our model quantifies temperature-induced mortality in nature, which is crucial to study the effects of global warming on natural populations, and analyses highlight that critical temperatures are unreliable predictors of mortality.

AB  - In insects, thermal adaptation works on the genetic variation for thermotolerance of not only larvae and adults but also of the immobile stages of the life cycle including eggs. In contrast to adults and larvae, the genetic basis for thermal adaptation in embryos (eggs) remains to be tested in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Quantitative-trait loci (QTL) for heat-stress resistance in embryos could largely differ from previously identified QTL for larvae and adults. Here we used an intercontinental set of recombinant inbred lines (RIL), which were previously used to identify thermotolerance-QTLs in adults and larvae because of their high variation segregating for adult thermotolerance. Eggs appeared to be more heat resistant than larvae and adults from previous studies on these RIL, though different heat-shock assays were used in previous studies. We found that variation in thermotolerance in embryos can be, at least partially, genetically decoupled from thermotolerance in the adult insect. Some RIL that are heat resistant in the adult and larvae can be heat susceptible in embryos. Only one small-effect QTL out of five autosomal QTL co-localized between embryo and other ontogenetic stages. These results suggest that selection for thermal adaptation in adult flies and larvae is predicted to have only a small impact on embryo thermotolerance. In addition, heat-stress tolerance of insects can be measured across ontogenetic stages including embryos in order to better predict thermal adaptive limits of populations and species.

AB  - Comparative evidence suggests that adaptive plasticity may evolve as a response to predictable environmental variation. However, less attention has been placed on unpredictable environmental variation, which is considered to affect evolutionary trajectories by increasing phenotypic variation (or bet hedging). Here, we examine the occurrence of bet hedging in egg developmental rates in seven species of annual killifish that originate from a gradient of variation in precipitation rates, under three treatment incubation temperatures (21, 23, and 25 degrees C). In the wild, these species survive regular and seasonal habitat desiccation, as dormant eggs buried in the soil. At the onset of the rainy season, embryos must be sufficiently developed in order to hatch and complete their life cycle. We found substantial differences among species in both the mean and variation of egg development rates, as well as species-specific plastic responses to incubation temperature. Yet, there was no clear relationship between variation in egg development time and variation in precipitation rate (environmental predictability). The exact cause of these differences therefore remains enigmatic, possibly depending on differences in other natural environmental conditions in addition to precipitation predictability. Hence, if species-specific variances are adaptive, the relationship between development and variation in precipitation is complex and does not diverge in accordance with simple linear relationships.

AB  - 1. Alba, a white wing colour morph of butterflies of the genus Colias, makes fitness-related changes at several levels of phenotypic organization: physiology, development and behaviour. Two sympatric species of Colias are studied, which differ greatly in their frequency of alba vs its sister yellow/orange morph. How resource and time constraints on Colias interact with the morphs? different patterns of pupal resource allocation to alter the balance of the morphs' fitness components in the two species is discussed.
   2. These species, C, alexandra and C. scudderi, differ in melanin-based solar energy absorption, in larval dietary richness and in local adult nectar resources, The two female morphs determine alternate thermal balance, internal resource allocation and behavioural effects in each species, thus changing the morphs' time budgets and fitness-component impacts between the species. In particular, female egg output differences between the morphs appears to reverse between species: alba fecundity is greater than yellow fecundity in C. scudderi, but alba is less than yellow in C. alexandra.
   3. These differences are consistent with the large observed differences in alba frequency between the species. Some important questions about the selective regime maintaining a polymorphism here, rather than an alternation of monomorphisms, remain.

AB  - Arms-control agreements between the United States and Russia negotiated after the end of the Cold War have imposed limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons. Verification of these agreements has relied on onsite inspections, sometimes supported by radiation detection techniques to confirm the absence of a nuclear warhead when ambiguities arise. So far, these measurements have sought to detect neutron emissions associated with the presence of plutonium, but they would be inadequate for uranium devices. In an effort to offer instruments that could be used to confirm the absence of both plutonium and uranium weapons, here we propose an inspection system that uses only passive gamma radiation detection techniques. Such a system would be particularly valuable for next-generation arms-control agreements that limit total numbers of weapons and would involve containerized items in storage. We conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations to support the development of a verification protocol and detection algorithm. We demonstrate the viability of the technique using standard laboratory check sources and MCNP simulations for simplified configurations of special nuclear material.

AB  - Elucidating recruitment processes in marine fish is difficult when species occupy distinct habitats at different ontogenetic stages and when multiple cohorts determine year-class strength. Currently, there is insufficient information on the cohort dynamics of the early life history stages of summer-spawned bluefish Potnatonius saltatrix to critically evaluate each cohort's role in regulating population dynamics. The objective of this study was to provide greater insight into the cohort dynamics of summer-spawned bluefish during the summer and fall on the inner continental shelf off southern New Jersey. Length-frequency and otolith microstructure analyses were used to estimate the age, hatch date, and growth of neustonic individuals collected from shelf surface waters during August-October 1998. Bluefish ranged between 9 and 46 d in age, corresponding to back-calculated hatch dates between 27 June and 13 September. Hatch date frequencies were decomposed into a series of normal curves and identified three cohorts with mean hatch dates occurring in early July (cohort 1), late July to early August (cohort 2), and late August to early September (cohort 3). Cohort-specific growth rates ranged between 0.28 and 0.81 mm standard length/d. Otolith microstructure analysis revealed that growth was significantly faster for cohort 1 than for the other cohorts, most likely because of spatial and temporal variability in the environment (e.g., temperature) and size-selective processes (e.g., mortality). Back-calculated spawning dates indicated that the functional spawning output of bluefish was significantly greater during the first-quarler phase of the lunar cycle. Collectively, these observations suggest that the cohort structure of bluefish is more complex than previously recognized.

AB  - Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus are mosquito vectors for several tropical diseases that represent a current public health problem. The ecological requirements for each species are different, however, both species show high biological adaptability, which promotes their coexistence in the same breeding sites. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of larval association between Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus under different laboratory conditions of food supply and temperature, and under field simulated conditions like peridomestic containers. Our findings showed that under field simulated conditions there was no asymmetrical competition in mixed cultures with the different Cx. quinquefasciatus/Ae. aegypti ratios tested. However, under laboratory conditions in which different doses of food supply were evaluated, it was observed that competition between the two species takes place. Larval coexistence under food scarcity conditions (0.95 mg/larva) showed that Ae. aegypti had a greater adult emergence than Cx. quinquefasciatus and was capable of depriving Cx. quinquefasciatus of the food needed to complete metamorphosis. In an intermediate dose of food (1.9 mg/larva), the dry weight of Cx. quinquefasciatus adults decreased, and their larval development time increased when Cx. quinquefasciatus/Ae. aegypti ratio was low. Also, a temperature effect was assessed demonstrating that Cx. quinquefasciatus was more vulnerable to changes in temperature. We suggest that Ae. aegypti is more successful in exploiting microhabitats when food is scarce, due to its scrape active feeding habitats and fast larval development times. Therefore, in conditions of food paucity both species will compete, and Ae. aegypti larvae will prevail.

AB  - It is accepted by some authors that by stretching the developmental program, by lowering the developmental temperature in a physiological range, adult longevity can be prolonged.
   In order to test this hypothesis in Drosophila melanogaster two groups of flies were acclimated at 20 and 28 degrees C by self mating for 10 generations. The life tables for both sexes of the two temperature groups of flies were constructed at both temperatures. Flies raised at 28 degrees C had a very similar life span at 28 degrees C in comparison to those raised at 20 degrees C. Again the flies developed at 20 degrees C and tested at 20 degrees C did not live for a shorter period than those raised at 28 degrees C and tested at 20 degrees C. When the life spans of the two temperature groups of flies were measured at 25 degrees C, again no significant differences were observed between the averages of the flies collected from the 20 degrees C and 28 degrees C cultures.
   It is concluded that the life span of both male and female flies is independent of developmental temperature. The pertinent data on the subject is compared with ours and the subject evaluated.

AB  - To make laboratory studies of thermal resistance in ectotherms more ecologically relevant, temperature changes that reflect conditions experienced by individuals in nature should be used. Here we describe an assay that is useful for quantifying multiple measures of thermal resistance of individual adult flies. We use this approach to assess upper and lower thermal limits and functional thermal scope for Drosophila melanogaster and also show that the method can be used to (1) detect a previously described latitudinal cline for cold tolerance in D. melanogaster populations collected along the east coast of Australia, (2) demonstrate that acclimation at variable temperatures during development increases tolerance to both low and high thermal stresses and therefore increases thermal scope compared to acclimation at a constant temperature, (3) show that temperate populations adapted to variable thermal environments have wider thermal limits compared to those from the less variable tropics, at least when flies were reared under constant temperature conditions and (4) demonstrate that different measures of cold resistance are often not strongly correlated. Based on our findings, we suggest that the method could be routinely used in evaluating thermal responses potentially linked to ecological processes and evolutionary adaptation.

AB  - Changes in protein function and other biological properties, such as RNA structure, are crucial for adaptation of organisms to novel or inhibitory environments. To investigate how mutations that do not alter amino acid sequence may be positively selected, we performed a thermal adaptation experiment using the single-stranded RNA bacteriophage Q beta in which the culture temperature was increased from 37.2 degrees C to 41.2 degrees C and finally to an inhibitory temperature of 43.6 degrees C in a stepwise manner in three independent lines. Whole-genome analysis revealed 31 mutations, including 14 mutations that did not result in amino acid sequence alterations, in this thermal adaptation. Eight of the 31 mutations were observed in all three lines. Reconstruction and fitness analyses of Q beta strains containing only mutations observed in all three lines indicated that five mutations that did not result in amino acid sequence changes but increased the amplification ratio appeared in the course of adaptation to growth at 41.2 degrees C. Moreover, these mutations provided a suitable genetic background for subsequent mutations, altering the fitness contribution from deleterious to beneficial. These results clearly showed that mutations that do not alter the amino acid sequence play important roles in adaptation of this single-stranded RNA virus to elevated temperature.
   IMPORTANCE
   Recent studies using whole-genome analysis technology suggested the importance of mutations that do not alter the amino acid sequence for adaptation of organisms to novel environmental conditions. It is necessary to investigate how these mutations may be positively selected and to determine to what degree such mutations that do not alter amino acid sequences contribute to adaptive evolution. Here, we report the roles of these silent mutations in thermal adaptation of RNA bacteriophage Q based on experimental evolution during which Q beta showed adaptation to growth at an inhibitory temperature. Intriguingly, four synonymous mutations and one mutation in the untranslated region that spread widely in the Q beta population during the adaptation process at moderately high temperature provided a suitable genetic background to alter the fitness contribution of subsequent mutations from deleterious to beneficial at a higher temperature.

AB  - The following work is an in-depth investigation of the heat transfer characteristics and cooling effectiveness of a full-scale fully-cooled modern high-pressure turbine (HPT) vane as a result of genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, relative to the baseline cooling configuration. Individual designs were evaluated using 3-D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that modeled film cooling injection using a transpiration boundary condition. 1,800 total different film cooling arrays were assessed for fitness within the optimization where film cooling parameters such as axial and radial hole location, hole size, injection angle, compound angle, and custom-designed row patterns were varied in the design space. The GA was able to find a unique pressure side (PS) cooling array after only 13 generations. The fitness functions prescribed for the problem successfully lowered the PS average surface temperature, lowered the maximum temperature, and increased the average overall effectiveness. Results clearly show how the optimized design redistributed flow from over-cooled areas on the vane PS to under-cooled areas near the shroud. Methods used in substantially improving pressure side film cooling performance here are promising in terms of eliminating durability problem areas for individual HPT components in their proper operating environments as well as increasing the potential to use less air from the compressor for cooling purposes in a gas turbine engine.

AB  - The study presents a complete one-dimensional model to evaluate the parameters that describe the operation of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and PEM fuel cell. The mathematical modeling is implemented in Matlab/Simulink (R) software to evaluate the influence of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and overpotentials on the overall performance. The models are further merged into an integrated electrolyzer-fuel cell system for electrical power generation. The operational description of the integrated system focuses on estimating the overall efficiency as a novel indicator. Additionally, the study presents an economic assessment to evaluate the cost-effectiveness based on different economic metrics such as capital cost, electricity cost, and payback period. The parametric analysis showed that as the temperature rises from 30 to 70 degrees C in both devices, the efficiency is improved between 5-20%. In contrast, pressure differences feature less relevance on the overall performance. Ohmic and activation overpotentials are highlighted for the highest impact on the generated and required voltage. Overall, the current density exhibited an inverse relation with the efficiency of both devices. The economic evaluation revealed that the integrated system can operate at variable load conditions while maintaining an electricity cost between 0.3-0.45 $/kWh. Also, the capital cost can be reduced up to 25% while operating at a low current density and maximum temperature. The payback period varies between 6-10 years for an operational temperature of 70 degrees C, which reinforces the viability of the system. Overall, hydrogen-powered systems stand as a promising technology to overcome energy transition as they provide robust operation from both energetic and economic viewpoints.

AB  - In RNA viruses, mutations occur fast and have large fitness effects. While this affords remarkable adaptability, it can also endanger viral survival due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. How RNA viruses reconcile these two opposed facets of mutation is still unknown. Here we show that, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), spontaneous mutations are not randomly located along the viral genome. We find that the viral mutation rate experiences a threefold reduction in the region encoding the most external domains of the viral envelope, which are strongly targeted by neutralizing antibodies. This contrasts with the hypermutation mechanisms deployed by other, more slowly mutating pathogens such as DNA viruses and bacteria, in response to immune pressure. We show that downregulation of the mutation rate in HIV-1 is exerted by the template RNA through changes in sequence context and secondary structure, which control the activity of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3)-mediated cytidine deamination and the fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase.

AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is an androdioecious nematode with both hermaphrodites and males. Although males can potentially play an important role in avoiding inbreeding and facilitating adaptation, their existence is evolutionarily problematic because they do not directly generate offspring in the way that hermaphrodites do. This review explores how genetic, population genomic, and experimental evolution approaches are being used to address the role of males and outcrossing within C. elegans. Although theory suggests that inbreeding depression and male mating ability should be the primary determinants of male frequency, this has yet to be convincingly confirmed experimentally. Genomic analysis of natural populations finds that outcrossing occurs at low, but not negligible levels, and that observed patterns of linkage disequilibrium consistent with strong selfing may instead be generated by natural selection against outcrossed progeny. Recent experimental evolution studies suggest that males can be maintained at fairly high levels if populations are initiated with sufficient genetic variation and/or subjected to strong natural selection via a change in the environment. For example, as reported here, populations adapting to novel laboratory rearing and temperature regimes maintain males at frequencies from 5% to 40%. Laboratory and field results still await full reconciliation, which may be facilitated by identifying the loci underlying among-strain differences in mating system dynamics.

AB  - The rapid increase in population and urbanization has led to an enormous increase in the overall vehicular demand. In India, most vehicles run on conventional fuels producing harmful gases and particulate matter, causing an adverse effect on the human health & environment. Most urban cities in India are witnessing a rapid increase in the level of urban air pollution, which can be largely attributed to the continuous surge in the number of on-road vehicles. According to a KPMG report, it is estimated that by 2030 there will be a 100% incremental adoption of electric vehicles which will lead to the minimization of the pollution level generated from the conventional cars. However, in India, 57.3% of electricity is produced through coal thermal power plant. It cannot be denied that coal leaves behind harmful by-products upon combustion. The emissions from the coal power plants in India increased from 901.7 g CO2/kWh in 2005 to 926 g CO2/kWh in 2012. This is much higher than global averages in the same period, which were 542 g and 533 g CO2/kWh, respectively. The increase in the number of electric vehicles is likely to increase the demand for electricity, which may result in a rise in emissions from thermal power plants, thus offsetting the reductions in tailpipe emissions. This study deals with assessing the impact of shifting the fleet from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to electric vehicles (EV) on power generation sources, i.e., coal power plants, and its impact on the environment in India. The implication viability of electric vehicle over internal combustion engine vehicle has been assessed with exergy analysis, taking into account the total emissions involved from well to wheel. In the current power generation scenario of India, a comparative analysis of direct and indirect emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles (powered with coal power generation) shows that electric vehicles emit less CO2 and CO, whereas SO2 and Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emisions (indirectly from the thermal power plant), are higher.

AB  - A tropical climate prevails in most of the sericultural areas in India, where temperature increases during the summer lead to adverse effects on temperate bivoltine silkworm rearing and cause crop losses. Screening for thermotolerance in the silkworm, Bombyxmori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) is an essential prerequisite for the development of thermotolerant breeds/hybrids. In the current study, the aim was to identify potential bivoltine silkworm strains specific for tolerance to high temperature. The third day of fifth stage silkworm larvae of bivoltine strains were subjected to high temperature of 36 +/- 1 degrees C with RH of 50 +/- 5 % for six hours (10:00-16:00) every day until spinning for three consecutive generations. Highly significant differences were found among all genetic traits of bivoltine silkworm strains in the treated groups. Three groups of silkworm resulted including susceptible, moderately tolerant, and tolerant by utilizing pupation rate or survival rate with thermal stress as the index for thermotolerance. Furthermore, based on the overall silkworm rearing performance of nine quantitative genetic traits such as larval weight, cocoon yield by number and weight, pupation, single cocoon and shell weight, shell ratio, filament length and denier, three bivoltine silkworm strains, BD2-S, SOF-BR and BO2 were developed as having the potential for thermotolerance. The data from the present study enhance knowledge for the development of thermo tolerant silkworm breeds/hybrids and their effective commercial utilization in the sericulture industry.

AB  - Combined generation of heat, cooling and power has a large potential to increase its share in distributed generation of energy. Such investments are driven by energy savings which result to operational profits. These profits are very sensitive to the prices of the competitive energy products: electricity and gas. In this work a theoretical indicator is developed between energy prices, the technical characteristics of cogeneration and conventional generation equipment and the investment viability. Through this indicator, the operational profitability of cogeneration equipment is mapped and discussed. Empirical rules are extracted which can give a clear view of the sensitivity of energy prices on energy efficiency investments. The European cogeneration status quo is analyzed in terms of energy prices and market share. The developed indicator is also used, to analyze market related barriers and highlight the importance of energy pricing policy as a tool to minimize the risk exposure of energy efficiency investments.

AB  - A circular (close-loop) biorefinery, which integrates wastewater treatment with the generation of an energy precursor and organic fertilizer, tested at the level of a pilot plant treating 54,000 L per day (LPD) of sewage, is described. In the biorefinery's first stage, sewage was treated in a novel SHEFROL (R) (sheet-flow-root-level) bioreactor at a very rapid rate, indicated by a hydraulic retention time of a mere 6 h, to a level that met the prevailing national standards for the discharge of treated sewage. The main bioagent of the reactor-water hyacinth-was then processed for the generation of energy precursors. For this, volatile fatty acids (VFA) were extracted in a simple batch reactor operating at ambient temperature and pressure. The 'spent' weeds were then converted into organic fertilizer, also at ambient temperature and pressure, by the high-rate vermicomposting process earlier reported by the authors. In this manner, wastewater treatment, energy production, and the generation of a fertilizer were achieved rapidly and efficiently, creating a circular close-loop system that required very little energy and materials and generated almost zero net waste.

AB  - The size of reptile hatchlings can be phenotypically plastic in response to incubation temperature, and size is a trait likely to influence fitness-i.e. hatchling size is proposed as an indicator of quality. The parental and incubation temperature effects on the size of one of New Zealand's most biologically significant reptile species, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus are investigated. Artificial incubation at constant temperatures is used to produce founders for new captive and wild populations of tuatara and to augment existing rare populations. We compare size of hatchling tuatara from artificial and natural incubation treatments. The relationship of hatchling size with incubation temperature and sex is examined, and we investigate whether our results support differential fitness models for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in tuatara. Initial egg mass is the most important factor affecting size of hatchling tuatara and is still an important influence at 10 months of age. Incubation temperature does not greatly influence size of hatchlings, but significantly influences size by 10 months of age. Constant artificial incubation conditions result in larger, but possibly less aggressive, juveniles than those from more variable natural incubation conditions by 10 months of age. Evidence from size patterns of tuatara incubated in natural nests supports differential fitness models for the adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination. Thermal variation has little effect on size of male hatchlings, but female embryos that develop in more stable thermal conditions, in more reliable sites for hatching, are bigger and have longer jaws.

AB  - Although the impact of warming on winter limitation of aphid populations is reasonably well understood, the impacts of hot summers and heat wave events are less clear. In this study, we address this question through a detailed analysis of the thermal ecology of three closely related aphid species: Myzus persicae, a widespread, polyphagous temperate zone pest, Myzus polaris, an arctic aphid potentially threatened by climate warming, and, Myzus ornatus, a glasshouse pest that may benefit from warming. The upper lethal limits (ULT50) and heat coma temperatures of the aphid species reared at both 15 and 20 degrees C did not differ significantly, suggesting that heat coma is a reliable indicator of fatal heat stress. Heat coma and CTmax were also measured after aphids were reared at 10 and 25 degrees C for one and three generations. The extent of the acclimation response was not influenced by the number of generations. Acclimation increased CTmax with rearing temperature for all species. The acclimation temperature also influenced heat coma; this relationship was linear for M. ornatus and M. polaris but non-linear for M. persicae (increased tolerance at 10 and 25 degrees C). Bacteria known generically as secondary symbionts can promote thermal tolerance of aphids, but they were not detected in the aphids studied here. Assays of optimum development temperature were also performed for each species. All data indicate that M. persicae has the greatest tolerance of high temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study assessed the genotype by environment (G x E) interaction for diameter growth in 15 Eucalyptus globulus progeny trials in Australia. Single-site analyses revealed significant subrace and family-within-subrace variance in all trials. Across-site subrace ((r) over cap (s)) and family ((r) over cap (f)) correlations were estimated by linear mixed model analyses of pairs of trials. Using a factor analytic structure for subrace and family random terms in a multi-environment mixed model analysis, best linear unbiased predictions of subrace effects were obtained for each trial. These were then averaged for each of four states (Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia) and across all sites. Statistically significant G x E interaction was detected, and weighted means across states for (r) over cap (s) and (r) over cap (f) were 0.73 and 0.76, respectively. Nevertheless, the three subraces from the Otway Ranges were both fast growing and relatively stable in their ranks over all sites. We evaluated the sensitivity of subraces to changing environmental conditions, on the basis of random coefficient models regressing subrace performance on selected trial climatic variables. The results suggested differential susceptibility of subraces to water; light and (to a less extent) temperature stresses during summer. Moreover, using multivariate techniques to visualize and interpret the across-site correlation structure for subrace effects, we could identify site clusters of reduced G x E interaction related to soil water availability and evaporative demand during summer. A revised site-type classification using these factors should allow a better capture of genetic gains from breeding and deployment.

AB  - In the present study, seven carbohydrates were selected as encapsulant for preparing lutein microencapsulated powders (LMPs). The surface morphology, physical properties, encapsulation efficiency, and thermo- and storage stability of LMPs were studied to determine the protective effects of different carbohydrates on microencapsulated lutein during spray drying and storage. Results on powder characteristics indicated that the crystal inhibition of wall material in spray drying was necessary for decent encapsulation efficiency, and higher glass transition temperature of wall material could cause high product yield. In stability assessment, degradation kinetics of different LMPs at two different temperature conditions were analysed, revealing that inulin could provide more effective protection compared with the other carbohydrate. Our results suggested that the different carbohydrates had great influence on the quality of LMPs, and inulin could be considered as an alternative for the generation of LMPs to enhance storage stability and extend shelf life of this bioactive product.

AB  - Minimum mortality temperature (MMT) is an important indicator to assess the temperature-mortality relationship. It reflects human adaptability to local climate. The existing MMT estimates were usually based on case studies in data rich regions, and limited evidence about MMT was available at a global scale. It is still unclear what the most significant driver of MMT is and how MMT will change under global climate change. Here, by analysing MMTs in 420 locations covering six continents (Antarctica was excluded) in the world, we found that although the MMT changes geographically, it is very close to the local most frequent temperature (MFT) in the same period. The association between MFT and MMT is not changed when we adjust for latitude and study year. Based on the MFT similar to MMT association, we estimate and map the global distribution of MMTs in the present (2010s) and the future (2050s) for the first time.

AB  - The performance of a hybrid wind-solar power plant in southwestern Minnesota is modeled for a 2-yr period using hourly wind and solar insolation data. The wind portion of the plant consists of four interconnected wind farms within a radius of 90 km. The solar component of the plant is a parabolic trough solar thermal electric generating system using a heat transfer fluid that drives a steam turbine. The market value of energy produced, retail value of energy produced, and levelized cost of energy of the hybrid plant are compared to those of an energy equivalent wind-only plant. Results show that adding solar thermal electric generating capacity to a wind farm rather than expanding with additional wind capacity provides cost-benefit trade-offs that will continue to change as the two technologies evolve. At the present time, we find that capital cost and levelized cost of energy favor a wind-only plant while electric load matching favors a hybrid wind-solar plant. Regional differences in the solar resource in the US influence the economic viability of the hybrid plant, and a comparison using the present model is made with one location in the Southwest. The hourly data analysis presented here is a possible tool for evaluating the overall economic feasibility and generating characteristics for a hybrid wind-solar thermal electric power plant for any location with available wind, solar, electric load, and price data.

AB  - The role of winter diapause in two aphid parasitoid species, Aphidius ervi Haliday and Aphidius rhopalosiphi DeStefani-Peres (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae), in host synchronization and the induction of cold hardiness was investigated. Parasitoids were reared during three successive generations on Sitobion avenae Fabricius, at 15 degrees C under a photoperiod of 9 h light 15 h dark. Although these conditions are known to be strongly diapause inducing, neither parasitoids showed an incidence of diapause. above 65% over the three generations; the rest of the population underwent quiescence. In both parasitoid species, diapausing mummies exhibited greater cold hardiness than non-diapausing mummies, resulting in significantly lower supercooling points (SCP) and in a higher survival rate during long-term exposures at 0 and -10 degrees C. The induction of increased cold hardiness in parasitoids was thus associated with the diapause state. SCPs of third instar larvae of S. avenae were similar to those of non-diapausing mummies of both parasitoid species, but significantly higher than those of diapausing mummies. The effect of winter climate on the stability of the host-parasitoid interaction is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A previously established multiscale population genetics model posits that fitness can be inferred from the physical properties of proteins under the physiological assumption that a loss of stability by any protein confers the lethal phenotype to an organism. Here, we develop this model further by positing that replication rate (fitness) of a bacterial or viral strain directly depends on the copy number of folded proteins, which determine its replication rate. Using this model, and both numerical and analytical approaches, we studied the adaptation process of bacteria and viruses at varied environmental temperatures. We found that a broad distribution of protein stabilities observed in the model and in experiment is the key determinant of thermal response for viruses and bacteria. Our results explain most of the earlier experimental observations: the striking asymmetry of thermal response curves; the absence of evolutionary tradeoff, which was expected but not found in experiments; correlation between denaturation temperature for several protein families and the optimal growth temperature of their carrier organisms; and proximity of bacterial or viral optimal growth temperatures to their evolutionary temperatures. Our theory quantitatively and with high accuracy described thermal response curves for 35 bacterial species using, for each species, only two adjustable parameters the number of rate-determining genes and the energy barrier for metabolic reactions.

AB  - The present paper analyses a case study of the application of dynamic energy simulation on the energy efficiency improvement process of an existing commercial building, the retrofit of a CHP machine for the combined generation of heat and power is analysed. Great attention is dedicated to the correct sizing of the CHP/CCHP plant both in term of energy efficiency and economic viability.
   A detailed building model is developed and used, through dynamic building simulation, to identify the potential energy and economic savings achievable with the installation of a CHP/CCHP sized based on the results of the simulation itself.
   The work proves the usefulness of dynamic energy simulation as an evaluation tool for retrofits of CHP plants and provides suggestions on the correct sizing of CHP equipment. It is also meant to prove what could be achieved if those kind of analysis were carried out during the design of the building.

AB  - Thermal adaptation of individual proteins is often achieved through modulating protein stability, with proteins that are adapted to extreme cold environments having increased conformational flexibility when brought to mesophilic conditions. Conversely, proteins adapted to higher temperatures appear less dynamic and tire found to be much more stable against thermal denaturation than their mesophilic counterparts. According to the current paradigm, the adaptation of an organism for survival at higher or lower temperatures is facilitated by the adaptation of the component proteins. We note, however, that these observations have been carried out on relatively few proteins. The extent to which the conformational stabilities of all members of the proteome have been modulated for thermal adaptation remains unclear, with no direct experimental strategies to address this issue. Adapted extremophilies are likely to use it Multitude of molecular and biophysical strategies for survival and, therefore, evolution of specific biophysical properties of proteins for optimal function may not be necessary for all proteins in the proteome. Using it sequence-based predictor of protein stability, eScape, an in silico examination of several extremophilic proteomes shows a correlation between the collective stability of the proteins and the thermal range of survival for the organism as expected. Unexpectedly, however, the analysis shows that protein thermostability is modified to different extents across the proteome and depends oil the functional role for which the protein is involved. Identification of these differences provides unique opportunities to study interdependence within the proteome as well as the role that the proteome plays in the process of evolutionary thermal adaptation.

AB  - In the current article, which is first to a two-part study, techno-economic evaluation, viability and optimization of concentrated solar power plants considering design parameters of solar multiple and integration of thermal energy storage is performed. High frequency (10 min), validated ground datasets are used for numerical simu-lations using System Advisor Model. Techno-economic performance analysis of dry and wet cooling system equipped solar tower and parabolic trough collectors is assessed for three different climatic zones i.e. temperate, semi-arid and sub-tropical. The optimization problem intends to maximize technical potential alongside mini-mizing net cost of electricity production. It is found that on average, 60 and 75% increase in annual electricity generation, and 5 and 7% decrease in levelized cost of electricity is observed with addition of 6 h of storage for solar tower and trough plants, respectively. For cost-effective solution, optimal solar multiple and thermal energy storage combination is in range of 3-3.2 and 15.4-15.9 for solar tower, and 2.3-3 and 10.6-11.6 h for trough plants. Wet-cooled solar towers perform the best in each climatic zone offering 5-6% lower cost of electricity production and 3-7% higher electricity generation potentials. Moreover, for mutually exclusive projects, lev-elized cost of electricity is a better metric to gauge economic viability than net present value. The follow-up study (Part B) focuses on environ-economic optimization of concentrated solar power plants. Furthermore, outcomes from both optimization objectives are utilized for multi-objective optimization based 'balanced' solution assessment in the next part.

AB  - The use of wood fuel for heat generation has been increasing steadily in re-cent years. Wood-fired heating systems do not only make economic sense for woodland owners; more and more often non-woodland owners are having their heat supplied by wood-fired power stations.
   Three output categories of wood-fired system were compared: 20, 60 and 100 kilowatt (kW). The cost price of the heat ranged from 16.4 to 34.0 Swiss centimes per kilowatt hour. Pellet heating was most cost-effective for the 20 kW output category, woodchip firing with tower-silo storage for outputs of 60 and 100 kW. A heat cost price comparison of heating systems with fossil energy carriers such as fuel oil and natural gas shows that medium and relatively high-output wood-burning systems cost only slightly more.
   An analysis of four case studies shows that investment costs can vary greatly for woodchip heating systems with comparable plant ratings. The type of woodchip storage and other operational factors can make all the difference.

AB  - Effect of different temperature degrees (10, 20 and 30 C) on the developmental stages of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius colemani Vierek (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae), reared on mealy aphid Hyalopterus pruni (Geoffroy) was studied under laboratory conditions. As temperature increased from 10 to 30 degrees C longevity decreased. Lowest thermal threshold for the development of the parasitoid was 0.40 degrees C for eggs, 2.6 degrees C for larvae and 4.0 degrees C for pupae, while it was 2.8 degrees C for the total developmental duration from (egg to adult). Thermal constant for the development of eggs was 71.93 day degree (DD's), 103.37DD's for larvae, 94.7 DD's for pupae and 258.8 DD's for the total developmental period. The lowest thermal threshold for female longevity was 2.7 degrees C and the thermal constant was 73.63DD's, while the lowest thermal threshold for male longevity was 3.9 degrees C and the thermal constant was 45.67 DD's. Obtained results are essential information for predicting the field population of the parasitoid A. colemani and for its releasing time. Sex ratio (female: male) was 1.71:1 in the field. By rearing the parasitoid for three successive generations in laboratory, the sex ratio was almost 1:1 in the first two generations, but males were relatively higher in the third one (1:1.04)

AB  - Alternative host plants are among the key factors influencing the spread of invasive pests because they are utilized as a food source and provide shelter in unfavorable conditions. The South American tomato pinworm (SATP), Tuta absoluta Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), has a high behavioral and physiological plasticity enabling it to rapidly spread in several countries. Among the multiple strategies used by SATP in the invasion process is the use of alternative host plants including black nightshade (BNS), Solanum nigrum L. (Solanaceae), a perennial plant widely distributed across all habitats worldwide. Besides the life table and behavioral parameters of SATP on tomato, its survival and reproduction in low temperatures on alternative host plants should be assessed to evaluate the likely spread in temperate regions with harsh winters. In our study, comparing solanaceous species through generations, the primary difference was in the mean generation time with SATP reared on BNS, whereby it had a longer development time than larvae and pupae reared on tomato plants. Adults preferred tomato plants even if they had been reared as larvae on BNS. Exposure periods of 7, 14, and 21 days to 4 degrees C indicated that more than 50% of SATP pupae reared on BNS plants survived more than 14 days. The survival of SATP reared on tomato plants exceeded 21 days and after exposure to 4 degrees C, females reared on both plants remained fertile. The life table and behavioral parameters recorded demonstrated a significant potential of BNS to support the development of SATP, also at low temperature. Therefore, even with effective border surveillance and phytosanitation processes in place, invasion through an alternative host is possible and difficult to detect.

TI  - Wilhelm Weinberg's Early Contribution to Segregation Analysis
T2  - GENETICS
LA  - English
AB  - Wilhelm Weinberg (1862-1937) is a largely forgotten pioneer of human and medical genetics. His name is linked with that of the English mathematician G. H. Hardy in the Hardy-Weinberg law, pervasive in textbooks on population genetics since it expresses stability over generations of zygote frequencies AA, Aa, aa under random mating. One of Weinberg's signal contributions, in an article whose centenary we celebrate, was to verify that Mendel's segregation law still held in the setting of human heredity, contrary to the then-prevailing view of William Bateson (1861-1926), the leading Mendelian geneticist of the time. Specifically, Weinberg verified that the proportion of recessive offspring genotypes aa in human parental crossings Aa x Aa (that is, the segregation ratio for such a setting) was indeed p = 1/4. We focus in a nontechnical way on his procedure, called the simple sib method, and on the heated controversy with Felix Bernstein (1878-1956) in the 1920s and 1930s over work stimulated by Weinberg's article.

AB  - For nearly three centuries the area around Gusum, in south-east Sweden, has been highly polluted with copper. An earlier study in this area showed that populations of the freeze-tolerant earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra were genetically adapted to copper. Apparently, no life-history costs to reproduction or growth were imposed by this adaptation. In the present paper we therefore investigated how laboratory raised F1-generations of these populations coped when exposed to increased copper concentrations in the soil and to sub-zero temperatures. We found that D. octaedra from polluted sites accumulated the same amount of copper as reference worms. Furthermore, earthworms from polluted sites survived equally to reference worms when exposed to freezing temperatures (-8 or - 12 degrees C). However, when simultaneously exposed to the lowest temperature and copper, the worms from polluted sites survived significantly better than reference worms. The overall conclusion of this study is that worms from polluted sites seem to be better at handling copper and accrue no costs in terms of reduced cold tolerance in connection to genetic adaptation in these populations.

AB  - Based on Brazilian isolated communities' situation about absence energy distribution, mainly in the Amazon, northeastern semi-arid and isolated regions of the Savana, some alternatives should be developed to produce electric power for energy supply. Looking for the capacities and sources of these communities, the oilseed production capacity is the most promised. So, a easy to handle pilot plant for cracking oils and fats was developed to produce biofuels. This study aimed to analyse the mass and energy balances of the pilot plant to check its viability for sustainable energy supply. For this, three different cracking temperatures (663 K, 678 K and 693 K) were studied, and reaction data was collected. The physicochemical properties are similar to those of petroleum diesel, indicating that thermal cracking fuel may be a viable alternative to this fossil fuel in diesel cycle engines. The best temperature for the cracking reaction was 678 K, due to the physicochemical parameters of the biofuel produced being similar to those of fossil diesel. So, according to energy production system, the cracking temperatures 678 and 693 K are recommended.

AB  - Flatfish and groundfish show many similarities in reproductive strategies and tactics, both in types present and in responses to fishing pressure or changes in their environment. Over the last 20-30 years the reproduction of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, sole Solea solea, and turbot Scophthalmus maximus have been extensively studied in the North Atlantic. For cod, halibut and turbot, the research has progressed rapidly due to interest from the aquaculture industry. Extensive overexploitation over many years in combination with climate change represents a potential evolutionary pressure towards changes in growth, lower age at maturity, increased fecundity, smaller egg size (and thereby larval size) and change in spawning time. Early sexual maturity/precocious maturation is also seen in aquaculture and is problematic economically due to a reduction in fillet production. In this paper information is reviewed from studies on both wild and captive populations in experiments, the latter considered important because overexploitation, such as observed in the North Sea, often reduces the natural dynamics in growth and reproduction and complicates collection of sufficiently large samples. Evidence from laboratory experiments demonstrates the inherent plasticity of fecundity production and how this is controlled by food availability and length of photoperiod, while recent information from field studies demonstrates the evolution of genotypes in response to fishing mortality. Today several laboratories have adopted modem techniques for analysis of reproductive investments (fecundity, atresia and sperm characterisation) in controlled experimental situations to explore the effect of temperature or other environmental parameters (such as salinity) on reproduction. These developments, in combination with the rapid implementation of molecular techniques, should make it possible in the future to present highly precise information on reproductive potential, both at the individual and stock level. Of particular interest, and a major goal, would be to dissociate genetic and phenotypic control of reproductive traits arising from a better understanding of gene expression in captive populations.

AB  - The effect of different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations on the macroinvertebrate assemblages from 2 Australian tropical streams (1 upland, 1 lowland) was measured using artificial stream mesocosms. Responses to 5-d exposures were tested. Both the upland and lowland assemblages showed a similar response. Most taxa tolerated all but very low DO levels (<10% saturation), although a reduction in emergence of insect taxa at intermediate levels (25-35% and 10-20% saturation) was observed. Mayflies showed the highest sensitivity to low oxygen conditions, and lethal effects were observed at DO levels <20% saturation for several upland and lowland species. For other taxa, including several Chironomidae, mortality was observed when oxygen concentrations were below 8% saturation. A drift response was observed only when oxygen concentrations reached near lethal levels (less than or equal to10% saturation). The lack of a drift response at DO concentrations of 25 to 35% and 10 to 20% saturation indicates that, in moderately poor oxygen conditions, macroinvertebrates will remain at a location and, hence, experience sublethal effects such as suppressed emergence. It is clear that these animals can persist in hypoxic conditions in the short term. However, because of sublethal effects, understanding how low DO concentrations affect natural assemblages of aquatic macroinvertebrates may require studies of populations over several generations.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising renewable feedstock for the sustainable manufacturing of biofuels and bioproducts. Among emerging bioproducts, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is of particular interest as a platform chemical to produce commercially significant chemicals such as acrylic acid. In this study, BioSTEAM.an open-source platform.was leveraged to design, simulate, and evaluate (via techno-economic analysis, TEA, and life cycle assessment, LCA) biorefineries producing acrylic acid via fermentation of sugars (glucose and xylose) to 3-HP. The biorefinery could produce acrylic acid with a minimum product selling price (MPSP) of $1.72-2.08.kg(-1) (5th-95th percentiles; baseline at $ 1.83.kg(-1)). Advancements in key technological parameters (fermentation yield, titer, and saccharification solids loading) could greatly enhance the biorefinery's performance (MPSP of $1.29-1.52.kg(-1) with similar to 88% probability of market-competitiveness, a global warming potential of 3.00 [2.53-3.38] kg CO2-eq.kg(-1), and a fossil energy consumption of 39.9 [31.6-45.1] MJ.kg(-1)). A quantitative sustainable design framework was used to explore alternative fermentation regimes (neutral/ low-pH fermentation across titer, yield, and productivity combinations) and alternative feedstocks (first/second-generation feedstocks across price and sugar/carbohydrate content). Overall, this research highlights the ability of agile TEA-LCA to screen promising biorefinery designs, navigate sustainability trade-offs, prioritize research needs, and establish a roadmap for the continued development of bioproducts and biofuels.

AB  - The solitary bee Osmia lignaria Say continues to be developed as an orchard pollinator in the United States and southern Canada. Female bees are active during the early spring and construct nests consisting of a linear series of unlined cells delimited by mud partitions. Cells are provisioned with a pollen/nectar mass on which an egg is deposited, and nests are sealed with a mud plug. In 1997, we initiated two experiments on the development, mortality, and emergence of O. lignaria at selected laboratory temperature regimes and outdoors. In the first experiment (published previously), we compared temperature treatments for their adequacy in maintaining healthy O. lignaria populations. In a second experiment (reported here), we determined the relationship between rearing temperatures and prepupa-adult development rates as well as emergence time and longevity after wintering and incubation the following spring. We observed important differences in O. lignaria prepupa versus pupa responses to selected temperature treatments. The relationship between temperature and days to pupa was U-shaped, with additional time to transit the prepupa-pupa interval at temperatures above and below 26 degrees C. The negative relationship between temperature and the length of the pupa to adult interval contrasts with the U-shaped thermal response observed for prepupae. Thus, with each increase in thermal beat units over the range of temperature treatments tested, we observed an additional reduction in the pupa-adult interval. Individuals reared at constant 18 degrees C required 2.4 times as many days to transit the pupa-adult interval compared with those at constant 32 degrees C. Our results suggest that there is a need for the development of regionally adapted, latitude-specific breeding populations of this outstanding orchard crop pollinator.

AB  - A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model of infrasound propagation in a realistic atmosphere is used to provide quantitative interpretation of infrasonic waves produced by auroral arcs moving with supersonic speed. The Lorentz force and Joule heating are discussed in the existing literature as primary sources producing infrasound waves in the frequency range 0.1-0.01 Hz associated with the auroral electrojet. The results are consistent with original ideas of Swift (1973) and demonstrate that the synchronization of the speed of auroral arc and phase speed of the acoustic wave in the electrojet volume is an important condition for generation of magnitudes and frequency contents of infrasonic waves observable on the ground. The reported modeling also allows accurate quantitative reproduction of previously observed complex infrasonic waveforms including direct shock and reflected shockwaves, which are refracted back to the earth by the thermosphere.

It is concluded that some caution must be taken for the commonly used strategy of assuming time-averaged frictional heat generation for intermittent contact. The predictions made by the half-plane analytical solution that assumes thermally nonconductive and rigid frictional surface considerably overestimate the dimensionless critical speeds of realistic brake or clutch systems. Longer wavelength perturbations become unstable at a dimensionless sliding speed approaching zero, as opposed to the converged value of unity in the half-plane solution. Averaging the heat input over the entire circumference is appropriate only when the period of frictional contact is longer than that of separation. These results merit the use of the finite element method in more general applications involving intermittent contact.

AB  - PMN from blood of 6 mares were separated using hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes and centrifugation. After addition of a solution of equine plasma and DMSO (5%) the PMN were frozen. A method for freezing was developed with control of temperature decreasing rate. Tempera ture curve was 4 to -70 degrees C at 1 degrees C/min, -71 to -140 degrees C at 10 degrees C/min, -140 to -196 degrees C diving. To verify cell survival rate after thawing as well as its functional capacity i.e. phagocytosis and respiratory burst (ROS) an experiment using flow cytometry assay was performed. 95.5% resp. 94.5% of propidium iodide negative PMNs indicate cell membrane integrity of both the fresh and frozen/thawed PMN populations. Phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria was similar in both populations of cells i.e. 81.0% resp. 80.0% of the fresh resp. frozen/thawed PMNs. Increasing capacity for generation of reactive oxygen species after stimulation by PMA was observed with frozen/thawed neutrophils. The results of this study indicate the practicability of the method for achieving and cryopreservation of a vital and immune competent PMN population for intended therapeutic use in susceptible mares for endometritis.

AB  - In the present day, methanol is mainly produced from methane via reforming processes, but research focuses on alternative production routes. Herein, we present a chemo-/biocatalytic oxidation cascade as a novel process to currently available methods. Starting from synthetic biogas, in the first step methane was oxidized to formaldehyde over a mesoporous VOx/SBA-15 catalyst. In the second step, the produced formaldehyde was disproportionated enzymatically towards methanol and formic acid in equimolar ratio by formaldehyde dismutase (FDM) obtained from Pseudomonas putida. Two processing routes were demonstrated: (a) batch wise operation using free formaldehyde dismutase after accumulating formaldehyde from the first step and (b) continuous operation with immobilized enzymes. Remarkably, the chemo-/biocatalytic oxidation cascades generate methanol in much higher productivity compared to methane monooxygenase (MMO) which, however, directly converts methane. Moreover, production steps for the generation of formic acid were reduced from four to two stages.

AB  - Complete indehiscence of anthers accompanied with exerted stigmas outside the hull could be useful in hybrid rice breeding if the genetics and possible environmental effects are well understood. Studies were undertaken to identify the sources, confirm the mode of inheritance, and examine the possible environmental effects and potential application of anther indehiscence with exerted stigmas in hybrid rice breeding. Direct and reciprocal crosses were made between Jasmine 85, selected interspecific and intersubspecific lines and two wide compatibility varieties. The resulting F1 progenies were evaluated for their expression of anther indehiscence and exerted stigmas. Expression of anther indehiscence with exerted stigmas by both direct and reciprocal crosses suggested no effect of cytoplasmic factors on the expression of the trait. Segregation analysis supported the 7:1 (indehiscence: dehiscence) mode of inheritance. Temperature and relative humidity could not modulate the fertility/sterility status of anther indehiscent plants. Utilization of anther indehiscence with exerted stigmas in hybrid rice breeding was hindered by trait fixation and propagation.

AB  - Long-term performance of power generation and water desalination equipment depends on proper seawater quality. At Sabiya power generation and water desalination plant (SPDP), the seawater quality is very high in turbidity because of high content of silt and sand. Currently, the quality of seawater at SPDP is causing some inconvenience to the operation and maintenance of the station's equipment. This paper is aimed at assessing the viability of enhancing seawater quality for thermal and membrane desalination processes at SPDP using the pilot-scale decanter centrifuge unit as mechanical treatment. This unit has the potential to substantially lower the silt and sand concentration to an acceptable level, allowing the use of seawater safely as feed for membrane and thermal desalination units, as well as for power generation equipment. The experimental results indicated that the decanter centrifuge system is a viable mechanical process for improving the quality of the SPDP seawater feed. The system was able to treat 100% of seawater feed, with a 99.6% availability. The separated silt and sand by the decanter centrifuge unit is coming out as a fine dry powder from the solid side compartment, which can be collected and transferred out of the SPDP station. In addition, the results showed that as flow increases, the power consumption decreases, which give an indication that the power consumption for treating seawater utilizing decanter centrifuge with a bigger capacity will be in an acceptable range.

AB  - The fission product strontium (Sr), after generation in the reactor due to fission of U-233, might exist as SrF2 in the molten fluoride medium of molten salt reactor (MSR) using fluoride carrier salts. The high temperature interactions between the strontium fluoride (SrF2) with the fertile fuel component and thorium fluoride (ThF4) leads to form single ternary compound SrThF6(s). The Gibbs energy of formation is the driving force for formation of any compound. In the present study, standard molar Gibbs energy of formation SrThF6(s) has been determined using an e.m.f. technique using CaF2(s) as solid electrolyte. Using the experimental thermodynamic data, to study the stability domain of SrThF6(s), the chemical potential diagram of Sr-Th-F-O system and ternary phase diagram of Sr-Th-F-2 system have been calculated.

AB  - Population dynamics and production of the calanoid copepod Acartia omorii Bradford were studied from November 1986 to November 1987 in Fukuyama Harbor, a eutrophic inlet of the Inland Sea of Japan. This species was present in the plankton from October to July (temperature range: 8.9 to 24.3 degrees C), with peaks in February-March and June. During this period, nine generations could be detected, for which the mean population egg production rate and midstage abundance of each life stage older than naupliar Stage (N) II were determined to trace survival. The population suffered extremely high mortality during the early life stages: on average only 2.5% of the eggs produced recruited into NII. This large loss is probably concentrated within the egg stage, due to predation, including cannibalism, by omnivorous copepods, in addition to sinking loss of eggs in the water column. However, the mortality from NII to copepodite Stage (C) V was negligible, indicating low predation pressure by large carnivores. The biomass of A. omorii showed marked seasonal variations in parallel with numerical abundance. The instantaneous growth rate of each stage increased exponentially with increasing temperature. The integrated production rate of A. omorii from 7 November 1986 to 21 July 1987 was 749 mg C m(-3) or 5.62 gCm(-2).

AB  - The simultaneous cloaking and concentrating of heat flux is achieved through topology optimization based on a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy by formulating the optimization problem of improving two different objective functions. The topology-optimized thermal cloak-concentrator realizes excellent bi-functionality (i.e., cloaking and concentrating) despite having a simple composition, and structural characteristics needed for simultaneous cloaking and concentrating are revealed adopting a level set method with clear structural interfaces. Moreover, a thermal cloak-concentrator that is robust against fluctuations of thermal conductivity is designed by improving a fitness incorporating multiple objective functions under various thermal conductivities.

AB  - The present paper aimed at assessing the effect of two thermal management approaches on geometry and productivity of thin-walled structures built by Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM). Thin-walls of ER 5356 (Al5Mg) with different lengths and the same number of layers were deposited via the gas metal arc (GMA) process with the aid of an active cooling technique (near-immersion active cooling-NIAC) under a fixed set of deposition parameters. Then, the same experiment was performed with natural cooling (NC) in air. To characterize the thermal management approaches, the interpass temperature (i.e., the temperature at which subsequent layers are deposited) were monitored by a trailing/leading infrared pyrometer during the deposition time. Finally, thin walls with a fixed length were deposited using the NC and NIAC approaches with equivalent interpass temperatures. As expected, the shorter the wall length the more intense the deposition concentration, heat accumulation, and, thus, geometric deviation. This behavior was more evident and premature for the NC strategy due to its lower heat sinking effectiveness. The main finding was that, regardless of the thermal management technique applied, if the same interpass temperature is selected and maintained, the geometry of the part being built tends to be stable and very similar. However, the total deposition time is somewhat shorter with the NIAC technique due its greater heat sinking advantage. Thus, the NIAC technique facilitates the non-stop manufacturing of small parts and details via WAAM.

AB  - Dense bush-like clumps of several hundred individuals of a new species of Cladorhiza (Demospongiae, Poecilosclerida) were observed near methane sources in mud volcanoes, 4718 to 4943 m deep in the Barbados Trench. The sponge tissue contains 2 main morphological types of extracellular symbiotic bacteria: small rod-shaped cells and larger coccoid cells with stacked membranes. Stable carbon isotope values, the presence of methanol dehydrogenase and ultrastructural observations all indicate that at least some of the symbionts are methanotrophic. Ultrastructural evidence of intracellular digestion of the symbionts and the stable C and N values suggest that the sponge obtains a significant portion of its nutrition from the symbionts. Ultrastructure of the sponge embryo suggests direct transmission through generations in brooded embryos. The sponge also maintains a carnivorous feeding habit on tiny swimming prey, as do other cladorhizids.

AB  - We present a multi-site stochastic model for the generation of average daily temperature, which includes a flexible parametric distribution and a multivariate autoregressive process. Different versions of this model are applied to a set of 26 stations located in Switzerland. The importance of specific statistical characteristics of the model (seasonality, marginal distributions of standardized temperature, spatial and temporal dependence) is discussed. In particular, the proposed marginal distribution is shown to improve the reproduction of extreme temperatures (minima and maxima). We also demonstrate that the frequency and duration of cold spells and heat waves are dramatically underestimated when the autocorrelation of temperature is not taken into account in the model. An adequate representation of these characteristics can be crucial depending on the field of application, and we discuss potential implications in different contexts (agriculture, forestry, hydrology, human health).

AB  - As the earth warms, populations will be faced with novel environments to which they may not be adapted. In the short term, populations can be buffered against the negative effects, or maximize the beneficial effects, of such environmental change via phenotypic plasticity and, in the longer term, via adaptive evolution. However, the extent and direction of these population-level responses will be dependent on the degree to which responses vary among the individuals within them (i.e., within population variation in plasticity), which is, itself, likely to vary among populations. Despite this, we have estimates of among-individual variation in plastic responses across multiple populations for only a few systems. This lack of data limits our ability to predict the consequences of environmental change for population and species persistence accurately. Here, we utilized a 16-yr data set from climatically distinct populations of the viviparous skinkNiveoscincus ocellatustracking over 1,200 litters from more than 600 females from each population to examine inter- and intrapopulation variability in the response of parturition date to environmental temperature. We found that these populations share a common population-mean reaction norm but differ in the degree to which reaction norms vary among individuals. These results suggest that even where populations share a common mean-level response, we cannot assume that they will be affected similarly by altered environmental conditions. If we are to assess how changing climates will impact species and populations accurately, we require estimates of how plastic responses vary both among and within populations.

AB  - One mechanism for generation of multiple antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria involves the global regulatory system marRAB. The operon, when induced, encodes for resistance to structurally and functionally unrelated antibiotics. Exposure of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to increasing levels of chloramphenicol (CHL) resulted in survival of mutants that were resistant to the inducing agent and to tetracycline (TET), nalidixic acid (NAL), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). A mutant (RU122) that lacks MarR, the transcriptional repressor of the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) operon, served as a genetic tool to study the role of MarR in growth of E. coli O157:H7. No significant difference (P>0.05) was observed in growth curves of the wild-type or the mutant under the conditions examined (rich and minimal media, acidic conditions, and temperatures from 24 to 42 C). A preconditioned mutant (indRU122; cultured for 17 h in Luria-Bertani (LB) containing chloramphenicol and then examined) exhibited greater growth under all treatments tested compared to the mutant. marCRAB of E. coli O157:H7 was sequenced and compared to other known mar sequences to determine divergence from other bacteria (Salmonella, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter).

AB  - The diapause inducement condition, cold hardiness, and flight ability in Cry1Ac-resistant (BtR) and Cry1Ac-susceptible (96S) strains of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) were compared in the laboratory. The BtR strain was derived from the 96S strain and shows 1375-fold resistance to the Cry1Ac toxin after having been selected for 52 generations. Compared with the 96S strain, the Bt-resistant strain was more likely to go into diapause under a short-photoperiod environment. At 11L : 13D, 12L : 12D and 13L : 11D photoperiods, the percentages of BtR insects entering diapause were 72.7%, 82.9% and 68.7%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the 96S strain (58.6%, 67.4% and 46.3%, respectively) under the same. conditions. The supercooling points (SCP) and freezing points (FP) were not significantly different between the BtR and 96S strains. The LT50 (50% lethal time) and LT90 (90% lethal time) of BtR pupae were also not significantly different from those of the 96S strain at -15 degrees C. The moths from both strains had similar flight ability when their larvae were fed with nontoxic control diet. However, the total flight distance of these BtR moths was 56.2 km whose larvae fed on normal diet, which was more than twice as much as for those feeding on Bt diet (26.2 km). Flight duration for these BtR moths was longer after feeding on normal diet (11.6 h) than after feeding on Bt diet (7.3 h).

AB  - The tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens (F) is thought to be a pest that migrates each year from warmer southern latitudes to colder areas where it cannot survive cold temperatures during the winter Although northwestern Mississippi is south of 40 degrees N latitude, which is recognized as the upper boundary for overwintering survival of the insect it is commonly believed that increasing abundance during the spring in this area is because of migration of moths from the south In this study we used a 10-year set of captures of tobacco budworm male moths from pheromone traps and air temperatures from the area as well as data on development of tobacco budworm in incubators at a range of constant temperatures Results indicated that moths that produced eggs before the 258(th) day of the year have time to accumulate the necessary degree days to produce the last generation of that year while moths that produced eggs between days 258 and 277 give raise to the first spring generation Moths reproductively active after day 277 will not under the hypothesis of no larval overwintering survival produce a generation the following year in northwestern Mississippi Moths reproductively active between days 80 and 124 will produce the generation observed between days 136 and 162 there is a gap between generations and this gap will separate generations all year Because we observed generations overlapping in the data from the pheromone traps there is a possibility that larval overwintering survival might explain the dynamics of the insect in this area

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity and adaptation are common traits of organisms living in highly dynamic and changing,environments. Several copepod species, especially estuarine dwelling species, have demonstrated high phenotypic plasticity and adaptability to variations in environmental conditions. Copepods play a critical role in aquatic foodwebs and their population structure is closely linked to water quality fluctuations, especially salinity and temperature. However, few studies have examined the response of population structure to environmental stress. Here, we examine the population structure, egg production and hatching success of Acartia fancetti in relation to hypersalinity (30, 40, 50 and 60) and temperature (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C). A. fancetti is a neritic species occupying a key niche in the hypersaline areas of the Coorong, South Australia. Our results show a significant influence of salinity and temperature on the population size, nauplii production, copepodites production and adults of A. fancetti. The maximum numbers of nauplii, copepodites and adults were at salinity 30 and 40, at both 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. However, substantial population sizes were also observed at salinity 50 and 60 in 15 degrees C treatments. At 20 degrees C, no individual was observed at salinity 60. This study indicates that the population of A. fancetti in the Coorong is tolerant to hypersalinity at lower temperatures, but the combined effects of haline and thermal stress significantly reduces the ability of this species to survive at higher temperatures. The distribution of A. fancetti in the Coorong is also affected by the environmental change related to anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand what factors affect the repeatability of adaptive outcomes. To better understand the role of temperature in determining the repeatability of adaptive trajectories, we evolved populations of different genotypes of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila at low and high temperatures and followed changes in growth rate over 6,500 generations. As expected, growth rate increased with a decelerating rate for all populations; however, there were differences in the patterns of evolution at the two temperatures. The growth rates of the different genotypes tended to converge as evolution proceeded at both temperatures, but this convergence was quicker and more pronounced at the higher temperature. Additionally, over the first 4,000 generations we found greater repeatability of evolution, in terms of change in growth rate, among replicates of the same genotype at the higher temperature. Finally, we found limited evidence of trade-offs in fitness between temperatures, and an asymmetry in the correlated responses, whereby evolution in a high temperature increases growth rate at the lower temperature significantly more than the reverse. These results demonstrate the importance of temperature in determining the repeatability of evolutionary trajectories for the eukaryotic microbe Tetrahymena thermophila and may provide clues to how temperature affects evolution more generally.

AB  - Author summary
   Insects often carry bacteria that live within their cells and are transmitted from the mother to the progeny. Wolbachia is one the most common of such bacteria and can strongly influence the insect biology. Its capacity to protect some hosts from viral infection is being used in the fight against mosquitoes-transmitted viruses by introducing Wolbachia in these insects. The amount of Wolbachia within the host can impact their interaction and must be well controlled. To understand this process we screened for new mutants of Wolbachia that proliferate too much in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We identified two mutants and characterized them in detail. One mutant has too many copies of a specific set of genes, confirming previous similar results. However, the other mutant Wolbachia lost those exact same genes, showing that they are particularly important in growth regulation. Moreover, we show that proliferation of different Wolbachia variants depends on temperature, and the developmental stage of the insect host. Finally, the data indicate that protection to viruses and cost of Wolbachia depend on related but different aspects of this control of growth. In summary, we show that we can screen for new mutants of Wolbachia and understand better how control of growth is genetically controlled by Wolbachia.
   Wolbachia is one of the smost prevalent bacterial endosymbionts, infecting approximately 40% of terrestrial arthropod species. Wolbachia is often a reproductive parasite but can also provide fitness benefits to its host, as, for example, protection against viral pathogens. This protective effect is currently being applied to fight arboviruses transmission by releasing Wolbachia-transinfected mosquitoes. Titre regulation is a crucial aspect of Wolbachia biology. Higher titres can lead to stronger phenotypes and fidelity of transmission but can have a higher cost to the host. Since Wolbachia is maternally transmitted, its fitness depends on host fitness, and, therefore, its cost to the host may be under selection. Understanding how Wolbachia titres are regulated and other aspects of Wolbachia biology has been hampered by the lack of genetic tools. Here we developed a forward genetic screen to identify new Wolbachia over-proliferative mutant variants. We characterized in detail two new mutants, wMelPop2 and wMelOctoless, and show that the amplification or loss of the Octomom genomic region lead to over-proliferation. These results confirm previous data and expand on the complex role of this genomic region in the control of Wolbachia proliferation. Both new mutants shorten the host lifespan and increase antiviral protection. Moreover, we show that Wolbachia proliferation rate in Drosophila melanogaster depends on the interaction between Octomom copy number, the host developmental stage, and temperature. Our analysis also suggests that the life shortening and antiviral protection phenotypes of Wolbachia are dependent on different, but related, properties of the endosymbiont; the rate of proliferation and the titres near the time of infection, respectively. We also demonstrate the feasibility of a novel and unbiased experimental approach to study Wolbachia biology, which could be further adapted to characterize other genetically intractable bacterial endosymbionts.

AB  - The optimization of geothermal exploitation model and simulation of productivity is a hot spot in the thermal industry recently. Previously, the fracture permeability was considered as a constant during the thermal exploitation. However, the fracture permeability varies constantly during the thermal exploitation, and this causes an error in the numerical simulation of geothermal productivity. Here, the experiment in evolution of the fracture permeability in granite was performed, and the equations for evolution of the permeability in major fractures, branch fractures and natural fractures were established. On this basis, the thermal-hydro-mechanical coupling geothermal model was established to investigate the effect of well profiles, conditions for evolution of fracture permeability and natural fracture development degree on geothermal exploitation capacity. The results show that when considering the evolution of fracture permeability, the vertical well model is affected after 20 years of exploitation, and the produced thermal energy in the vertical well with developed fractures is about 4% (0.4 MW) lower than in the conventional vertical well model. Under the same conditions, the difference between horizontal wells is within 1%, which can be ignored. More heat is outputted in reservoirs with developed fractures than in those without fractures.

AB  - Microgrids provide multiple benefits to end-use customers and electric utilities, including enhanced reliability and resilience, reduced operational costs, streamlined renewable generation integration, and improved energy efficiency. However, the microgrid technology's large capital cost remains a major barrier to establishing its economic viability. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a practical methodology for microgrid generation sizing. The proposed methodology uses the concept of robust optimization and a multi-criteria decision-making process, taking overall cost, emission reduction, and demand response into account as important factors in optimal generation sizing. The objective is to minimize the supply gap throughout the year, which is defined as the unmet load or required load curtailment under various load and solar generation scenarios. Numerical simulations on a real-world microgrid, ComEd's Bronzeville Community Microgrid (BCM) on Chicago's South Side, exhibit the practicality of the proposed method and its applications for electric utilities. The study proposes an optimal size of 4.8 MW considering the commercially available generator sizes for the BCM, which has a total peak load of 7 MW, 0.75 MW of PV and 0.5MW/2MWh of Battery energy storage installed.

AB  - A series of comprehensive and systematic experimental data and log data of lower Cambrian Qongzhusi Formation, from the first successful Well Jin-1 in western Sichuan Basin, were analyzed to investigate the properties of lower Cambrian organic-rich shale and to illustrate its shale gas potential, so as to investigate the factors affecting shale gas potential in overmature and ultratight shale. Trace element ratios (V/Cr and Ni/Co) and the concentrations of Cu + Zn imply the lower Cambrian shale deposited under suboxic anoxic bottom water with high primary productivity. The organic matter is enriched in Qiongzhusi Formation as sapropelic (type I) mainly, and R-o (2.65-2.97%) values indicate the organic matter is in the overmature stage. Pores are dominated by organic pores in lower organic-rich shale and by inorganic intragranular and intergranular pores in upper organic-rich shale. Generally, organic-rich shale was deposited in anoxic shelf (high ratios of V/Cr and Ni/Co) with high productivity (high concentration of Cu + Zn), and shale gas has accumulated and been preserved in the region with stable tectonic setting. Comprehensive analysis of the properties in overmature shales (Marcellus, Longmaxi, and Qiongzhusi) and their effect on shale gas shows that (a) organic matter formed a material basis for shale gas generation, (b) porosity provided the capacity for shale gas accumulation, and (c) moderately high thermal maturity (R-o up to 3%) improved the storage space through elevating porosity. This indicates that total organic carbon, porosity, and thermal maturity in overmature shales are the main factors affecting shale gas accumulation.

AB  - Nanostructured alloy powders of SmCo5+ 10 wt% Fe obtained using recycled material were studied for the first time. The SmCo(5)precursor was obtained from commercial magnets recycled by hydrogen decrepitation. The results were compared with identically processed samples obtained using virgin SmCo(5)raw material. The samples were synthesized by dry high-energy ball-milling and subsequent heat treatment. Robust soft/hard exchange coupling was observed-with large coercivity, which is essential for commercial permanent magnets. The obtained energy products for the recycled material fall between 80% and 95% of those obtained when using virgin SmCo5, depending on milling and annealing times. These results further offer viability of recycling and sustainability in production. These powders and processes are therefore candidates for the next generation of specialized and nanostructured exchange-coupled bulk industrial magnets.

AB  - We studied the importance of selection and constraint in determining the limits of adaptive radiation and the consequences of adaptive radiation in an experimental system. We propagated four replicate lines of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens derived from a single ancestral clone in 95 environments, where growth was limited by the availability of a single carbon source for 1, 000 generations. We then assayed the growth of the ancestral clone and the evolved lines in all 95 environments. Evolved lines increased their performance in almost every selection environment and invaded 70% of the novel environments as a direct response to selection. Direct responses tended to be larger in environments where growth was initially poor. Although evolved lines lost the ability to grow on about three substrates that their ancestor could readily grow on, the correlated response to selection was, on average, positive. The correlated response allowed all of our evolved populations to expand their niches and to occupy collectively the remaining novel habitats. This is inconsistent with classical theories of niche evolution. In the most extreme cases, adaptation occurred through "roundabout selection": lineages became adapted to an environment through selection in another environment but not through selection in the environment itself. Our results indicate that mutation accumulation by neutral drift was responsible for generating the majority of costs of adaptation.

AB  - The effective population size (N-e) is a central factor in determining maintenance of genetic variation. The neutral theory predicts that loss of variation depends on N-e, with less genetic drift in larger populations. We monitored genetic drift in 42 Drosophila melanogaster populations of different adult census population sizes (10, 50 or 500) using pooled RAD sequencing. In small populations, variation was lost at a substantially lower rate than expected. This observation was consistent across two ecological relevant thermal regimes, one stable and one with a stressful increase in temperature across generations. Estimated ratios between N-e and adult census size were consistently higher in small than in larger populations. The finding provides evidence for a slower than expected loss of genetic diversity and consequently a higher than expected long-term evolutionary potential in small fragmented populations. More genetic diversity was retained in areas of low recombination, suggesting that associative overdominance, driven by disfavoured homozygosity of recessive deleterious alleles, is responsible for the maintenance of genetic diversity in smaller populations. Consistent with this hypothesis, the X-chromosome, which is largely free of recessive deleterious alleles due to hemizygosity in males, fits neutral expectations even in small populations. Our experiments provide experimental answers to a range of unexpected patterns in natural populations, ranging from variable diversity on X-chromosomes and autosomes to surprisingly high levels of nucleotide diversity in small populations.

AB  - This paper outlines a new direction for fundamental heat transfer: a multidisciplinary approach (combined heat transfer and strength of materials) in the conceptual design of structures that have two functions, mechanical strength and resistance (survival) in the presence of sudden thermal attack. The two functions are considered simultaneously, from the start of conceptual design. This is unlike traditional approaches, where structures are optimized for mechanical strength alone, or for thermal resistance alone. In the first part of the paper, the profile of a beam loaded in bending is optimized by maximizing the lifetime in the presence of sudden heating. The propagation of the heat wave through the beam causes softening, because of the gradual transition from elastic behavior to thermoplastic behavior. In the second part of the paper, the subject is a beam of concrete reinforced with steel bars. It is shown that the clash between the mechanical and thermal objectives of the beam generates the shape of the beam cross-section, and the position of the steel bars in the beam cross-section. The generation of optimal architecture for maximal global performance under global constraints in freely morphing systems is constructal design. On the background of the constructal architectures that have been developed so far, the present paper outlines the first steps toward the constructal design of multiobjective (multidisciplinary) architectures.

AB  - Natural selection of organisms results in differences between populations in response to environmental conditions-that is, local adaptation. Understanding heterogeneity at this level requires identification of the different selection pressures that cause this differentiation. Tadpoles of the common frog, Rana temporaria, from northern Sweden show superior growth in warmer incubation conditions than tadpoles from the south, and vice versa in cooler conditions. A plausible explanation for this is that the thermal optimum in the northern population has been shifted by selection to correspond better with the. relatively warmer developmental conditions experienced in the north compared with the south (northern ponds are warmer because they are shallower and tend to heat more quickly following the melting of snow). To test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment in which frogs from both regions were allowed to develop in water temperatures representative of those in their natural breeding ponds and in those at the other climatic extreme. Tadpoles in the 'warm' (northern) part of the range had markedly reduced survival at low temperatures compared with those from the cooler region in the south, with a non-significant difference at relatively high temperatures. Thus, northern frogs appear to have evolved towards becoming high-temperature 'specialists', with local adaptation being upheld by hard selection on tadpole survival.

AB  - Technical viability of two small-scale electricity generation pathways based on willow short rotation coppice biomass was evaluated using a Screening Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) procedure. The system inputs included fuel and oil consumption in machine operations, fertilizer and herbicide production, transportation of willow chips biomass, and biomass-to-energy conversion. The analysis was based on net energy production, energy output-input ratio, and the related CO2 emission. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of fertilizer type and application technique, harvesting and drying techniques, energy conversion process and chips transportation distance. The results showed that key energy efficiency and environmental compatibility factors include: the choice of drying technique; fertilizer type and application technique (68.2% variation in net energy, 57.7% difference in output-input ratio, respectively), and; the type of biomass-to-energy conversion plant, which had up to 36.4% variation in net energy production, and 96.4% reduction in CO2 emission. Willow chips transportation up to distances of 38 km did not have significant impact on the net energy production and CO2 emission. Chip transportation over distances in excess of 38 km generated significant drop in energy efficiency (25.9% reduction in energy output-input ratio) which underlines the importance of transportation in the overall system productivity.

AB  - Noble scallop Chlamys nobilis is one of the most important bivalves in China. C. nobilis aquaculture is mainly carried out in coastal areas that vulnerable to high salinity fluctuations. Hyposaline conditions caused by a large volume of freshwater input from rivers in rainy seasons often leads to mass mortalities of farmed C. nobilis. Interspecific hybridization is a promising approach to improve the growth rate, survival rate and environmental adaptability of bivalves. However, it is not clear whether intraspecific hybridization can be used as a management strategy to mitigate the impact of hyposaline on farmed C. nobilis. Therefore, this study compared the effects of hyposaline on the growth rate, survival rate, total carotenoid content (TCC) and transcriptome data of intraspecific inbred and hybrid C. nobilis. The results of this study revealed that intraspecific hybridization of C. nobilis exhibited significant positive heterosis in growth rate, survival rate and adaptation to hyposaline condition. The stronger adaptation to hyposaline condition is mainly attributed to the induction of genes involved in osmoregulation, cell protection and damaged protein repair. Therefore, intraspecific hybridization is a potential management strategy to mitigate the impact of hyposaline on farmed bivalves (at least for C. nobilis).

AB  - Nanocellulose producing from wood pulp and its derivatives is a well-known and characterized industrial process. However, agro-industrial residues can also be used for this process as they have a high content of lignocellulosic portions, particularly cellulose. Usually discarded or used as animal feed their composition pose a great potential for the generation of value added products. As an alternative to wood pulp, cellulose from residues represent a great source for obtaining nanocellulose due to its wide availability and low cost. Given that many other studies have focused on generating nanocellulose out of wood pulp due to its intrinsic characteristics, such as high aspect ratio, biodegradability, and good overall mechanical properties, it was decided to characterize the processing of agro-industrial residues on last decade in this review as their composition greatly varies among plant sources, presenting influence on produced nanocrystals quality. The intrinsic properties of nanocellulose justify its utilization in many applications, including use in food, cosmetic, and material industry. This review attempts to follow through the state-of-art for crystalline nanocellulose preparation, presenting its current concerns in process and commercial viability, and finally, indicating some future perspectives on using agro-industrial residues as an environmentally-friendly alternative to wood sources.

AB  - Offspring, especially during early development, are influenced by both intrinsic properties endowed to them by their parents, extrinsic environmental factors as well as the interplay between genes and the environment. We investigated the effects of paternity (P), temperature (T), and asynchronous hatching on larval traits of cod, Gadus morhua from the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. Daily cohorts of 4 half-sib families of Atlantic larvae and 5 half-sib families of Baltic larvae were incubated and hatched at 5 temperatures (Atlantic 2.0-10.0 degrees C, Baltic 6.5-12.5 degrees C) and imaged for notochord length (L-N), yolk-sac area (A(Y)), and deformities. Larvae hatching on a given day were incubated at the same temperature and sampled at 4 days post-hatch (DPH) for growth, yolk utilization rate (YUR) and efficiency (YUE). The mean SE duration of the hatching window decreased with increasing temperature in both Atlantic (5.4 +/- 0.1 to 2.6 +/- 0.3 days from 2.0 to 10.0 degrees C) and Baltic larvae (6.2 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.6 days from 6.5 to 12.5 degrees C) and L-N increased and A(Y) decreased for every subsequent day of hatch. Deformities increased with increasing T and P x T explained 523 and 26.8% of the variance for Atlantic and Baltic larvae, respectively. In Baltic larvae, size at peak hatch tended to decrease with increasing T and P x T explained 34.6% of the variance. In Atlantic larvae, growth, YUR and YUE were influenced by T while P alone explained 26.0% of the variance in YUE and up to 66.4% of variance in morphological traits at 4 DPH. Asynchronous hatching significantly affected larval growth, YUR, and YUE with P explaining 37.1% of the variance in growth for Atlantic larvae. Temperature and asynchronous hatching interacted to produce larvae that were generally longer and had smaller A(Y) if they were incubated at colder temperatures or if they hatched at the end of the hatching period at a specific temperature. Differences in larval morphometrics among temperatures for early hatching larvae decreased or even reversed for later hatching larvae. In light of anticipated global climate change, the present study on cod provides further insight in understanding the genotype-based variability and the adaptive potential to an ecologically changing environment.

AB  - Rapid urbanisation has altered the vulnerability of urban areas to heat wave disasters. There is an urgent need to identify the factors underlying the effect of heat waves on human health and the areas that are most vulnerable to heat waves. In this study, we plan to integrate indices associated with heat wave vulnerability based on meteorological observation data, remote sensing data and point of interest (POI) data; analyse the influence of urbanisation on the urban vulnerability environment; and explore the relationship between the vulnerability environment and heat-wave-related mortality. Finally, we attempt to map the spatial distribution of high heat-wave-related mortality risk based on the results of heat wave vulnerability study and artificial society. The results reveal that 1) there are differences in the influence of urbanisation on heat wave exposure, sensitivity and adaptability; 2) the exposure and sensitivity level effects on the lower limit of health impacts and the adaptability level effects on the upper limit of the health impact from heat wave in a given study area; and 3) areas vulnerable to the effects of heat waves are not confined to the city centre, which implies that residents living in suburban areas are also vulnerable to heat waves. Finally, this study not only explores the factors contributing to the impacts of heat waves but also describes the spatial distribution of the risk of disaster-associated mortality, thereby providing direct scientific guidance that can be used by cities to address heat wave disasters in the future.

AB  - Generation of clonal zebrafish will facilitate large-scale genetic screening and help us to overcome other biological and biotechnological challenges due to their isogenecity. However, protocols for the development of clonal lines have not been optimized. Here, we sought to develop a novel method for generation of clonal zebrafish by androgenesis induced by cold shock. Androgenetic zebrafish doubled haploids (DHs) were induced by cold shock of just-fertilized eggs, and the eggs were then heat shocked to double the chromosome set. The yield rate of putative DHs relative to the total number of eggs used was 1.10% +/- 0.19%. Microsatellite genotyping of the putative DHs using 30 loci that covered all 25 linkage groups detected no heterozygous loci, confirming the homozygosity of the DHs. Thus, a clonal line was established from sperm of a DH through a second cycle of cold-shock androgenesis and heat-shock chromosome doubling, followed by genetic verification of the isogenic rate confirming the presence of identical DNA fingerprints by using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. In addition, our data provided important insights into the cytological mechanisms of cold-shock-induced androgenesis.

AB  - Soil thermal properties can influence several soil processes important for crop productivity. This study was conducted to evaluate the influence of cover crops on selected soil physical and thermal properties. The field site was set up using a randomized complete block design with two levels of cover crops (cover crops versus no cover crops). The soil thermal properties measured included thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity. The physical properties of the soil studied included bulk density, volumetric water content, total pore spaces, water-filled pore spaces, air-filled pore spaces, gas diffusion coefficient, and soil pore tortuosity factor. Soil organic carbon was also measured. The results showed that soil organic carbon was 26% higher under cover crops management compared to no cover crops management. Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity were positively correlated with soil bulk density and these properties (soil thermal conductivity and soil thermal diffusivity) were higher under no cover crops management compared with cover crops management probably due to the proximity between soil particles. The volumetric heat capacity was positively correlated with soil organic carbon, with soil organic carbon being higher under cover crops management compared with no cover crops management. Results from the current study show that cover crops can improve soil physical and thermal properties which may benefit crop productivity as corroborated via laboratory measurements.

AB  - The pretreatment of renewable resources is the first step to make them metabolically available for microorganisms for generation of value-added products by fermentation. In this research, barley husk (BH) and oat husk (OH) were used as renewable resources to study the optimization of dilute acid pretreatment conditions by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Temperature (T, 110-130 degrees C), solid-to-liquid ratio (S:L, 1:8-1:16 w/v), dilute sulfuric acid concentration (DSA, 1-5%, v/v), and pretreatment time (t, 30-90min) were selected as independent variables. Their levels were specified by one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method according to statistically significance level (p=0.05). OFAT results indicated that the independent variables for optimization of acid pretreatment conditions of the renewable resources were T (120-130 degrees C), S:L (1:8-1:12 w/v), and DSA (1-3% v/v) for BH; T (120-130 degrees C), S:L (1:8-1:12 w/v), and t (10-30min) for OH. Optimum pretreatment values were 130 degrees C, 1:8 (w/v), 1.86% (v/v), and 30min for BH and 130 degrees C, 1:8 (w/v), 1% (v/v), and 19min for OH by using Box-Behnken RSM. Under optimal conditions, fermentable sugar concentration, total phenolics, and extract yield were determined to be 76.28, 1.12g/L, and 55% for BH and 59.63g/L, 0.70g/L, and 56% for OH, respectively. Additionally, the chemical composition of hydrolysates was also evaluated in terms of maltose, glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, phenolics, 5-hydroxymthylfurfural, 2-furaldehyde (2-F), formic acid, and acetic acid. Catalytic efficiency values of sulfuric acid for BH and OH were 21.58 and 8.35g/g, respectively. Consequently, this study clearly indicates that the hydrolysates from the renewable resources can be used as feedstocks for the production of value-added products by biotechnological processes.

LA  - English
AB  - The effects of temperature on population characteristics of Artemia sinica Cai from Yanchi Saltlake, Shanxi province, China, were studied in the laboratory at a salinity of 60parts per thousand. The developmental stages and generation time were dramatically shortened with increasing water temperature between 16degreesC and 34degreesC. Hatching and survival rates decreased rapidly above 30degreesC. The optimum temperature for reproduction and population growth was 26-28degreesC. The threshold temperatures for hatching of eggs and development of larvae were 9.07degreesC and 11.00degreesC, respectively. The effective cumulative temperature for a generation (time x temperature required from hatching to death) was 458.4+/-39.6 C degree-days.
   Based on field monitoring, Yanchi Saltlake provides favorable annual conditions of 2884.1 C degree-days, which would support an estimated 6.3+/-0.5 A. sinica generations,per year. The intrinsic and finite rates of population increase were both increased with adapted water temperature. Extrapolating this data to Yanchi Saltlake, the period from the middle of May to September (second to fifth A. sinica generations) would be the most productive, with a generation time of < 42 d, a population doubling time of < 15 d, a finite rate of increase of > 1.0 d(-1), and an intrinsic rate of natural increase of > 0.04 d(-1).

AB  - The emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), native to Northeast Asia, is the most destructive invasive ash (Fraxinus spp.) pest in the United States. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of exposure of diapausing mature fourth instars (J-shaped larvae, JL) of EAB to cool temperatures, either 1.7 or 12.8 degrees C for 1-9 mo, on their post-chill development including adult emergence, longevity, and lifetime fecundity under standard rearing conditions (26 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 16:8 h L:D). In addition, we determined the effect of different stages of the larvae chilled at 12.8 degrees C for 3 mo on the subsequent post-chill development to EAB adults. Findings from the study revealed that a period (>= 2 mo) of chill at 12.8 degrees C is required for the termination of the EAB diapause. However, chill treatment of the larvae at the near zero temperature (1.7 degrees C) does not result in the post-diapause larval development to adults, regardless of the chill time (1-9 mo). In addition, our results showed that chill treatment of immature young larvae (L1-L4 prior to JL) results in little production of EAB adults, indicating that EAB diapause predominantly as JL. Findings of this study may be useful to laboratory rearing of EAB from eggs through continuous generations and help us understand the pest's voltinism resulting from the diapause and post-diapause development under different climatic conditions.

AB  - In the historiography of post-Communist nations, historical genres such as political history and social history is more often, not discussed in the classroom, allowing for a qualitatively weak background in the social sciences as well as collective memory. For the successive generations who have completed secondary education since 1989 this is proving fertile ground for "lost" generations in Central Europe and Slovakia in particular, giving a challenge to instructors who facilitate courses and discussions on this period of history and post-Cold War political and economic developments.
   Moreover, for instructors from Western Europe and North American education systems, the level of standardization of instruction typical in the secondary education level is familiar to practitioners, however it is lacking in central and Eastern Europe where textbook and education reform has been undertaken in a highly charged political atmosphere. The result has been haphazard at best with political and social history after 1968 largely ignored besides a few specific events. For instruction at the university level, undertaken by expatriate lecturers, holding class discussions on subjects such as 'shock therapy' or 'turncoats' often is a lesson on the event or person instead of the intended intellectual exploration.
   The following paper concentrates on the challenges teaching and facilitating classroom discussions by expatriate teachers in Slovakia from the period 1998-2013 on the heritage of communism to the present political, socio-cultural, and economic system.

AB  - The article deals with justification to choose optimal thermodynamic condiions to generate porous ammonium nitrate in the vortex granulators. Advantages of granules modification are justified by way of humidification and further thermal treatment. The necessity to improve technologies for porous ammonium nitrate generation is shown with aim to form meso- and macropores on the surface of the granule and inside it. The internal and surface structure of granules is studied under different thermal treatment regimes. The results of experimental research allow to define the temperature of heat transfer agent in the working area of the vortex granulator during the proper time and to implement this index to calculate heating up kinetics and granule dehydration. Specification of the heat transfer agent's temperature index lets to perform computations, determining minimum time for granule drying, in order to avoid its unintended overheating and core destruction.

AB  - Habitat use affects food intake, reproductive fitness and body temperature control in reptiles. Habitat use depends on both the characteristics of the animal and the environmental heterogeneity. In this study we investigated habitat use in a population of the South-American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus, in a cerrado (the Brazilian savanna) remnant, in south-eastern Brazil. In general, snakes appeared to be thermal generalists. However, they showed substrate temperature preferences in the rainy season, when they selected colder substrates during the day and warmer substrates at night. Individuals were predominantly active on the surface and more frequently found under bushes. Furthermore, in general, the principal component analysis results indicate that rattlesnakes are generalists regarding the microhabitat variables examined in this study. These habitat characteristics, associated with a low thermal selectivity, indicate that rattlesnakes are able to colonize deforested areas where shade occurrence and vegetation cover are similar to those in the cerrado.

AB  - The effects of cold storage temperature and exposure duration on different developmental stages of spottedwing drosophila (SWD) Drosophila suzukn (Diptera Drosophilidae) on 'Campbell Early' grapes were examined to establish a phytosamtary control method. The immature stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) of SWD were all dead after a 6-d cold treatment at 1 degrees C and 8-d cold treatment at 1.5 and 2 degrees C Probit-9 estimated a fourfold increase in cold treatment duration to achieve 99.9968% mortality, compared with the observed mortality. Efficacy tests using pupae, which were the most cold-tolerant stage, confirmed the validity of the selected temperature and exposure durations. Based on these results, 1 degrees C, which requires a shorter exposure for complete mortality, was selected for the test in conditions that mimic those of grape exportation. Six-day cold treatments at 1 degrees C produced 99.57%, mortality in different replicates, although the surviving pupae died later. Conversely, the 8- and 10-d treatments at 1 degrees C showed 100% mortality, suggesting that these treatments can provide quarantine security against infestations of SWD on exported Campbell Early grapes, although an additional experiment with an increased sample size is required for further reliable conclusion.

AB  - Various galactosylated scaffolds have been developed for hepatocyte culture because galactose ligands help maintain cell viability, facilitate the formation of multicellular spheroids and help maintain a high level of liver-specific functions. However, it is difficult to harvest the cell spheroids generated inside the three-dimensional scaffolds for their further biological analysis and applications. Here we developed a new galactosylated hydrogel scaffold which solidifies in situ upon heating to physiological temperature, but liquefies again upon cooling back to room temperature. The new scaffold is composed of poly(N-iso-propylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Because of the thermosensitivity of PNIPAM microgel, the mixed dispersions gel upon heating and liquefy upon cooling. PEG was added to reduce the shrinkage of the gels. Part of the PNIPAM microgel was replaced with a galactosylated one to provide a series of blend gels with various galactose ligand contents. HepG2 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, were encapsulated in the in situ-formed gels. As expected, the cell viability increases with increasing content of galactose ligands. In addition, compact multicellular spheroids were obtained in gels containing galactose ligands, while loose spheroids formed in gel without galactose ligands. The cells cultured in galactose-containing gels also exhibit a higher level of liver-specific functions, in terms of both albumin secretion and urea synthesis, than those cultured in gel without these ligands. The new galactosylated scaffold not only promotes the formation of hepatocyte spheroids, but also allows for their harvest. By cooling back to room temperature to liquefy the gel, the hepatocyte spheroids can be facilely harvested from the scaffold. The reversible galactosylated scaffold developed here may be used for large scale fabrication of hepatocyte spheroids. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable and biocompatible polyester which are biosynthesized from the intracellular cells of microalgae through the cultivation of organic food waste medium. Before cultivation process, food waste must undergo several pre-treatment techniques such as chemical, biological, physical or mechanical in order to solubilize complex food waste matter into simpler micro- and macronutrients in which allow bio-valorisation of microalgae and food waste compound during the cultivation process. This work reviews four microalgae genera namely Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, Spirulina, and Botryococcus, are selected as suitable species due to rapid growth rate, minimal nutrient requirement, greater adaptability and flexibility prior to lower the overall production cost and maximized the production of PHAs. This study also focuses on the different mode of cultivation for the accumulation of PHAs followed by cell wall destabilization, extraction, and purification. Nonetheless, this review provides future insights into enhancing the productivity of bioplastic derived from microalgae towards low-cost, large-scale, and higher productivity of PHAs.

AB  - We have developed methods for the laboratory culture of chaetognaths over a number of generations, and have documented growth and reproduction of the benthic arrowworm Paraspadella gotoi cultivated with different foods and temperatures. We classified growing P. gotoi into four stages based on predatory ability: non-feeding, first feeding, second feeding, and late stages. The first feeding stage was fed nauplii of Tigriopus japonicus; the second feeding stage was fed copepodites of T. japonicus or newly hatched Artemia salina nauplii. The duration of each of these stages was about 10 days at 24 degrees C. The late-stage individuals preferred adult T. japonicus. The growth rate at 24 degrees C was higher than at 17 degrees C. Development from the first feeding stage to mature individuals at first egg-laying took about 50 days at 24 degrees C and about 70 days at 17 degrees C. Survival also strongly depended on temperature being higher at 17 degrees C than 24 degrees C. At 17 degrees C, P. gotoi laid eggs four times at about 10-days intervals, and the estimated life span was 4-5 months.

AB  - Marine mesotherms are able to occupy broader thermal niches than ectotherms; however, this means they must thermoregulate according to diverse thermal conditions across the ocean. Knowledge remains limited about how differences in thermal conditions within the selected habitats affect the behavior and associated ecological traits in mesotherms. Here, we tested if a marine mesotherm, leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) generally maintain their body temperature by diving to greater depths to expose themselves to cold waters as sea surface temperature becomes warmer. Moreover, we investigate how such behavioral thermoregulation may influence their ecological traits (e.g., foraging and migration). We analyzed 49,461 dive profiles and 16,255 temperature-depth profiles from 17 leatherback turtles migrating across the North Pacific using satellite-linked data loggers. Our results showed that leatherbacks changed their dive behavior regionally, in response to sea surface temperature and potential foraging habitats. Dive type classification revealed that V-shaped, presumably gliding dives, became deeper when the surface water was warmer, likely because leatherbacks dive to deep cold waters to avoid overheating. We found five hotspots of wiggle (up-and-down undulations in the depth profile) dives that are indicative of foraging behavior, ranging from tropical to cool-temperate regions in the North Pacific. The dive patterns in potential foraging hotspots indicate that leatherbacks engage in behavioral thermoregulation in warmer regions. Such bioenergetics may affect the time available for foraging activity during migration phases. In cool-temperate foraging areas, leatherbacks are indeed able to spend more time foraging due to mesothermy. However, the trade-off between energy gain by foraging activity and additional migration cost of moving to higher latitude areas might not result in greater reproductive output for leatherbacks foraging in distant cool-temperate regions. These patterns highlight that mesothermy represents a trade-off: Leatherbacks can utilize cooler waters but must engage in additional behavioral thermoregulation (i.e., extremely deep dives) in warmer waters. Thus, mesothermy might not provide a direct fitness advantage to all individual leatherback turtles; rather, it affords a species-level fitness advantage by allowing a greater diversity of habitats to be utilized.

AB  - Protein function is a balance between activity and stability. However, the relevance of stability-activity trade-offs for protein evolution and their impact on organismal fitness have been difficult to determine. Previously, we have linked organismal survival at increasing temperatures to adaptive changes to a single protein sequence through allelic replacement of an essential gene, adenylate kinase (adk), in a thermophile. In vivo continuous evolution of the temperature-sensitive thermophile has shown that the first step toward increased organismal fitness is mutation of glutamine-199 to arginine in the mesophilic enzyme (AKsub Q199R). Here, we show that although substitution of Arg-199 did confer a modest increase in stability (0.6 kcal mol(-1)at 20 degrees C; Delta T-m = 3.0 degrees C), it is a large change in the activity profile of the enzyme that is responsible for its exceptional robustness during the earlier experimental evolution study. Kinetic studies of AKsub Q199R show that it has a strong loss of enzymatic activity (> 50%) at lower temperatures (20-45 degrees C) and a subsequent increase at elevated temperatures. The stability-activity trade-off observed for AKsub Q199R was linked to the rigidification of the overall structure through stabilization of a polypeptide loop containing Arg-199 that is part of the ATP-binding site of the enzyme. Structural analysis revealed the formation of new ionic interactions facilitated by Arg-199. Our results suggest that stability-activity trade-offs are employed readily as an evolutionary strategy during natural selection to increase organismal fitness.

AB  - Temperature tolerance is an important factor limiting the distribution of arthropod vectors, with limited information on the ability of mosquitoes to evolve different temperature levels. Under laboratorial conditions effect of thermal stress in late third instar larvae ofAedes aegyptidetermined by subjecting them to temperature regimes such as 37 degrees C, 39 degrees C, 41 degrees C, 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C, and the lethal time required to inflict mortality of 50% (LT50) and 90% (LT90) were also computed. To understand the adaptive thermotolerance in immature stages ofAe.aegypti, late third instar larvae were exposed to 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C, and these larvae were further re-exposed to temperatures 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C respectively. The median mortality of the larvae exposed to sub-lethal temperatures at 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C was 140 and 30 min respectively. While the median mortality for the larvae adapted at 39 degrees C and exposed to 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C was 230 and 50 min. All the larvae exposed at 39 degrees C were survived up to 420 min whereas at 45 degrees C within 60 min of exposure time 100% mortality was observed. Larvae pre-adapted at 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C were re-exposed to 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C and it was observed that larvae pre-adapted at 39 degrees C were more thermotolerant than larvae pre-adapted at 37 degrees C. LT(50)values were 82.9 and 213.7 min as compared to the non-adapted larvae. Similarly, the LT(50)values were 30.5 min and in larvae pre-adapted at 39 degrees C when re-exposed to 45 degrees C showed 2 fold increases in thermotolerancein comparison to the same stage larvae kept at room temperature. Larvae pre-adapted from higher temperature showed more thermotolerance than the larvae pre-adapted at lower temperature.

AB  - The regulation of body temperature (thermoregulation) and of water balance (defined here as hydroregulation) are key processes underlying ecological and evolutionary responses to climate fluctuations in wild animal populations. In terrestrial (or semiterrestrial) ectotherms, thermoregulation and hydroregulation closely interact and combined temperature and water constraints should directly influence individual performances. Although comparative physiologists traditionally investigate jointly water and temperature regulation, the ecological and evolutionary implications of these coupled processes have so far mostly been studied independently. Here, we revisit the concept of thermo-hydroregulation to address the functional integration of body temperature and water balance regulation in terrestrial ectotherms. We demonstrate how thermo-hydroregulation provides a framework to investigate functional adaptations to joint environmental variation in temperature and water availability, and potential physiological and/or behavioral conflicts between thermoregulation and hydroregulation. We extend the classical cost-benefit model of thermoregulation in ectotherms to highlight the adaptive evolution of optimal thermo-hydroregulation strategies. Critical gaps in the parameterization of this conceptual optimality model and guidelines for future empirical research are discussed. We show that studies of thermo-hydroregulation refine our mechanistic understanding of physiological and behavioral plasticity, and of the fundamental niche of the species. This is illustrated with relevant and recent examples of space use and dispersal, resource-based trade-offs, and life-history tactics in insects, amphibians, and nonavian reptiles.

AB  - High levels of gene flow among partially isolated populations can overwhelm selection and limit local adaptation. This process, known as "gene swamping," can homogenize genetic diversity among populations and reduce the capacity of a species to withstand rapid environmental change. We studied brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) distributed across seven islands in The Bahamas. We used microsatellite markers to estimate gene flow among islands and then examined the correlation between thermal performance and island temperature. The thermal optimum for sprint performance was correlated with both mean and maximum island temperature, whereas performance breadth was not correlated with any measure of temperature variation. Gene flow between islands decreased as the difference between mean island temperatures increased, even when those islands were adjacent to one another. These data suggest that phenotypic variation is the result of either (1) local genetic adaptation with selection against immigrants maintaining variation in the thermal optimum, (2) irreversible forms of adaptive plasticity such that immigrants have reduced fitness, or (3) an interaction between fixed genetic differences and plasticity. In general, the patterns of gene flow we observed suggest that local thermal environments represent important ecological filters that can mediate gene flow on relatively fine geographic scales.

AB  - Organisms can cope with stressful environments via a combination of phenotypic plasticity at the individual level and adaptation at the population level. Changes in gene expression can play an important role in both. Significant advances in our understanding of gene regulatory plasticity and evolution have come from comparative studies in the field and laboratory. Experimental evolution provides another powerful path by which to learn about how differential regulation of genes and pathways contributes to both acclimation and adaptation. Here we present results from one such study using the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. We selected one set of lines to withstand heat stress and another oxidative stress. We then compared transcriptional responses to acute heat stress of both and an unselected control to the ancestral population using a weighted gene coexpression network analysis, finding that the transcriptional response is primarily dominated by a plastic response that is shared in the ancestor and all evolved populations. In addition, we identified several modules that respond to artificial selection by (1) changing the baseline level of expression, (2) altering the magnitude of the plastic response, or (3) a combination of the two. Our findings therefore reveal that while patterns of transcriptional response can be perturbed with short bouts of intense selection, the overall ancestral structure of transcriptional plasticity is largely maintained over time.

CP  - Conference on Emerging Lithographic Technologies XI
AB  - The joint specification projected in-band EUV power requirements at the intermediate focus will rise beyond 185W 2%-bw to maintain the necessary 80-100WPH throughput for economic viability. New improvements in photon efficiency and mask illumination are needed to reduce reflections and power demand, as well as improving source spatial uniformity.
   In 2006, Starfire presented a novel approach to the EUV source-optic architecture using a high-brightness light source array for direct integration within the illumination optical system. Spatial uniformity and Kohler illumination across the entrance pupil is achieved by dividing the incident light into discrete bundles on a fly's eye mirror. These light bundles form a secondary source image plane that is projected onto the pupil of the projection optics. This configuration allows electronic adjustment of partial coherence and depth of focus for improved lithographic contrast and resolving capability. By distributing total EUV power across discrete units, thermal and particle loadings become manageable without the need for exotic materials or cooling schemes and sources of contaminating debris are reduced.
   Experimental data from a 5x5 xenon-fed microdischarge source array is presented, demonstrating repetition rate and source addressability for illumination patterning and grayscaling capability. In addition, experimental data from xenonbased sources will be presented with a suite of plasma and optical diagnostic instruments, including conversion efficiency, spectral purity and debris generation. Projections for scaling to HVM conditions will also be presented.

AB  - Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) is an important phosphate metabolite abundantly found in Mycobacterium leprae bacilli. This pathogen does not derive ATP from its host but has its own mechanism for the generation of ATP. Interestingly, this molecule as well as several antigenic proteins act as bio-markers for the detection of leprosy. One such bio-marker is the 18 kDa antigen. This 18 kDa antigen is a small heat shock protein (HSP18) whose molecular chaperone function is believed to help in the growth and survival of the pathogen. But, no evidences of interaction of ATP with HSP18 and its effect on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18 are available in the literature. Here, we report for the first time evidences of "HSP18-ATP" interaction and its consequences on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18. TNP-ATP binding experiment and surface plasmon resonance measurement showed that HSP18 interacts with ATP with a sub-micromolar binding affinity. Comparative sequence alignment between M. leprae HSP18 and alpha B-crystallin identified the sequence 49KADSLDIDIE58 of HSP18 as the Walker-B ATP binding motif. Molecular docking studies revealed that beta 4-beta 8 groove/strands as an ATP interactive region in M. leprae HSP18. ATP perturbs the tertiary structure of HSP18 mildly and makes it less susceptible towards tryptic cleavage. ATP triggers exposure of additional hydrophobic patches at the surface of HSP18 and induces more stability against chemical and thermal denaturation. In vitro aggregation and thermal inactivation assays clearly revealed that ATP enhances the chaperone function of HSP18. Our studies also revealed that the alteration in the chaperone function of HSP18 is reversible and is independent of ATP hydrolysis. As the availability and binding of ATP to HSP18 regulates its chaperone function, this functional inflection may play an important role in the survival of M. leprae in hosts.

AB  - The native lace bug, Leptoypha mutica Say (Hemiptera: Tingidae), has demonstrated potential as an insect biological control agent of invasive Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense Lour). To better evaluate its potential to establish on a new host, developmental biology on Chinese privet was studied at temperatures of 20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C, and 32 degrees C. The complete duration of development of L. mutica from egg deposition through five instars on this previously unreported host ranged from 24.4 to 57.1 d. Estimated threshold temperatures and calculated thermal unit requirements for egg development were 11.0 degrees C and 211.9 degree-days (DD); for nymphal development, 9.9 degrees C and 326.8 DD; and for complete development, 10.5 degrees C and 527.4 DD. Results of this study indicate that L. mutica will oviposit and can develop successfully on Chinese privet over a range of temperatures suggesting the potential for multiple generations to occur in a single season.

AB  - The genome of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas extremaustralis was analyzed searching for genes involved in environmental adaptability focusing on anaerobic metabolism, osmoregulation, cold adaptation, exopolysaccharide production and degradation of complex compounds. Experimental evidences demonstrated the functionality of several of these pathways, including arginine and pyruvate fermentation, alginate production and growth under cold conditions. Phylogenetic analysis along with genomic island prediction allowed the detection of genes with probable foreign origin such as those coding for acetate kinase, osmotic resistance and colanic acid biosynthesis. These findings suggest that in P. extremaustralis the horizontal transfer events and/or gene redundancy could play a key role in the survival under unfavorable conditions. Comparative genome analysis of these traits in other representative Pseudomonas species highlighted several similarities and differences with this extremophile bacterium.

AB  - Evolutionary rescue occurs when adaptation restores population growth against a lethal stressor. Here, we studied evolutionary rescue by conducting experiments with Escherichia coli at the lethal temperature of 43.0 degrees C, to determine the adaptive mutations that drive rescue and to investigate their effects on fitness and gene expression. From hundreds of populations, we observed that similar to 9% were rescued by genetic adaptations. We sequenced 26 populations and identified 29 distinct mutations. Of these populations, 21 had a mutation in the hsIVU or rpoBC operon, suggesting that mutations in either operon could drive rescue. We isolated seven strains of E. coli carrying a putative rescue mutation in either the hsIVU or rpoBCoperon to investigate the mutations' effects. The single rescue mutations increased E. coli's relative fitness by an average of 24% at 42.2 degrees C, but they decreased fitness by 3% at 37.0 degrees C, illustrating that antagonistic pleiotropy likely affected the establishment of rescue in our system. Gene expression analysis revealed only 40 genes were upregulated across all seven mutations, and these were enriched for functions in translational and flagellar production. As with previous experiments with high temperature adaptation, the rescue mutations tended to restore gene expression toward the unstressed state, but they also caused a higher proportion of novel gene expression patterns. Overall, we find that rescue is infrequent, that it is facilitated by a limited number of mutational targets, and that rescue mutations may have qualitatively different effects than mutations that arise from evolution to nonlethal stressors.

AB  - A theory for describing evolution as adaptive walks by a finite population with M walkers (M greater than or equal to 1) on an anisotropic Mt. Fuji-type fitness landscape is presented, from a thermodynamical point of view. Introducing the 'free fitness' as the sum of a fitness term and an entropy term and 'evolutionary force' as the gradient of free fitness on a fitness coordinate, we demonstrate that the behavior of these theoretical walkers is almost consistent with the thermodynamical schemes. The major conclusions are as follows: (1) an adaptive walk (=evolution) is driven by an evolutionary force in the direction in which free fitness increases; (2) the expectation of the climbing, rate obeys an equation analogous to the Einstein relation in Brownian motion; (3) the standard deviation of the climbing rate is a quantity analogous to the mean thermal energy of a particle, kT (x constant). In addition, on the interpretation that the walkers climb the landscape by absorbing 'fitness information' from the surroundings, we succeeded in quantifying the fitness information and formulating a macroscopic scheme from an informational point of view.

AB  - With the increasing global warming, climate change has affected human survival and development, which has become an important problem facing the world. Therefore, green building has become the most important development trend, which is an important measure of the corresponding sustainable development strategy. Through green building, China can implement energy conservation and emission reduction strategy, which will better deal with global warming. Green building needs multi-disciplinary technology combination, which needs to set the design goal according to the local environment, form and function. By strengthening the natural regulation of climate, green buildings can better apply the environmental climate change, which will meet the requirements of energy conservation and health. This paper mainly studies the adaptability of the subtropical marine climate green building, which can better design the building in line with energy conservation, health and function. Taking Guangzhou as an example, this paper analyzes the adaptive design of green building through examples.

AB  - Organisms living in seasonally variable environments utilize cues such as light and temperature to induce plastic responses, enabling them to exploit favorable seasons and avoid unfavorable ones. Local adapation can result in variation in seasonal responses, but the genetic basis and evolutionary history of this variation remains elusive. Many insects, including Drosophila melanogaster, are able to undergo an arrest of reproductive development (diapause) in response to unfavorable conditions. In D. melanogaster, the ability to diapause is more common in high latitude populations, where flies endure harsher winters, and in the spring, reflecting differential survivorship of overwintering populations. Using a novel hybrid swarm-based genome wide association study, we examined the genetic basis and evolutionary history of ovarian diapause. We exposed outbred females to different temperatures and day lengths, characterized ovarian development for over 2800 flies, and reconstructed their complete, phased genomes. We found that diapause, scored at two different developmental cutoffs, has modest heritability, and we identified hundreds of SNPs associated with each of the two phenotypes. Alleles associated with one of the diapause phenotypes tend to be more common at higher latitudes, but these alleles do not show predictable seasonal variation. The collective signal of many small-effect, clinally varying SNPs can plausibly explain latitudinal variation in diapause seen in North America. Alleles associated with diapause are segregating in Zambia, suggesting that variation in diapause relies on ancestral polymorphisms, and both pro- and anti-diapause alleles have experienced selection in North America. Finally, we utilized outdoor mesocosms to track diapause under natural conditions. We found that hybrid swarms reared outdoors evolved increased propensity for diapause in late fall, whereas indoor control populations experienced no such change. Our results indicate that diapause is a complex, quantitative trait with different evolutionary patterns across time and space.
   Author summary
   Animals exhibit diverse strategies to cope with unfavorable conditions in temperate, seasonally varying environments. The model fly, Drosophila melanogaster, can enter a physiological state known as diapause under winter-like conditions. Diapause is characterized by an absence of egg maturation in females and is thought to conserve energy for survival during stressful times. The ability to diapause is more common in flies from higher latitudes and in offspring from flies that have recently overwintered. Therefore, diapause has been thought to be a recent adaptation to temperate climates. We identified hundreds of genetic variants that affect diapause and found that some vary predictably across latitudes in North America. We found little signal of repeated seasonality in diapause-associated genetic variants, but our populations evolved an increased ability to diapause in the winter when they were exposed to natural conditions. Combined, our results suggest that diapause-associated variants evolve differently across space and time. We find little evidence that diapause evolved recently in temperate environments; rather, alleles associated with diapause are as common as expected in Zambia, suggesting that diapause may promote survival under stresses other than cold. Our results provide future targets for research into the genetic underpinnings of this complex, ecologically relevant trait.

AB  - Three methods of deriving weather for use in a nitrogen decision support system with a weekly time-step are described and evaluated. The simplest of these is simply the mean (M) of the three weather variables: Rainfall (R), evapotranspiration (ET) and temperature (T). To represent the variability of weather, many sets of generated data are needed but this is not possible with mean values. Two methods of generating rainfall are described: a fully stochastic simulator (FS) and a method based on partitioning the distribution into sections (SM). Temperature, T, and evapotranspiration ET are represented in both generators by sinusoidal functions. The amount of R is modelled as an empirical distribution, rain persistence as a Markov chain. All three means of deriving weather were compared directly with actual weather from the historical record and in use with the SUNDIAL DSS. The mean values of R, ET and T were reproduced satisfactorily (r > 0.99) by both FS and SM, but variability less accurately (r > 0.80 for the standard deviations of T, r > 0.97 for R and ET). The mean values of several components of the nitrogen cycle simulated with SUNDIAL were generally reproduced well for both methods of weather generation, but less accurately for mean weather. For leaching, the root mean square errors were 2.6, 2.3 and 11.4 kg/ha for FS, SM and M, respectively. The sectioning method generally gave a poor estimate of variation, which was significantly underestimated for the majority of variables, in the case of leaching by a factor of three. Where variance is important, FS is preferred; weather data generated by this method may be used with confidence for risk assessments of denitrication and crop N uptake.

AB  - Evolutionary explanations of the adaptive value of animal characteristics are often expressed in energetic terms, but unless they are accompanied by demonstrations of limited energy availability, they remain speculative. In this review, we argue that metabolic power budgeting provides easily testable mechanisms through which energetically efficient attributes could become adaptive. Given each organism's maximal aerobic (and metabolic) capacity, available metabolic power (energy use per unit time) is limited and must be partitioned between different processes. This leads to compromises among the major fitness functions of growth, locomotor activity, and reproductive investment. As examples of such conflicts, we examine the compromise among growth, reproduction, and predator avoidance in scallops, as well as the means whereby thermal limitations on oxygen uptake reflect the geographical distribution limits and associated energetic trade-offs of temperate zone and polar fishes. These examples show several means whereby the budgeting of aerobic power is implicated in the major fitness trade-offs faced by animals.

AB  - Information on various aspects of reproductive traits of female pool barbs from various stretches of Ganga River basin, India was generated in relation to climatic variability. The presumptions surrounding - minnows being the first and easily hit by climatic variability, was validated. GAM models revealed low threshold rainfall requirement (> 50 mm) within a wide temperature range (20-30 degrees C) necessary for attainment of breeding GSI (> 10.5 units). Pre-spawning fitness (K-spawn50) and size at 50% maturity (L-M(50)) benchmarked through Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were in the range 1.61-1.67 units (Fulton condition factor) and 8.6-9.0 cm respectively. Mapping of climate preferendum through LOESS smoothing hinted both low-mild rainfall (50-150 mm) and high rainfall conditions (400-700 mm) conducive for attaining pre-spawning fitness while no dependence on temperature was observed. First maturity of females was encountered at 4.7 cm within the size range 4.4-12.6 cm. The present study hinted a probable reduction (1.4-1.8 cm) in size at maturity of female pool barbs. We observed pool barbs can breed within a wide thermal regime following slightest of rainfall events. Collating this with the present rates of climatic variability, we infer negligible threat of changing climate on reproduction of Puntius sophore in near future - contrary to the existing presumptions. Owing to the easiness in attainment of pre-spawning fitness under an apparently flexible climate preferendum, 'skipped spawning' decisions while facing climatic variability also seem minimum. The recorded breeding thresholds may serve as future references while assessing climate driven changes on reproduction and evolutionary adaptations in Gangetic minnows.

AB  - The temperate-water Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, has replaced the local subtropical species Haliotis diversicolor, as the main cultured abalone species in southern China in recent years. Although the ability to tolerate high temperature has increased for Pacific abalone, summer mortality still has a serious effect on cultivation success, as the temperature in southern China is significantly higher than the temperature in natural habitats. Hybridization has been demonstrated as an effective way to improve adaptability to particular environmental conditions. In this study, we introduced green abalone, Haliotis fulgens, from North America into China and successfully conducted hybridization trials with Pacific abalone. Fertilization rate for H. discus hannai female x H. fulgens male was at an acceptable level for commercial production. The hybrids exhibited hybrid vigor for growth and survival, as well as a higher temperature tolerance, showing great potential for application in the abalone aquaculture industry in southern China. Moreover, two-step PCR methods using three primers were developed, which can be used for quick genetic identification of green abalone, Pacific abalone and their reciprocal hybrids.

AB  - With rapid growth in global demand for energy, the emission of CO2 is increasing due to the use of fossil fuels in power plants. Effective strategies are required to decrease the industrial emissions to meet the climate change target set at 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21). Carbon capture and storage have been recognized as the most useful methods to reduce the CO2 emissions while using fossil fuels in power generation. This work reviews different methods and updates of the current technologies to capture and separate CO2 generated in a thermal power plant. Carbon capture is classified in two broad categories depending on the requirement of separation of CO2 from the gases. The novel methods of oxy combustion and chemical looping combustion carbon capture have been compared with the traditional post combustion and precombustion carbon capture methods. The current state of technology and limitation of each of the processes including commonly used separation techniques for CO2 from the gas mixture are discussed in this review. Further research and investigations are suggested based on the technological maturity, economic viability, and lack of proper knowledge of the combustion system for further improvement of the capture system.

AB  - Sustainable resource management in small islands is very challenging. To address the challenges, four water and waste management strategies were proposed for a wastewater treatment plant in the Kinmen islands, Taiwan. Life cycle assessment was employed for evaluation of the environmental impacts and benefits (i.e., avoidance of impacts) associated with the resource management strategies at the plant. The results showed that the energy requirements (mainly electricity consumption) for water and sludge treatments in the wastewater treatment plant had the most remarkable impact as high as 98.6%. Significant environmental advantages could be achieved by reusing the reclaimed wastewater for agricultural applications (27.8% reduction in eutrophication potential), reusing the sludge for land applications (157% reduction in global warming potential), and generating energy from incineration of recycled sludge (impacts were neutralized). Impacts from addition of tertiary treatment for wastewater reclamation could be offset by preventing discharge of nutrients (i.e. N and P) into the environment. The reclamation also reduced the demand from groundwater pumping and associated impacts. Reuse of sludge for energy generation was more favorable than for land applications. This was mainly because eutrophication impact could not be avoided when the sludge was applied to soil (excess in nutrients), and, relatively higher reduction in global warming potential was observed for energy generation (-197 kg CO2 eq/m(3)) than for land applications (-18.8 kg CO2 eq/m(3)).

AB  - Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is a surgical procedure applied in the reconstruction of periodontal defects, where an occlusive membrane is used to prevent the fast-growing connective tissue from migrating into the defect. In this work, silk fibroin (SF) membranes were developed for periodontal guided tissue regeneration. Solutions of SF with glycerol (GLY) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) where prepared at several weight ratios up to 30%, followed by solvent casting and thermal annealing at 85 degrees C for periods of 6 and 12h to produce high flexible and stable membranes. These were characterized in terms of their morphology, physical integrity, chemical structure, mechanical and thermal properties, swelling capability and in vitro degradation behavior. The developed blended membranes exhibited high ductility, which is particular relevant considering the need for physical handling and adaptability to the defect. Moreover, the membranes were cultured with human periodontal ligament fibroblast cells (hPDLs) up to 7 days. Also, the higher hydrophilicity and consequent in vitro proteolytic degradability of these blends was superior to pure silk fibroin membranes. In particular SF/GLY blends demonstrated to support high cell adhesion and viability with an adequate hPDLs' morphology, make them excellent candidates for applications in periodontal regeneration.

AB  - The study of ecological niche evolution is fundamental for understanding how the environment influences species' geographical distributions and their adaptation to divergent environments. Here, we present a study of the ecological niche, demographic history and thermal performance (locomotor activity, developmental time and fertility/viability) of the temperate species Drosophila americana and its two chromosomal forms. Temperature is the environmental factor that contributes most to the species' and chromosomal forms' ecological niches, although precipitation is also important in the model of the southern populations. The past distribution model of the species predicts a drastic reduction in the suitable area for the distribution of the species during the last glacial maximum (LGM), suggesting a strong bottleneck. However, DNA analyses did not detect a bottleneck signature during the LGM. These contrasting results could indicate that D. americana niche preference evolves with environmental change, and thus, there is no evidence to support niche conservatism in this species. Thermal performance experiments show no difference in the locomotor activity across a temperature range of 15 to 38 C between flies from the north and the south of its distribution. However, we found significant differences in developmental time and fertility/viability between the two chromosomal forms at the model's optimal temperatures for the two forms. However, results do not indicate that they perform better for the traits studied here in their respective optimal niche temperatures. This suggests that behaviour plays an important role in thermoregulation, supporting the capacity of this species to adapt to different climatic conditions across its latitudinal distribution.

AB  - A central challenge in global change research is the projection of the future behavior of a system based upon past observations. Tree-ring data have been used increasingly over the last decade to project tree growth and forest ecosystem vulnerability under future climate conditions. But how can the response of tree growth to past climate variation predict the future, when the future does not look like the past? Space-for-time substitution (SFTS) is one way to overcome the problem of extrapolation: the response at a given location in a warmer future is assumed to follow the response at a warmer location today. Here we evaluated an SFTS approach to projecting future growth of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), a species that occupies an exceptionally large environmental space in North America. We fit a hierarchical mixed-effects model to capture ring-width variability in response to spatial and temporal variation in climate. We found opposing gradients for productivity and climate sensitivity with highest growth rates and weakest response to interannual climate variation in the mesic coastal part of Douglas-fir's range; narrower rings and stronger climate sensitivity occurred across the semi-arid interior. Ring-width response to spatial versus temporal temperature variation was opposite in sign, suggesting that spatial variation in productivity, caused by local adaptation and other slow processes, cannot be used to anticipate changes in productivity caused by rapid climate change. We thus substituted only climate sensitivities when projecting future tree growth. Growth declines were projected across much of Douglas-fir's distribution, with largest relative decreases in the semiarid U.S. Interior West and smallest in the mesic Pacific Northwest. We further highlight the strengths of mixed-effects modeling for reviving a conceptual cornerstone of dendroecology, Cook's 1987 aggregate growth model, and the great potential to use tree-ring networks and results as a calibration target for next-generation vegetation models.

AB  - Population bottlenecks leading to a drastic reduction of the population size are common in the evolutionary dynamics of natural populations; their occurrence is known to have implications for genome evolution due to genetic drift, the consequent reduction in genetic diversity, and the rate of adaptation. Nevertheless, an empirical characterization of the effect of population bottleneck sizeon evolutionary dynamics of bacteria is currently lacking. In this study, we show that selective conditions have a stronger effect on the evolutionary history of bacteria in comparison to population bottlenecks. We evolved Escherichia coli populations under three different population bottleneck sizes (small, medium, and large) in two temperature regimes (37 degrees C and 20 degrees C). We find a high genetic diversity in the large in comparison to the small bottleneck size. Nonetheless, the cold temperature led to reduced genetic diversity regardless the bottleneck size; hence, the temperature has a stronger effect on the genetic diversity in comparison to the bottleneck size. A comparison of the fitness gain among the evolved populations reveals a similar pattern where the temperature has a significant effect on the fitness. Our study demonstrates that population bottlenecks are an important determinant of bacterial evolvability; their consequences depend on the selective conditions and are best understood via their effect on the standing genetic variation.

AB  - Enteric pathogens are constantly exposed to stressful conditions in their natural habitat in the host and even more in the extra-host environment, including food processing.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of selected environmental stress factors: temperature shift, starvation and atmospheric oxygen concentration on culturability/viability of two Campylobacter jejuni isolates. Additionally, after stress exposure, in an in vitro cell culture model using Caco-2 cells, the adhesion, invasion and intracellular survival of C. jejuni were studied.
   Nutrient insufficiency was the most powerful stress factor which significantly affected C. jejuni culturability and viability, as well as, adhesion and invasion properties. Temperature elevation induced a transient growth arrest, and temporary loss of pathogenic potential as indicated by impaired adhesion and invasion efficiency of C. jejuni. However, bacteria recovered within 24-48 h inside the Caco-2 cells. Oxidative stress neither affected C. jejuni growth nor reduced the binding and invasion into Caco-2 cells. Only 5 h oxygen exposure increased the invasion capability and intraepithelial survival of the clinical isolate.
   Modulation of C. jejuni virulence in response to environmental stress factors may have further implications in the pathogenesis of campylobacteriosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biogas plants enable power to be generated in a flexible way so that variable, renewable energy sources can be integrated into the energy system. In Germany, the Renewable Energy Sources Act promotes flexible power generation in biogas plants. Two existing biogas plants in flexible operation were analyzed with respect to economic viability and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to assess the feasibility of flexible operation. To do this, a biogas technology simulation model was developed to reproduce the technical design of both biogas plants and to link this design with twelve flexibilization scenarios. The evaluation of the economic viability is based on a discounting method of investment appraisal. For assessing the level of GHG emissions, the life cycle assessment method has been applied. The results show that the profitability of flexibilization is contingent upon premium payments promoting flexibility and direct sales resulting from a higher electrical efficiency of new or additionally installed combined heat and power units. Overall, with respect to profitability, the results of the flexible power generation scenarios are dependent upon the properties of the technical plant, such as its power generation and gas storage capacities. Relative GHG emissions from flexible biogas plants show significantly lower values than for referenced fossil gas-steam power stations. Among the various scenarios, the results reveal that the level of GHG emissions especially depends on the number of operating hours of the additional combined heat and power unit(s). The results of the analyzed biogas plants showed no direct correlation between GHG emissions and the economic benefits. Overall, a flexible power generation of biogas plants may improve the economic viability as well as result in lower GHG emissions in comparison with a conventional base load operation.

AB  - Achieving optimal body temperature maximizes animal fitness. Since ambient temperature may limit ectotherm thermal performance, it can be constrained in too cold or hot environments. In this sense, elevational gradients encompass contrasting thermal environments. In thermally pauperized elevations, ectotherms may either show adaptations or suboptimal body temperatures. Also, reproductive condition may affect thermal needs. Herein, we examined different thermal ecology and physiology capabilities of the lizard Psammodromus algirus along a 2200-m elevational gradient. We measured field (T-b) and laboratory-preferred (T-pref) body temperatures of lizards with different reproductive conditions, as well as ambient (T-a) and copper-model operative temperature (T-e), which we used to determine thermal quality of the habitat (d(e)), accuracy (d(b)), and effectiveness of thermoregulation (d(e)-d(b)) indexes. We detected no T-b trend in elevation, while T-a constrained T-b only at high elevations. Moreover, while T-a decreased more than 7 A degrees C with elevation, T-pref dropped only 0.6 A degrees C, although significantly. Notably, low-elevation lizards faced excess temperature (T-e > T-pref). Notably, d(e) was best at middle elevations, followed by high elevations, and poorest at low elevations. Nonetheless, regarding microhabitat, high-elevation d(e) was more suitable in sun-exposed microhabitats, which may increase exposition to predators, and at midday, which may limit daily activity. As for gender, d(b) and d(e)-d(b) were better in females than in males. In conclusion, P. algirus seems capable to face a wide thermal range, which probably contributes to its extensive corology and makes it adaptable to climate changes.

AB  - Parental care is predicted to evolve to mitigate harsh environments, thus adaptive plasticity of care may be an important response to our climate crisis. In biparental species, fitness costs may be reduced by resolving conflict and enhancing cooperation among partners. We investigated this prediction with the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis, by exposing them to contrasting benign and harsh thermal environments. Despite measurable fitness costs under the harsh environment, sexual conflict persisted in the form of sex-specific social plasticity. That is, females provided equivalent care with or without males, whereas males with partners deserted earlier and reduced provisioning effort. The interaction of social condition and thermal environment did not explain variation in individual behavior, failing to support a temperature-mediated shift from conflict to cooperation. Examining selection gradients and splines on cumulative care revealed a likely explanation for these patterns. Contrary to predictions, increased care did not enhance offspring performance under stress. Rather, different components of care were under different selection regimes, with optimization constrained due to lack of coordination between parents. We suggest that the potential for parenting to ameliorate the effects of our climate crisis may depend on the sex-specific evolutionary drivers of parental care, and that this may be best reflected in components of care.

AB  - Larval and juvenile stages of many fishes require nursery habitats that provide optimal conditions for growth. Loss or degradation of these habitats limits recruitment, causing population and species declines. Least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis), an endemic cyprinid in the Bonneville Basin, is currently restricted to a few spring complexes in Utah. This species utilizes the warm shallow spring margins as spawning and rearing habitat throughout the summer. This study was conducted to determine effects of temperature on survival and growth of age-0 least chub to understand the importance of temperature in selection of spring margins as rearing habitat. Age-0 least chub were exposed to 5 temperatures (14 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 27 degrees C) for 112 days. Growth rates varied significantly with temperature except at 17 degrees C and 27 degrees C, and growth rates were highest at 21 degrees C (P < 0.001). Maximum growth rate for age-0 least chub, estimated from a 2nd-order polynomial regression, would occur at 22.3 degrees C. These thermal requirements indicate the importance of warm rearing habitats in producing strong year classes and viable populations. However, warm spring margins also enable western mosquitofish, a nonnative competitor and predator of least chub, to thrive in these spring habitats. Broad thermal limits of the least chub suggest that it could persist at cooler temperatures, which would reduce the viability of western mosquitofish populations.

CP  - IEEE 34th International Telecommunications Energy Conference (INTELEC)
AB  - Northwestel is a Canadian based telecommunication company operating over 100 "prime-power" systems supporting a microwave radio and fiber optic telecommunication network spanning Canada's North, encompassing some of the most rugged and sparsely populated geography on earth.
   The operation and maintenance (O&M) of the network involves significant expense due to its remoteness. Access to approx 40% of the sites for quarterly maintenance and fuel delivery is via helicopter, which is very costly. Small scale 10-15 kW diesel generators along with battery storage, is the system of choice for providing "off grid" power requirements. This arrangement has supplied the remote site energy needs for many years, while assuring an incredibly high level of reliability.
   Northwestel has incrementally reduced its O&M costs at remote sites by increasing system efficiencies. However, decreasing availability of new system efficiencies combined with aging infrastructure has prompted Northwestel to examine a broader range of technology options for the power and heat production.
   In partnership with the Cold Climate Innovation Center (CCIC), a division of the Yukon Research Center, Northwestel is investigating alternative methods for power generation. The Stirling engine is a promising and maturing technology, and is being considered for remote site energy/heat requirements.

AB  - Most capture technologies, today, are associated with large energy penalties, thus decreasing their economic viability. Efficiency is one of the most important feature when designing and selecting power plants with CO2 capture. Oxygen mixed conducting membranes (OMCM) that separate oxygen from air can be used to develop oxy-combustion concepts to capture carbon dioxide with a small energy penalty. This high temperature membrane is combined with two heat exchangers (a low temperature and a high temperature one) on either end of the membrane and a combustor to form a MCM reactor that can replace the combustion chamber in a traditional gas turbine. The MCM reactor is integrated in five power cycles to provide flexibility, both in the extent of carbon capture and in different process schemes such as polygeneration. Thermodynamic evaluations for five concepts utilizing the MCM technology have been presented. The modeling results show that these concepts offer efficiencies in the range 49-55% including CO2 compression to 110 bar, and 85-100% CO2 capture. These concepts have the highest efficiencies of all previously published results for large-scale power cycles using natural gas as fuel. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Ocean warming represents the greatest threat to the persistence of reef ecosystems. Most coral populations are projected to experience temperatures above their current bleaching thresholds annually by 2050. Adaptation to higher temperatures is necessary if corals are to persist in a warming future. While many aspects of heat stress have been well studied, few data are available for predicting the capacity for adaptive cross-generational responses in corals. Consistent sets of heat tolerant genomic markers that reliably predict thermal tolerance have yet to be identified. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the heritability and genetic variation associated with heat tolerance in Platygyra daedalea from the Great Barrier Reef. We tracked the survival of ten quantitative genetic crosses of larvae produced form six parental colonies in a heat tolerance selection experiment. We also identified allelic shifts in heat-selected (35 degrees C) survivors compared with paired, non-selected controls (27 degrees C). The narrow-sense heritability of survival under heat stress was 0.66 and a total of 1,069 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with different survival probabilities. While 148 SNPs were shared between several experimental crosses, no common SNPs were identified for all crosses, which suggests that specific combinations of many markers are responsible for heat tolerance. However, we found two regions that overlap with previously identified loci associated with heat tolerance in Persian Gulf populations of P. daedalea, which reinforces the importance of these markers for heat tolerance. These results illustrate the importance of high heritability and the complexity of the genomic architecture underpinning host heat tolerance. These findings suggest that this P. daedalea population has the genetic prerequisites for adaptation to increasing temperatures. This study also provides knowledge for the development of high throughput genomic tools which may screen for variation within and across populations to enhance adaptation through assisted gene flow and assisted migration.

AB  - The increases in a country's energy capacity are related to its gross domestic product (GDP). In Brazil, increases in income and the consumption of goods and services have led to an increase in the generation of solid waste (SW), which is sent to landfills as a method of treatment and final disposal. The purpose of this study was to facilitate an increase in energy generation from renewable resources, specifically from landfills via thermal biogas plants, and the research was divided into two phases. The first phase involved the assessment of the potential population size contributing to the landfill, which could result in the installation of a financially viable enterprise to generate electricity in Brazil. Next, an estimate of the costs associated with the generation and collection of solid waste in Brazil was predicted by GDP prognoses, the latter being in accordance with the National Energy Balance (Balanco Energetico Nacional - BEN) plan created by the Mines and Energy Ministry of Brazil (Ministerio de Minas e Energia do Brasil - MME). The net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) of each enterprise scenario was used in the first stage to assess the plan's financial viability. In the second stage, estimation curves such as logistics, decreasing rate of growth, and logarithmic curves were used to establish relationships between the generation scenarios and the projected collection of SW and projected GDP. Thus, a range of possible landfill biogas/methane generation values and installed energy capacities were created, considering the extreme maximum and minimum values. These values were related to the energy sources from residual fuels reported by BEN. The results demonstrated that such values still represented a small percentage (0.00020% in 2010 and 0.44496-0.81042% in 2030) of the projected energy generation from residual fuels. Thus, an urgent need was identified to formulate policies that would encourage landfills as a source of renewable energy, broadening the number of financially viable initiatives for energy generation from landfill biogas for populations of fewer than 200,000 inhabitants.

AB  - The effects of two bacterial endosymbionts, designated PASS and PAR, were evaluated on the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera:Aphididae), in which they occur facultatively, and on the blue alfalfa aphid, A. kondoi Shinji, in which these bacteria have not been found in natural populations. Subclones of pea aphids and blue alfalfa aphids, derived from parent aphid clones that did not contain PASS or PAR, were infected with one or both bacteria, generating PASS- and/or PAR-positive subclones with minimal genetic differences from the parent clones. Under laboratory conditions at 20 degrees C, PAR consistently reduced the fecundity (by between 19 and 60%) of subclones derived from three different parent pea aphid clones on bur clover, Medicago hispida Gaertn. PAR had intermediate effects on pea aphids reared on sweet pea, Lathyrus odoratus L., and had no significant effect on pea aphids on alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. The effect of PASS was either neutral or negative, depending on parent clone as well as host plant. Also at 20 degrees C, PASS reduced fecundity (70-77%) and longevity (40-48%), and increased the age of first reproduction (by up to 1.5 days) of blue alfalfa aphid reared on alfalfa and clover. PAR had a less dramatic effect (e.g., 30-39% reduction in fecundity) on these traits of blue alfalfa aphid. In contrast, PAR and PASS increased the fitness of pea aphid subclones of one parent clone reared for three generations at 25 degrees C on each of the three test plants. Without facultative bacteria, fecundity of the parent clone was reduced to a mean total of < 6 offspring per adult at this elevated temperature, but with PASS or PAR, mean total fecundity of its subclones was > 35. However, this ameliorative effect of facultative bacteria at 25 degrees C was not found for two other sets of parent clones and their derived subclones. Alate production in pea aphids was significantly increased in large populations of two PASS- and PAR-positive subclones relative to their parent clones. Attempts to transmit PASS or PAR horizontally, i.e., from aphid to aphid via feeding on host plants (bur clover), were unsuccessful.

AB  - Studying population-by-environment interactions (PEIs) at species range margins offers the opportunity to characterize the responses of populations facing an extreme regime of selection, as expected due to global change. Nevertheless, the importance of these marginal populations as putative reservoirs of adaptive genetic variation has scarcely been considered in conservation biology. This is particularly true in marine ecosystems for which the deep refugia hypothesis proposes that disturbed shallow and marginal populations of a given species can be replenished by mesophotic ones. This hypothesis therefore assumes that identical PEIs exist between populations, neglecting the potential for adaptation at species range margins. Here, we combine reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments with population genetics analyses to decipher the PEIs in the red coral, Corallium rubrum. Our analyses reveal partially contrasting PEIs between shallow and mesophotic populations separated by approximately one hundred meters, suggesting that red coral populations may potentially be locally adapted to their environment. Based on the effective population size and connectivity analyses, we posit that genetic drift may be more important than gene flow in the adaptation of the red coral. We further investigate how adaptive divergence could impact population viability in the context of warming and demonstrate differential phenotypic buffering capacities against thermal stress. Our study questions the relevance of the deep refugia hypothesis and highlights the conservation value of marginal populations as a putative reservoir of adaptive genetic polymorphism.

AB  - Longevity of a species is a multifactorial quantitative trait influenced by genetic background, sex, age and environment of the organism. Extended longevity phenotypes (ELP) from experimental evolution in the laboratory can be used as model systems to investigate the mechanisms underlying aging and senescence. ELPs of Drosophila are correlated with various life history attributes such as resistance to environmental stressors (starvation, desiccation, cold and paraquat), developmental time, biochemical defenses, etc. The association between oxidative stress resistance and longevity is not clear and ELPs offer an opportunity to examine the role of oxidative stress resistance in longevity. Here, we have investigated the hypothesis that enhanced oxidative stress resistance and elevated antioxidant defense system play a positive role in longevity using an ELP of Drosophila melanogaster. An ELP of D. melanogaster isolated and characterized in our laboratory through artificial selection (inbred laboratory strain of Oregon K) is employed in this study. Our ELP, named as long lifespan (LLS) flies, shows marked extension in lifespan when compared to the progenitor population (normal lifespan, NLS) and makes a suitable model to study the role of mitochondrial genome in longevity because of its least heterogeneity. In this study, sensitivity to ethanol with age was employed as a measure of resistance to oxidative stress in NLS and LLS flies. Effect of age and oxidative stress on longevity was examined by employing NLS and LLS flies of different age groups against ethanol-induced oxidative stress. Results show that the lower mortality against ethanol was associated with enhanced oxidative stress resistance, higher antioxidant defenses, lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, enhanced alcohol dehydrogenase activity and better locomotor ability attributes of LLS flies. In addition, age-related changes like locomotor impairments, decreased antioxidant defenses, higher ROS levels and sensitivity to oxidative stress were delayed in LLS flies when compared to NLS. Our study supports the hypothesis that higher oxidative stress resistance and enhanced antioxidant defenses are significant factors in extending longevity.

AB  - To understand why organisms function the way that they do, we must understand how evolution shapes physiology. This requires knowledge of how selection acts on physiological traits in nature. Selection studies in the wild allow us to determine how variation in physiology causes variation in fitness, revealing how evolution molds physiology over evolutionary time. Manipulating phenotypes experimentally in a selection study shifts the distribution of trait variation in a population to better explore potential constraints and the adaptive value of physiological traits. There is a large database of selection studies in the wild on a variety of traits, but very few of those are physiological traits. Nevertheless, data available so far suggest that physiological traits, including metabolic rate, thermal physiology, whole-organism performance, and hormone levels, are commonly subjected to directional selection in nature, with stabilizing and disruptive selection less common than predicted if physiological traits are optimized to an environment. Selection studies on manipulated phenotypes, including circulating testosterone and glucocorticoid levels, reinforce this notion, but reveal that trade-offs between survival and reproduction or correlational selection can constrain the evolution of physiology. More studies of selection on physiological traits in nature that quantify multiple traits are necessary to better determine the manner in which physiological traits evolve and whether different types of traits (dynamic performance vs. regulatory) evolve differently.

AB  - An unacceptable proportion of stallion sperm do not survive the freeze-thaw process. The hypothesis of this study was that adding cholesterol to a stallion semen extender would stabilise the sperm membrane, resulting in an improved post-thaw semen quality in terms of increased sperm viability, membrane integrity and fluidity, and reduced oxidative stress. Semen was collected from three stallions and diluted in four extenders: TALP; TALP + 0.75 mg methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-cholesterol (M beta CD)/mL (M beta CD0.75); TALP + 1.5 mg M beta CD-cholesterol/mL(M beta CD1.5); and Equipro. Following 15 min incubation, samples were centrifuged and diluted to 100 x 10(6) sperm/mL, frozen in 0.5 mL straws and stored in liquid nitrogen. Sperm from each treatment was assessed for progressive linear motility (PLM) and acceptable membrane integrity under hypotonic conditions on a phase contrast microscope at 1000x while viability, membrane fluidity and superoxide generation were assessed by flow cytometry. The M beta CD1.5 and M beta CD0.75 treatments had a greater proportion of viable sperm than the TALP treatment (P<0.01). There was no effect of treatment on PLM or membrane integrity. The M beta CD1.5 treatment had a greater proportion of viable sperm positive for membrane fluidity than the TALP treatment (P<0.05). The M beta CD1.5 and M beta CD0.75 treatments had a lesser proportion of viable sperm positive for superoxide generation than the TALP treatment (P<0.001). This study has demonstrated that adding cholesterol to stallion sperm prior to cryopreservation increases post-thaw viability, with these viable sperm being of better quality in terms of increased membrane fluidity and reduced superoxide generation.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The Italian semi-intensive (ISISF) technology is widely used for rearing the Mediterranean snail, Cornu aspersum. It relies on protecting overwintering specimens with Lutrasil frost cloth (LFC). This approach yielded elevated mortalities in Romanian snail farms. We aimed to develop a simple and effective system for protecting overwintering C. aspersum adults in colder climates. This three-year, three-phase experiment investigated selected behavioral aspects and thermal protection efficiency of different protective structures. Mature gastropods in preparation for hibernation exhibited a significant preference for wood and ridge-tile micro shelters. Soil texture significantly influenced the burrowing behavior, but not the burrowing depth. The structure soil/LFC/straw/10-cm air cushion/high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-the "sandwich" system-was selected to be used as a protective system. Under farm conditions, adult snails tended to hibernate clustered together, attached to the lower surface of micro shelters. The "sandwich" system coupled with using ridge-tile/wood micro shelters resulted in significantly higher survival thanthe sole use of LFC. Predator occurrence appeared to exert a minor effect on snail survival. These data render the "sandwich" system a potential solution for overwintering C. aspersum breeders in colder climates.
   (1) Background: Hibernation in pens covered with LFC was associated with high mortality of C. aspersum snails in Romanian snail farms. This three-year study aimed to develop a simple, but effective system for protecting breeders in colder climates. (2) Methods: The first phase investigated the (pre)hibernal burrowing behavior and the overwintering habitat choice. Protective structures based on straw, LFC, and/or HDPE were tested at pilot level (no snails). The most suitable system was applied under farm conditions. (3) Results: Wood and ridge-tile micro shelters were significantly preferred to corrugated iron micro shelters. Burrowing specimens acted as shallow-burrowers, and this behaviorwas significantly more common for looser soils. All pilot systems displayed significantly higher thermal protection efficiency compared to the sole use of LFC. The balance between straw moistening and thermal protection favored using structure soil/LFC/straw/10-cm air cushion/HDPE. Its use yielded significantly higher survival compared to the sole use of LFC. Most hibernating snails clustered together in large groups, attached on the lower surface of micro shelters. Predator occurrence appeared to marginally affect overwintering survival. (4) Conclusions: The "sandwich" system could be an effective solution for overwintering mature C. aspersum snails in colder climates.

TI  - FAILURE OF STEEL COLUMNS IN FIRE
T2  - FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Results of an analytical study of the performance of geometrically perfect steel columns under fire conditions are presented.  The analysis was based on the finite strip method and includes non-linear material characteristics as functions of temperature.  Results obtained using different models of such functions are compared, demonstrating very significant variation in predicted behaviour.  The influence of slenderness ratio was studied and shown to be a major factor controlling the failure temperature, whilst the effect of residual stress levels on column failure is little different from that at ambient temperature.  Local buckling behaviour was also investigated.  The results suggest that this mode of failure may be rather more critical for columns in fire than at ambient temperature.  The effect of partial protection provided by blocking-in the column web was investigated.  This shows that although there is relatively little improvement in failure temperature, significantly longer survival times are achieved using this form of construction.  Although the study is not comprehensive, some useful indications are provided for future generation of practical design rules.

AB  - Berkeley Lab has been developing the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model for several years. Given load curves for energy services requirements in a building microgrid (mu center dot grid), fuel costs and other economic inputs, and a menu of available technologies, the model finds the optimum equipment fleet and operating schedule. This capability is being applied using a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. The evolution of this approach is demonstrated by description of four past and present projects: (1) a public access web site focused on solar photovoltaic generation and battery viability for large non-residential customers; (2) a building CO2 emissions reduction operations problem for a university dining hall with potential investments considered; (3) a battery and rolling operating schedule problem for a large county jail; and (4) the direct control of the solar-assisted heating ventilation and air conditioning system of a university building by providing optimised daily schedules that are automatically implemented in the building's energy management and control system. Together these examples show that optimisation of building grid design and operation can be effectively achieved using SaaS.

AB  - Background: Phenotypic plasticity operates across generations, when the parental environment affects phenotypic expression in the offspring. Recent studies in invertebrates have reported transgenerational plasticity in phenotypic responses of offspring when the mothers had been previously exposed to either live or heat-killed pathogens. Understanding whether this plasticity is adaptive requires a factorial design in which both mothers and their offspring are subjected to either the pathogen challenge or a control, in experimentally matched and mismatched combinations. Most prior studies exploring the capacity for pathogen-mediated transgenerational plasticity have, however, failed to adopt such a design. Furthermore, it is currently poorly understood whether the magnitude or direction of pathogen-mediated transgenerational responses will be sensitive to environmental heterogeneity. Here, we explored the transgenerational consequences of a dual pathogen and stress challenge administered in the maternal generation in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Prospective mothers were assigned to a non-infectious pathogen treatment consisting of an injection with heat-killed bacteria or a procedural control, and a stress treatment consisting of sleep deprivation or control. Their daughters and sons were similarly assigned to the same pathogen treatment, prior to measurement of their reproductive success.
   Results: We observed transgenerational interactions involving pathogen treatments of mothers and their offspring, on the reproductive success of daughters but not sons. These interactions were unaffected by sleep deprivation.
   Conclusions: The direction of the transgenerational effects was not consistent with that predicted under a scenario of adaptive transgenerational plasticity. Instead, they were indicative of expectations based on terminal investment.

AB  - Sampling was conducted from biochemical reaction tanks of six municipal wastewater treatment plants in the Yangtze River and Zhujiang deltas and the Jing-Jin-Ji region to assess their morphology, level, and composition. Morphological observations suggested that particles were scattered amorphously with C, O, and Si as the major elements. Bioaerosols are composed of spatially varying levels of microorganisms and chemicals. As the sampling height increased, the level of the components in the bioaerosols decreased. Wastewater in the biochemical reaction tanks was identified as an important source of bioaerosols using SourceTracker analysis. The aerosolization of film drops produced by bursting of bubbles was the main reason for the generation of bioaerosols. Increasing the aeration rate of water may promote bioaerosol generation. Relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and solar illumination influenced the survival of bioaerosols. Large particle sedimentation and wind diffusion significantly decreased the atmospheric aerosol concentration. When the sampling point height increased from 0.1 m to 3.0 m, the concentrations of the microorganisms and total suspended particles decreased by 23.71% and 38.74%, respectively. Considerable attention should be paid to the control of total suspended particles and microorganisms in bioaerosols.

AB  - Maintaining an adaptive seasonality, with life cycle events occurring at appropriate times of year and in synchrony with cohorts and ephemeral resources, is a basic ecological requisite for many cold-blooded organisms. There are many mechanisms for synchronizing developmental milestones, such as egg laying (oviposition), egg hatching, cocoon opening, and the emergence of adults. These are often irreversible, specific to particular life stages, and include diapause, an altered physiological state which can be reversed by some synchronizing environmental cue (e.g. photoperiod). However, many successful organisms display none of these mechanisms for maintaining adaptive seasonality. In this paper, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of yearly oviposition dates and temperatures to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Of particular interest biologically are life cycles which are timed to complete in exactly 1 year, or univoltine cycles. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for many temperate species, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. Adaptive seasonality may therefore break down with little warning with constantly increasing or decreasing temperature change, as in scenarios for global warming. These ideas are illustrated and explored in the context of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) occurring in the marginal thermal habitat of central Idaho's Rocky Mountains. Applications of these techniques have not been widely explored by the applied math community, but are likely to provide great insight into the response of biological systems to climate change.

AB  - Inertial fusion energy (IFE) targets injected into fusion chambers must withstand the demanding acceleration forces and the intense thermal environment of the fusion chamber. For indirect targets, the ultrathin capsule support membrane is the target component that is most sensitive to acceleration forces. Maintaining the deuterium-tritium (DT) temperature, to prevent a significant increase in DT vapor pressure, is the most critical thermal requirement. Secondarily, material selection of the high-temperature laser entrance hole window is required. This paper briefly describes how these requirements are satisfied for a laser-driven IFE plant design.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity, the property by which living organisms express different phenotypes depending on environmental conditions, can impact their response to environmental perturbation, including that resulting from climate change. When exposed to altered environmental conditions, phenotypic plasticity might help or might hinder both immediate survival and future adaptation. Because climate change will cause more than a global rise in mean temperatures, it is valuable to consider the combined effects of temperature and other environmental variables on trait expression (thermal plasticity), as well as trait evolution (thermal adaptation). In this review, we focus primarily on thermal developmental plasticity in insects. We discuss the genomics of thermal plasticity and its relationship to thermal adaptation and thermal tolerance, and to climate change and multifactorial environments.

AB  - The fossorial life-history emerged as a response to hostile environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures and dryness. It evolved independently in different lineages of amphibians, which are particularly vulnerable to dehydration and require a continuous level of humidity because of their permeable skin. For the first time, we test the hypothesis that amphibians are able to adapt their fossorial behaviour to substrate humidity, using the Pacific homed frogs (Ceratophrys stolzmanni) from the Ecuadorian dry forest as a model. When exposed to dry substrate, the animals burrowed much deeper than the ones in wet soil. The capacity to excavate was particularly high in this species: frogs from the dry treatment could be found at more than 1-m depth after just a few hours. Our results reveal a conditional strategy that contributes to explain the persistence of amphibians in dry environments.

AB  - The capacity of Telenomus remus to parasitize eggs of Anticarsia gemmatalis, compared with its natural host, Spodoptera frugiperda, was evaluated under different temperatures. The parasitoid T. remus was reared at 25 +/- 1 degrees C for a single generation on both hosts. After reaching the adult stage, they were allowed to parasitize both hosts to study parasitoid biology and parasitism capacity at temperatures between 19 degrees C and 37 +/- 1 degrees C. Egg-to-adult developmental time was similar on both hosts. The number of A. gemmatalis eggs parasitized was lower than that of S. frugiperda eggs at all temperatures. Parental female longevity of parasitoids was greater on A. gemmatalis eggs. This indicated a smaller metabolic expense during parasitism, a common feature observed on nonpreferable hosts. In general, sex ratio was little affected by temperature or hosts. When parental T. remus were reared on A. gemmatalis before the experiment, base temperature (Tb) and the thermal constant (K) were 9.53 degrees C and 209.57 DD on eggs of A. gemmatalis and 9.68 degrees C and 197.79 DD on eggs of S. frugiperda, respectively. When parental T. remus were reared on S. frugiperda eggs, Tb and K were 10.12 degrees C and 188.46 DD and 9.69 degrees C and 190.24 DD for the evaluated host eggs of A. gemmatalis and S. frugiperda, respectively. Therefore, T. remus develops in eggs of A. gemmatalis. This can be beneficial for its use in field crops where outbreaks of both Spodoptera spp. and A. gemmatalis occur. However, A. gemmatalis is a less favorable host for the parasitoid development.

AB  - This work presents a holistic approach for the optimization of Energy Hubs with mixed integer linear programming for industrial applications. As a use case, a chipboard production plant is used, which produces different products depending on current orders. The use case includes units for power and steam generation, energy conversion, energy and material storages as well as continuous and batch production machines. Additionally, power is sold to the grid and energy in form of heat covers the demand of two district heating suppliers. To model and optimize such extensive industrial systems efficiently, a generic and modular modelling approach is proposed. The entire process is modelled based on five generic modules, which can be configured for specific tasks. To evaluate the viability of the proposed approach, three different scenarios within the industrial use case (without storage, with thermal energy storage, with material storage) were optimized. The results show, that this approach is well suited for scheduling and the assessment of process design improvements of existing industrial plants, due to its easily adaptable modular structure and the ability to use simple data-driven models.

AB  - When removing biomass residues from the agriculture for bioenergy utilization, the nutrients and carbon stored within these "residual resources" are removed as-well. To mitigate these issues the energy industry must try to conserve and not destroy the nutrients. The paper analyses a novel integration between the agricultural system and the energy system through the Low Temperature Circulating Fluidized Bed (LT-CFB) gasifier from the perspective of wheat grain production and electricity generation using wheat straw, where the effects of removing the straw from the agricultural system are assessed along with the effects of recycling the nutrients and carbon back to the agricultural system. The methods used to assess the integration was Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with IPCC's 2013 100 year global warming potential (GWP) as impact assessment method. The boundary was set from cradle to gate with two different functional units, kg grain and kW h electricity produced in Zealand, Denmark. Two cases were used in the analysis: 1. nutrient balances are regulated by mineral fertilization and 2. the nutrient balances are regulated by yield. The analysis compare three scenarios of gasifier operation based on carbon conversion to two references, no straw removal and straw combustion. The results show that the climate effect of removing the straws are mitigated by the carbon soil sequestration with biochar, and electricity and district heat substitution. Maximum biochar production outperforms maximum heat and power generation for most substituted electricity and district heating scenarios. Irrespective of the substituted technologies, the carbon conversion needs to be 80-86% to fully mitigate the effects of removing the straws from the agricultural system. This concludes that compromising on energy efficiency for biochar production can be beneficial in terms of climate change effect of an integrated wheat production and bioenergy system.

AB  - The mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) constitutes one of the main pest of grape crop at the Submedio Sao Francisco Valley. The objective of this work was to study the biology of the broad mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), to determine its thermal requirements and its fertility life table in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cv. Italy. Acclimatized chambers (BOD) were used, adjusted to the temperatures of 18, 22, 25, 28 and 32 degrees C, relative humidity of 65 +/- 10% and alternated light of 12h. Egg-adult period was 3.4 and 6.8 days for males and 3.5 and 7.4 days for females, respectively at 32 degrees C and 18 degrees C. At the temperatures of 18, 25 and 32 degrees C, each female deposited, respectively, 16.5, 44.3 and 13.3 eggs. The stages of egg, larva and pupa and egg-adult period presented, respectively, thermal thresholds of 11.23, 9.45, 12.19, and 9.71 degrees C and thermal constant of 28.51, 14.59, 8.33, and 62.73 degrees-day. The mean duration of one generation (T) was 25.6, 10.8 and 8.2 days, respectively, at the temperatures of 18, 25 and 32 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0) at the temperature of 25 degrees C was the highest, corresponding to an increase of 30.12 times at each generation. The intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) was 0.10 (18 degrees C), 0.31 (25 degrees C) and 0.12 (32 degrees C) and the finite ratio of population increase (lambda) was 1.10 (18 degrees C), 1.36 (25 degrees C) and 1.13 (32 degrees C). According to the mean temperature values, P latus can have 95 and 99 generations/year, respectively, for the municipal districts of Petrolina, PE and Juazeiro, BA.

AB  - In the Present machine tool industry, CNC machine tools are capable of meeting the demands like high productivity, high precision and reliability. But, accuracy of the machine tools is greatly affected by three types of errors, 1) geometric error, 2) thermal error and 3) cutting force induced error. Among these errors thermal error contributes more than 70% of total error. Thermal error management on machine tool is done through two approaches; they are 1) Thermal error reduction approach and 2) Thermal error compensation approach. This work deals with only thermal error compensation approach. Identification of thermal sensitive region on machine tool is the most challenging task of thermal error compensation. Thermal imaging is an experimental method which is currently being used to identify thermal sensitive region on machine tool. But this method is associated with more time, human efforts and high cost. Hence, in this work, two numerical methods such as thermal error sensitive method and thermal modal analysis method were used identify the thermal sensitive region. Here, cantilever beam was considered as a case study to illustrate the selection of thermal sensitive points. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Recent studies have highlighted that uncoupling of sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) by sarcolipin (SLN) increases ATP consumption and contributes to heat liberation. Exploiting this thermogenic mechanism in skeletal muscle may provide an attractive strategy to counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders. In the present study, we have investigated the role of SLN on substrate metabolism in human skeletal muscle cells.
   Methods and results After generation of skeletal muscle cells with stable SLN knockdown (SLN-KD), cell viability, glucose and oleic acid (OA) metabolism, mitochondrial function, as well as gene expressions were determined. Depletion of SLN did not influence cell viability. However, glucose and OA oxidation were diminished in SLN-KD cells compared to control myotubes. Basal respiration measured by respirometry was also observed to be reduced in cells with SLN-KD. The metabolic perturbation in SLN-KD cells was reflected by reduced gene expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1 alpha) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Furthermore, accumulation of OA was increased in cells with SLN-KD compared to control cells. These effects were accompanied by increased lipid formation and incorporation of OA into complex lipids. Additionally, formation of complex lipids and free fatty acid from de novo lipogenesis with acetate as substrate was enhanced in SLN-KD cells. Detection of lipid droplets using Oil red O staining also showed increased lipid accumulation in SLN-KD cells.
   Conclusions Overall, our study sheds light on the importance of SLN in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in human skeletal muscle. Findings from the current study suggest that therapeutic strategies involving SLN-mediated futile cycling of SERCA might have significant implications in the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disorders.

AB  - The evolutionary adaptability of life to extreme environments is astounding given that all life on Earth is based on the same fundamental biochemistry. The range of some physicochemical parameters on Earth exceeds the ability of life to adapt, but stays within the limits of life for other parameters. Certain environmental conditions such as low water availability in hyperarid deserts on Earth seem to be close to the limit of biological activity. A much wider range of environmental parameters is observed on planetary bodies within our Solar System such as Mars or Titan, and presumably even larger outside of our Solar System. Here we review the adaptability of life as we know it, especially regarding temperature, pressure, and water activity. We use then this knowledge to outline the range of possible habitable environments for alien planets and moons and distinguish between a variety of planetary environment types. Some of these types are present in our Solar System, others are hypothetical. Our schematic categorization of alien habitats is limited to life as we know it, particularly regarding to the use of solvent (water) and energy source (light and chemical compounds).

AB  - Laboratory bioassays were conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of seven populations (strains) of the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to five commercially available diatomaceous earth (DE) formulations: Insecto, Protect-It, Protector, PyriSec, and SilicoSec. These DEs were applied on wheat, Tiiticum durum Desf., at two dose rates, 500 and 1000 ppm. The six beetle strains were obtained from Denmark, United Kingdom, Greece, Germany, Italy, and Portugal, whereas a seventh strain came from the Greek strain after laboratory selection with SilicoSec-treated wheat for six generations. Adults of the above-mentioned strains were exposed for 7 d to wheat treated with each DE formulation, and mortality was assessed after exposure. For all DE-dose combinations, significant differences were noted in mortality levels among strains. Generally, the strains from Denmark, United Kingdom, and Germany were the most susceptible to the DEs used, whereas the strain from Portugal was the least susceptible. No significant differences were noted in susceptibility level between the initial Greek strain and the laboratory-selected Greek strain, with the exception of Protector, where the selected strain was significantly more tolerant than the initial strain for both dose rates tested.

AB  - FDA (the Factorized Distribution Algorithm) is an evolutionary algorithm that combines mutation and recombination by using a distribution. The distribution is estimated from a set of selected points. It is then used to generate new points for the next generation. In general a distribution defined for n binary variables has 2(n) parameters. Therefore it is too expensive to compute. For additively decomposed discrete functions (ADFs) there exists an algorithm that factors the distribution into conditional and marginal distributions, each of which can be computed in polynomial time. Previously, we have shown a convergence theorem for FDA. But it is only valid using Boltzmann selection. Boltzmann selection was not used in practice because a good annealing schedule was lacking. Using a Taylor expansion of the average fitness of the Boltzmann distribution, we have developed an adaptive annealing schedule called SDS (standard deviation schedule) that is introduced in this work. The inverse temperature beta is changed inversely proportional to the standard deviation.

AB  - Productivity of marine fish stocks is known to be affected by environmental and ecological drivers, and global climate change is anticipated to alter recruitment success of many stocks. While the direct effects of environmental drivers on fish early life stage survival can be quantified experimentally, indirect effects in marine ecosystems and the role of adaptation are still highly uncertain. We developed an integrative model for the effects of ocean warming and acidification on the early life stages of Atlantic cod in the Barents Sea, termed SCREI (Simulator of Cod Recruitment under Environmental Influences). Experimental results on temperature and CO2 effects on egg fertilization, egg and larval survival and development times are incorporated. Calibration using empirical time series of egg production, temperature, food and predator abundance reproduces age-0 recruitment over three decades. We project trajectories of recruitment success under different scenarios and quantify confidence limits based on variation in experiments. A publicly accessible web version of the SCREI model can be run under www.oceanchange.uni-bremen.de/SCREI. Severe reductions in average age-0 recruitment success of Barents Sea cod are projected under uncompensated warming and acidification toward the middle to end of this century. Although high population stochasticity was found, considerable rates of evolutionary adaptation to acidification and shifts in organismal thermal windows would be needed to buffer impacts on recruitment. While increases in food availability may mitigate short-term impacts, an increase in egg production achieved by stock management could provide more long-term safety for cod recruitment success. The SCREI model provides a novel integration of multiple driver effects in different life stages and enables an estimation of uncertainty associated with interindividual and ecological variation. The model thus helps to advance toward an improved empirical foundation for quantifying climate change impacts on marine fish recruitment, relevant for ecosystem-based assessments of marine systems under climate change.

AB  - Currently, it has been observed that a considerable segment of the jaguar population is declining mainly because of hunting, and destruction and fragmentation of habitat. Given this scenario, efforts of the scientific community have been concentrated on the development of conservation strategies, such as the formation and use of somatic sample banks. We aimed to assess the effects of cryopreservation techniques of the ear skin of jaguar [slow freezing (SF) or direct vitrification in cryovials (DVC) or solid-surface vitrification (SSV)] on the morphological analysis and cell ability during the culture. All cryopreserved fragments regardless of the technique used, showed a reduction in the dermis and total thickness of the skin. Although a collagen matrix similar to the control group (fresh) has been observed only for the fragments from SF and SSV groups, all cryopreserved techniques were able to maintain normal patterns of the fibroblasts. Moreover, DVC and SSV methods maintained the proliferative activity of the tissues even after warming. After the culture, SF and SSV techniques were efficient for the recovery of the somatic cells according to most of the evaluated parameters, especially with regard to the duration of culture and cell metabolic activity. In conclusion, SSV was found to be a more efficient technique for cryopreserving jaguar skin when compared to DVC and SF. These results are relevant for the formation of somatic resource banks of this species, directed at cryopreserving adequate samplings of different individuals and generations for future applications in regenerative medicine, and assisted reproductive technologies.

AB  - Thermochemical water separation methods are one of the clean and green hydrogen production methods. Thermochemical cycles are divided into two groups; hybrid thermochemical cycles which are using electrical energy and thermal energy, and pure thermochemical cycles which are using only thermal energy. In this study, the most studied S-I, HyS, Fe-Cl, Cu-Cl and Mg-Cl pure/hybrid thermochemical cycles available in the open literature are examined in terms of efficiency and cost comparatively. Besides, its advantages, disadvantages and challenges are also summarized. Thermochemical cycles have promising values both in terms of cost and environmental impact. Cu-Cl thermochemical cycle offers 0.0023 ADP (kg Sb eq), 0.0026 AP (kg SO2 eq), 0.3370 GWP (kg CO2 eq), 2.27 x 10(-08) ODP (kg CFC-11 eq) and 2.4235 HTP (kg(-1), 4-DB eq). These values can be said to be more environmentally friendly than other hydrogen production methods. The Cu-Cl hybrid cycle is promising in terms of multigenerational integration. Apart from these cycles, thermochemical cycles that are new in the literature are examined and explained in detail. Among them, the NaOH, Cu-Cl and Boron thermochemical cycles appear to be promising in terms of efficiency, cost and productivity. In these cycles, the NaOH cycle is promising as it operates at 500 degrees C. It also has the highest energy efficiency with 82% among new cycles. More importantly, such thermeochemical/hybrid cycles are suitable to use the renewable heat and electricity.

AB  - The genetic basis of adaptation to different environments has been of long-standing interest to evolutionary biologists. Dormancy is a well-studied adaptation to facilitate overwintering. In Drosophila melanogaster, a moderate number of genes with large effects have been described, which suggests a simple genetic basis of dormancy. On the other hand, genome-wide scans for dormancy suggest a polygenic architecture in insects. In D. melanogaster, the analysis of the genetic architecture of dormancy is complicated by the presence of cosmopolitan inversions. Here, we performed a genome-wide scan to characterize the genetic basis of this ecologically extremely important trait in the sibling species of D. melanogaster, D. simulans that lacks cosmopolitan inversions. We performed Pool-GWAS in a South African D. simulans population for dormancy incidence at 2 temperature regimes (10 and 12 degrees C, LD 10:14). We identified several genes with SNPs that showed a significant association with dormancy (P-value < 1e-13), but the overall modest response suggests that dormancy is a polygenic trait with many loci of small effect. Our results shed light on controversies on reproductive dormancy in Drosophila and have important implications for the characterization of the genetic basis of this trait.

AB  - Effects of sex, mating status and temperature on flight activity of the Oriental tea tortrix, Homona magnanima, were evaluated by a computer-aided flight mill system. Adult moths reared through 22 to 25 generations were used to measure flight activity. Two to 8 day-old, females always flew more than males. It is likely that survival and flight duration of males were reduced due to exhaustion resulting from flight behavior. Mating status, whether mated or unmated, did not affect flight activity in either sex. Females showed high flight ability within the temperature range from 15 to 23 degrees C, and their flight activity and survival greatly decreased at temperatures over 25.5 degrees C.

AB  - Anode baking furnaces are a key component of the manufacturing process of prebaked anodes used for aluminium production. Green anodes are loaded into pits before being submitted to high temperature in order to meet resistivity and chemical reactivity specifications. These pits are separated from each other by fluewalls and headwalls made of dense refractory material. In order to answer to the need for productivity increase and cost reduction, a new generation of design for baking furnace without headwalls has been developed. From the proof of concept and the first tests realized in Rio Tinto Aluminium Grande Baie plant (UGB) to the industrial prototype implemented at Bell Bay Aluminium (BBA), this paper presents the different phases undertaken to successfully develop and test this breakthrough technology. The adaptations made to the operation sequences and the specific tools used to operate the industrial prototype will be described as well as the performance achieved to date at the two sites. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of the benefits of this technology depending on the scenario of implementation on greenfield or brownfield projects.

AB  - Phenological shifts are widely reported for different species as a response to climate change. Still, the efficiency of this mechanism is questioned because of the accelerated rate of change and the different change patterns of various climate parameters that may cause mismatches. Here, using loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) as model species, we examined whether phenological shifts could be an effective adaptive strategy over the critical period that determines reproductive output in the Mediterranean region. We compared the rate of temperature and precipitation change over the recent past (1971-2015) and future periods (2016-2060) along the 45 main nesting sites of the Mediterranean population, during the incubation period. Next, utilizing predictions of an earlier nesting season, we evaluated whether the timing of incubation will impact offspring survival on the Mediterranean population. To further assess species vulnerability, we investigated any potential relationship between hatching success and climate parameters at the largest Mediterranean nesting rookery (Zakynthos, Greece). We found that phenological changes would allow species to capture a thermal window similar to one they experience nowadays during the incubation period. Still, phenological shifts might be less adequate to follow precipitation changes, which however, were found to have a limited impact upon hatching success. Global adaptation management strategies should be directed towards (a) acquisition of long-term high-resolution temperature and precipitation series at nesting sites, (b) developing early warning systems to prevent negative impacts upon reproductive outputs, and (c) directly applying cooling of the nests when first altered climate signs are detected.

AB  - The shift from coal to natural gas in the power sector has led to significant reductions in carbon emissions. The shale revolution that led to this shift is now fueling a global expansion in liquefied natural gas (LNG) export infrastructure. In this work, we assess the viability of global LNG expansion to reduce global carbon emissions through coal-to-gas switching in the power sector under three temperature targets-Paris compliant 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C, and business-as-usual 3 degrees C. In the near to medium term (pre-2035), LNG-derived coal-to-gas substitution reduces global carbon emissions across all temperature targets as there is significantly more coal power generation than the LNG required to substitute it. However, we find that long-term planned LNG expansion is not compatible with the Paris climate targets of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C-here, the potential for emissions reductions from LNG through coal-to-gas switching is limited by the availability of coal-based generation. In a 3 degrees C scenario, high levels of coal-based generation through mid-century make LNG an attractive option to reduce emissions. Thus, expanding LNG infrastructure can be considered as insurance against the potential lack of global climate action to limit temperatures to 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C. In all scenarios analyzed, low upstream methane leakage and high coal-to-gas substitution are critical to realize near-term climate benefits. Large-scale availability of carbon capture technology could significantly extend the climate viability of LNG. Investors and governments should consider stranded risk assets associated with potentially shorter lifetimes of LNG infrastructure in a Paris-compatible world.

AB  - We studied the reproductive biology and adaptability of the alien freshwater crangonyctid amphipod Crangonyx floridanus, currently inhabiting a large portion of Japan, both in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions. In the Chikuma River population of this alien amphipod, egg-bearing individuals were found throughout the year. In terms of egg maturation cycle, egg development (during embryogenesis), and egg count per ovipositional cycle, these amphipods display a very efficient reproductive system. This study also established their adaptability to a wide range of water temperatures (primarily 4-20 degrees C, however in some cases, these individuals are able to survive at up to 30 degrees C). C. floridanus's strong capacity to adapt to broad and variable environmental conditions is certainly contributing to its high rate of population increase, and rapid dispersion throughout Japan.

AB  - The development of minimally invasive energy-based medical technologies continues to change the practice of medicine. The science behind their associated tissue effects has been better elucidated, in part due to improved histopathologic methods. These pathology techniques for evaluating thermal tissue changes evolved from gross observations to microscopic evaluations to viability staining. Further, these individual histopathology methods have been adapted specifically for high dose ablative versus low dose ablative versus non-ablative rejuvenation and hyperthermic versus cryothermic applications. A review of current pathology techniques should enhance their application to the continued development of medical devices.

AB  - Mediterranean ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots located between temperate mesic climates and semi-deserts and deserts. Mediterranean climates are characterized by a drought season but its length and severity can be highly variable across regions. In this review, we explored population genetic variation in functional traits and fitness in Mediterranean oak and pine species. We tested the hypothesis that increased drought tolerance has evolved as an adaptation to xeric and warm areas of the Mediterranean climate while increased competitive abilities have been favoured in more mesic regions, following a productivity-persistence trade-off within species. We first reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of studies on Pinus sp. and Quercus sp. from Mediterranean climates, and then analysed a set of unpublished data from Spanish common garden experiments of species from the Mediterranean Basin, searching for evidence of trait genetic variation among populations, local adaptation and trait-environment associations. The meta-analysis showed that 82.9% (95% CI 75.7-89.4) of traits per study showed significant population genetic differentiation and that 52.5% (35.6-69.2) of traits in studies with two or more Mediterranean environments exhibited population-by-environment interaction. Population differences in traits related to drought tolerance, cold hardiness and fitness were usually correlated with provenance precipitation and temperature gradients, suggesting that adaptation to different climatic regimes is an important process driving intraspecific genetic divergence. Within the Spanish trial network, however, predicted fitness functions based on climatic transfer distance failed to reveal significantly higher fitness of populations at experimental sites with climates closer to their provenances' ones. Neither the literature review nor the new analyses of the Spanish trial network provided evidence of a negative association between growth- and persistence-related traits at the intraspecific level. Synthesis. Population genetic differentiation in functional traits and fitness is common in Mediterranean species, driven, at least in part, by the adaptation to contrasting temperature and precipitation regimes. Because of experimental constraints or biological reality, our study failed to detect a trade-off between resource-use strategies within species, calling for future studies to investigate further whether intraspecific evolution of stress tolerance occurs at the expense of growth potential in Mediterranean environments or not.

AB  - The viral and host factors involved in herpes simplex virus (HSV) recombination are little understood. To identify features of the process, recombination in HSV-1 and HSV-2 has been studied by analysing the segregation of unselected markers in the form of restriction endonuclease (RE) sites. By confining parental interactions to only one strain of virus of each serotype, restrictions imposed by non-homology are overcome and differential growth phenotypes can be discounted. The analysis of unselected and selected recombinants using RE sites in conjunction with temperature-sensitive mutations is consistent with (i) HSV being highly recombinogenic, (ii) parental and progeny molecules taking part in the process, (iii) the four genomic isomers participating in recombination, (iv) genome alignment being part of the recombination process and (v) cellular factors in conjunction with genome homology influencing the efficiency of recombination.

AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) is an adverse environmental effect of urbanization that increases the energy demand of cities, impacts the human health, and intensifies and prolongs heatwave events. To facilitate the study of UHIs the Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing of the National Observatory of Athens (IAASARS/NOA) has developed an operational real-time system that exploits remote sensing image data from Meteosat Second Generation - Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) and generates high spatiotemporal land surface temperature (LST) and 2 m air temperature (TA) time series. These datasets form the basis for the generation of higher value products and services related to energy demand and heat-related health issues. These products are the heatwave hazard (HZ); the HUMIDEX (i.e. an index that describes the temperature felt by an individual exposed to heat and humidity); and the cooling degrees (CD; i.e. a measure that reflects the energy needed to cool a building). The spatiotemporal characteristics of HZ, HUMIDEX and CD are unique (1 km/5 min) and enable the appraisal of the spatially distributed heat related health risk and energy demand of cities. In this paper, the real time generation of the high spatiotemporal HZ, HUMIDEX and CD products is discussed. In addition, a case study corresponding to Athens' September 2015 heatwave is presented so as to demonstrate their capabilities. The overall aim of the system is to provide high quality data to several different end users, such as health responders, and energy suppliers. The urban thermal monitoring web service is available at http://snf-652558.vm.okeanos.grnet.gr/treasure/portal/info.html.

AB  - Variation in the strength of age-dependent natural selection shapes differences in ageing rates across species and populations. Likewise, sexual selection can promote divergent patterns of senescence across the sexes. However, the effects of these processes on the evolution of ageing have largely been considered independently, and interactions between them are poorly understood.
   We use experimental evolution to investigate how natural and sexual selection affect life span and ageing in Drosophila simulans.
   Replicate populations were evolved under lifetime monogamy (relaxed sexual selection) or lifetime polyandry (elevated sexual selection) and at one of two temperatures, 25 degrees C (relaxed natural selection) or 27 degrees C (enhanced natural selection), in a fully factorial design. We measured longevity in 150 individually housed flies taken from each of three replicate populations per selection regime.
   We found that natural and sexual selection affected the evolution of life span via sex-specific effects on different ageing parameters (ageing rate vs. baseline mortality): natural selection reduced the rate of ageing in both sexes but increased male baseline mortality, while sexual selection elevated baseline mortality in both sexes but particularly in males.
   This means that sexual and natural selection interacted to reduce male life span but acted on female life span by independently affecting particular ageing parameters. Sex-specific effects of sexual and natural selection may help explain the diverse patterns of ageing seen in nature but complicate predictions about how ageing and life span evolve across the sexes

AB  - Genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity are both important to adaptive evolution. However, how they act together on particular traits remains poorly understood. Here, we integrated phenotypic, genomic, and transcriptomic data from two allopatric but closely related congeneric oyster species, Crassostrea angulata from southern/warm environments and Crassostrea gigas from northern/cold environments, to investigate the roles of genetic divergence and plasticity in thermal adaptation. Reciprocal transplantation experiments showed that both species had higher fitness in their native habitats than in nonnative environments, indicating strong adaptive divergence. The southern species evolved higher transcriptional plasticity, and the plasticity was adaptive, suggesting that increased plasticity is important for thermal adaptation to warm climates. Genome-wide comparisons between the two species revealed that genes under selection tended to respond to environmental changes and showed higher sequence divergence in noncoding regions. All genes under selection and related to energy metabolism exhibited habitat-specific expression with genes involved in ATP production and lipid catabolism highly expressed in warm/southern habitats, and genes involved in ATP consumption and lipid synthesis were highly expressed in cold/northern habitats. The gene for acyl-CoA desaturase, a key enzyme for lipid synthesis, showed strong selective sweep in the upstream noncoding region and lower transcription in the southern species. These results were further supported by the lower free fatty acid (FFA) but higher ATP content in southern species and habitat, pointing to significance of ATP/FFA trade-off. Our findings provide evidence that noncoding variation and transcriptional plasticity play important roles in shaping energy metabolism for thermal adaptation in oysters.

AB  - Biologists have long been concerned with measuring thermal performance curves and limits because of their significance to fitness. Basic experimental design may have a marked effect on the outcome of such measurements, and this is true especially of the experimental rates of temperature change used during assessments of critical thermal limits to activity. To date, the focus of work has almost exclusively been on the effects of rate variation on mean values of the critical limits.
   If the rate of temperature change used in an experimental trial affects not only the trait mean but also its variance, estimates of heritable variation would also be profoundly affected. Moreover, if the outcomes of acclimation are likewise affected by methodological approach, assessment of beneficial acclimation and other hypotheses might also be compromised.
   In this article, we determined whether this is the case for critical thermal limits using a population of the model species Drosophila melanogaster and the invasive ant species Linepithema humile.
   We found that effects of the different rates of temperature change are variable among traits and species. However, in general, different rates of temperature change resulted in different phenotypic variances and different estimates of heritability, presuming that genetic variance remains constant. We also found that different rates resulted in different conclusions regarding the responses of the species to acclimation, especially in the case of L. humile.
   Although it seems premature to dismiss past generalities concerning interspecific and acclimation-related variation in critical thermal limits, we recommend that conditions during trials be appropriately selected, carefully reported and rigorously controlled.

AB  - We have studied the potential of environmental adaptation as a survival mechanism to enable lactic acid bacteria to withstand spray drying. The formulation process of these bacteria exposes them to stresses such as heating and dehydration on daily basis. In the present study, the effect of heat adaptation on subsequent exposure of Lactobacillus lactis subsp. lactis HE-1 cells to various types of lethal stress was examined by comparing the viability of heat-adapted cells with nonadapted ones. The responses of heat-adapted cells to other environmental stresses such as H2O2, heat, acid, and ethanol were also examined. The results showed that heat-adapted cells had a higher survival rate than the non-adapted cells. Morphological analysis was performed to explain the observed differences. The adaptation mechanisms in response to stresses in L. lactis subsp. lactis HE-1 are to be fundamental for survival during spray drying process.

AB  - The paper reports a study focused on breeding new rapidly growing and heat-tolerant strains in a commercially important Asian bivalve, Sinonovacula constricta. To breed a new strain of S. constricta with fast growth and high temperature tolerance, complete diallel crosses were carried out using three different geographical culture populations from Zhejiang (Z), Fujian (F) and Guangdong (G) provinces, China. Larval and spat growth and the survival and heat tolerance of spats were compared in detail. The experimental serial growth traits extracted from larval and spat measurements (shell length and shell height) indicated that there was no difference between six hybrid crosses and parental crosses at the larval stage; while at the spat stage, some differences were observed. The hybrid crosses ZF (Z female x F male), ZG (Z female x G male) and FG (F female x G male) outperformed the parental groups in shell length at the end of intermediate culture, with lengths of 21.77 +/- 0.28 mm, 21.55 +/- 0.29 mm and 21.44 +/- 0.20 mm respectively. For spat survival rate, the hybrid cross ZF (Z female x F male) had a significantly larger value (88.89 +/- 4.16%) than all the other groups, and the hybrid cross ZG (Z female x G male) had a significantly larger rate than the cross GZ (G female x Z male) and parental crosses ZZ (Z female x Z male) and GG (G female x G male). The hybrid crosses ZF (Z female x F male), ZG (Z female x G male) and FG (F female x G male) exceeded the parental groups in heat tolerance, but there was no significant difference. The growth, survival and heat tolerance results showed that the crosses ZF, ZG and FG in this study were the best hybridization combinations for genetic improvement, which could have significant implications for the development of razor clam aquaculture. This work provides a theoretical basis for breeding new varieties (strains) that grow rapidly and are heat tolerant.

AB  - Populations of Diaptomus leptopus (Copepocia: Calanoida) and other calanoid copepods exhibit varying degrees of sexual size dimorphism. We examined whether intraspecific or interspecific variation in dimorphism could be explained by allometry, and we examined the relationship between adult size attained and development rate to determine, any relationship between the two. We compared the degree of sexual size dimorphism in D. leptopus and in other calanoid copepods inhabiting temporary and permanent habitats. Allometry did not explain variation in sexual size dimorphism within or among populations or among species. Permanence of habitat affected the degree of dimorphism: dimorphism was greater within and among species inhabiting temporary environments. Non-significant differences in development rate were found among populations and significant differences were found between sexes of D. leptopus when reared under identical laboratory conditions: males developed more rapidly than females but there was no general relationship between development rate and adult size. Potential adaptive hypotheses to explain the differences between populations inhabiting temporary and permanent habitats are discussed.

AB  - In general, a thermoelectric converter exhibits low conversion efficiency due to the relatively small dimensionless figure of merit (zT less than or equal to 1) of currently available thermoelectric materials. This limits its application to specialised areas. Attempts to improve its economic viability have primarily focused on improving the conversion efficiency by increasing the figure of merit of thermoelectric materials, with only marginal success. A novel idea, which provides an alternative solution to overcome the low efficiency drawback, is to operate the thermoelectric converter in a combined heat and power generation mode (cogeneration). In this paper, a thermoelectric incorporated cogeneration system is proposed, and its key elements and advantages discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oviposition site choice, which is one of the most important forms of parental care in oviparous reptiles, has major effects on incubation duration, reproductive success, and offspring phenotype. We determined the thermal characteristics of nest-sites selected by females of the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus in laboratory thermal gradients, and we linked results with information on the effects of temperature on incubation times and hatchling phenotypes. Temperatures at oviposition sites (mean +/- SD = 26.0 +/- 1 1.9 degrees C) were on average lower and had a lower variance than those at available sites (32.0 +/- 6.2 degrees C). The duration of incubation decreased dramatically as temperature increased. In fact, the hatching dates predicted by the temperatures selected in the thermogradients were delayed with respect to the mean emergence dates observed in the field. Such disparity might occur because (1) natural incubation temperatures are variable rather than constant, (2) they are expected to rise later in the season, and (3) temperatures that are too high can severely compromise embryonic survival. In addition, females might select relatively low nest-site temperatures because hatching too early can force juveniles to face limited growth opportunities caused by food shortage in the Mediterranean environments in which they live.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to highlight the important role that dye and pigment colorants play in the areas of image generation, image storage, and image output with respect to digital still images. Colorants in the form of dyes and pigments play an integral part in the digital still imaging process, from the initial conversion of the original greyscale image into a full-colour RGB additive image, followed by electronic image storage, and finally to hard-copy output via non-impact printing technologies such as inkjet and thermal dye transfer. In addition, both dyes and pigments are also utilised for image generation in the fast-developing world of electronic paper display technologies. Dyes and pigments were the mainstay of many of the early analogue photographic processes in the areas of image capture and image reproduction, and this review sets out to show that, in the new age of digital imaging, this situation is still prevalent.

AB  - One of the most important factors that determine the evolutionary trajectory of a suite of traits in a population is the structure of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G). We studied the cyclically parthenogenetic aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, whose populations exhibit two types of reproductive lineages respectively specialized in sexuality (that is, cyclically parthenogenetic lineages) and in asexuality (that is, obligate parthenogenetic lineages). We compared the quantitative genetics of life histories in these two lineage types. Our results suggest that both, the elements and the whole structure of the resulting G matrices differ in the very short term, between lineage types. This would involve the evolution toward different evolutionary optima in the same population, depending on whether sexual or asexual lineages predominate. Since sexual and asexual lineages vary seasonally in their abundance, a fluctuating selective regime has been proposed for this species, which would contribute to the maintenance of the reproductive polymorphism that these populations exhibit.

AB  - Cell alignment in muscle, nervous tissue, and cartilage is requisite for proper tissue function; however, cell sheeting techniques using the thermosensitive polymer poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAm) can only produce anisotropic cell sheets with delicate and resource-intensive modifications. We hypothesized that electrospinning, a relatively simple and inexpensive technique to generate aligned polymer fibers, could be used to fabricate anisotropic PNIPAAm and poly(caprolactone) (PCL) blended surfaces that both support cell viability and permit cell sheet detachment via PNIPAAm dissolution. Aligned electrospun PNIPAAm/PCL fibers (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% PNIPAAm) were electrospun and characterized. Fibers ranged in diameter from 1-3 mu m, and all fibers had an orientation index greater than 0.65. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm the relative content of PNIPAAm and PCL. For advancing water contact angle and mass loss studies, only high PNIPAAm-content fibers (75% and greater) exhibited, temperature-dependent properties like 100% PNIPAAm fibers, whereas 25% and 50% PNIPAAm fibers behaved similarly to PCL-only fibers. 3T3 fibroblasts seeded on all PNIPAAm/ PCL fibers had high cell viability and spreading except for the 100% PNIPAAm fibers. Cell sheet detachment by incubation with cold medium was successful only for 90% PNIPAAm fibers, which had a sufficient amount of PCL to allow cell attachment and spreading but not enough to prevent detachment upon PNIPAAm dissolution. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using anisotropic electrospun PNIPAAm/ PCL fibers to generate aligned cell sheets that can potentially better recapitulate anisotropic architecture to achieve proper tissue function.

AB  - The Bt-cotton RH-647 was developed by Cotton Research Institute CRI, Khanpur has been acknowledged for its possesses superior plant characteristics and potential to yield out under harsh agro-climatic con-ditions of cotton productive district of Rahimyar Khan in Bahawalpur Division and southern Punjab in 2016. RH-647 for its novel plant structure and improved fiber quality heat and drought tolerant to with -stand successfully sustain yield out in harsh, highly variable hot and dry climatic conditions of and harsh seasoned. RH-647 was developed through one-way hybridization of elite parental genotypes accompa-nied by pedigree selection method through gene pyramiding technique for incorporation of excellent combinations of fiber traits and CLCuV disease tolerance with higher yield potential right from F1 pop-ulation. The superior plant combinations were selected in F2-F6 generations were entirely based on phe-notypic plant traits and progeny yield potential in field, plant shape, number of bolls per plant, average boll weight (g) and fiber quality traits over standard varieties. The single plant progenies were selected 56 sister lines were tested for Bt-gene (Cry1 Ac) were evaluated for high yielding performance for this supe-rior cross and finally RH-647 as superior breeding line was bulked in year 2010. The strain was evaluated in Randomized Complete Block Design in preliminary yield trials (PYT) and two years in Advance Yield Trials (AYT) trials and Zonal Varietal trials for two years. The superior line 647/10 was ensued for perfor-mance in variety attestation tests as RH-647. RH-647 performed best in two years varietal trials (NCVT and PCCT and DUS) conducted for two successive growing seasons (2014-2015 and 2015-2016). RH -647 yielded out significantly compared with standard varieties MNH-886, FH-142 and CIM 602. After completion of mandatory trials in year 2016, RH-647 was approved as new Bt. cotton variety "RH -647". RH-647 is early in maturity with high yield potential and best suited for wheat-cotton cropping pat-tern. It has fluffy opening and is easy to pick, strongly tolerant to CLCuV disease, high Ginning out turn GOT% (40.2%) with improved fiber traits; staple length (28.3 mm), fiber strength (4.2ug/inch) is duly cap-able to fulfill all industrial requisitions.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in perennial grasses as a renewable source of bioenergy and feedstock for second-generation cellulosic biofuels. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthusxgiganteus), belonging to the parennial grasses group, are the major lignocellulosic materials being studied today as sources for direct energy production, biofuels, bioremediation and other. They have the ability to grow at low cost on marginal land where they will not compete with the traditional food crops. Miscanthusxgiganteus possesses a number of advantages in comparison with the other potential energy crops such as are: high yields, low moisture content at harvest, high water and nitrogen use efficiencies, low need for annual agronomic inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, high cellulose content, non-invasive character, low susceptibility to pests and diseases and broad adaptation to temperate growing environments. The main problems are low rate of survival during the first winter after the creation of plantation and the relatively high establishment costs. Miscanthusxgiganteus is grown primarily for heat and electricity generation but can also be used to produce transport fuels. Miscanthus biomass has a very good combustion quality due to its low water concentration as well as its low Cl, K, N, S and ash concentrations compared to other lignocellulose plants. It is expected that miscanthus will provide cheaper and more sustainable source of cellulose for production of bioethanol than annual crops such as corn. Miscanthus has great promise as a renewable energy source, but it can only be realised when the grass production has been optimised for large-scale commercial cultivation. However, further research is still needed to optimise agronomy of miscanthus, to develop the production chain and pre-treatment as well as to optimise energy conversation route to produce heat, electricity, and/or fuels from biomass, if miscanthus is to compete with fossil fuel use and be widely produced.

AB  - Microplitis manilae Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval parasitoid, is a potential biological control agent of both Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) and Spodoptera litura (F.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Aspects of the climatic requirements for development, including survival, longevity, and fecundity of M. manilae were studied at six constant temperature regimes (17, 20, 23, 26, 29, and 32 degrees C) in the laboratory. The results showed that developmental duration for egg, larva, pupa, and the entire immature stages shortened in response to temperature increasing from 17 to 32 degrees C. Survival rates of different developmental stages were higher at 20-29 degrees C than at other temperatures. Longevity of M. manilae adults shortened with increasing temperature. The maximum fecundity of M. manilae female equaled 261.0 eggs/female at 26 degrees C. Minimum threshold temperature and effective accumulated temperature for completing a generation of M. manilae were 11.04 degrees C and 205.98 degrees-days, respectively. Both intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) of M. manilae did not differ between 26 and 29 degrees C, but those were significantly higher at 26 and 29 degrees C than at any other temperatures. The highest net reproduction rate (R-0) was observed at 26 degrees C, with the value of 97.77, but the lowest was 11.79 at 32 degrees C. These results suggest that the parasitoid is well adapted to temperate and subtropical climates, which implies a significant potential for using M. manilae to control S. exigua because most of areas occupied by these two pests belong to temperate and subtropical regions in southeastern Asia.

AB  - The frequency and magnitude of heat waves have increased in recent decades, imposing additional stresses on organisms in extreme environments. Most reptilian embryos are regularly exposed to thermal stress because they develop in shallow, warm soils for weeks to months. We studied cardiac performance during warming to infer lethal temperatures for embryonic lizards in the Sceloporus undulatus complex. Embryos from four populations throughout the geographical range (New Jersey, South Carolina, Colorado, and Arizona) were warmed at a rate observed in natural nests. Embryos from all populations exhibited a similar pattern of thermal sensitivity, as follows: heart rate rose between 34 and 41 degrees C, remained stable between 41 and 44 degrees C, and dropped sharply between 44 and 47 degrees C. No embryos recovered from cardiac arrest, indicating that the upper lethal temperature was <= 47 degrees C. Despite the putative selective pressures, the thermal limit to cardiac performance seems to have been conserved during the evolution of this species.

AB  - The present investigation was made with an attempt to manufacture banana based probiotic soy yoghurt with addition of probiotic culture and banana puree, were examined. Probiotic soy yoghurt samples were produced from soy milk fermented with yoghurt and probiotic culture i.e. Streptococcus thermophilus NCDC-074, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus NCDC-009, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC-15 and Bifidobacterium bifidum NCDC-235. The viability (SPC) of these four strains were analyzed during storage at refrigerated temperature with the selective media of MRS, ST, MRS-sorbitol and MRS-maltose agar. These counts generally decreased during the storage period. Supplementation of banana fortified soy yoghurts with 5, 10 and 15% of banana puree, improved the viability of probiotic bacteria during storage period. However, the yoghurt supplemented with banana puree, at 15% level, showed highest viability (106 cfu/g) among all treatment combinations up to four weeks of refrigerated storage.

AB  - Water scarcity is the biggest survival challenge for the current generation, and atmospheric water condensation can be a solution. This paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental evaluation of a novel thermoelectric air duct dehumidifier system (TE-ADD) installed on a test chamber. The subject system, made of twenty-four thermoelectric modules along with heat sinks and fans, was used to produce freshwater by extracting moisture from ambient air. The performance of the system was evaluated as a function of the input power and the airflow rate. The results show that the water condensate production increases and the optimal value is achieved for an input power to the TE-ADD system of 6 A at 5 V. A further increase of the input power adversely affects the performance of the system. The condensate production also depends on the flow rate of the air. The optimal flow rate of air at an input current of 5 A and 6 A is 0.011 kg/s. Thus, this system solves two critical environmental issues, i.e., decrease of the thermal load and freshwater production, simultaneously.

AB  - The susceptibility of populations of the summer fruit tortrix moth, Adoxophyes orana, from apple orchards in Kent, England, to chlorpyrifos was determined in 1992, 1994 and 1995, by topically dosing larvae feeding on leaves or adults adhered to pheromone trap sticky bases. LD50 values (range 6.3 to 23.2 ng chlorpyrifos per individual) for first or second generation males, second generation females or for first generation fourth instar larvae collected in the field were significantly greater (2-3 fold) for populations from orchards with a long history of treatment with broad-spectrum organophosphorus and other insecticides than for those from untreated orchards (range 1.6 to 8.1 ng chlorpyrifos per individual), though there was considerable variation between sites and years.
   Twelve replicated orchard experiments between 1993 and 1995 were used to examine a range of different strategies for insecticidal control. Applications of chlorpyrifos against overwintered larvae feeding in trusses in spring gave, at best, a 75% reduction in larval numbers, insufficient to prevent damage by the subsequent generation in summer. However, two applications of fenoxycarb (one immediately pre-and one immediately post-blossom of apple cv. Cox) completely prevented successful subsequent development of the pest, and a single (post-blossom) spray nearly so.
   The timing of application of chlorpyrifos against first generation larvae hatching from eggs in June was shown to be critical and currently used methods of spray-timing were unreliable. The effective persistence of chlorpyrifos was short (<7 days). Though good control could be achieved with a single spray, a better strategy was to apply a series of sprays at 7-day intervals to cover the egg hatch period. Sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis at the same timing intervals gave, maximally, an 80% reduction in larval numbers, but usually less: improved control was not achieved by applying a programme of sprays compared to a single spray, though a novel, more potent, formulation was significantly more active. Triazophos was also effective as an egg hatch spray. Sprays of chlorpyrifos or tebufenozide between late September and mid-October 1995 against second or third instar larvae migrating to overwintering sites before diapause, failed to reduce significantly the numbers of subsequent overwintering larvae or the numbers that emerged to feed on blossom trusses in spring.

AB  - Understanding physiological adaptations of organisms to temperature changes that characterize their habitat is the first step in predicting the putative effects of global climate change on population dynamics. Mudflats are an important part of the intertidal zone and experience extreme and fluctuating temperatures. Therein, species would be potentially susceptible to global warming. The present study explored physiological adaptations of burrowing species to life in an intertidal mudflat by analyzing the potential operative temperatures in the mudflat, and assessing cardiac performance and the transcriptional response to thermal stress by a typical burrowing bivalve, the razor clam Sinonovacula constrict(' in different thermal environments, mimicking conditions during low tides. Clams showed higher thermal sublethal limits in mud with overlying air than in mud with overlying water, indicating an adaptation to rapidly changing ambient temperatures and thermal environments during emersion. This sublethal limit was far above the maximum operative temperature in the actual habitat site and suggests a potential buffer zone to ensure survival under unexpected high temperatures, that could occur with global warming. In response to high temperature, S. constricta exhibited the common heat stress response by up-regulating expression of the Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) and heat shock proteins to cope with the adverse effects of high temperature on protein homeostasis. Increased expression of key genes, including molybdenum cofactor synthesis 3 (MOCS3), oligoribonuclease (REX2), and NF kappa appaB inhibitor alpha (NFIA) may further remit the effect of thermal stress during the emersion period and delay a situation where clams reach their thermal sublethal limit, thereby helping to endure high temperature during low tide. These results clearly illustrate significant adaptations of a burrowing bivalve to life in intertidal mudflats at both physiological and molecular levels and can provide insights into potential physiological or evolutionary responses that could aid survival of mudflat species in a changing global climate.

AB  - Eleven Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) (370-512 mm) and eight sea trout (Salmo trutta) (370-585 mm in length) were tagged externally or internally with depth- and temperature-measuring data-storage tags (DST) before they were released into the sea in the Alta Fjord in north Norway in June 2002. All sea trout were recaptured after they spent 1-40 days at sea, while all Arctic charr were recaptured after 0.5-33 days at sea. On average, trout preferred water about 0.6 m deeper and 1.3 degrees C warmer than Arctic charr. Arctic charr spent > 50% of their time between 0 and 1 m depth, while trout spent > 50% of their time between 1 and 2 m depth. Both species spent > 90% of their time in water no deeper than 3 m from the water surface. However, sea trout dove more frequently and to greater depths (max. 28 m) than Arctic charr (max. 16 m), and these deep dives were most frequently performed at the end of the sea migration. Arctic charr demonstrated a diel diving pattern, staying on average about 0.5 m deeper between 08:00 hours and about 15:00 hours than during the rest of the 24 h, even though there was continuous daylight during the experiments. When comparing data obtained from the DSTs with temperature measurements within the fjord system, the two species were observed to select different feeding areas during their sea migration, the sea trout choosing the inner and warmer parts of the fjord, in contrast to the Arctic charr that preferred the outer, colder parts of the fjord. The observed differences in migration behaviour between the two species are discussed in relation to species preferences for prey and habitat selection, and their optimal temperatures for growth.

AB  - A satellite in orbit is exposed to external radiation from space, including: solar radiation, reflected light and earth emission. Heat is also generated through its internal components. Thermal design considerations are necessary to prevent any component from being damaged by excessive heating and to guarantee its performance. This paper explores options for thermal control mechanisms onboard a 6U CubeSat that includes a high-power laser. The CubeSat mission represents a space environment demonstration of a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) project for determining asteroid composition. A Low Earth Orbit (LEO) CubeSat mission is simulated at 650 km altitude, and the sensor system will determine through spectrometric detection the composition of a cold target heated by an on-board laser. An intuitive interface was created using MATLAB's tool GUIDE, where orbit, altitude and satellite position are input parameters that result in the average temperature at each orbit point, presented on a globe. The challenge is to find devices capable of controlling the temperature on the surfaces of the nanosatellite, and to be efficient enough to handle the heat generated by the laser when it is activated, requiring dissipation and expulsion of approximately 200 W. Mechanical designs tested include thermal straps, heat pipes, passive radiative surfaces and active schemes such as thermal louvres. Based on thermal gradients from analytical simulations and state-of-the-art in CubeSat thermal control, some of the tested thermal control schemes maintain the equipment within its working temperature range. The viability of selected thermal control schemes is discussed in this article.

AB  - Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an emerging combustion technology with an inherent separation of the greenhouse gas CO2. The feasibility of CLC has been proven in various small-scale units worldwide, but the large-scale realization of theoretical or small-scale units is still lacking due to many technical challenges. Most of the existing CLC installations use a configuration of two interacting fluidized bed reactors, and even though the fluidized bed technology is mature and well-established, a high level of uncertainty is included in the attempts to up-scale the reactor system involved in CLC. For progressive scale-up of the new technology, a preliminary design of a 100 MWth pre-commercial CLC unit for gaseous fuels is presented. A reactor-level model was used to predict the performance of such a system, and as a result, the operation of the system was characterized and valuable information of the parameters affecting the process was received. For cost-effective energy generation with efficient CO2 capture, the power plant-level integration of CLC must be conducted carefully, and different plant configurations need to be investigated to find the most optimal solution. Hence, the integration of the reactor system and steam turbine cycle for power production was studied resulting in a suggested plant layout including a CLC boiler system, a simple heat recovery setup, and an integrated steam cycle with a three pressure level steam turbine. A plant-level model was used to evaluate the viability of the plant, and without the purification and compression of CO2, the net cycle efficiency of 42.8% was obtained. It was also found that a drop of 2% points in the degree of fuel conversion decreases the net cycle efficiency by about 1% point. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temperature shifts are a major challenge to animals; they drive adaptations in organisms and species, and affect all physiological functions in ectothermic organisms. Understanding the origin and mechanisms of these adaptations is critical for determining whether ectothermic organisms will be able to survive when faced with global climate change. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is thought to be an important metabolic player in this regard, since the capacity of the mitochondria to produce energy greatly varies according to temperature. However, organism survival and fitness depend not only on how much energy is produced, but, more precisely, on how oxidative phosphorylation is affected and which step of the process dictates thermal sensitivity. These questions need to be addressed from a new perspective involving a complex view of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and its related pathways. In this review, we examine the effect of temperature on the commonly measured pathways, but mainly focus on the potential impact of lesser-studied pathways and related steps, including the electron-transferring flavoprotein pathway, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, choline dehydrogenase, proline dehydrogenase, and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Our objective is to reveal new avenues of research that can address the impact of temperature on oxidative phosphorylation in all its complexity to better portray the limitations and the potential adaptations of aerobic metabolism.

AB  - Insertion sequences (ISs) are transposable genetic elements in bacterial genomes. IS elements are common among bacteria but are generally rare within free-living species, probably because of the negative fitness effects they have on their hosts. Conversely, ISs frequently proliferate in intracellular symbionts and pathogens that recently transitioned from a free-living lifestyle. IS elements can profoundly influence the genomic evolution of their bacterial hosts, although it is unknown why they often expand in intracellular bacteria. We designed a laboratory evolution experiment with Escherichia coli K-12 to test the hypotheses that IS elements often expand in intracellular bacteria because of relaxed natural selection due to (1) their generally small effective population sizes (N (e)) and thus enhanced genetic drift, and (2) their nutrient rich environment, which makes many biosynthetic genes unnecessary and thus selectively neutral territory for IS insertion. We propagated 12 populations under four experimental conditions: large N (e) versus small N (e), and nutrient rich medium versus minimal medium. We found that relaxed selection over 4,000 generations was not sufficient to permit IS element expansion in any experimental population, thus leading us to hypothesize that IS expansion in intracellular symbionts may often be spurred by enhanced transposition rates, possibly due to environmental stress, coupled with relaxed natural selection.

AB  - The overwintering pattern of parasitic herbivorous arthropods is closely related to host phenology, because defoliation imposes strong selection pressures on various developmental stages. This relationship has been well studied in populations of spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) on deciduous hosts, but is little studied in populations on evergreen hosts, probably because their leaves are always available. However, spring defoliation may also influence the life cycle. We studied the overwintering pattern of Schizotetranychus brevisetosus (Acari: Tetranychidae), a specialist on evergreen oak, Quercus glauca, in Kochi, Japan. Only adult females and their eggs (winter eggs) survived the coldest months. We also observed a conspicuous seasonal change in egg colour and size: December winter eggs were 1.7x larger than September summer eggs, suggesting the winter eggs are diapausing. Adult females produced summer eggs until November and winter eggs from late November until they disappeared in March. The winter eggs hatched in early March. The immature stages developed in mid- to late March, when 39% of old leaves fell, some of which carried hundreds of immature individuals. Therefore, even in evergreen hosts, defoliation places potentially strong selection pressure on the immature stages. Despite this, S. brevisetosus appears not to change its egg hatching season to avoid the defoliation season, so it may have evolved a behavioural adaptation to escape falling leaves. The existence of several species with similar lifestyles suggests the importance of host phenology and predation pressure for evolution of the overwintering pattern.

AB  - Absolute density sampling was conducted to determine population densities of Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) eggs and larvae at two locations in central Oklahoma from 1971 to 1990. For each generation of the weevil, egg deposition began following the return of adults from summer estivation sites during October and November and continued until the following April. Although hatching began as early as December, the appearance of large numbers of larvae coincided with growth of the first alfalfa crop from February to May. Depending upon effects of weather conditions on egg development and survival, the time when larval numbers first exceeded the economic threshold ranged from late February to April. Multivariate discriminant analysis with five variables related to weevil egg numbers and temperature conditions was used in deriving a model for predicting by 15 February whether the economic threshold would be exceeded in late February, early March (1-15), late March (16-31), or April. When tested, >90% of the predictions of the model were correct. This model will provide valuable assistance to growers and consultants in determining when field scouting should be conducted to make decisions regarding sprays for alfalfa weevil control.

AB  - Power generation from renewable and sustainable sources is an important field of technology development owing to the increasing costs (both economically and environmentally) of fired generation. Most research associated with alternative forms of power generation have concentrated on relatively high efficiency systems, as this makes commercial realisation more readily achievable. A new research programme is taking a slightly different approach, where an inherently low efficiency power generation system based on low temperature differential Stirling engine technology is being considered.
   Here we describe the design of a low temperature differential Stirling engine for research into determining the commercial viability of utilising low enthalpy (or low grade) heat for electric power generation. While the design does not satisfy low cost economic requirements, through its ability to change important operational parameters such as compression ratio, piston phasing, and working gas movement dynamics, it is capable of identifying important features needed to optimise engine performance. The design utilises the Modified Beale Number and some preliminary, software modelling, to satisfy the specifications of having a 500W output with a temperature differential of only 40 K.

AB  - Probiotics play a significant role in functional foods. Heat stress and dehydration are the two principal mechanisms leading to inactivation and loss of probiotics viability in its production. There is a need to develop an industrial organism to withstand higher temperatures during its processing and storage. This current study aims to develop thermotolerant strains of Lacticaseibacillus casei N (N) and Lactobacillus helveticus NRRL B-4526 (H) by acclimatizing the wild-type strains to the higher temperature of 45 degrees C by adaptive laboratory evolution. A two-fold increase in biomass was observed in both acclimatized strains up to the 200th generation, which subsequently remained stable after 500 generations. The morphological change of these acclimatized strains was observed under scanning electron microscopy. Also, there was an increase in probiotic attributes of these acclimatized strains compared to their wild-types. Among two acclimatized strains, L. casei N-45 had shown higher tolerance in the acidic pH 3.0 (89.31%), the bile of 0.3% (84.45%), simulated gastric juice (79.12%), and simulated intestinal juice (73.86%). There was also an increase in salt tolerance (NaCl), radical scavenging activity, autoaggregation, coaggregation, and hydrophobicity of these adapted strains. The total protein profiling using 2D gel electrophoresis reveals the differences in protein expressions between wild-type and acclimatized strains. Specific protein spots from acclimatized strains of H-45 and N-45 were further subjected to MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Some of the identified proteins were recognized to play a role in RNA chaperones and protein synthesis during stress conditions.

AB  - Increasing climate variability may pose an even greater risk to species than climate warming because temperature fluctuations can amplify adverse impacts of directional warming on fitness-related traits. Here, the influence of directional warming and increasing climate variability on marine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) offspring size variation was investigated by simulating changes to the mean and variance of ocean temperatures predicted under climate change. Reproductive traits of mothers and offspring size reaction norms across four climate scenarios were examined to assess the roles of standing genetic variation, transgenerational and within-generation plasticity in adaptive potential. Mothers acclimated to directional warming produced smaller eggs than mothers in constant, ambient temperatures, whereas mothers in a predictably variable environment (weekly change between temperatures) produced a range of egg sizes, possibly reflecting a diversified bet hedging strategy. Offspring size post-hatch was mostly influenced by genotype by environment interactions and not transgenerational effects. Offspring size reaction norms also differed depending on the type of environmental predictability (predictably variable vs. stochastic), with offspring reaching the largest sizes in the stochastic environment. Release of cryptic genetic variation for offspring size in the stochastic environment suggests hidden evolutionary potential in this wild population to respond to changes in environmental predictability.

AB  - The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is the most cultivated oyster species around the world. However, massive mortalities linked to high temperatures have been reported in different countries, becoming one of the most significant challenges for oyster culture. High mortality episodes have been reported also in Mexico due to temperature stress, mainly in Sonora and Baja California Sur. In this region, areas with shallow waters can reach 34 ?C, causing severe physiological stress, mostly in juvenile oysters. Recently and as a strategy to address this problem in Mexico, a selective breeding program has been implemented, aiming to develop families with high survival at high temperatures through marker-aided selection. The objective of the present study was the identification of SNP markers from the transcriptome of families phenotypically different: thermo-resistant (?R?) versus thermo-susceptible (?S?) and analyzing whether these variants were present in transcripts potentially involved in thermal resistance. Several SNP variants were detected between ?R? and ?S? families, affecting multiple transcripts and molecular pathways. Four SNP markers provided accurate differentiation between ?R? and ?S? oysters. Additionally, 66 SNPs were suitable for pedigree reconstruction and sibling clustering. The discriminant SNPs were associated with changes in gene transcripts that were related to biological processes such as the activation of HSP90, zinc uptake, collagen biosynthesis, ion transport, and the immune response. The use of SNPs markers associated with thermo-resistant families can help to improve the yields in oyster production at high temperatures, especially in Mexico.

AB  - Intraspecific genetic diversity and divergence have a large influence on the adaption and evolutionary potential of species. The widely distributed starfish, Coscinasterias tenuispina, combines sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction via fission. Here we analyse the phylogeography of this starfish to reveal historical and contemporary processes driving its intraspecific genetic divergence. We further consider whether asexual reproduction is the most important method of propagation throughout the distribution range of this species. Our study included 326 individuals from 16 populations, covering most of the species' distribution range. A total of 12 nuclear microsatellite loci and sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene were analysed. COI and microsatellites were clustered in two isolated lineages: one found along the southwestern Atlantic and the other along the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. This suggests the existence of two different evolutionary units. Marine barriers along the European coast would be responsible for population clustering: the Almeria-Oran Front that limits the entrance of migrants from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, and the Siculo-Tunisian strait that divides the two Mediterranean basins. The presence of identical genotypes was detected in all populations, although two monoclonal populations were found in two sites where annual mean temperatures and minimum values were the lowest. Our results based on microsatellite loci showed that intrapopulation genetic diversity was significantly affected by clonality whereas it had lower effect for the global phylogeography of the species, although still some impact on populations' genetic divergence could be observed between some populations.

Invariably, plant is installed, which consists of heating systems employing low pressure hot water, high pressure hot water or steam, vapour compression refrigeration systems and an electrical power supply derived from the National Grid. The overall utilisation. efficiency of these processes is low, because of the relatively low electricity generation efficiency in power stations and distribution losses in the grid. A way of increasing the energy utilisation efficiency of food manufacturing and retail facilities is through tri-generation. This paper considers tri-generation technology and the feasibility of its application to the food retail industry and examines the economics and environmental impacts of the technology compared to conventional systems. The results indicate that the economic viability of these systems is dependent on the relative cost of natural gas and grid electricity. The system investigated can provide payback periods of less than 4.0 years when the relative cost of gas to electricity is below 0.3. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Summer steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were reared as South Santiam Hatchery, Oregon, under different lighting conditions for about 2 months prior to release.  Groups of about 40,000 steelhead were reared under constant lighting from mercury-vapor lights (''lighted'' fish) and compared with groups of fish that were covered with black plastic each night at dusk (''covered'' fish).  These groups were also compared with groups of the same strain reared at Roaring River Hatchery, Oregon, which had no nighttime lighting around the ponds (''unlighted'' fish).  At the time fish were released from their hatcheries, gill ATPase activity was significantly higher in the unlighted group at Roaring River Hatchery than in both groups at South Santiam Hatchery, where ATPase activity did not differ between lighted and covered groups.  The lighted group was more silvery than covered or unlighted groups.  The covered group was slightly smaller than the other two groups and showed decrease migration downstream.  Timing of migration was similar in all three groups.  Fish less than 17 cm were not recaptured in the migrant trap.  The return of adults from the covered group was not significantly different from returns from the other two groups.  Differences in fish physiology and behavior were associated with the lighting treatment, but whether or not low-level hatchery lighting benefits steelhead fitness remains ambiguous.

AB  - Background: Pulsed ultraviolet (UV)-C light sources, such as excimer lasers, are used in emerging non-thermal food-decontamination methods and also have high potential for use in a wide range of microbial decontamination applications. The acaricidal effect of an experimental UV-C irradiation device was assessed using female adults and eggs of a model organism, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae.
   Methods: UV-C light was generated by a pulsed krypton fluoride excimer laser operating at 248-nm emission wavelength. The pulse energy and pulse repetition rate were 5 mJ and up to 100 Hz, respectively. The distance from the light source to the target was 150 mm; the target surface area was 2.16 cm(2). The exposure time for the mites and fresh eggs varied from 1 to 4 min at 5-300 mW, which corresponded to UV doses of 5-80 kJ/m(2). Post-irradiation acaricidal effects (mite mortality) were assessed immediately and also measured at 24 h. The effects of UV-C irradiation on the hatchability of eggs were observed daily for up to 12 days post-irradiation.
   Results: The mortality of mites at 5 and 40 kJ/m(2) was 26% and 92%, respectively. Mite mortality reached 98% at 80 kJ/m(2). The effect of exposure duration on mortality was minimal. The effect of irradiation on egg hatchability was even more significant than that on adult mite mortality, i.e. about 100% egg mortality at an accumulated dose of as little as 5 kJ/m(2) for each exposure time.
   Conclusions: A high rate of mite mortality and lethal egg damage were observed after less than 1 min of exposure to 5 mJ UV-C pulsed irradiation at 60 Hz. Pending further developments (such as beam steering, beam shaping and miniaturisation) and feasibility studies (such as testing with mites in real-life situations), the reported results and characteristics of the UV-C generator (modulation of energy output and adaptability to varying spot sizes) open up the use of this technology for a vast field of acaricidal applications that require long-range radiation.

AB  - Annual mean wind speed distribution models for power generation based on regional wind resource maps are limited by spatial and temporal resolutions. These models, in general, do not consider the impact of local terrain and atmospheric circulations. In this study, long-term five-year wind data at three sites on the North, East, and West of the Baltimore metropolitan area, Maryland, USA are statistically analyzed. The Weibull probability density function was defined based on the observatory data. Despite seasonal and spatial variability in the wind resource, the annual mean wind speed for all sites is around 3 m/s, suggesting the region is not suitable for large-scale power generation. However, it does display a wind power capacity that might allow for non-grid connected small-scale wind turbine applications. Technical and economic performance evaluations of more than 150 conventional small-scale wind turbines showed that an annual capacity factor and electricity production of 11% and 1990 kWh, respectively, are achievable. It results in a payback period of 13 years. Government incentives can improve the economic feasibility and attractiveness of investments in small wind turbines. To reduce the payback period lower than 10 years, modern/unconventional wind harvesting technologies are found to be an appealing option in this region. Key contributions of this work are (1) highlighting the need for studying the urban physics rather than just the regional wind resource maps for wind development projects in the build-environment, (2) illustrating the implementation of this approach in a real case study of Maryland, and (3) utilizing techno-economic data to determine suitable wind harnessing solutions for the studied sites.

AB  - Forests and trees throughout the world are increasingly affected by factors related to global change. Expanding international trade has facilitated invasions of numerous insects and pathogens into new regions. Many of these invasions have caused substantial forest damage, economic impacts and losses of ecosystem goods and services provided by trees. Climate change is already affecting the geographic distribution of host trees and their associated insects and pathogens, with anticipated increases in pest impacts by both native and invasive pests. Although climate change will benefit many forest insects, changes in thermal conditions may disrupt evolved life history traits and cause phenological mismatches. Individually, the threats posed to forest ecosystems by invasive pests and climate change are serious. Although interactions between these two drivers and their outcomes are poorly understood and hence difficult to predict, it is clear that the cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems will be exacerbated. Here we introduce and synthesize the information in this special issue of Forestry with articles that illustrate the impacts of invasions of insects and pathogens, climate change, forest management and their interactions, as well as methods to predict, assess and mitigate these impacts. Most of these contributions were presented at the XXIV IUFRO World Congress in 2014.

AB  - Tradeoffs in performance or fitness across environments have important implications regarding the nature of evolutionary constraints. It remains controversial whether tradeoffs such as these reflect genetic correlations that are genuine evolutionary constraints. However, if such long-term genetic constraints do exist, they must be due to underlying pleiotropy such that alleles that confer high performance in one environment invariably confer low performance in another. The distribution of genetic correlations within and among populations can provide insight about the existence of such pleiotropic tradeoffs.
   The long-term association of certain teleost fish taxa with particular abiotic environments suggests that tradeoffs in performance across environments have constrained the geographic distribution of those taxa. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we artificially selected on acute heat- and cold-stress tolerance in two stocks of the poeciliid fish Heterandria formosa from source populations with different thermal histories. Unexpectedly, we observed no direct responses to selection. Under certain conditions, fish from the different source populations differed significantly in cold tolerance, but not in heat tolerance. The results suggest there are no strong pleiotropic tradeoffs between heat- and cold-stress tolerance in these populations.

AB  - In this work a numerical model, which simulates the buildings thermal response and evaluates the indoor environment comfort, in transient conditions, is used in the energy and thermal comfort management in a kindergarten school building in the South of Portugal in Winter conditions. After it's validation, this numerical model is applied in the evaluation of the building thermal behavior, using the indoor temperature field, and the occupants thermal comfort levels, using the PMV and PPD indexes.
   In the numerical model validation, experimental data and numerical values, for the indoor air temperature, are compared. In the experimental tests, for a typical Winter day, the outdoor and indoor environmental variables are measured. In the numerical simulation of the kindergarten school building, the 25 compartments, the 498 building main bodies and the 42 windows glasses, as well as all surrounding main buildings, are considered. The viability to build an indoor greenhouse, used to heat the cooled spaces, and the evolution of indoor thermal comfort level are analyzed.

AB  - Gyrodactylid population growth may depend on abiotic variables such as temperature. We tested the survival and reproductive rate of Gyrodactylus mexicanus, a parasite infecting fins of Girardinichthys multiradiatus, at 3 different water temperatures, 10-13, 19-22, and 24 C. The temporal sequence of birth and age at death of each parasite isolated from the hosts was recorded through at least 8 generations. Our results showed that the average number of offspring per parasite was 2.0 when averaged across all temperatures. However, the generation time was negatively correlated with temperature. The innate capacity for increase (r(m)) was positively correlated with water temperature: from 0.29 parasite/day at 13 C to 0.48 parasite/day at 24 C. These data confirm that water temperature has a direct influence on parasite population dynamics. The current study represents the first contribution to understanding the population ecology of the monogenean G. mexicanus in central Mexico.

AB  - Climate change will alter natural selection on native plant populations. Little information is available to predict how selection will change in the future and how populations will respond. Insight can be obtained by comparing selection regimes in current environments to selection regimes in environments similar to those predicted for the future. To mimic predicted temporal change in climate, three natural populations of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata were sampled from a climate gradient in the Great Plains and progeny of formal crosses were reciprocally planted back into common gardens across this climate gradient. In each garden, native populations produced significantly more seed than the other populations, providing strong evidence of local adaptation. Phenotypic selection analysis conducted by site showed that plants with slower reproductive development, more leaves, and thicker leaves were favored in the most southern garden. Evidence of clinal variation in selection regimes was also found; selection coefficients were ordered according to the latitude of the common gardens. The adaptive value of native traits was indicated by selection toward the mean of local populations. Repeated clinal patterns in linear and nonlinear selection coefficients among populations and within and between sites were found. To the extent that temporal change in climate into the future will parallel the differences in selection across this spatial gradient, this study suggests that selection regimes will be displaced northward and different trait values will be favored in natural populations.

AB  - Species have responded to climate change via seasonal (phenological) shifts, morphological plasticity, and evolutionary adaptation, but how these responses contribute to changes and variation in population fitness are poorly understood. We assess the interactions and relative importance of these responses for fitness in a montane butterfly, Colias eriphyle, along an elevational gradient. Because environmental temperatures affect developmental rates of each life stage, populations along the gradients differ in phenological timing and the number of generations each year. Our focal phenotype, wing solar absorptivity of adult butterflies, exhibits local adaptation across elevation and responds plastically to developmental temperatures. We integrate climatic data for the past half-century with microclimate, developmental, biophysical, demographic, and evolutionary models for this system to predict how phenology, plasticity, and evolution contribute to phenotypic and fitness variation along the gradient. We predict that phenological advancements incompletely compensate for climate warming, and also influence morphological plasticity. Climate change is predicted to increase mean population fitness in the first seasonal generation at high elevation, but decrease mean fitness in the summer generations at low elevation. Phenological shifts reduce the interannual variation in directional selection and morphology, but do not have consistent effects on variation in mean fitness. Morphological plasticity and its evolution can substantially increase population fitness and adaptation to climate change at low elevations, but environmental unpredictability limits adaptive plastic and evolutionary responses at high elevations. Phenological shifts also decrease the relative fitness advantages of morphological plasticity and evolution. Our results illustrate how the potential contributions of phenological and morphological plasticity and of evolution to climate change adaptation can vary along environmental gradients and how environmental variability will limit adaptive responses to climate change in montane regions.

AB  - Heat tolerance is a complex and economically important trait for catfish genetic breeding programs. With global climate change, it is becoming an increasingly important trait. To better understand the molecular basis of heat stress, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out using the 250 K catfish SNP array with interspecific backcross progenies, which derived from crossing female channel catfish with male F1 hybrid catfish (female channel catfish 9 male blue catfish). Three significant associated SNPs were detected by performing an EMMAX approach for GWAS. The SNP located on linkage group 14 explained 12.1% of phenotypical variation. The other two SNPs, located on linkage group 16, explained 11.3 and 11.5% of phenotypical variation respectively. A total of 14 genes with heat stress related functions were detected within the significant associated regions. Among them, five genes-TRAF2, FBXW5, ANAPC2, UBR1 and KLHL29-have known functions in the protein degradation process through the ubiquitination pathway. Other genes related to heat stress include genes involved in protein biosynthesis (PRPF4 and SYNCRIP), protein folding (DNAJC25), molecule and iron transport (SLC25A46 and CLIC5), cytoskeletal reorganization (COL12A1) and energy metabolism (COX7A2, PLCB1 and PLCB4) processes. The results provide fundamental information about genes and pathways that is useful for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of heat stress. The associated SNPs could be promising candidates for selecting heat-tolerant catfish lines after validating their effects on larger and various catfish populations.

AB  - Aim We examine how environmental variability at seasonal and interannual time-scales influences evolutionary trajectories and the role of plasticity in response to recent and future climate change at biogeographic scales. We investigate the interplay of selection pressures at chronic (performance) and acute (thermal stress) time-scales. Location Colorado, USA. Time period 1950-2099. Major taxa studied A montane butterfly, clouded sulphur (Colias eriphyle W.H. Edwards, 1876). Methods We leverage field and laboratory data to construct phenotype-based models that predict fitness and evolutionary responses to recent and future climate change. Our focal phenotype, wing solar absorptivity, responds plastically to developmental (pupal) temperatures and determines adult fitness via its influence on body temperature. Results We project that phenology accelerates with decreasing elevation and climate change, but gradients in pupal and adult temperature with climate change are modest. Fitness of the first generation is predicted to decrease at low elevations and increase at high elevations with warming. Elevational clines in optimal wing absorptivity shift towards lower absorptivities with warming. We project that temporal shifts from selection for wing darkening (to extend flight time) to selection for wing lightening (to avoid overheating) in some cool, montane locations will ultimately impose fitness costs. Main conclusions Our analysis suggests that shifts in the balance of selection between acute and chronic responses to environmental variation will alter biogeographic responses to climate change. Evolutionary lags may ultimately confer greater sensitivity to climate change, but plasticity can reduce evolutionary lags by facilitating trait evolution.

AB  - 1. In thermally extreme environments, it is challenging for organisms to maximize performance due to risks associated with stochastic variation in temperature and, subsequently, over evolutionary time minimizing the exposure to risk can serve as one of the mechanisms that result in organisms preferring suboptimal temperatures.
   2. We tested this hypothesis in a slow-moving intertidal snail on tropical rocky shores, where temperature variability increases with time from 30 min to 20 hr when recorded at 30 min intervals (due to short-term environmental autocorrelation where temperatures closer in time are more similar as compared to temperatures over a long period of time). Failure to accommodate temporal variation in thermal stress by selecting cool habitats can result in mortality.
   3. Thermal performance curves for different traits (heart rate and locomotion) were measured and compared to the snail's thermal preferences in both the field and laboratory. Predicted performances of the snails were simulated based on thermal performance curves for different traits over multiple time-scales and simulated carryover effects.
   4. A strong mismatch was found between physiological and behavioural thermal maxima of the snails (physiological thermal maximum being higher by similar to 7 degrees C), but the snails avoided these maxima and sought temperatures 7-14 degrees C cooler. Such a risk-averse strategy can be explained by their predicted performances where the snails should make decisions about preferred temperatures based on time periods >= 5 hr to avoid underestimating the temporal variation in body temperature.
   5. In extreme and stochastic environments, where the temporal variation in environmental conditions can lead to substantial divergence between instantaneous and time-averaged thermal performances, 'cooler is better' and 'suboptimal' body temperatures are preferred as they provide sufficient buffer to reduce mortality risk from heat stress.

AB  - Wind power is widely expected to expand rapidly in Britain over the next decade. Large amounts of variable wind power on the system will increase market risks, with prices more volatile and load factors for conventional thermal plant lower and more uncertain. This extra market risk may discourage investment in generation capacity. Financial viability for thermal plant will be increasingly dependent on price spikes during periods of low wind. Increased price risk will also make investment in other forms of low-carbon generation (e.g. nuclear power) more challenging.
   A number of policies can reduce the extent to which generators are exposed to market risks and encourage investment. However, market risks play a fundamental role in shaping efficient investment and dispatch patterns in a liberalised market. Therefore, measures to improve price signals and market functioning (such as a stronger carbon price and developing more responsive demand) are desirable. However, the scale of the investment challenge and increased risk mean targeted measures to reduce (although not eliminate) risk exposure, such as capacity mechanisms and fixed price schemes, may have increasing merit. The challenge for policy is to strike the right balance between market and planned approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, the quality and reproductive success of wild Black Sea Trout (Salmo trutta labrax) were investigated. In total 32 wild trout (27.3 +/- 13.6 g and 13.9 +/- 2.3 cm) from the Bicki Stream in Kocaeli Province in the Marmara Region were kept in circular fiberglass outdoor flow-through tanks (1.5m empty set) at the mean water temperature of 11.8 +/- 4.5 degrees C. In November 2016, when the water temperature was 8.4 degrees C, the first spawning of wild trout occurred. Sperm volume (ml), Motility (%) and VCL (mu m/sec) values were determined to be 7.5 +/- 2.5, 70.42 +/- 0.83 and 70.35 +/- 3.98, respectively. The weight (g), total fecundity and egg diameter (mm) values of female fish were listed to be 513.75 +/- 78, 1.171 +/- 171, and 3.84 +/- 0.02, respectively. In the experiment, 5.859 wild Black sea trout eggs were fertilized. The eyed-egg stage occurred 24 days (288 day-degree) post fertilization and the survival rate from fertilization to the eyed-stage was 28%. Wild Black Sea trout larvae from P1 (Paternal Generation) hatched 48 days after fertilization with the hatching rate of 7%.

AB  - A cogeneration plant operates under very variable conditions within a reporting period (usually one year) and this frustrates the achievement of the high standards stipulated by the EU Directive from 2004. Taking into consideration these difficulties, one needs to start with the decomposition of the cogeneration plant in order to determine a virtual part of the plant that can meet the requirements of the Directive on the basis of conducted measurements and calculations. In this way, the plant can be partially qualified as eligible for economic and financial benefits.
   The focus of this paper is an analysis of the power loss coefficient of steam turbines for the generation of useful heat energy and electricity simultaneously. This applies to all cogeneration plants comprising extraction-condensing steam turbines and combined cycles (gas turbine and steam turbine) when heat is extracted prior to the bottoming cycle. The proposed procedure for calculation of power loss coefficient is easily applicable in industrial practice. The viability of the proposed method is demonstrated in the case of calculations for a 10 MWe (combined cycle gas turbine) plant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reproductive biology of female amphidromous croaker Johnius coitor (Hamilton, 1822) was studied for the first time from various freshwater stretches of Ganga river basin, India in relation to climatic variability. The species showed high spatial variation in reproductive phenology and capable of breeding during pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter. Water temperature is the most crucial environmental parameter influencing gonadal maturation and breeding. Generalized additive model (GAM) models revealed water temperature near 23-25 degrees C as optimum and threshold GSI above 3 units necessary for breeding. Pre-spawning fitness (K-spawn50) and size at 50% maturity (L-M50) benchmarked through Kaplan-Meier survival fit estimates were in the range 1.27-1.37 units and 19-24.5 cm respectively. First maturity of females was encountered at 11.4 cm within the size range 7.2-28.5 cm. Egg parameters in mature-ripe females ranged between 0.29-0.80mm(diameter), 0.05-0.19 mg (weight) and 5687-121 849 eggs (absolute fecundity). Mapping of climate preferendum through LOESS smoothing technique hinted water temperatures < 20 degrees C and > 32 degrees C to be detrimental for attainment of pre-spawning fitness while no dependence on rainfall was observed. Based on the climato-hydrological influence on breeding and regional trends of changing climate along river Ganga, we infer minimal climate driven changes in breeding phenology of this amphidromous fish species. Results of this study may serve as baseline information for future studies assessing climate driven changes and evolutionary adaptations in croakers from river Ganga.

KW  - ENERGY
AB  - GEOPHIRES (GEOthermal energy for the Production of Heat and Electricity ("IR") Economically Simulated) is a software tool that combines reservoir, wellbore, and power plant models with capital and operating cost correlations and financial levelized cost models to assess the technical and economic performance of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). It is an upgrade and expansion of the "MIT-EGS" program used in the 2006 "Future of Geothermal Energy" study. GEOPHIRES includes updated cost correlations for well drilling and completion, resource exploration, and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and flash power plants. It also has new power plant efficiency correlations based on AspenPlus and MATLAB simulations. The structure of GEOPHIRES enables feasibility studies of using geothermal resources not only for electricity generation but also for direct-use heating, and combined heat and power (CHP) applications. Full documentation on GEOPHIRES is provided in the supplementary material. Using GEOPHIRES, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the levelized cost of heat (LCOH) have been estimated for 3 cases of resource grade (low-, medium-, and high-grade resource corresponding to a geothermal gradient of 30, 50, and 70 degrees C/km) in combination with 3 levels of technological maturity (today's, mid-term, and commercially mature technology corresponding to a productivity of 30, 50, and 70 kg/s per production well and thermal drawdown rate of 2%, 1.5%, and 1%). The results for the LCOE range from 4.6 to 57 (c) over bar /kWh(e) and for the LCOH from 3.5 to 14 $/MMBTU (1.2 to 4.8 (c) over bar /kWh(th)). The results for the base-case scenario (medium-grade resource and mid-term technology) are 11 (c) over bar /kWh(e) and 5 $/MMBTU (1.7 (c) over bar /kWh(th)), respectively. To account for parameter uncertainty, a sensitivity analysis has been included. The results for the LCOE and LCOH have been compared with values found in literature for EGS as well as other energy technologies. The key findings suggest that given today's technology maturity, electricity and direct-use heat from EGS are not economically competitive under current market conditions with other energy technologies. However, with moderate technological improvements, electricity from EGS is predicted to become cost-effective with respect to other renewable and non-renewable energy sources for medium-and high-grade geothermal resources. Direct-use heat from EGS is calculated to become cost-effective even for low-grade resources. This emphasizes that EGS for direct-use heat may not be neglected in future EGS development.

AB  - The present study dealt with the generation of freshwater through the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) technique, powered by an evacuated tube solar collector (ETSC). The major objective of the present work was to determine the optimum conditions of fluid flow rate and temperature for maximum freshwater productivity across both the feed and permeate sides of the membrane module. A flat hydrophobic membrane composed of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coated with Teflon was utilized for the DCMD process. The rate of freshwater production was examined with the variation in the feed/permeate flow rates (from 3 to 7 LPM) and feed temperature (from 45 degrees C to 75 degrees C) for a constant permeate-side temperature of 30 degrees C. The experimental results indicated that a maximum freshwater productivity of 45.18 kg/m(2)h was achievable from the proposed system during its operation with a high solar heated inlet feed temperature of 75 degrees C and mass flow rates of 7 LPM across both sides of the membrane. Further, a detailed assessment of the performance parameters indicated that the present solar-powered DCMD system exhibited a maximum evaporative efficiency of about 80% and temperature polarization coefficient (TPC) of 0.62 respectively.

AB  - We demonstrate the viability of using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for facial recognition of meteorological phenomena in satellite imagery. Transfer learning was used to fine tune the widely used VGG-16 network architecture and allow the network to successfully detect (94% accuracy) the presence of transverse cirrus bands (TCBs) in NASA MODIS and VIIRS satellite browse imagery. The CNN exhibited better performance compared to a random forest classifier (84% accuracy) and was further validated by applying it to NASA satellite browse imagery in order to create a multi-year (2013-2015) global heat map of TCB occurrence. The annual heat map shows spatial patterns that are consistent with known mechanisms for the generation of TCBs, providing confidence in the CNN classifications. Our study shows that CNNs are well suited for meteorological phenomena detection due to their generalization capabilities and strong performance. An immediate application of our work intends to enable phenomena-based search of big satellite imagery databases. With additional modifications, the CNN could be utilized for other applications such as providing situational awareness to operational forecasters or developing phenomena specific climatologies.

AB  - Climate change scenarios suggest an increase in tropical ocean temperature by 1-3 degrees C by 2099, potentially killing many coral reefs. But Arabian/Persian Gulf corals already exist in this future thermal environment predicted for most tropical reefs and survived severe bleaching in 2010, one of the hottest years on record. Exposure to 33-35 degrees C was on average twice as long as in non-bleaching years. Gulf corals bleached after exposure to temperatures above 34 degrees C for a total of 8 weeks of which 3 weeks were above 35 degrees C. This is more heat than any other corals can survive, providing an insight into the present limits of holobiont adaptation. We show that average temperatures as well as heat-waves in the Gulf have been increasing, that coral population levels will fluctuate strongly, and reef-building capability will be compromised. This, in combination with ocean acidification and significant local threats posed by rampant coastal development puts even these most heat-adapted corals at risk. WWF considers the Gulf ecoregion as "critically endangered". We argue here that Gulf corals should be considered for assisted migration to the tropical Indo-Pacific. This would have the double benefit of avoiding local extinction of the world's most heat-adapted holobionts while at the same time introducing their genetic information to populations naive to such extremes, potentially assisting their survival. Thus, the heat-adaptation acquired by Gulf corals over 6 k, could benefit tropical Indo-Pacific corals who have <100 y until they will experience a similarly harsh climate. Population models suggest that the heat-adapted corals could become dominant on tropical reefs within similar to 20 years.

AB  - Understanding the capacity of species to acclimate and adapt to expected temperature increases is critical for making predictions about the biological impacts of global warming, yet it is one of the least certain aspects of climate change science(1-4). Tropical species are considered to be especially sensitive to climate change because they live close to their thermal maximum and exhibit limited capacity for acclimation(5-7). Here, we demonstrate that a tropical reef fish is highly sensitive to small increases in water temperature, but can rapidly acclimate over multiple generations. Acute exposure to elevated temperatures (+1.5 degrees C and +3.0 degrees C) predicted to occur this century caused a 15% and 30% respective decrease in individual's maximum ability to perform aerobic activities such as swimming or foraging, known as aerobic scope. However, complete compensation in aerobic scope occurred when both parents and offspring were reared throughout their lives at elevated temperature. Such acclimation could reduce the impact of warming temperatures and allow populations to persist across their current range. This study reveals the importance of transgenerational acclimation as a mechanism for coping with rapid climate change and highlights that single generation studies risk underestimating the potential of species to cope.

AB  - Here, we present a rapid, low-temperature (200 degrees C) plasma -enabled synthesis of graphene micro-islands (GMs). Morphological analyses of GMs by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) feature a uniform and open-networked array of aggregated graphene sheets. Structural and surface chemical characterizations by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) support the presence of thin graphitic edges and reactive oxygen functional groups. We demonstrate that these inherent properties of GMs enable its multifunctional capabilities as a bioactive interface. GMs exhibit a biocompatibility of 80% cell viability with primary fibroblast lung cells after 5 days. Further, GMs were assembled into an impedimetric genosensor, and its performance was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A dynamic sensing range of 1 pM to 1 nM is reported, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 2.03 x 10(-13) M is deduced, with selectivity to single-RNA-base mismatched sequences. The versatile nature of GMs may be explored to enable multi-faceted bioactive platforms for next-generation personalized healthcare technologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here we demonstrate that sulfur dioxide (SO2) is efficiently captured via heterogeneous oxidation into sulfate on the surface of hydroxylated manganese dioxide (MnO2). Lab-scale activity tests in a fluidized bed reactor showed that the removal efficiency for a simulated flue gas containing 5000 mg.Nm(-3) SO2 could reach nearly 100% with a GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of 10000 h(-1). The mechanism was investigated using a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. It was found that formation of surface bound sulfate proceeds via association of SO2 with terminal hydroxyls. Both H2O and O-2 are essential for the generation of reactive terminal hydroxyls, and the indirect role of O-2 in heterogeneous SO2 oxidation at low temperature was also revealed. We propose that the high reactivity of terminal hydroxyls is attributed to the proper surface configuration of MnO2 to adsorb water with degenerate energies for associative and dissociative states, and maintain rapid proton dynamics. Viability analyses suggest that the desulfurization method that is based on such a direct oxidation reaction at the gas/solid interface represents a promising approach for SO2 capture.

AB  - P>1. Despite the great interest in characterising fish reproductive habitat, the relationship between the selection of a given spawning site and individual fitness has not been experimentally tested.
   2. In this study, we used an in situ experimental approach to determine (i) the relative contribution of substrate characteristics as well as hydrological and physicochemical variables to small-scale redd site selection by brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill) and (ii) if hatching and emergence success, used as a surrogate of fitness, are improved in selected compared to non-selected sites in both lake and stream habitats.
   3. Our results show that upwelling groundwater flow was always significantly higher in selected than in non-selected sites in both lake and stream habitats. We found no significant difference in the mean geometric substrate diameter and no consistent differences in substrate composition between selected and non-selected sites. Oxygen concentration was higher (significantly so in three of four comparisons) and conductivity tended to be lower in selected than in non-selected sites, while temperature showed no significant or consistent variations. We found a significant positive relationship between the selection of a given spawning habitat and hatching and emergence success in these systems.
   4. These results show that the main cue that brook charr use to select their spawning sites is upwelling groundwater in lake and stream habitats, and that active selection of these sites increases individual fitness. This suggests that natural selection acted on the same cues in lentic and lotic environments; this could have been highly adaptive in a species that used both habitats as colonisation routes after the last glaciation.

AB  - Data center thermal management challenges have been steadily increasing over the past few years due to rack level power density increases resulting from system level compaction. These challenges have been compounded by antiquated environmental control strategies designed for low power density installations and for the worst-case heat dissipation rates in the computer systems. Current data center environmental control strategies are not energy efficient when applied to the highly dynamic, high power density data centers of the future. Current techniques control the computer room air conditioning units (CRACs) based oil the return air temperature of the air-typically set near 20 degrees C. Blowers within the CRACs are normally operated at maximum flow rate throughout the operation of the data center unless they are equipped with nonstandard variable frequency drives. At this setting the blowers typically provide significantly more airflow than is required by the equipment racks to prevent recirculation and the subsequent formation of hot spots. This strategy tends to be overly conservative and inefficient. As an example air entering a given system housed in a rack undergoes a temperature rise of 15 degrees C due to the heat added by the system. The return air control strategy strives to keep the entire room at a fixed temperature. Therefore in a typical data center the CRAC supply temperature, and hence the air entering the racks, is 13 - 15 degrees C and the CRAC return is 20-22 degrees C. At these settings the CRACs can consume almost as much energy as the computer equipment the), are cooling [Friedrich, R., Patel, C.D., 2002, "Towards Planetary Scale Computing - Technical Challenges for Next Generation Internet Computing," THERMES 2002, Santa Fe, NM; The Uptime Institute, "Heat Density Trends in Data Processing, Computer Systems and Telecommunications Equipment, " White Paper issued by The Uptime Institute, 2000.]. Experiments conducted by the authors using these CRAC settings show that nearly 0.7 W is consumed by the environmental control system for every I W of heat dissipated by the computer equipment in the authors' experimental facility indicating that the energy efficiency of standard data center environmental control systems is poor. This study examines several opportunities for improving thermal management and energy performance of data centers with automatic control. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate how simple, modular control strategies can be implemented. Furthermore, experimental data is presented that show it is possible to improve the energy performance of a data center by up to 70% over current standards while maintaining proper thermal management conditions.

AB  - Biogas is a fuel which has a high potential energy and it is produced from the anaerobic degradation of organic material. It can be used for many applications such as heat and electrical generation and fueling vehicles. Given that anaerobic reactors and landfills are the main forms for treating domestic solid waste in Brazil, this current article presents a five scenario analysis on the energy potential and economic viability of the combined use of biogas produced in these structures for generating electricity in the city of Itajuba, Brazil. From the energy point of view, the best case scenario is the combined use of biogas from sanitary landfill and sewage treatment station. This scenario resulted in an installed power of 685 kW, with an annual energy production capable of supplying approximately 10% of the city's energy. Concerning the economic aspect, the best option is the use of biogas from sanitary landfill in an isolated manner, due to the shorter distance of the transport of the gas, in comparison with other scenarios. The results demonstrate the potential and possibility of economic viability for the use of biogas in urban structures for these microregions in Brazil, indicating that the development of biogas use in small cities can be accomplished within the resolutions of distributed microgeneration. Such potential tends to increase as basic sanitation grows throughout the country.

AB  - Temperature has dramatic evolutionary fitness consequences and is therefore a major factor determining the geographic distribution and abundance of ectotherms. However, the role that age might have on insect thermal tolerance is often overlooked in studies of behaviour, ecology, physiology and evolutionary biology. Here, we review the evidence for ontogenetic and ageing effects on traits of high- and low-temperature tolerance in insects and show that these effects are typically pronounced for most taxa in which data are available. We therefore argue that basal thermal tolerance and acclimation responses (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) are strongly influenced by age and/or ontogeny and may confound studies of temperature responses if unaccounted for. We outline three alternative hypotheses which can be distinguished to propose why development affects thermal tolerance in insects. At present no studies have been undertaken to directly address these options. The implications of these age-related changes in thermal biology are discussed and, most significantly, suggest that the temperature tolerance of insects should be defined within the age-demographics of a particular population or species. Although we conclude that age is a source of variation that should be carefully controlled for in thermal biology, we also suggest that it can be used as a valuable tool for testing evolutionary theories of ageing and the cellular and genetic basis of thermal tolerance.

AB  - Clarkus papillatus is a widely distributed predatory soil nematode and is of interest in the study of soil ecology, yet very little information exists on its in vitro culturing. In this investigation, an artificial environment was created to maintain C. papillatus for multi-generational studies. The mean number of C. papillatus increased significantly over time when starting the cultures with three adults per plate. Clarkus papillatus had a significantly higher median fecundity at 20, 25 and 28 degrees C than at five other temperatures. Juvenile C. papillatus could not survive without adults in culture and, therefore, may require adult maceration of prey nematodes to survive in vitro.

AB  - Considerable attention has been given to the potential impacts of global climate change on biodiversity. In the present study, we combine understudied themes by examining the ability of a freshwater fish (polymorphic for heat-sensitivity) to respond to short-term thermal stress mimicking an extreme temperature event. We simultaneously measured the effect of thermal stress on the body condition of heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant forms to evaluate an existing hypothesis regarding the underlying mechanism by which temperature affects the maintenance of genetic variation in this species. Surprisingly, the heat-sensitive allelic variant increased in body condition equally as much as a heat-tolerant variant under acute heat stress. More importantly, the heat-sensitive variant exhibited a significant response to thermal stress, with an upward shift of greater than 2 degrees C in critical thermal maximum. Our findings suggest a complexity to the relationship between thermal stress and male body condition that may depend on an interaction with other factors such as resource level. Although the evolutionary fate of species with respect to climate change is typically evaluated in terms long-term adaptive response, short-term selection events could drastically reduce fitness and reduce evolutionary potential. Our results suggest that heat-sensitive species may have considerably greater resilience to the short-term, extreme perturbations to the environment that are expected under climate change.

AB  - Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process with self-limiting reaction on the substrate provides a very uniform and conformal thin film with high quality. In this regards, current industrial requirements of silicon oxide are as follow. Silicon oxide film is used as gate sealing and gate spacer oxide, gapfill oxide in memory and logic devices. It is also used for double and quadruple spacer in self-aligned patterning technology. Therefore, recent ALD of SiO2 requires very low temperature process, good step-coverage (thickness uniformity of SiO2 film in pattern) and excellent film density with high purity (low wet-etch rate) in device pattern. In order to meet these requirements, a new scheme called Space-Divided Plasma Atomic Layer Deposition (SDPALD) of silicon oxide was developed. A high-quality film deposition at low temperature was established in this process, high growth rate ensured accomplishing a high productivity. This study shows step coverage more than 95% at aspect ratio of 60:1, wet etch rate 0.48 A/sec at 400 degrees C (100:1 HF). There is no sub-layer damage by plasma process. Also, pure SiO2 as well as doped SiO2 can be made by additiional gas. Doping concentration can be controlled by treatment time and process temperature. Currently, doped SiO2 can be developed for next generation device in memory technology. Therefore, we believe that SDPALD SiO2 system is the solution of next generation semiconductor.

AB  - The antidepressant, venlafaxine (VFX), and climate change stressors, such as increased water temperature and decreased dissolved oxygen, are current threats to aquatic environments. This study aimed to determine how microRNAs (miRNAs) and predicted targeted transcripts were altered in livers of zebrafish exposed to these stressors, and livers of their un-exposed F-1 and F-2 offspring. Following a 21 day exposure to multiple stressors (1 mu g/L VFX, +5 degrees C ambient, 50% O-2), then a subsequent 21 day recovery, relative abundances of cyp3a65, hsp70, hsp00, and ppargc1a and miRNAs predicted to target them (miR-142a, miR-16c, miR-181c, and miR-129, respectively) were measured in the liver via quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). There were significant decreases in miR-142a in the exposed F-0 generation and the exposed F-1 generation. While there were no changes detected in cyp3a65 relative abundance, there was a significant inverse relationship between cyp3a65 and miR-142a. Hsp70 expression significantly increased in the F-1 generation, which persisted to the F-2 generation and the relative abundance of hsp90 significantly increased in all generations. There was a significant reduction in miR-181c in the F-1 generation, but there was no significant relationship between miR-181c and hsp00. Finally, there was a significant decrease in ppargc1a relative abundance in the F-1 generation which was associated with an increase in miR-129. Combined, these results suggest that parental exposure to multiple, environmentally relevant stressors can confer transcriptional and epigenetic responses in the F-1 and F-2 generations, although identifying which stressor is a driving force becomes unclear.

AB  - Montane reptiles are predicted to move to higher elevations in response to climate warming. However, whether upwards-shifting reptiles will be physiologically constrained by hypoxia at higher elevations remains unknown. We investigated the effects of hypoxic conditions on preferred body temperatures (T-pref) and thermal tolerance capacity of a montane lizard (Phrynocephalus vlangalii) from two populations on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Lizards from 2600 m a.s.l. were exposed to O-2 levels mimicking those at 2600 m (control) and 3600 m (hypoxia treatment). Lizards from 3600 m a.s.l. were exposed to O-2 levels mimicking those at 3600 m (control) and 4600 m (hypoxia treatment). The T-pref did not differ between the control and hypoxia treatments in lizards from 2600 m. However, lizards from 3600 m selected lower body temperatures when exposed to the hypoxia treatment mimicking the O-2 level at 4600 m. Additionally, the hypoxia treatment induced lower critical thermal minimum (CTmin) in lizards from both populations, but did not affect the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in either population. Our results imply that upwards-shifting reptiles may be constrained by hypoxia if a decrease in T-pref reduces thermally dependent fitness traits, despite no observed effect on their heat tolerance.

AB  - To demonstrate how insects may adapt to ecologically relevant levels of heat stress, we performed artificial selection on the ability of Drosophila melanogaster to fly after an exposure to a high but non-lethal thermal stress. Both tolerance and intolerance to heat stress arose very quickly, as only a few generations of selection were necessary to cause significant separation between high and low lines for heat tolerance. Estimates of heritability based on the lines artificially selected for increased flight ability ranged from 0.024 to 0.052, while estimates of heritability based on the lines selected for the inability to fly after heat stress varied between 0.035 and 0.091. Reciprocal F-1 crosses among these lines revealed strong additive effects of one or more autosomes and a weaker X-chromosome effect. This variation apparently affected flight specifically; neither survival to a more extreme stress nor knockdown by high temperature changed between lines selected for high and low heat tolerance as measured by flight ability. As the well-studied heat-shock response is associated with heat tolerance as measured by survival and knockdown, the aspects of the stress physiology that actually affect flight ability remains unknown.

AB  - How will climate change affect species' reproduction and subsequent survival? In many egg-laying reptiles, the sex of offspring is determined by the temperature experienced during a critical period of embryonic development (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD). Increasing air temperatures are likely to skew offspring sex ratios in the absence of evolutionary or plastic adaptation, hence we urgently require means for predicting the future distributions of species with TSD. Here we develop a mechanistic model that demonstrates how climate, soil and topography interact with physiology and nesting behaviour to determine sex ratios of tuatara, cold-climate reptiles from New Zealand with an unusual developmental biology. Under extreme regional climate change, all-male clutches would hatch at 100% of current nest sites of the rarest species, Sphenodon guntheri, by the mid-2080s. We show that tuatara could behaviourally compensate for the male-biasing effects of warmer air temperatures by nesting later in the season or selecting shaded nest sites. Later nesting is, however, an unlikely response to global warming, as many oviparous species are nesting earlier as the climate warms. Our approach allows the assessment of the thermal suitability of current reserves and future translocation sites for tuatara, and can be readily modified to predict climatic impacts on any species with TSD.

AB  - Current rates of environmental change are exceeding the capacity of many populations to adapt to new conditions and thus avoid demographic collapse and ultimate extinction. In particular, cold-water freshwater fish species are predicted to experience strong selective pressure from climate change and a wide range of interacting anthropogenic stressors in the near future. To implement effective management and conservation measures, it is crucial to quantify the maximum rate of change that cold-water freshwater fish populations can withstand. Here, we present a spatially explicit eco-genetic individual-based model, inSTREAM-Gen, to predict the eco-evolutionary dynamics of stream-dwelling trout under anthropogenic environmental change. The model builds on a well-tested demographic model, which includes submodels of river dynamics, bioenergetics, and adaptive habitat selection, with a new genetic module that allows exploration of genetic and life-history adaptations to new environments. The genetic module models the transmission of two key traits, size at emergence and maturity size threshold. We parameterized the model for a brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) population at the warmest edge of its range to validate it and analyze its sensitivity to parameters under contrasting thermal profiles. To illustrate potential applications of the model, we analyzed the population's demographic and evolutionary dynamics under scenarios of (1) climate change-induced warming, and (2) warming plus flow reduction resulting from climate and land use change, compared to (3) a baseline of no environmental change. The model predicted severe declines in density and biomass under climate warming. These declines were lower than expected at range margins because of evolution towards smaller size at both emergence and maturation compared to the natural evolution under the baseline conditions. Despite stronger evolutionary responses, declining rates were substantially larger under the combined warming and flow reduction scenario, leading to a high probability of population extinction over contemporary time frames. Therefore, adaptive responses could not prevent extinction under high rates of environmental change. Our model demonstrates critical elements of next generation ecological modelling aiming at predictions in a changing world as it accounts for spatial and temporal resource heterogeneity, while merging individual behaviour and bioenergetics with microevolutionary adaptations.
