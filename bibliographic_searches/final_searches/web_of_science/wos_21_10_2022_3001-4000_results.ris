AB  - Mangroves migrate northward in Florida and colonize marshes historically dominated by salt marsh species. In theory, this migration should be facilitated by greater numbers of propagules stemming from increased reproductive activity and greater genetic variability caused by outcrossing. We aimed to determine if stand reproduction and % outcrossing were affected by cold stress (stress increases with latitude), anthropogenic stress (human population density as a proxy), and years since a major hurricane. Further, we wished to determine if mutation rate varied with the stressors and if that affected stand reproduction. Both coasts of Florida from the southern Florida Keys to Tampa Bay on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and Merritt Island on the Atlantic coast. We conducted field surveys of frequency of reproducing trees (104,211 trees surveyed in 102 forested stands), incidence of trees showing albinism in propagules, and % outcrossing estimated from the ratio of albino: normal propagules. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test a conceptual model that served as a multivariate hypothesis. Reproductive frequencies varied by site and increased with latitude although more strongly on the Gulf coast. Our SEM results indicate that outcrossing increases in this predominately selfing species under conditions of cold and anthropogenic stress, and that this increases reproductive output in the population. Further, we find that increased mutation rates suppress stand reproductive output but there is no significant relationship between outcrossing and mutation rate. Tree size responded to stressors but did not affect stand reproduction. Reproduction increased with years since major hurricane. Potential for colonization of northern Florida salt marshes by mangroves is enhanced by increased reproductive rates that provides more propagules and outcrossing that should enhance genetic variation thereby promoting adaptation to novel environmental conditions. Natural (cold) stress reduced mutation rate and increased stand reproductive output but anthropogenic stress did the opposite.

AB  - Specific thermoreceptors or putative multimodal thermoreceptors are not known in Crustacea. However, behavioural studies on thermal avoidance and preference and on the effects of temperature on motor activity indicate that the thermosensitivity of crustaceans may be in the range 0.2-2 degrees C. Work on planktonic crustaceans suggests that they respond particularly to changes in temperature by klinokinesis and orthokinesis. The thermal behaviour of crustaceans is modified by thermal acclimation among other factors. The acclimation of the critical maximum temperature is an example of resistance acclimation, while the acclimation of preference behaviour may be classified as capacity acclimation of some other function. In crustaceans,, the use of the concepts stenothermy and eurythermy at the species level is questionable, and it is not possible to divide crustacean species into thermal guilds as suggested for fishes. Thermal preference behaviour contributes to fitness in different ways in different species, often by maximising the aerobic metabolic scope for activity. In crustaceans the peripheral nervous system seems to have retained the capacity for thermosensitivity and thermal acclimation independently of the central nervous system control of behaviour.

AB  - Genetic variation is prevalent among individuals of the same species and yet the potential effects of genetic variation on developmental outcomes are frequently suppressed. Understanding the mechanisms that are responsible for this suppression is an important goal. Previously, we found that the microRNA miR-9a mitigates the impact of natural genetic variants that promote the development of scutellar bristles in adult Drosophila. Here we find that miR-9a does not affect the impact of genetic variants that inhibit the development of scutellar bristles. We show this using both directional and stabilizing selection in the laboratory. This specificity of action suggests that miR-9a does not interact with all functional classes of developmental genetic variants affecting sensory organ development. We also investigate the impact of miR-9a on a fitness trait, which is adult viability. At elevated physiological temperatures, miR-9a contributes to viability through masking genetic variants that hinder adult viability. We conclude that miR-9a activity in different developmental networks contributes to suppression of natural variants from perturbing development.

AB  - A recently developed experimental set-up has been used to test the constancy of flight direction in the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae, originally collected in Northern Germany. The night direction, tested with virgin females, depends on the developmental mode. Butterflies from diapause pupae fly north, those from subitan pupae fly south.
   The constancy of the flight direction has been examined in detail with the spring generation over a period of 14 d. The preferred direction does not change with advancing age and is essentially not influenced by temperature or by the sun's azimuth. The night activity, however, increases with temperature, but this is concealed by an intrinsic response resulting in a diurnal peak of night activity at 10.00-11.00 hours, long before the maximum temperature of the day is reached.
   Whether the observed direction can be considered as a parameter of migration behaviour is discussed. It is shown that migration in Pieris brassicae does not end with reproductive maturity but lasts throughout the entire imaginal stage.

AB  - Southern California (USA) populations of the intertidal marine snail Chlorostoma (formerly Tegula) funebralis generally occupy warmer climates and are exposed to high air temperatures during low tides more often than northern California populations. Available genetic data suggest there is extensive gene flow across a broad range of C funebralis populations, so it is unclear if populations can adapt to differences in local environments. To test for population-specific responses to heat stress, three phenotypic assays were performed on three northern and on three southern populations of C. funebralis, after acclimation to common-garden conditions in the laboratory. Thermal drop-down, heat stress mortality, and heat stress reattachment assays were designed to evaluate ecologically relevant phenotypic responses to heat stress; these assays assessed tolerance during, mortality following, and speed of recovery following heat stress. The latter two tests indicate that southern populations consistently suffer significantly lower mortality and recover significantly more quickly following heat stress compared to northern populations. Hierarchical cluster analysis of stress response data clearly identified northern California and southern California regional groupings of populations. Thus, these results indicate that southern populations have higher tolerance to heat stress than northern populations and suggest that adaptation to local environmental differences can evolve despite moderate potential for larval dispersal in this species. Accounting for intraspecific population variation in thermal tolerance may provide important insights for predicting how species distributions will respond to global warming. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents an overview of how mechanistic knowledge of organism-environment interactions, including biomechanical interactions of heat, mass and momentum transfer, can be integrated into basic theoretical population biology through mechanistic functional responses that quantitatively describe how organisms respond to their physical environment. Integrating such functional responses into simple community and microevolutionary models allows scaling up of the organism-level understanding from biomechanics both ecologically and temporally. For community models, Holling-type functional responses for predator-prey interactions provide a classic example of the functional response affecting qualitative model dynamics, and recent efforts are expanding analogous models to incorporate environmental influences such as temperature. For evolutionary models, mechanistic functional responses dependent on the environment can serve as fitness functions in both quantitative genetic and game theoretic frameworks, especially those concerning function-valued traits. I present a novel comparison of a mechanistic fitness function based on thermal performance curves to a commonly used generic fitness function, which quantitatively differ in their predictions for response to environmental change. A variety of examples illustrate how mechanistic functional responses enhance model connections to biologically relevant traits and processes as well as environmental conditions and therefore have the potential to link theoretical and empirical studies. Sensitivity analysis of such models can provide biologically relevant insight into which parameters and processes are important to community and evolutionary responses to environmental change such as climate change, which can inform conservation management aimed at protecting response capacity. Overall, the distillation of detailed knowledge or organism-environment interactions into mechanistic functional responses in simple population biology models provides a framework for integrating biomechanics and ecology that allows both tractability and generality.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the generation and transmission expansion planning of large-scale energy systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources. Since expansion plans are usually provided for a long-term planning horizon, the system conditions are generally uncertain at the time the expansion plans are decided. In this work, we focus on the uncertainty of thermal power plants production costs, because of the important role they play in the generation and transmission expansion planning by affecting the merit order of thermal plants and the economic viability of renewable generation. To deal with this long-term uncertainty, we consider different scenarios and we define capacity expansion decisions using a two-stage stochastic programming model that aims at minimizing the sum of investment, decommissioning and fixed costs and the expected value of operational costs. To be computationally tractable most of the existing expansion planning models employ a low level of temporal and technical detail. However, this approach is no more an appropriate approximation for power systems analysis, since it does not allow to accurately study all the challenges related to integrating high shares of intermittent energy sources, underestimating the need for flexible resources and the expected costs. To provide more accurate expansion plans for power systems with large penetration of renewables, in our analysis, we consider a high level of temporal detail and we include unit commitment constraints on a plant-by-plant level into the expansion planning framework. To maintain the problem computationally tractable, we use representative days and we implement a multi-cut Benders decomposition algorithm, decomposing the original problem both by year and by scenario. Results obtained with our methodology in the Italian energy system under a 21-year planning horizon show how the proposed model can offer professional guidance and support in strategic decisions to the different actors involved in electricity transmission and generation.

AB  - Cross tolerance, whereby tolerance to one environmental stress is correlated with tolerance to other stressors, is thought to be widespread in insects. We used lines of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae) selected for survival at a 1-h exposure to -5 degrees C to examine the extent to which this selection results in increased tolerance to other stresses, including high and low temperatures, desiccation and starvation. While selection improved tolerance to acute cold exposure and survival at -5 degrees C, there was little effect of selection regime on tolerance to other stressors. There was no correlation between tolerances to any of the stressors, suggesting different mechanisms of tolerance. This supports arguments that correlations between stress tolerances during selection experiments with D. melanogaster may be coincidental. The magnitude of heat-hardening was apparently constrained by basal tolerance among lines, but the magnitude of the rapid cold-hardening response was not correlated with basal cold tolerance, implying that the relationship between inducible and basal tolerances differs at high and low temperatures.

AB  - Epidemiological analyses of health risks associated with non-optimal temperature are traditionally based on ground observations from weather stations that offer limited spatial and temporal coverage. Climate reanalysis represents an alternative option that provide complete spatio-temporal exposure coverage, and yet are to be systematically explored for their suitability in assessing temperature-related health risks at a global scale. Here we provide the first comprehensive analysis over multiple regions to assess the suitability of the most recent generation of reanalysis datasets for health impact assessments and evaluate their comparative performance against traditional station-based data. Our findings show that reanalysis temperature from the last ERA5 products generally compare well to station observations, with similar non-optimal temperature-related risk estimates. However, the analysis offers some indication of lower performance in tropical regions, with a likely underestimation of heat-related excess mortality. Reanalysis data represent a valid alternative source of exposure variables in epidemiological analyses of temperature-related risk.

AB  - Physiological function in ectotherms is tightly linked to body temperature. As a result, the thermal sensitivity of physiological function may evolve to optimize fitness across different thermal environments. One hypothesis for the evolution of thermal sensitivity, coadaptation, predicts that optimal temperatures for performance should evolve to match the temperatures that an organism experiences in nature. Another hypothesis, countergradient variation, posits that genetic variation can compensate for decreased performance in cool environments, leading to physiological phenotypes that do not track environmental temperatures. On Mo''orea, French Polynesia, thermal ecology and physiology were studied in two morphologically similar skinks that differ in habitat use. Previous studies show that Emoia impar tends to inhabit closed-canopy and interior habitats that are cooler compared to those inhabited by Emoia cyanura, but these differences had not been quantified on Mo''orea. The goal of this study was to determine whether this pattern of habitat partitioning exists on Mo''orea and relates to interspecific differences in thermal physiology and to evaluate whether the evolution of thermal sensitivity supports coadaptation or countergradient variation. I found that E. impar inhabits closed-canopy habitats with cooler substrates and with higher altitudes compared to habitats of E. cyanura. Although the two species do not differ significantly in critical thermal minimum, E. impar has a significantly lower preferred body temperature and critical thermal maximum than does E. cyanura. Despite a preference for cooler habitats and temperatures, E. impar has a warmer optimal temperature for sprint speed and sprints faster than E. cyanura at all temperatures, which supports the countergradient model of thermal adaptation. These results are robust to three different curve-fitting functions and support the view that generalist/specialist trade-offs do not universally constrain the evolution of performance curves.

AB  - In this study, a new commercial Solar Dish/Stirling (SDS) system with a rated power of 25 kW is experimentally established and thermodynamically modeled. A mathematical model implemented in MATLAB software is developed to simulate the proposed SDS system operation in order to analyze its performance, under conditions of Tianjin, China. An analysis of the daily, monthly, and annual performances of the investigated SDS system is performed. In addition, a techno-economic viability for assessing the electricity cost and life cycle cost of the SDS system is also performed. The results indicated that the proposed SDS system produces 28.748 MWh annually, with a yearly net overall efficiency of 19.55%, and achieves maximum energy of 3.8 MWh with a monthly average efficiency of 22.75% in June. From the energy cost analysis, the levelized energy cost of the SDS system is estimated to be 1.719 CNY/kWh similar to (0.2565 $/kWh). In conclusion, the present study identifies the actual commercial and economic situation of the Dish Stirling technology in China, taking into account the China's feed-in tariff of CSP systems (1.2 CNY/kWh), and it also provides a new theoretical guidance for predicting the annual performance and evaluating the economic situation of the SDS systems.

AB  - In summer 2010, a bleaching event decimated the abundant reef flat coral Stylophora pistillata in some areas of the central Red Sea, where a series of coral reefs 100-300 m wide by several kilometers long extends from the coastline to about 20 km offshore. Mortality of corals along the exposed and protected sides of inner (inshore) and mid and outer (offshore) reefs and in situ and satellite sea surface temperatures (SSTs) revealed that the variability in the mortality event corresponded to two spatial scales of temperature variability: 300 m across the reef flat and 20 km across a series of reefs. However, the relationship between coral mortality and habitat thermal severity was opposite at the two scales. SSTs in summer 2010 were similar or increased modestly (0.5 degrees C) in the outer and mid reefs relative to 2009. In the inner reef, 2010 temperatures were 1.4 degrees C above the 2009 seasonal maximum for several weeks. We detected little or no coral mortality in mid and outer reefs. In the inner reef, mortality depended on exposure. Within the inner reef, mortality was modest on the protected (shoreward) side, the most severe thermal environment, with highest overall mean and maximum temperatures. In contrast, acute mortality was observed in the exposed (seaward) side, where temperature fluctuations and upper water temperature values were relatively less extreme. Refuges to thermally induced coral bleaching may include sites where extreme, high-frequency thermal variability may select for coral holobionts preadapted to, and physiologically condition corals to withstand, regional increases in water temperature.

AB  - Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) have been used to study movements, habitat use, and postrelease survival of large pelagic vertebrates, but the size of these tags has historically precluded their use on smaller coastal species. To evaluate a new generation of smaller PSATs for the study of postrelease survival and habitat use of coastal species, we attached Microwave Telemetry, Inc., X-tags to ten striped bass (Morone saxatilis) 94-112 cm total length (TL) caught on J hooks and circle hooks during the winter recreational fishery in Virginia. Tags collected temperature and depth information every five minutes and detached from the fish after 30 days. Nine of the ten tags released on schedule and eight transmitted 30% to 96% (mean 78.6%) of the archived data. Three tags were physically recovered during or after the transmission period, allowing retrieval of all archived data. All eight striped bass whose tags transmitted data survived for 30 days after release, including two fish that were hooked deeply with J hooks. The eight fish spent more than 90% of their time at depths less than 10 m and in temperatures of 6-9 C, demonstrated no significant diel differences in depth or temperature utilization (P>0.05), and exhibited weak periodicities in vertical movements consistent with daily and tidal cycles.

AB  - The parabolic trough solar collector with Direct Steam Generation (DSG) has the potential to bring down the electricity cost. The viability of DSG technology is proved using various experimental demonstrations (e.g., DISS test facility) and running commercial-scale power plants (Thai Solar One). However, the DSG technology is in the nascent stage and needs improvement in the solar collector's components and control mechanism. The thermo-hydrodynamic instability induced in the absorber tube due to the nonuniform concentrated solar flux and flow boiling. This study investigates the effects of transient solar flux profiles on the thermal-hydraulics of flow boiling in the DSG process using CFD software ANSYS Fluent. The Eulerian two-fluid model is developed using conservation equations, turbulence model, and phase change model. The concentrated solar flux profiles are considered corresponding to various times of the day from 12:00 h (solar noon) to 17:00 h at an interval of 1 h. The three dimensional (3-D) numerical investigations are performed for DNI of 750 W/m2 and 1000 W/m2; operating pressures 60 bar and 100 bar; mass flow rates 0.4 kg/s and 0.6 kg/s. The flow regimes under the considered boundary conditions are observed as stratified flow. The vapor volume fractions at the absorber outlet exist between 0.30 and 0.45 for DNI of 750 W/m2 and 0.35 to 0.50 for DNI of 1000 W/m2. The absorber surface temperature has been calculated for operation at various times of the day, and it stands between 550 K and 656 K. Further, the circumferential temperature distributions and temperature contours have been plotted for various operating conditions. The adopted multiphase model shows very good performance and is useful for designing and optimizing solar collectors for DSG.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1 High-throughput genomic methods are increasingly used to investigate invertebrate thermal responses with greater dimensionality and resolution than previously achieved. However, corresponding methods for characterizing invertebrate phenotypes are still lacking. To scale up the characterization of invertebrate thermal responses, we propose a novel use of thermocyclers as temperature-controlled incubators.
   2 Here, we tested the performance of thermocyclers as incubators and demonstrated the application of this method to efficiently characterize the thermal responses of model and non-model invertebrates.
   3 We found the thermocyclers performed with high precision, accuracy and resolution under various and fluctuating ambient conditions. We were able to successfully characterize the temperature-dependent development of grasshopper eggs (Warramaba virgo), as well as the effects of fluctuating temperature cycles on the survival of mosquito eggs (Aedes aegypti) and developmental success of Drosophila simulans larvae, all with similar survival rates to conventional methods.
   4 Thermocyclers are a general and transferrable means to scale up current methods of incubating small invertebrates. They permit rapid characterization of high-dimensional physiological responses to natural thermal regimes. When combined with existing approaches in thermal and evolutionary biology, these methods will advance our understanding of, and ability to predict, biological adaptations and responses to environmental changes.

AB  - In hot free forging process of large products, surface cracks occur occasionally. When these cracks occur, they must be removed by hot scarfing process after stopping forging process temporarily. Final products have no cracks on those surfaces after applying the hot scarfing process. Hot scarfing process, however, cuts into productivity due to additional time consuming. Since surface cracks are regarded as significant defects, suppression of the surface crack generation is important issue. A lot of research has been studied about mechanism and criteria of forging crack generation [1]similar to[8]. In hot forging process, however, there are a few researches [9]similar to[14]. Then the mechanism and criteria of crack generation during the hot forging process are not clear at this moment. There are various factors for crack generation, such as reduction ratio, forging temperature, anvil shape, ingot surface integrity and so on. The goal of this research is to clarify the mechanism of crack generation in actual forging processes. The derived mechanism is applied to design anvil shapes by using numerical forging simulation.

AB  - Alternating current electroluminescent (AC-EL) device can be considered as a potential candidate for next generation of multifunctional light-emitting sources. In this work, we present a new design of AC-EL device with inclusion of a silver oxide humidity-sensing layer instead of an insulating buffer layer for humidity detection. The ZnS:Cu, Cl and ZnS:Ag+(Zn,Cd)S:Ag phosphors were used as an emissive layer prepared by screen printing method. The silver oxide (AgO/Ag2O) nanoparticles synthesized via a green method were employed as a humidity sensing layer. The developed AC-EL devices exhibited high response, good productivity, high stability, high repeatability and linear relationship with humidity in range of 10%-90% RH as well as no significant effects with several VOCs/gases such as NH3, CO2, acetone, methanol, toluene and propan at room temperature. The effects of parameters such as excitation frequency, applied voltage, and waveforms on the luminance intensity are discussed. The development of the present AC-EL device offers a simplified architecture to enable sensing functions of the AC-EL device via monitoring of light emission changing.

AB  - This paper proposes an economic and environmental analysis for the design of solar heat systems and their incorporation in the industrial sector. A novel computational methodology is implemented to help the sustainable integration of parabolic trough collectors photothermal technology into the low and medium enthalpy industrial activities. A multivariate artificial neural network that involves environmental, operational, and economic aspects was used to transfer the phenomenon under study into a simple and fast computing multi-output mathematical model. The optimal trade-off between environmental benefits and investment viability of the hybrid solar plant's design is obtained by a multiobjective optimization process. The objective functions consider the maximization in CO2 mitigation and net present value, and the minimization of the total life-cycle cost. The final optimal result is selected by using the TOPSIS decision-making method. Besides, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to report the system performance with respect to back-up boiler fuel type, climate region, the volume of the storage tank, and solar field area. The work contemplates the case study of a solar thermal plant based on parabolic collectors integrated into a pre-existing industrial process in Mexico. The study considered four of the most common climatic regions and the most representative heating fossil fuels in the national industrial sector. Based on the results, the best profitability and CO2 mitigation are achieved in warm climate regions. Moreover, diesel was identified as the most profitable back-up fuel scenario and natural gas as the least viable. Analysis of the energy contribution describes that implementation of parabolic trough collectors in the presented industrial process covers just over 40%-80% of the energy required, depending on the climate region. The presented methodology constitutes a rapid and low-cost computational tool which facilitates decision making for the implementation of solar heat industrial process systems. Moreover, it can be applied to other industrial processes with several photothermal technologies for clean heat generation. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a traditional solar aided power generation (SAPG) plant, problematic two-phase flow may be present in the solar collector tubes which can lead to burst pipes. Within the SAPG plant, it is proposed that a flash tank be applied. By using a flash tank and mandating its inlet pressure by controlling the booster pump, the preheating and overheating collectors can each be ensured to have single-phase flow. To assess the economic and performance criteria of adding a flash tank, a simulation model using is developed and using a unified matrix equation technique. This method is used to assess the effect of the flash tank on a case study 300 MW SAPG plant. Two modes of SAPG operation are considered. In the 'single-generation mode' only steam is introduced to the fossil-fuelled plant. In the 'co-generation mode' both steam, from the overheating collector, and water, from the flash tank, are introduced to the fossil-fuelled plant. The 'co-generation mode' is found by the authors to be the marginally better performing mode. By applying a flash tank in the SAPG system, the problem of unstable two-phase flow in solar collector tubes can be effectively overcome thereby improving the viability of implementation of retrofitted solar aided power generation to fossil-fuelled plants.

AB  - Biogas is a multifunctional energy carrier currently used for co-generation or compressed biomethane as vehicle fuel. Gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology enables conversion of biogas into other energy carriers with higher energy density, facilitating fuel distribution.
   The energy efficiency and global warming potential (GWP) for conversion of biogas to compressed biogas (CBG), liquefied biogas (LBG), Fischer-Tropsch diesel (FTD), methanol and dimethyl ether (DME) were studied in a life cycle perspective covering the technical system from raw biogas to use in city buses.
   CBG, methanol and DME showed the best specific fuel productivity. However, when fuel distribution distances were longer, DME, LBG and methanol showed the best energy balance. Methanol, FTD and DME emitted half the GWP of LBG and CBG. Choice of electricity mix had a large impact on GWP performance. Overall, taking into account the different impact categories, combustion properties and fuel yield from raw biogas, DME showed the best performance of the fuel conversion scenarios assessed.

AB  - Temperature is a major factor contributing to the biogeography of intertidal poikilotherms. The population dynamics of intertidal invertebrates like mussels are strongly dependent on larval supply and larval mortality. Unlike adults, which are resistant to fluctuating environmental conditions, larvae are highly sensitive to the physicochemical conditions of the pelagic zone. The effects of rearing temperature on larval and post-larval performance of 2 coexisting mussels species, Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus, were examined in this study. In the first experiment, larvae of both species were reared separately at constant temperatures of 10, 17, and 24 degrees C from D-larvae to the dissoconch stage. In the second experiment, pediveligers were reared under the same experimental conditions as the larvae for 2 wk. Survival, growth, and lipid composition (triacylglycerol [TAG] and sterol [ST] contents) were used to compare the performance of both species. The first experiment showed a species-specific thermal tolerance range, reflecting the biogeography of the species. M. trossulus larvae showed a preference for water at 10 and 17 degrees C, corresponding to the more northerly distribution of this species, whereas M. edulis preferred temperatures of 17 and 24 degrees C. Moreover, the TAG content in larvae of both species varied with temperature, supporting the hypothesis of a positive correlation between energy reserve content and the survival of mussel larvae. In contrast, the species-specific characteristics of thermal tolerance were not observed during post-larval development, suggesting that the selective effect of temperature on mussel species occurs during early ontogeny.

AB  - Whether species that have persisted throughout historic climatic upheavals will survive contemporary climate change will depend on their ecological and physiological traits, their evolutionary potential, and potentially upon the resources that humans commit to prevent their extinction. For those species where temperatures influence sex determination, rapid global warming poses a unique risk of skewed sex ratios and demographic collapse. Here we review the specific mechanisms by which reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) may be imperilled at current rates of warming, and discuss the evidence for and against adaptation via behavioural or physiological means. We propose a scheme for ranking reptiles with TSD according to their vulnerability to rapid global warming, but note that critical data on the lability of the sex determining mechanism and on the heritability of behavioural and threshold traits are unavailable for most species. Nevertheless, we recommend a precautionary approach to management of reptiles identified as being at relatively high risk. In such cases, management should aim to neutralise directional sex ratio biases (e.g. by manipulating incubation temperatures or assisted migration) and promote adaptive processes, possibly by genetic supplementation of populations. These practices should aid species' persistence and buy time for research directed at more accurate prediction of species' vulnerability. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The vulnerability of early fish stages represents a critical bottleneck for fish recruitment; therefore, it is essential to understand how climate change affects their physiology for more sustainable management of fisheries. Here, we investigated the effects of warming (OW; +4 degrees C) and acidification (OA; Delta pH = 0.5) on the heart and oxygen consumption rates, metabolic enzymatic machinery-namely citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), of seabream (Sparus aurata) larvae (fifteen days after hatch). Oxygen consumption and heart rates showed a significant increase with rising temperature, but decreased with pCO(2). Results revealed a significant increase of LDH activity with OW and a significant decrease of the aerobic potential (CS and HOAD activity) of larvae with OA. In contrast, under OA, the activity levels of the enzyme LDH and the LDH:CS ratio indicated an enhancement of anaerobic pathways. Although such a short-term metabolic strategy may eventually sustain the basic costs of maintenance, it might not be adequate under the future chronic ocean conditions. Given that the potential for adaptation to new forthcoming conditions is yet experimentally unaccounted for this species, future research is essential to accurately predict the physiological performance of this commercially important species under future ocean conditions.

AB  - Smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) is an invasive cool-season grass that has spread throughout the Great Plains of North America. The species is considered one of the most widespread exotic grasses that has successfully invaded both cool-season and warm-season native prairies. In the prairies where it has invaded, there has often been a total elimination of native species and an overall homogenization of ecosystems. Smooth brome has greater competitive abilities compared to many native grasses and can foster their total elimination in many instances. The greater competitiveness can be partially attributed to its ability to alter the soil and hydrological properties of a site. It is a deep-rooted rhizomatous grass species that thrives in nitrogen-enriched soil, and since its leaf tissue decomposes faster than native species, it in turn increases the soil nitrogen level, causing positive plant-soil feedback. Moreover, smooth brome is able to transport the required nutrients from older plants to the newer progenies invading new nutrient-depleted areas, making it a potent invader. However, the impact of smooth brome is not limited to soil biochemistry alone; it also affects other ecosystem components such as the movement and behavior of many native arthropods, thereby altering the overall population dynamics of such species. Thus, smooth brome invasion poses a serious threat to the remnant prairies of the Great Plains, and efficient management strategies are urgently needed to control its invasion. Control measures such as mowing, grazing, burning, and herbicide application have been effectively used to manage this species. However, due to the widespread distribution of smooth brome across North America and its adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions, it is challenging to translate the management strategies from one area to another.

AB  - Due to the widespread production and use of carbon nanotubes in almost every area of science (i.e., drug delivery, biosensors, fuel cells and thermal management systems), they are receiving considerable attention for their novel mechanical, electrical and chemical properties. At this time of high exposure potential, it is critical to ascertain the biological impact of these materials on likely target organs, tissues and cells, such as those of the lung. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of cytotoxicity to human lung macrophage (U937) cells after exposure to unpurified or acid-purified multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Cells were incubated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and assessed for cytotoxicity, generation of reactive oxygen species, morphological changes and uptake. The results demonstrate that multi-walled carbon nanotubes can accumulate in human lung macrophage cells to different degrees based on their surface chemistry. MWNT-COOH reduces cell viability in a dose-dependent manner under these experimental conditions (5-50 mu g/ml, 2-24 h). However, images of individual cells demonstrate morphological changes at low concentrations. Therefore, before nanomaterials are fully accepted and integrated into biological systems, they will continue to undergo further scrutiny at various stages of their processing (i.e., before and after purification) and with models ranging from simple to complex (i.e., cells vs. whole animals) to gain a better understanding between their physicochemical properties and bio-effects.

AB  - The widespread evidence that global warming can increase species sensitivities to chemical toxicants, and vice versa, and the recent insight that thermal evolution may mitigate these effects is crucial to predict the future impact of toxicants in a warming world. Nevertheless, a major component of global warming, the predicted increase in daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs), has been ignored at the interface of evolutionary ecotoxicology and global change biology. We studied whether 4 degrees C warming and a 5 degrees C DTF increase (to 10 degrees C DTF) magnified the negative impact of the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) in larvae of low- and high latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. While 4 degrees C warming only increased CPF-induced mortality in high latitude larvae, the high (10 degrees C) DTF increased CPF-induced larval mortality at both latitudes. CPF reduced the heat tolerance; however, this was buffered by latitude-specific thermal adaptation to both mean temperature and DTF. Integrating our results in a space-for-time substitution indicated that gradual thermal evolution in high-latitude larvae may offset the negative effects of CPF on heat tolerance under warming, unless the expected DTF increase is taken into account. Our results highlight the crucial importance of jointly integrating DTFs and thermal evolution to improve risk assessment of toxicants under global warming.

AB  - the present paper investigates the effect of environmental change especially solar irradiation and temperature on the productivity of silicon photovoltaic panels. Grid connected systems are commonly the most used application of PV technologies for power generation utility sector and building integration. The performance and reliability of these systems are very interesting indices for design improvement and research development. Several studies in different locations have investigated and reported the importance of PV performance monitoring to qualify various technologies operating worldwide. These information are very useful for energy policy makers and projects development. The research reported in this article, highlights the performance analysis of 2.04 kWp poly-crystalline grid-tied system installed on the roof of laboratory building inside the faculty of science using an implemented monitoring system based on PC-duino hardware. The annual specific yield, system efficiency and energy density were found for instance to be 1874 kWh/kWp/year, 16.32 % and 284.98 kWh/m-respectively. Other performance indicators are discussed profoundly in this paper. Findings from this work provide useful information for research applications and projects development of small-scale grid connected photovoltaic systems in Morocco and near regions.

AB  - Synergistic interactions between temperature and contaminants are a major challenge for ecological risk assessment, especially under global warming. While thermal evolution may increase the ability to deal with warming, it is unknown whether it may also affect the ability to deal with the many contaminants that are more toxic at higher temperatures. We investigated how evolution of genetic adaptation to warming affected the interactions between warming and a novel stressor: zinc oxide nanoparticles (nZnO) in a natural population of Daphnia magna using resurrection ecology. We hatched resting eggs from two D.magna subpopulations (old: 1955-1965, recent: 1995-2005) from the sediment of a lake that experienced an increase in average temperature and in recurrence of heat waves but was never exposed to industrial waste. In the old ancestral subpopulation, exposure to a sublethal concentration of nZnO decreased the intrinsic growth rate, metabolic activity, and energy reserves at 24 degrees C but not at 20 degrees C, indicating a synergism between warming and nZnO. In contrast, these synergistic effects disappeared in the recent derived subpopulation that evolved a lower sensitivity to nZnO at 24 degrees C, which indicates that thermal evolution could offset the elevated toxicity of nZnO under warming. This evolution of reduced sensitivity to nZnO under warming could not be explained by changes in the total internal zinc accumulation but was partially associated with the evolution of the expression of a key metal detoxification gene under warming. Our results suggest that the increased sensitivity to the sublethal concentration of nZnO under the predicted 4 degrees C warming by the end of this century may be counteracted by thermal evolution in this D.magna population. Our results illustrate the importance of evolution to warming in shaping the responses to another anthropogenic stressor, here a contaminant. More general, genetic adaptation to an environmental stressor may ensure that synergistic effects between contaminants and this environmental stressor will not be present anymore.

AB  - Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) are projected to contribute to a 1.1-6.4 degrees C rise in global average surface temperatures and a 0.14-0.35 reduction in the average pH of the global surface ocean by 2100. If realized, these changes are expected to have negative consequences for reef-building corals including increased frequency and severity of coral bleaching and reduced rates of calcification and reef accretion. Much less is known regarding the independent and combined effects of temperature and pCO(2) on critical early life history processes such as fertilization. Here we show that increases in temperature (+3 degrees C) and pCO(2) (+400 mu atm) projected for this century negatively impact fertilization success of a common Indo-Pacific coral species, Acropora tenuis. While maximum fertilization did not differ among treatments, the sperm concentration required to obtain 50% of maximum fertilization increased 6- to 8- fold with the addition of a single factor (temperature or CO2) and nearly 50- fold when both factors interact. Our results indicate that near-future changes in temperature and pCO(2) narrow the range of sperm concentrations that are capable of yielding high fertilization success in A. tenuis. Increased sperm limitation, in conjunction with adult population decline, may have severe consequences for coral reproductive success. Impaired sexual reproduction will further challenge corals by inhibiting population recovery and adaptation potential.

AB  - Climate response functions for 125 Pinus contorta populations were updated to assess the impact of 16 climate change scenarios on forest productivity. Productivity was defined as the volume of wood expected per hectare at age 20 and was calculated as the product of predicted individual tree volumes, an initial stocking (1600 trees ha(-1)), and predicted survival. Impact was considered according to the transient effects of a changing climate governed by (1) physiological plasticity in the contemporary generation and (2) long-term evolutionary adjustments that provide adaptedness and optimize productivity in future generations. Direct short-term plastic responses were geographically complex and had repercussions throughout the species' distribution even when temperature fluctuations were small (+/- 1 degrees C) and changes in distribution were inconsequential. Evolutionary adjustments ameliorated negative short-term impacts while enhancing the positive. Scenarios that encompassed predictions for global warming produced short-term impacts that were negative in the south and positive in the north, but subsequent evolutionary adjustments projected substantial increases in productivity. The long-term adjustments may require only 1 to 3 generations in the north but 6 to 12 generations in the south, thereby taking between 200 and 1200 years.

AB  - Several hundred Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) were collected from selected spawning grounds along the Norwegian coast in March 2002. Four areas or regions that represent a wide range of environmental conditions were chosen for our breeding experiments: Porsangerfjord, Tystjord, Helgeland, and Oygarden. Cod were transported to Oygarden near Bergen, individually tagged, and kept in sea cages. In both 2003 and 2004, a total of 40 family groups (adult pairs) representing the four regions were monitored for their spawning performance in separate tanks. During the spawning period, the quantity and diameter of eggs were recorded. During 2003, the time of peak spawning differed among groups. It was evident that the broodstock from the Oygarden region spawned about one month earlier than the broodstock collected from the Helgeland region. This also occurred in 2004, two years after the cod were collected, suggesting that the difference has a genetic component. Differences in life history parameters between cod populations, such as spawning cycles as described here, could be adaptive and under genetic control. This must be taken into consideration when assessing precautionary means of overcoming the problem with escapees from future cod mariculture.

AB  - Population cycles have fascinated ecologists since the early nineteenth century, and the dynamics of insect populations have been central to understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic biological processes responsible for these cycles. We analyzed an extraordinary long-term data set (every 5 days for 48 years) of a tea tortrix moth (Adoxophyes honmai) that exhibits two dominant cycles: an annual cycle with a conspicuous pattern of four or five single-generation cycles superimposed on it. General theory offers several candidate mechanisms for generation cycles. To evaluate these, we construct and parameterize a series of temperature-dependent, stage-structured models that include intraspecific competition, parasitism, mate-finding Allee effects, and adult senescence, all in the context of a seasonal environment. By comparing the observed dynamics with predictions from the models, we find that even weak larval competition in the presence of seasonal temperature forcing predicts the two cycles accurately. None of the other mechanisms predicts the dynamics. Detailed dissection of the results shows that a short reproductive life span and differential winter mortality among stages are the additional life-cycle characteristics that permit the sustained cycles. Our general modeling approach is applicable to a wide range of organisms with temperature-dependent life histories and is likely to prove particularly useful in temperate systems where insect pest outbreaks are both density and temperature dependent.

AB  - The rapid development of new energy represented by wind power and photovoltaic power generation necessitates higher requirements for the flexibility of traditional thermal power generation units. The role of thermal power units will change from conventional main power to auxiliary power, not only because of the need for the survival and development of thermal power enterprises, but also because of the inevitable requirement for promoting the revolution of power energy production and consumption in China. The economy of thermal power unit flexibility transformation is an important constraint factor for decision-making in thermal power unit transformation. How to consider the economic factor of the thermal power unit transformation is a key problem for decision-making. In this paper, a nonlinear programming model is proposed to solve the problem. By introducing greedy strategy and improved reproduction strategy, an improved invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm is also proposed to solve the problem. Finally, a case study with three different scenario assumptions was conducted according to the most used transformation schemes of thermal power units in China, and the results were derived by using the proposed model and the improved IWO method. The comparative analysis of the results showed that the more the thermal power units participated in deep peak shaving, the greater the risk of the flexibility transformation of the thermal power units. In addition, under the condition of the same proportion of peak shaving, the risk of transformation without oil peak shaving was lower than that of oil peak shaving. Thus, the improved IWO algorithm can provide a stable and satisfactory solution. The research in this paper can provide a more scientific basis for decision-making on the flexibility transformation of the thermal power unit and can provide a reference for the selection of the flexibility transformation scheme of the thermal power unit.

AB  - The Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) are largely reliant on fossil fuels for electricity generations and this dependency makes these Island States immensely vulnerable to global fuel price volatility since the excess outflow of money on fuel imports not only affects the economic growth but also hinders the sustainable development. Additionally, waste management in these small countries is economically and environmentally expensive and mostly dumped in open/closed-dumps and landfills which decompose and releases notorious greenhouse gases (i.e., methane and carbon dioxide, etc.). Amalgamating these two disparate issues, this study aims to find a mutual solution by exploring the feasibility of waste-to-energy (WtE) potentials via different technologies at the selected sites. Using the population and per capita waste generation data of fifteen selected sites of eight PSIDS, a waste profile of each site is evaluated. Then, the waste generation over the projected 20 years is used to determine the electricity generation potential of each site under the proposed alternative scenarios (i.e., 2 - landfill gas to energy (LFGTE) technology, 3 - mass-burn incineration, 4 - hybrid mechanical-biological treated (MBT) anaerobic digestion (AD) and LFGTE technology, and 5 - hybrid MBT-AD and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) incineration). These four scenarios (2-5) are compared to the Business-as-Usual case denoted as scenario 1. To test the economic viability, the Net Present Value, Levelized Cost of Energy, and Payback Period of each site is ascertained. Further economic benefits are assessed through the recycling of materials including plastics (under scenario 4 only), glass, and metals (under all scenarios). Emissions and energy consumption of each scenario are analysed using the Waste Reduction Model (WARM). The outcome of this study revealed that scenario 3 offers the greatest potential in terms of electricity generation, at Port Moresby (PNG1), Papua New Guinea site having the highest potential (i.e., 78.86 GWh) and Kosrae (FSM4), Federated States of Micronesia has the lowest generation potential of only 92.86 MWh. This scenario 3 (mass-burn incineration) was also supported by the economic assessment. It was also found that recycling brought in additional economic benefits and also helped offset CO2-equivalent emissions and contributed towards energy savings. Multi-level multi-criteria decision analysis (ML-MCDA) was performed to select the most viable waste management alternative based on technical, economic, environmental, and stakeholder preferences. The priorities assigned to the respective scenarios for all fifteen sites were as such: scenario 3 > scenario 5 > scenario 4 > scenario 2 > scenario 1. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Empirically understanding spatial variation in secondary production rates is central to ecology. Yet for most taxa, such patterns are rarely examined, especially at different levels of ecological organization (e.g., species-vs. community-level patterns). We compiled data on biomass, production, and P/B rates of freshwater fish communities and species across latitudes and contrast patterns observed at the community level with those observed for species. At the community level, and at two distinct spatial scales (global vs. continental-North American), negative or neutral relationships were apparent between biomass, production, and P/B with latitude; however, there was substantial scatter in these data. Yet at the species level in North America, production was often closely linked to latitude, but in the opposite direction: Many species showed improved production with latitude. Latitudinal increases in species-level production rates were strongest for cool-and cold-water species, and species rarely showed the opposite trend. Species-level increases in production with latitude strengthened when production rates were normalized by the thermal opportunity for production, suggesting potential adaptations of individuals and populations to shorter growing seasons (i.e., "countergradient" production) at high latitudes. At the global scale, there were apparent unimodal relationships between community fish production measures and species richness; however, these patterns became linearized or non-significant at the continental scale. Decreased interspecific competition at northern latitudes combined with genetic adaptations (e.g., countergradient growth) could explain a tendency for increased species production in northern populations, while total community production remains reduced. Latitude has contrasting effects on fish production at different spatial scales and levels of biological organization. Thus while freshwater fish communities are somewhat more productive and diverse at lower latitudes, species production in northern populations is often surprisingly high.

AB  - Organismal characteristics of ectotherms are profoundly affected by body temperature (T-b). Despite constraints imposed by environmental factors, they can adjust T-b by several means. However, if thermoregulatory ability is limited by their own property such as coloration and this constraint affects individuals fitness, selection may promote coevolution of coloration and thermal aspects. I investigated this topic using a colour-dimorphic (melanistic/striped) snake Elaphe quadrivirgata as a model species. Recent laboratory experiment revealed slower body warming in striped individuals than in melanistic individuals. Under this circumstance, one way that striped individuals can manage their slower body warming is to prefer low Tb. Contrary to this prediction, there was no intermorph difference in preferred Tb. Coupled with the results of field studies, I suggest that striped individuals manage their slower body warming by behavioural thermoregulation and that constraints (e.g., high predation risk due to conspicuousness under thermally superior habitats) imposed on melanistic individuals lessen their thermal advantages. The effect of melanism on thermal aspects may not be so advantageous for melanistic animals than generally thought. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009.

AB  - The economic viability of producing baseload wind energy was explored using a cost-optimization model to simulate two competing systems: wind energy supplemented by simple- and combined cycle natural gas turbines ("wind+ gas"), and wind energy supplemented by compressed air energy storage ("wind+CAES"). Pure combined cycle natural gas turbines ("gas") were used as a proxy for conventional baseload generation. Long-distance electric transmission was integral to the analysis. Given the future uncertainty in both natural gas price and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions price, we introduced an effective fuel price, P-NGeff, being the sum of the real natural gas price and the GHG price. Under the assumption of P-NGeff = $5/GJ (lower heating value), 650 W/m(2) wind resource, 750 km transmission line, and a fixed 90% capacity factor, wind + CAES was the most expensive system at phi 6.0/kWh, and did not break even with the next most expensive wind + gas system until P-NGeff = $9.0/GJ. However, under real market conditions, the system with the least dispatch cost (short-run marginal cost) is dispatched first, attaining the highest capacity factor and diminishing the capacity factors of competitors, raising their total cost. We estimate that the wind + CAES system, with a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate that is one-fourth of that for natural gas combined cycle plants and about one-tenth of that for pulverized coal plants, has the lowest dispatch cost of the alternatives considered (lower even than for coal power plants) above a GHG emissions price of $35/tC(equiv), with good prospects for realizing a higher capacity factor and a lower total cost of energy than all the competing technologies over a wide range of effective fuel costs. This ability to compete in economic dispatch greatly boosts the market penetration potential of wind energy and suggests a substantial growth opportunity for natural gas in providing baseload power via wind + CAES, even at high natural gas prices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: On average, a person living in San Francisco can expect to live 83 years. This number conceals significant variation by sex, race, and place of residence. We examined deaths and area-based social factors by San Francisco neighborhood, hypothesizing that socially disadvantaged neighborhoods shoulder a disproportionate mortality burden across generations, especially deaths attributable to violence and chronic disease. These data will inform targeted interventions and guide further research into effective solutions for San Francisco's marginalized communities.
   STUDY DESIGN: The San Francisco Department of Public Health provided data for the 2010-2014 top 20 causes of premature death by San Francisco neighborhood. Population-level demographic data were obtained from the US American Community Survey 2015 5-year estimate (2011-2015). The primary outcome was the association between years of life loss (YLL) and adjusted years of life lost (AYLL) for the top 20 causes of death in San Francisco and select social factors by neighborhood via linear regression analysis and heatmaps.
   RESULTS: The top 20 causes accounted for N = 15,687 San Francisco resident deaths from 2010-2014. Eight neighborhoods (21.0%) accounted for 47.9% of city-wide YLLs, with 6 falling below the city-wide median household income and many having a higher percent population Black, and lower education and higher unemployment levels. For chronic diseases and homicides, AYLLs increased as a neighborhood's percent Black, below poverty level, unemployment, and below high school education increased.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the mortality inequity burdening socially disadvantaged San Francisco neighborhoods, which align with areas subjected to historical discriminatory policies like redlining. These data emphasize the need to address past injustices and move toward equal access to wealth and health for all San Franciscans. (C) 2022 by The Author(s).

AB  - A field survey was conducted in March 2009 in upland rice growing agro-ecosystem of four districts in Tanzania namely Ulanga, Kyela, Morogoro and Korogwe to investigate the agronomic and socioeconomic factors which influence rice productivity and suitability of these areas for NERICA cultivation so as to increase rice productivity. Questionnaire was used to gather primary information from ten farmers from each district. Secondary information was obtained from district agricultural offices and weather data from Tanzania Meteorological Agency. A composite soil sample was collected from upland rice fields of sampled farmers and analyzed for complete soil fertility. The findings showed that rice is the most important crop in all areas as both food and cash crop. However, rice yield is as low as 1 tha(-1). Low yields are attributed to diseases and pests, poor inputs, insufficient water, poor soil fertility, short supply of fertilizers and use of low yielding traditional varieties, among other factors. The soils are potentially low in nitrogen and phosphorus and therefore N and P fertilization is recommended. Rainfall and temperature pattern is adequate for NERICA cultivation which gives higher yields compared to traditional upland varieties under stress-prone environments such as poor soil fertility, disease and pests and moisture stress which characterize the upland agro-ecosystem.

AB  - There are significant opportunities for expansion of a forest bioenergy industry in Australia based on distributed electricity generation and production of liquid fuels (ethanol and bio-oil). If the large amounts of forest residues already available annually could be utilized, this would deliver useful greenhouse benefits, assist regeneration of new forests that have increased environmental values, and benefit silvicultural management. Creation of new forests in low rainfall environments for both environmental and commercial reasons will also provide residues in the future that could be used for energy production, thus enhancing overall viability of such ventures. Currently, there are several serious impediments to realising the potential. These include: center dot Large reserves of accessible coal, and low cost of electricity generated in coal-fired power plants. center dot Uncertain greenhouse and renewable energy policy (specifically that relating to implementation of the Mandated Renewable Energy Target (MRET)). center dot Lack of proven efficient small-scale technology to enable distributed electricity generation that would reduce transportation costs for delivery of biofuels. center dot Controversy over the sustainable use of native forest residues for renewable energy generation. center dot Lack of markets for environmental credits (carbon, salinity, biodiversity). center dot Lack of efficient processes for producing ethanol from wood, inadequate commercial products from lignin, and the need for further development before diesel engines can be run on bio-oil for stationary power generation and transport. In Australia, apart from the use of firewood for domestic heating, forest bioenergy has developed only to a very limited extent, despite the existence of significant opportunities. A major impediment to expansion is lack of public acceptance and support, especially for the use of native forest residues which are the main available biomass source. A concerted effort at several levels is needed to address this issue. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microorganisms are used in large-scale heap or tank aeration processes for the commercial extraction of a variety of metals from their ores or concentrates. These include copper, cobalt, gold and, in the past, uranium. The metal solubilization processes are considered to be largely chemical with the microorganisms providing the chemicals and the space ( exopolysaccharide layer) where the mineral dissolution reactions occur. Temperatures at which these processes are carried out can vary from ambient to 80 C and the types of organisms present depends to a large extent on the process temperature used. Irrespective of the operation temperature, biomining microbes have several characteristics in common. One shared characteristic is their ability to produce the ferric iron and sulfuric acid required to degrade the mineral and facilitate metal recovery. Other characteristics are their ability to grow autotrophically, their acid-tolerance and their inherent metal resistance or ability to acquire metal resistance. Although the microorganisms that drive the process have the above properties in common, biomining microbes usually occur in consortia in which cross-feeding may occur such that a combination of microbes including some with heterotrophic tendencies may contribute to the efficiency of the process. The remarkable adaptability of these organisms is assisted by several of the processes being continuous-flow systems that enable the continual selection of microorganisms that are more efficient at mineral degradation. Adaptability is also assisted by the processes being open and non-sterile thereby permitting new organisms to enter. This openness allows for the possibility of new genes that improve cell fitness to be selected from the horizontal gene pool. Characteristics that biomining microorganisms have in common and examples of their remarkable adaptability are described.

AB  - The standard material of the ceramic layer in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs)-a solid solution of ZrO(2)stabilized with (6-8 wt.%) Y2O3(YSZ)-approaches the temperature limit of its application (<1200 degrees C) because the ZrO(2)t ' phase sinters and undergoes t '-ZrO2 -> T-ZrO2+ F-ZrO(2)phase transformations to form M-ZrO(2)at elevated temperatures. Ceramic materials for a new generation of TBCs need to be developed to increase the operating temperature (up to 1600 degrees C), efficiency, and productivity of gas-turbine engines. The overview paper analyzes research efforts focusing on the development of TBCs using solid solutions of ZrO(2)with rare-earth metal and titanium oxides. When Y(2)O(3)in YSZ is partially substituted by CeO2, TiO2, La2O3, Sc2O3, Gd2O3, Nd2O3, Yb2O3, Er2O3, and Ta2O5, ceramics with high phase stability (ZrO(2)t ' phase being retained in the coating) up to 1500 degrees C, lower thermal conductivity, and required fracture toughness and sintering resistance but shorter thermal fatigue life than that of standard YSZ are produced. The concepts of greater tetragonality of the ZrO(2)t ' phase (ceramics in the ZrO2-CeO2-TiO(2)system) and a 'multicomponent defective cluster' (ceramics in the ZrO2-Y2O3-Nd2O3(Gd2O3, Sm2O3)-Yb2O3(Sc2O3) system) explain how the operating temperature of the TBC ceramic layer increases to 1350 degrees C and 1600 degrees C, respectively. The thermal conductivity of TBC ceramics in the binary ZrO2-CeO2, ZrO2-Er2O3, ZrO2-Sm2O3, ZrO2-Nd2O3, ZrO2-Gd2O3, ZrO2-Dy2O3, and ZrO2-Yb(2)O(3)systems is lower than that of YSZ. Ceramics with high phase stability and low thermal conductivity have been produced in the ternary ZrO2-Sc2O3-Gd2O3, ZrO2-CeO2-Gd2O3, ZrO2-YbO1.5-TaO2.5, and ZrO2-Yb2O3-TiO(2)systems. An integrated approach is needed to choose the composition of the ceramic layer based on the ZrO(2)solid solution, select the coating technique, and improve the coating architecture to design effective TBCs with balanced properties.

AB  - We have produced an innovative, theranostic material based on FePt/SiO2/Au hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) for both, photo-thermal therapy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, a new synthesis approach, i.e., Au double seeding, for the preparation of Au nanoshells around the FePt/SiO2 cores, is proposed. The photo-thermal and the MRI response were first demonstrated on an aqueous suspension of hybrid FePt/SiO2/Au NPs. The cytotoxicity together with the internalization mechanism and the intracellular fate of the hybrid NPs were evaluated in vitro on a normal (NPU) and a half-differentiated cancerous cell line (RT4). The control samples as well as the normal cell line incubated with the NPs showed no significant temperature increase during the in vitro photo-thermal treatment (Delta T < 0.8 degrees C) and thus the cell viability remained high (similar to 90%). In contrast, due to the high NP uptake by the cancerous RT4 cell line, significant heating of the sample was observed (Delta T = 4 degrees C) and, consequently, after laser irradiation the cell viability dropped significantly to similar to 60%. These results further confirm that the hybrid FePt/SiO2/Au NPs developed in the scope of this work were not only efficient but also highly selective photo-thermal agents. Furthermore, the improvement in the contrast and the easier distinction between the healthy and the cancerous tissues were clearly demonstrated with in vitro MRI experiments, proving that hybrid NPs have an excellent potential to be used as contrast agents.

AB  - Fluctuating water temperatures can affect fitness in fish when the opportunity to select habitats with appropriate temperature is limited. Despite the importance of the relationships between water temperature and host-pathogen interactions, reports on the susceptibility of fish to infectious viruses under conditions of changing water temperature are limited. Here, we compared the survival rates of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) infected with Cyprinid hopesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) in water in which the temperature varied from 22 degrees C +/- 3 degrees C and in water with a constant temperature of 22 degrees C or 25 degrees C. We also examined changes in concentrations of CyHV-3 DNA and cortisol released from infected fish into ambient water as indicators of CyHV-3 transmission and stress response, respectively. The survival rates of fish infected with CyHV-3 were lower, and concentrations of CyHV-3 DNA and cortisol were higher, in the fluctuating-temperature treatments than in the constant-temperature treatments. Our findings provide direct evidence that carp are highly susceptible to CyHV-3 infection when water temperatures change diurnally. Moreover, such temperature fluctuations can promote transmission of CyHV-3 in the wild. Preserving a variety of aquatic environments including water temperature may help to prevent disease outbreaks and to conserve fish populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - From 1989 to 1996, barbel in the River Ourthe started spawning under variable environmental conditions, except for water temperature. Each year, spawning was initiated when water daily minimum temperature reached or exceeded 13.5 degrees C. Any decrease of temperature below this value later in the spawning period caused spawning to be suspended. Analyses of offspring growth provided evidence that 13.5 degrees C was the value below which 0+ barbel stop growing. It was hypothesized that barbel trade off the lower initial probability of survival against a larger size at the onset of winter. To test empirically for this hypothesis, the adequacy of alternative-theoretical-strategies associated with other thermal thresholds (12, 15.0, 17.1 and 20.2 degrees C) was modelled with respect to: (1) the feasibility of spawning (inhibition of sexual maturation by a decreasing photoperiod): (2) the impact of the temperature on embryonic development; (3) the effect of water level variations on the integrity of spawning grounds until the emergence of larvae; (4) the size of the offspring at the onset of winter. On an 8-year (1989-1996) average, the present spawning strategy would have produced a higher recruitment than alternative strategies (relative adequacy of 33.23, 85.64, 93.17 and 17.62%, respectively). However, alternative strategies would have produced better annual scores on five of eight occasions in the River Ourthe environment. and a better overall score in environments 1.5 or 3.5 degrees C warmer than now. The consistency of the thermal threshold over years, despite a low selection pressure by the environment, was interpreted as the expression of a phenotypic mechanism (thermal homing) promoting the selection of the lowest efficient thermal threshold, and enabling breeders to relay to the next generation some form of thermal stability in a variable environment.

AB  - The pursuit of future energy systems that can meet electricity demands while supporting the attainment of societal environment goals, including mitigating climate change and reducing pollution in the air, has led to questions regarding the viability of continued use of natural gas. Natural gas use, particularly for electricity generation, has increased in recent years due to enhanced resource availability from non-traditional reserves and pressure to reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG) from higher-emitting sources, including coal generation. While lower than coal emissions, current natural gas power generation strategies primarily utilize combustion with higher emissions of GHG and criteria pollutants than other low-carbon generation options, including renewable resources. Furthermore, emissions from life cycle stages of natural gas production and distribution can have additional detrimental GHG and air quality (AQ) impacts. On the other hand, natural gas power generation can play an important role in supporting renewable resource integration by (1) providing essential load balancing services, and (2) supporting the use of gaseous renewable fuels through the existing infrastructure of the natural gas system. Additionally, advanced technologies and strategies including fuel cells and combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) systems can facilitate natural gas generation with low emissions and high efficiencies. Thus, the role of natural gas generation in the context of GHG mitigation and AQ improvement is complex and multi-faceted, requiring consideration of more than simple quantification of total or net emissions. If appropriately constructed and managed, natural gas generation could support and advance sustainable and renewable energy. In this paper, a review of the literature regarding emissions from natural gas with a focus on power generation is conducted and discussed in the context of GHG and AQ impacts. In addition, a pathway forward is proposed for natural gas generation and infrastructure to maximize environmental benefits and support renewable resources in the attainment of emission reductions.

AB  - Animal by-products (ABP) can be valorized via anaerobic digestion (AD) for biogas energy generation. The digestate issued from AD process is usually used to fertilize farming land for agricultural activities, which may cause potential sanitary risk to the environment. The European Union (EU) requires that certain ABP be thermally pasteurized in order to minimize this sanitary risk. This process is called hygienization, which can be replaced by alternative nonthermal technologies like pulsed electric field (PEF). In the present study, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as indicator bacteria. Their resistance to thermal pasteurization and PEF treatment were characterized. Results show that Ent. faecalis and E. coli are reduced by 5 log10 in less than 1 min during thermal pasteurization at 70 degrees C. The critical electric field strength was estimated at 18 kV center dot cm(-1) for Ent. faecalis and 1 kV center dot cm(-1) for E. coli. "G+" bacteria Ent. faecalis are generally more resistant than "G-" bacteria E. coli. AD process also plays an important role in pathogens inactivation, whose performance depends on the microorganisms considered, digestion temperature, residence time, and type of feedstock. Thermophilic digestion is usually more efficient in pathogens removal than mesophilic digestion.

AB  - Background: Predicting the effects of climate warming on the dynamics of ecological systems requires understanding how temperature influences birth rates, death rates and the strength of species interactions. The temperature dependance of these processes-which are the underlying mechanisms of ecological dynamics-is often thought to be exponential or unimodal, generally supported by short-term experiments. However, ecological dynamics unfold over many generations. Our goal was to empirically document shifts in predator-prey cycles over the full range of temperatures that can possibly support a predator-prey system and then to uncover the effect of temperature on the underlying mechanisms driving those changes.
   Methods: We measured the population dynamics of the Didinium-Paramecium predator-prey system across a wide range of temperatures to reveal systematic changes in the dynamics of the system. We then used ordinary differential equation fitting to estimate parameters of a model describing the dynamics, and used these estimates to assess the long-term temperature dependance of all the underlying mechanisms.
   Results: We found that predator-prey cycles shrank in state space from colder to hotter temperatures and that both cycle period and amplitude varied with temperature. Model parameters showed mostly unimodal responses to temperature, with one parameter (predator mortality) increasing monotonically with temperature and one parameter (predator conversion efficiency) invariant with temperature. Our results indicate that temperature can have profound, systematic effects on ecological dynamics, and these can arise through diverse and simultaneous changes in multiple underlying mechanisms. Predicting the effects of temperature on ecological dynamics may require additional investigation into how the underlying drivers of population dynamics respond to temperature beyond a short-term, acute response.

AB  - Combined heat and power (CBP) is a master term for onsite power generation technologies that simultaneously produce electrical or mechanical energy and useful energy. Cogeneration is now achieving a great level of acceptance due to increased reliability and overall cost efficiency. CBP technologies have the potential to reduce the energy consumption thus decreasing energy bills, as well as pollution. It is the performance of CHP plants, which determine the amount of energy saved, using these technologies.
   This paper outlines a specific method for assessing the feasibility of installing a reciprocating engine based on a combined heat and power system in the Dublin City University. It describes the basic models that are typically used by CB? industry for feasibility studies. The basis of this method relies on a specific calculation, which encompasses a twelve months result on electricity load profile, gas and electricity bills and operating times for the existing boiler plant.

TI  - Use of Non-Conductive Film (NCF) with Nano-sized Filler Particles for Solder Interconnect
T2  - 2016 IEEE 66TH ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (ECTC)
LA  - English
CP  - 66th IEEE Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)
AB  - As three-dimensional Through-Silicon Via (3DTSV) packaging is emerging in the semiconductor market to integrate multiple functions in a system for further miniaturization, thermal compression bonding (TCB), which stacks multiple bare chips on top of each other with Cu pillar bumps with solder cap, has become an indispensable new packaging technology.
   The novel non-conductive film (NCF) described in this paper is an epoxy-type thermosetting material in film form, with lower density of Nano-sized silica filler particles (average particle size is 100 Nano meters). Advantages of this NCF material with Nano-sized fillers include: transparency of the NCF material so that the TCB bonder's image recognition system can easily identify fiducial marks on the chip; ability of the Nano-filler to flow out with the NCF resin during thermal compression bonding, to mitigate filler entrapment between solder joints, which is critical to ensure reliable solder connections; compatibility with fine pitch applications with extremely narrow chip-to-chip and chip-to-substrate gaps to form void-free underfill. Instead of the previous processes of die attach, fluxing, traditional oven mass re flow, flux cleaning, and capillary underfill (CUF), the current process involves the use of NCF & TCB.
   The NCF is applied on a wafer in a film form by lamination, and then a wafer is diced with the pre laminated NCF in pieces. Then they are joined by TCB, with typical parameters of 250 C for 10 seconds with 80N (solder cap on 15pm diameter Cu pillar, 40pm pitch, 1000 bumps). NCF heated by TCB is quickly liquidized to lower its viscosity after a few seconds. Other advantages of NCF is that it has a fluxing function included in the material, which eliminates the need for separate flux apply and flux clean steps, which simplifies process and costs. Also, NCF can control extrusion along the package's edge line since NCF is a half-cured B-stage material which has some mechanical rigidity during handling and lamination.
   Thus NCF Thermal Compression Flip Chip Bonding method is the vital solution to ensure good reliability with mass productivity for next generation's packaging.
   The characterization of NCF material and the importance of controlling viscosity and elastic modulus during thermal-compression will be analyzed and discussed in this paper. Process and reliability data on test vehicles will be shown.

AB  - A hyperspectral imaging system was coupled to a precision, pulsed-jet, micro-dosing system to selectively deliver high-temperature, organic, food-grade oil for intra-row weed control in early growth tomatoes. The imaging system, based upon a multispectral Bayesian classifier, successfully discriminated the species of 95.9%, on average, of plant canopy for tomato, Solanum nigrum L and Amaranthus retroflexus L using canopy reflectance in the 384-810 nm range. Food-grade oil, heated to approximately 160 C, was applied to weeds using a pressurized micro-dosing pulsed-jet. The target application rate was approximately 0.85 mg/cm(2) in 10-ms-pulsed doses while traveling at a ground speed of 0.04 m/s. In an outdoor test, approximately 95.8% of S. nigrum and 93.8% of A. retroflexus were controlled 15 days post thermal treatment, while only 2.4% of the tomato plants received significant damage. Application coverage assessments of leaf surfaces immediately after the heated oil application found that tomato viability was retained if 50% or less of the leaf surface was inadvertently dosed, while 100% mortality was achieved for S. nigrum and A. retroflexus if more than 90% of their respective leaf surfaces were covered with heated oil.

AB  - Sorption enhanced methane reforming (SER), employing a CaO-based solid as a high temperature CO2 sorbent, is generally considered to be a promising route for H-2 production. In this paper we present a dynamic pseudo-homogeneous model to describe the operation of a packed bedreactor in which the SER reaction is carried out under adiabatic conditions. This reactor can be implemented according to several process schemes, including a novel Ca/Cu looping process for hydrogen generation with inherent CO2 capture. The proposed SER model is based on the well-established principles of gassolid contact and heat transfer in fixed-bedreactors and on the kinetic expressions published in the literature that describe the main reactions involved in the process. The resulting model describes the transient performance of the SER reaction and confirms the theoretical viability of this critical reaction stage in a large scale H-2 production facility. It is demonstrated that the SER process can yield a CH4 conversion and H-2 purity of up to 85% and 95%, respectively, under operating conditions of 923 K, 3.5 MPa, a steam/carbon ratio of 5 and a space velocity of 3.5 kg/m(2) s.

AB  - In Japan, the energy source for power generation depends mostly on foreign countries. Therefore, it is necessary to secure stable energy resources in our country. Wave energy has a very large amount of energy (Masuda 2008, Hiromichi et al. 2016, Tanaka et al., 2016).
   In this research, thermal fluid analysis software was used to numerical calculations to reproduce the hydraulic characteristics, the breaking wave and the overtopping wave. For wave power generation, there is an advantage that resources that are semi-permanent waves can be used. The structure of the overtopping wave power generator was mainly wall type and no-wall type under wave run-up slope area.
   At first this research, we summarize the types and characteristics of power generation methods using ocean energy. At second we focused on the extraction of unused wave energy and the overtopping wave power generation which can be effectively utilized. Numerical analysis of regulated waves was carried out to reproduce the hydraulic characteristics such as the behavior of the run-up, the catchment and the breaking wave and the transverse wave in the local quantity by using the thermo-fluid analysis software. Then the results of the breaking wave, the transient phenomenon for various wave conditions reproduction, and overflow wave flow rate were calculated. The overtopping flow rate and water storage rate were very important factors in such systems. Numerical calculation of regular waves on the influence of shape difference on overtopping flow rate and water storage rate were carried out.
   At third, to simulate actual sea conditions irregular waves were made for calculation. These results were compared with calculations of regular waves.
   At final, numerical calculation using regular waves and irregular waves showed that the influence of the difference in the shape of the structure on the maximum water overtopping storage rate. It was necessary to devise a structure that can be efficiently overtopped by irregular waves.

AB  - Background: Ectothermic organisms are thought to be severely affected by global warming since their physiological performance is directly dependent on temperature. Latitudinal and temporal variations in mean temperatures force ectotherms to adapt to these complex environmental conditions. Studies investigating current patterns of thermal adaptation among populations of different latitudes allow a prediction of the potential impact of prospective increases in environmental temperatures on their fitness.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, temperature reaction norms were ascertained among 18 genetically defined, natural clones of the microbial eukaryote Paramecium caudatum. These different clones have been isolated from 12 freshwater habitats along a latitudinal transect in Europe and from 3 tropical habitats (Indonesia). The sensitivity to increasing temperatures was estimated through the analysis of clone specific thermal tolerances and by relating those to current and predicted temperature data of their natural habitats. All investigated European clones seem to be thermal generalists with a broad thermal tolerance and similar optimum temperatures. The weak or missing co-variation of thermal tolerance with latitude does not imply local adaptation to thermal gradients; it rather suggests adaptive phenotypic plasticity among the whole European subpopulation. The tested Indonesian clones appear to be locally adapted to the less variable, tropical temperature regime and show higher tolerance limits, but lower tolerance breadths.
   Conclusions/Significance: Due to the lack of local temperature adaptation within the European subpopulation, P. caudatum genotypes at the most southern edge of their geographic range seem to suffer from the predicted increase in magnitude and frequency of summer heat waves caused by climate change.

AB  - Spatially explicit crop models were developed from mechanistic principles to investigate the regional impacts of climate change. The approach highlights the spatial variability of crop responses to altered environmental conditions. The mechanistic nature of the models allows some confidence to be placed in the results that are produced under climate change scenarios. Two crop models have been constructed and applied across a large European region: EuroWheat (winter wheat) and EuroSunfl (sunflower). Model results were compared with observed phenology and yield across a variety of scales and found to capture the current spatial variability in wheat and sunflower productivity. Climate change scenarios from both equilibrium and transient general circulation model experiments were applied to each crop model. Wheat yields are predicted to increase throughout Europe for all climate change scenarios. Conversely, water-limited sunflower yields decrease in most regions and scenarios. More positive effects are predicted for winter wheat than sunflower due to a lower sensitivity to increased temperature and a higher sensitivity to elevated concentrations of CO2. The lowest yield increases for wheat and the largest yield decreases for sunflower are found in western Europe, whilst the most positive responses for both crops occur in central and eastern Europe. Predictions for southern Europe are highly sensitive both within the region and between the scenarios. The old generation of equilibrium climate change scenarios gives the worst predictions (lowest yield increases or highest yield decreases). More beneficial responses are observed for the new generation of transient scenarios for both wheat and sunflower. Area averaged results for Europe, based on the United Kingdom Meterorological Office transient experiment (UKTR), indicate a rate of increase in winter wheat yields of 0.2 t ha(-1) decade(-1) up to the 2020s and 0.36 t ha(-1) decade(-1) beyond. Smaller changes are predicted for sunflower: a rate of decrease of 0.05 t ha(-1) decade(-1) up to the 2020s followed by an increase of 0.05 t ha(-1) decade(-1).

AB  - Estuarine copepods are considered ecological relevant components in the marine trophic webs and have high phenotypic plasticity and adaptability to face the environmental variations coastal marine ecosystems typically show. This work aims to assess the Acartia tonsa food availability, egg production, and female survival in an urban-industrial sewage discharge site (Canal Vieja, CV) and a non-disturbed site by sewage (Bahia del Medio, BM) from the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina. Acartia tonsa females and microplankton samples, used as natural food, were taken during the austral warm season 2008-2009. The experimental incubations of the females were performed in a laboratory simulating the in situ environmental conditions. The microplankton showed different composition and abundance values between both studied sites. The survival of females showed significant differences between the sites, but the egg production did not show clear differences between them. A positive correlation was found among egg production, diatom, and tintinnid-ciliate abundances. A low female survival (16.5%) was observed when high ammonium concentrations (35.15 mu M) were recorded at CV. The concentration of nitrogenous nutrients, especially ammonium, along with pH and turbidity, were the drivers explaining the variation in the reproductive performance and survival of A. tonsa. Our findings further understand the reproductive performance, plasticity, and survival of key planktonic organisms in polluted coastal areas. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As rising temperatures threaten biodiversity across the globe, tropical ectotherms are thought to be particularly vulnerable due to their narrow thermal tolerance ranges. Nevertheless, physiology-based models highlighting the vulnerability of tropical organisms rarely consider the contributions of their gut microbiota, even though microbiomes influence numerous host traits, including thermal tolerance. We combined field and lab experiments to understand the response of the slender anole lizard (Anolis apletophallus) gut microbiome to climatic shifts of various magnitude and duration. First, to examine the effects of long-term climate warming in the wild, we transplanted lizards from the mainland Panama to a series of warmer islands in the Panama Canal and compared their gut microbiome compositions after three generations of divergence. Next, we mimicked the effects of a short-term "heat-wave" by using a greenhouse experiment and explored the link between gut microbiome composition and lizard thermal physiology. Finally, we examined variation in gut microbiomes in our mainland population in the years both before and after a naturally occurring drought. Our results suggest that slender anole microbiomes are surprisingly resilient to short-term warming. However, both the taxonomic and predicted functional compositions of the gut microbiome varied by sampling year across all sites, suggesting that the drought may have had a regional effect. We provide evidence that short-term heat waves may not substantially affect the gut microbiota, while more sustained climate anomalies may have effects at broad geographic scales. IMPORTANCE As climate change progresses, it is crucial to understand how animals will respond to shifts in their local environments. One component of this response involves changes in the microbial communities living in and on host organisms. These "microbiomes" can affect many processes that contribute to host health and survival, yet few studies have measured changes in the microbiomes of wild organisms experiencing novel climatic conditions. We examined the effects of shifting climates on the gut microbiome of the slender anole lizard (Anolis apletophallus) by using a combination of field and laboratory studies, including transplants to warm islands in the Panama Canal. We found that slender anole microbiomes remain stable in response to short-term warming but may be sensitive to sustained climate anomalies, such as droughts. We discuss the significance of these findings for a species that is considered highly vulnerable to climate change.

AB  - Intraspecific genetic variation across the distribution of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy suggests the existence of divergent stocks among major river drainages. Often, stocks differentiate in response to latitudinal variation in thermal regime. Genetic variation and thermal adaptation may drive fish to either maximize growth during brief growing seasons at higher latitudes (counter-gradient growth) or experience longer periods of slower growth at lower latitudes (cogradient growth). The strength and direction of these genetic effects matter for fish stocked outside of their native drainage and for populations experiencing changes to regional thermal regimes. We used a replicated pond experiment with uniform initial fish size and environmental conditions to compare the survival and growth of stocked age-0 Ohio River drainage (OH) Muskellunge with those of the more northerly upper Mississippi River drainage (MISS) stock following their first winter and a year after introduction into a common environment. Both stocks had similarly high winter survival, though the MISS stock had a slower growth rate overwinter than the OH stock. Survival during the latter spring-to-fall period was greatly reduced for the MISS stock, however, with the differences in growth rate persisting. These findings suggest that cogradient adaptation to temperatures experienced during early life stages in native environments results in a disadvantage for high-latitude stocks of Muskellunge in thermal regimes warmer than those they have historically experienced in their native drainages.

AB  - In a patchy environment, animals must make habitat choices, presumably based on environmental cues that provide reliable fitness-related information. Capelin Mallotus villosus is a small (<200 mm), short-lived (3-6 years) forage fish that spawns adhesive eggs in 2 habitats with divergent temperature regimes: beach (warm, variable) and deep water (demersal; cool, stable). In 2009 and 2010, I investigated the influence of temperature on spawning habitat selection in coastal Newfoundland by quantifying habitat-specific temperature, population-level habitat use, and individual-level movements of male capelin via acoustic telemetry. Drastically, different temperature in both years was associated with divergent habitat use. Capelin spawned only at beaches in 2009, when temperatures were significantly colder and frequently fell below suitable ranges at demersal sites (2-12 degrees C), whereas demersal sites were predominantly used under opposing conditions in 2010. Most male capelin (76%, n = 22) were detected in one habitat only per year (beach: 10%, n = 3; demersal: 66%, n = 19). Males detected in both habitats (17%, n = 5) primarily dispersed from the initial habitat when temperatures routinely fell outside of suitable ranges. This movement often involved traveling long distances (11.0-32.7 km) against currents, suggesting energetic costs. Other males (7%, n = 2) were only detected at unused sites in 2009, implying these fish did not spawn despite having developed secondary sexual characteristics. Overall, temperature appeared to be an important environmental cue for habitat selection by capelin. The flexible use of spawning habitats under divergent temperature conditions suggests that capelin have a high capacity to respond to and possibly tolerate predicted ocean-climate change.

AB  - The Earth's climate is changing at a rapid pace. To survive in increasingly fluctuating and unpredictable environments, species can either migrate or evolve through rapid local adaptation, plasticity and/or bet-hedging. For small ectotherm insects, like parasitoids and their hosts, phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging could be critical strategies for population and species persistence in response to immediate, intense and unpredictable temperature changes. Here, we focus on studies evaluating phenotypic responses to variable predictable thermal conditions (for which phenotypic plasticity is favoured) and unpredictable thermal environments (for which bet-hedging is favoured), both within and between host and parasitoid generations. We then address the effects of fluctuating temperatures on host-parasitoid interactions, potential cascading effects on the food web, as well as biological control services. We conclude our review by proposing a road map for designing experiments to assess if plasticity and bet-hedging can be adaptive strategies, and to disentangle how fluctuating temperatures can affect the evolution of these two strategies in parasitoids and their hosts.

AB  - With the advancement of civilization, water purification, as well as management and disposal of ever-increasing municipal solid waste (MSW), and e-waste, have become global concerns. To address these issues in a sustainable way, a 3D solar evaporator has been proposed in this paper by repurposing recycled paper from MSW in the form of egg trays and waste dry toner (e-waste) using a facile fabrication method. The unique 3D porous structure, fibrous surface, superior water absorbing capability as well as low thermal conductivity of wastepaper-derived egg trays make them an excellent candidate for an efficient solar evaporator, while the waste toner powder coating significantly enhances the optical absorbance capacity. Under 1 sun illumination, the proposed solar evaporator demonstrates an excellent evaporation rate and efficiency of 1.3 kg/m(2) h and 78.5%, respectively. Moreover, the competitive advantage of the 3D structure in collecting solar irradiance at various light incident angles in comparison to a 2D structure, excellent cycle stability, low processing temperature, and the use of low-cost waste materials enable its use for large-scale water purification systems.

AB  - It is generally accepted that populations of most species experience some level of density dependence: however, this has rarely been shown for soil-dwelling invertebrate species, in particular for earthworms. Experimental data, mostly obtained at high laboratory densities, suggest intense intraspecific competition for resources and/or living space and density-dependent dynamics in earthworm populations, irrespective of their ecological group affiliation. In the present study performed in large field microcosms, I investigated whether density-dependent responses occur within the earthworm density gradients more realistic for the natural sites. Five lumbricid species from epigeic (Dendrobaena octaedra, Lumbricus rubellus), endogeic (Allolobophora chlorotica, Aporrectodea caliginosa) and anecic (Lumbricus terrestris) ecological groups were tested. Soil systems populated with earthworm monocultures in large (20-L) microcosms were exposed in a beech-oak forest for 4.5 months; each species was represented by two (L. terrestris) or three treatments forming gradients of increasing density. In two endogeic species, manifold and generally similar density-dependent responses (a retardation of growth, maturation and reproduction rates, but higher mortality rates with density increase) were revealed, likely explained by spatial competition rather than by direct food competition. In each of epigeic species density-dependent responses were less variable and more species-specific. In contrast to endogeics, direct food competition was presumably a more important cause of density-dependence. In L. terrestris no significant density-dependent responses in adult earthworms were revealed; however, they need to be further investigated in relation to the age and territorial behaviour of individual earthworms. Importantly, in any earthworm species the density variations in the reproducing generation had significant consequences for the advancing generation, affecting either the numbers or/and the size (individual weight) of the cocoons produced. It is suggested that an underestimation of density dependent processes may cause inaccurate estimates of the activities of local lumbricid populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Burrow use is an important component of the behavioral repertoire of many terrestrial reptiles. The availability and/or selection of suitable burrows within the environment may have consequences for fitness as retreat site selection can affect the physiology and ecology of an animal. Thermal behavior and microhabitat selection may vary with respect to ambient temperatures, humidity levels, and the digestive state of the organism. To understand behavioral and physiological regulation mechanisms, we investigated the thermal biology of the Tuatara, Sphenodon punctatus, a medium-sized reptile that use underground burrows as general shelter. We gave captive, juvenile Tuatara a series of choices between burrows varying in temperature and humidity while in a fed or post-absorptive state. We did this to test hypotheses that Tuatara choose burrows based on temperature and humidity, and that those choices may change with the metabolic requirements of digestion. Tuatara selected warm temperatures regardless of digestive state, humidity, or time of the day. However, there was a clear diel trend in thermoregulatory behavior with Tuatara maintaining warmer body temperatures and using warmer parts of the gradient during the day. Tuatara were outside their burrows and moved about the thermal gradient more often during the night. Tuatara selected higher temperatures on the gradient under the dry treatment than they did in the humid treatment. However, Tuatara were outside their burrows in greater numbers under the humid treatment compared to the dry. Digestive state had no discernable effect on either temperatures selected or burrow use. This study provides experimental evidence that reptiles are capable of adjusting their habitat selection behavior in response to differing humidity constraints.

AB  - Many problems appear in the sintering process of vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite, such as high energy consumption and low productivity; sinter quality is also very poor for its low tumble strength and high reduction degradation. Sinter productivity and quality are dominated by bed permeability and mineralogy structure, which are highly influenced by the thermal state of sintering bed, so the sintering process of titanomagnetite is researched by bed dissection in this work. Temperature evolution curves of sinter materials were measured, and the results show that melting duration, peak temperature duration and sintering temperature of different layers differ greatly from each other; flame front speed and vertical sintering speed of bed lower region are much smaller than those of bed upper region. Simultaneously, sinter samples were collected from different layers, and their mineralogy characteristics are analyzed; sinters from bed lower region have poor mineralogy structure, and the amounts of perovskite and dicalcium silicate increase intensively, which are bad for sinter strength and reduction degradation property. Measures are proposed to improve the quality and productivity of titanomagnetite sinter.

AB  - A biological control strategy aimed at enhancing the performance in the field of two predatory mites that are natural enemies of an invasive pest of avocado orchards was applied during two consecutive years. Unexpected poor pest control led us to analyse additional factors involved in the dynamics of the community such as summer environmental conditions, which were very hot and dry. Non-linear regressions considering biotic and abiotic effects suggested that high temperatures during the second half of the summer were central to predator/prey population dynamics. Harsh environmental conditions were therefore a direct cause of biological control disruption. We believe that, in the future, the success of biological control strategies will be limited by the natural enemy's capacity to respond adaptatively to rapid climate changes, and that research aimed at evaluating the evolutionary potential of natural enemies to rapid climate change should be the focus of future investigations.

AB  - Studies on aggressiveness of parasitoids, as assessed by their parasitism against pests, used in biological-control programs are highly important to select the most suitable species and/or strain to control insect pests. The present study investigated whether the egg parasitoid Trichogramma galloi Zucchi, an efficient control agent for sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius) in Brazil, could be replaced by Trichogramma atopovirilia Oatman & Platner, a parasitoid easier to mass-produce, since it has been found parasitizing D. saccharalis eggs in the warmest region of Brazil and Argentina. Three strains of the genus Trichogramma were compared: T. atopovirilia (ATP strain) reared on a factitious host Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller); T. atopovirilia isoline ATP-I, reared on D. saccharalis eggs for six generations; and T. galloi, reared on A. kuehniella eggs. We measured parasitism of each strain for 72 h and for the entire life span, parasitism rate per cluster of D. saccharalis eggs, number of parasitoids emerged (parasitism viability), and parasitoid life span. The results confirmed that T. galloi is the best species for D. saccharalis control, showing higher control potential, since parasitism and emergence rate were higher for this species. Although T. atopovirilia ATP-I performed reliably in all parameters, T. galloi exceeded and was the most indicated for mass-rearing in control programs for sugarcane borer.

AB  - Tail autotomy is an antipredatory defense that allows lizards to escape predator attacks by shedding their tails. While the benefits of preserving life are indisputable, tail loss implies a number of physiological, social, reproductive and even metabolic costs derived from tail regeneration and reduced motility. In addition, predation risk is increased in lizards with autotomized tails. Metabolic rates increase with body temperature, which in ectotherms depends on external heat sources. Ectotherm thermoregulation is costly in terms of time consumption and exposure to predators, this cost depending on habitat thermal quality. In this work, we seek to disentangle the effects of tail autotomy on field and selected body temperature of an accurately thermoregulating lizard Psammodromus algirus in different thermal environments along a 2200-m elevational gradient. We test two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. According to a physiological hypothesis, we expect lizards with autotomized tails to show higher body temperatures that allow them to regenerate lost tissues faster, at least when the thermal environment is not limiting (at mid and low elevations). By contrast, according to an ethological hypothesis, we expect lizards with autotomized tails to avoid exposure to predators by reducing thermoregulation time, thus showing lower temperatures than lizards with non-autotomized tails. However, we found that the tail state did not significantly affect lizard field or selected body temperatures. On the one hand, a warmer thermal optimum could imply greater exposure to predators during basking, making motility-impaired lizards with autotomized tails more vulnerable, which could explain why the physiological hypothesis of autotomy thermal effect does not apply. On the other hand, lower body temperatures could be physiologically costly for lizards, which, together with the other costs resulting from tail autotomy, could jeopardize lizard fitness. Therefore, both hypotheses were not supported.

AB  - This study proposed an integrated process for biogas generation and biochar production from thermal hydrolysis pretreated sludge (THP sludge). In this study, the liquid and solids fractions of THP sludge were separately processed for the first time. The liquid fraction of THP sludge (THP-L) reached the biodegradability (262.6 +/- 5.1 mL CH4/g tCOD(feed)) on the 15th day during anaerobic treatment, while the solids fraction of THP sludge (THP-S) only contributed 31.0% to the total methane production and required more than 30 days digestion time. We investigated the feasibility to convert THP-S into biochar to realize the higher value of the solids fraction. The results prove the produced biochar can be used as slow-release fertilizer. Preliminary energy analysis was performed to evaluate the energy efficiency of the integrated approach, namely, methane generation from THP-L coupled with biochar production from THP-S. The process realized energy surplus of 0.81 MWh/tonne dry sludge. In addition, THP-L digested sludge showed better dewaterability, lower yield stress and reduced viscosity during digestion. The proposed new sludge treatment process therefore has lower operating cost and higher value returns. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent climate change has re-invigorated scientific interest in the dynamics of geographic distributions of organisms. Climate responses and their biogeographical ramifications can be predicted indirectly by studying variation in fitness-related traits across environmental gradients in wide-ranging species. We review evidence for such variation in reptiles. Clinal variation in seasonal timing (onset) of nesting is common but may offer only minor compensation. In contrast, clinal variation in nesting behavior in two wide-ranging species suggests that reptiles can use nest site choice to counter climate differences. We suggest that when range boundaries located at climate extremes are determined by thermal conditions of embryos (vs. the adult stage) they cannot be predicted by the combination of environmental temperatures and thermal tolerances of embryos alone. We propose that nest site choice can reduce or eliminate the environmental variation that would be experienced by embryos in nests selected randomly with respect to temperature or factors influencing temperature. We also hypothesize that this compensation is limited at climate extremes; when temperatures are too cold for behavioral compensation (e.g., due to lack of suitably warm nest sites), reptiles can only invade colder climates by evolving viviparity. Animals with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are more vulnerable to climate change than those with genetic sex determination (GSD) because the complete production of one sex in TSD species would occur before complete embryonic failure in GSD species. Collectively, research on reptiles suggests that range boundaries at climate extremes are determined by: (1) thermal limits and compensatory thermoregulation of free-living adults; (2) thermal limits of embryos; (3) the extent of compensatory nest site choice behavior; (4) mode of sex determination; and in cold climates (5) reproductive mode (oviparity vs. viviparity).

AB  - Although it is well known that insects are sensitive to temperature, how they will be affected by ongoing global warming remains uncertain because these responses are multifaceted and ecologically complex. We reviewed the effects of climate warming on 31 globally important phytophagous (plant-eating) insect pests to determine whether general trends in their responses to warming were detectable. We included four response categories (range expansion, life history, population dynamics, and trophic interactions) in this assessment. For the majority of these species, we identified at least one response to warming that affects the severity of the threat they pose as pests. Among these insect species, 41% showed responses expected to lead to increased pest damage, whereas only 4% exhibited responses consistent with reduced effects; notably, most of these species (55%) demonstrated mixed responses. This means that the severity of a given insect pest may both increase and decrease with ongoing climate warming. Overall, our analysis indicated that anticipating the effects of climate warming on phytophagous insect pests is far from straightforward. Rather, efforts to mitigate the undesirable effects of warming on insect pests must include a better understanding of how individual species will respond, and the complex ecological mechanisms underlying their responses.

AB  - Methyl esters (ME) and triacetin production from the supercritical interesterification of the product from low pressure extraction (crambe seed oil and methyl acetate) are evaluated. Reactions are conducted at 300-375 degrees C for different residence times, at 20 MPa, and under these conditions the thermal stability of triacetin is evaluated. The effect of the free fatty acid (FFA) concentration (in oil) is determined. An increase in temperature favors the formation of ME and triacetin at shorter reaction times. At 375 degrees C, after 15 min a drop in the ME yield is observed and triacetin is not detected. A reduction in the triacetin concentration (reaching approximate to 99%) is observed at 375 degrees C. High FFA concentration (in oil) initially provided higher product generation, however, after 15 min no influence is observed. The highest ME yield (approximate to 60%) is obtained at 300 degrees C, along with 1.22 wt% triacetin and approximate to 5.0 wt% unreacted compounds.
   Practical Applications: This paper reports new experimental data on an integrated process for the production of methyl esters from low pressure extraction (crambe seeds and methyl acetate) and supercritical reaction of the extraction mixture. The technique used allows the removal of a high quantity of oil from good quality crambe seeds. The viability of applying the integrated process to obtain oils with a high content of free fatty acids is verified, promoting the obtainment of relatively simple methyl esters. The procedure does not require oil purification and solvent recovery prior to the reaction.

AB  - We examined the relationship between survival of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) fawns at Trois Fontaines, Champagne-Ardennes, France, and factors related to bed-site selection (predator avoidance and thermoregulation) and maternal food resources (forage availability in the maternal home range). Previous studies have demonstrated that at small scales, the young of large herbivores select bed sites independently from their mothers, although this selection takes place within the limits of their mother's home range. Fawn survival was influenced largely by the availability of good bed sites within the maternal home range, not by the fawn's selection of bed sites; however, selection for thermal cover when selecting bed sites positively influenced survival of young fawns. Typical features of a good home range included close proximity to habitat edges, which is related to forage accessibility for roe deer. The availability of bed sites changed as fawns aged, probably due to an increased mobility of the fawn or a different use of the home range by the mother; sites offering high concealment and thermal protection became less available in favor of areas with higher forage accessibility. Despite the minor influence of bed-site selection on survival, roe deer fawns strongly selected their bed sites according to several environmental factors linked to predator avoidance and thermoregulation. Fawns selected for sites providing concealment, light penetration, and avoided signs of wild boar (Sus scrofa) activity. Avoidance of sites with high light penetration by young fawns positively affected their survival, confirming a negative effect on thermoregulation due to reduced thermal cover. Selection for light penetration by older fawns was less clear. We discuss these results in the context of cross-generational effects in habitat selection across multiple scales, and the potential influence of the 'ghost of predation past'.

AB  - A high temperature cascade heat pump (HTCHP) system using low-grade heat from waste water to generate steam for industrial processes is studied from the thermodynamic and economic view. The effects of intermediate temperature, heat source temperature, heat sink temperature, working fluids, and the pinch point temperature difference at the evaporator, condenser, and intermediate heat exchanger on the thermodynamic performance and cost-effectiveness of the HTCHP system are investigated. The PBP varying with the gas price and electricity price is evaluated as well. The results show that optimal intermediate temperatures exist under different operational conditions, not only for the COP, but also for the PBP. A high heat source temperature and low heat sink temperature are conducive to increasing the COP and shortening the PBP. Working fluid pair R1234Ze(E)-R1233zd(Z) shows a promising application in the HTCHP system for its relatively high COP, short PBP, and low GWP. A lower pinch point temperature difference will cause a higher COP and shorter PBP, but a higher SEC. The energy price has a great effect on the economic viability of the system. When the price ratio is lower than 1.81, the PBP is lower than 4.6 years.

AB  - Jatropha curcas has been intensively investigated recently as a biodiesel feedstock producer because of its adaptability to adverse soil and climatic conditions. It has been seen that increasing value from by-products of oil production is important for the viability of the crop for the farmers. The seed kernel meal left after oil extraction is potentially of high market value as an animal feed ingredient. Every kilogram of oil produced from jatropha seeds generates about 0.75 kg of high quality seed kernel meal. It has a high protein content (65% on a dry matter basis) with a favourable amino acid composition, but is toxic because of the presence of compounds called phorbol esters. We introduce a non-toxic jatropha variety where phorbol esters are absent in the seeds and hence, the kernel meal can be included in animal feeds after conventional heat treatment similar to that done for soybean meal. Preliminary observations in a field trial indicates that there are non-toxic jatropha provenances that are similar to or better than the conventional toxic jatropha varieties in seed yield per plant and seed oil content. Non-toxic jatropha has potential as a viable bio-oil crop if high quality seeds are used for developing the plantation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent advances in molecular interrogation techniques now allow unprecedented genomic inference about the role of adaptive genetic divergence in wild populations. We used high-throughput genotyping to screen a genome-wide panel of 276 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the economically and culturally important salmonid Oncorhynchus mykiss. Samples included 805 individuals from 11 anadromous and resident populations from the northwestern United States and British Columbia, and represented two major lineages including paired populations of each life history within single drainages of each lineage. Overall patterns of variation affirmed clear distinctions between lineages and in most instances, isolation by distance within them. Evidence for divergent selection at eight candidate loci included significant landscape correlations, particularly with temperature. High diversity of two nonsynonymous mutations within the peptide-binding region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (DAB) gene provided signatures of balancing selection. Weak signals for potential selection between sympatric resident and anadromous populations were revealed from genome scans and allele frequency comparisons. Our results suggest an important adaptive role for immune-related functions and present a large genomic resource for future studies

AB  - Cities are particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change, causing an increasing incidence of heat waves. Extreme temperatures can impair the use of public spaces in cities, as heat stress endangers human well-being and health. Identifying suitable adaptation measures to maintain the full functionality of public spaces requires a multidimensional approach, accounting for interrelated scientific, social, and practical aspects. As one result we introduce an inter- and transdisciplinary concept that addresses the challenge of adapting public spaces to climate change. Additionally we present a pilot study from Heidelberg, Germany, where a new, sustainable urban quarter experienced more pronounced heat stress than the historic city centre in the hot and dry summer of 2018. The study shows the suitability of our approach to identify appropriate heat adaptation measures. Solar potential modelling and mental map surveys proved to be particularly effective methods. We find that adaptation measures generate synergy effects by improving both climatic and social conditions.

AB  - Phenotypic differences between populations often correlate with climate variables, resulting from a combination of environment-induced plasticity and local adaptation. Species comprising populations that are genetically adapted to local climatic conditions should be more vulnerable to climate change than those comprising phenotypically plastic populations. Assessment of local adaptation generally requires logistically challenging experiments. Here, using a unique approach and a large dataset (> 50,000 observations from across Britain), we compare the covariation in temperature and first spawning dates of the common frog ( Rana temporaria) across space with that across time. We show that although all populations exhibit a plastic response to temperature, spawning earlier in warmer years, between-population differences in first spawning dates are dominated by local adaptation. Given climate change projections for Britain in 2050-2070, we project that for populations to remain as locally adapted as contemporary populations will require first spawning date to advance by similar to 21-39 days but that plasticity alone will only enable an advance of similar to 5-9 days. Populations may thus face a microevolutionary and gene flow challenge to advance first spawning date by a further similar to 16-30 days over the next 50 years.

AB  - Infectious agents such as the bacteria Vibrio aestuarianus or Ostreid herpesvirus 1 have been repeatedly associated with dramatic disease outbreaks of Crassostrea gigas beds in Europe. Beside roles played by these pathogens, microbial infections in C. gigas may derive from the contribution of a larger number of microorganisms than previously thought, according to an emerging view supporting the polymicrobial nature of bivalve diseases. In this study, the microbial communities associated with a large number of C. gigas samples collected during recurrent mortality episodes at different European sites were investigated by real-time PCR and 16SrRNA gene-based microbial profiling. A new target enrichment next-generation sequencing protocol for selective capturing of 884 phylogenetic and virulence markers of the potential microbial pathogenic community in oyster tissue was developed allowing high taxonomic resolution analysis of the bivalve pathobiota. Comparative analysis of contrasting C. gigas samples conducted using these methods revealed that oyster experiencing mortality outbreaks displayed signs of microbiota disruption associated with the presence of previously undetected potential pathogenic microbial species mostly belonging to genus Vibrio and Arcobacter. The role of these species and their consortia should be targeted by future studies aiming to shed light on mechanisms underlying polymicrobial infections in C. gigas.

AB  - Hagberg falling number (FN) is an important quality trait used for grain grading. The FN test can only be measured in the late stages of variety development when progeny are homogeneous and sufficient grain is available for testing. The FN is strongly influenced by environmental conditions during reproductive growth stages, including excess moisture, extreme temperature, and biotic and abiotic stresses. The objective of this study was to identify potential genomic regions that influence FN in a subset of 110 hard white spring (HWS) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accessions from the National Small Grain Collection (NSGC) using genome-wide association mapping. The FN tests were conducted using grain flour samples of these accessions grown in five environments. A total of 1740 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to detect SNP-FN associations using both the general linear model (GLM) and the mixed linear model (MLM). Thirteen quantitative trait loci (QTL) located in nine chromosomal regions were identified in both GLM and MLM approaches. Pyramiding these QTL could explain up to 45% of the phenotypic variation of FN. The present study identified several potential markers for use in marker-assisted selection for high FN lines in wheat breeding.

AB  - Due to its antimicrobial and healing-promoting effects, the application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) appears to be a promising modality in various fields of general medicine and dentistry. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of a handheld device utilizing ambient air for plasma generation. Suspensions of 11 oral bacteria (among them Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus gordonii, and Tannerella forsythia) were exposed to CAP for 10, 30, 60, and 120 s. Before and after treatment, colony forming unit (CFU) counts were determined. Then, 12-species biofilms were cultured on dentin and titanium specimens, and CAP was applied for 30, 60, and 120 s before quantifying CFU counts, biofilm mass, and metabolic activity. A reduction of >= 3 log(10) CFU, was found for ten out of the eleven tested species at 30 s (except for T. forsythia) and for all species at 60 s. For biofilm grown on dentin and titanium specimens, the log(10) reductions were 2.43 log(10) CFU/specimen and by about 4 log(10) CFU/specimen after 120 s of CAP. The CAP application did not reduce the biomass significantly, the metabolic activity of the biofilms on dentin and titanium decreased by 98% and 95% after 120 s of CAP. An application of 120 s of CAP had no cytotoxic effect on gingival fibroblasts and significantly increased the adhesion of gingival fibroblasts to the titanium surface. These results are promising and underline the potential of CAP for implementation in periodontal and peri-implantitis therapy.

TI  - Genomic determinants of coral heat tolerance across latitudes
T2  - SCIENCE

KW  - RAPID CLIMATE-CHANGE

KW  - RESILIENCE
AB  - As global warming continues, reef-building corals could avoid local population declines through "genetic rescue" involving exchange of heat-tolerant genotypes across latitudes, but only if latitudinal variation in thermal tolerance is heritable. Here, we show an up-to-10-fold increase in odds of survival of coral larvae under heat stress when their parents come from a warmer lower-latitude location. Elevated thermal tolerance was associated with heritable differences in expression of oxidative, extracellular, transport, andmitochondrial functions that indicated a lack of prior stress. Moreover, two genomic regions strongly responded to selection for thermal tolerance in interlatitudinal crosses. These results demonstrate that variation in coral thermal tolerance across latitudes has a strong genetic basis and could serve as raw material for natural selection.

AB  - Due to the increasing future energy demands and global warming, the renewable alternative energy sources and the efficient power systems have been getting importance over the last few decades. Among the renewable energy technologies, the solar energy coupling with fuel cell technology will be the promising possibilities for the future green energy solutions. Fuel cell cogeneration is an auspicious technology that can potentially reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact associated with serving building electrical and thermal demands. In this study, performance assessment of a co-generation system is presented to deliver electrical and thermal energy using the solar energy and the reversible solid oxide fuel cell. A mathematical model of the co-generation system is developed. To illustrate the performance, the system is considered in three operation modes: a solar-solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode, which is low solar radiation time when the solar photovoltaic (PV) and SOFC are used for electric and heat load supply; a solar-solid oxide steam electrolyzer (SOSE) mode, which is high solar radiation time when PV is used for power supply to the electrical load and to the steam electrolyzer to generate hydrogen (H-2); and a SOFC mode, which is the power and heat generation mode of reversible SOFC using the storage H-2 at night time. Also the effects of solar radiation on the system performances and the effects of temperature on RSOFC are analyzed. In this study, 100 kW electric loads are considered and analyzed for the power and heat generation in those three modes to evaluate the performances of the system. This study is also revealed the combined heat and power (CHP) efficiency of the system. The overall system efficiency achieved for the solar-SOFC mode is 23%, for the solar-SOSE mode is 20% and for the SOFC mode is 83.6%. Besides, the Only electricity generation efficiency for the solar-SOFC mode is 15%, for the solar-SOSE mode is 14% and for the SOFC mode is 44.28%. An economic analysis is presented based on the annual electricity generation from the system and the system has shown the good economic viability in this study with a unit cost of energy (COB) about 0.068 $/kW h.

AB  - A unique accumulation of workers ('colony') of the wood ant Formica polyctena Forst., trapped within an old bunker for storing nuclear weapons, is described. The source of the 'colony' is a large colony nesting outdoors, on top of the bunker. Individuals that have fallen down through a ventilation pipe are not able to find their way back to the mother nest. In total darkness, they have constructed an earthen mound, which they have maintained all-year-round by moulding it and keeping the nest entrances open. Judging from the huge deposits of wood-ant corpses in the bunker, the 'colony' has survived for years. Through these years, the mortality has been more than compensated by new workers that fall down during the active season of the free-living colony outside, and at present the number of the bunker workers is counted in hundreds of thousands. The 'colony' has evidently produced no offspring, which is due to low (though relatively stable) temperatures and scanty food in the bunker.

T2  - SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PASSENGER CARS-MECHANICAL SYSTEMS
LA  - English
AB  - The automotive industry, known for its competitiveness & innovations globally, researches for continuous improvement of part performances along with reduction of cost & weight. These are amongst the top priority goals across all OEMs. In the long list of automobile parts, pipe clamps have paved their way of design through generations from being of metal to plastic that has expanded its scope of application & performance.
   In an automobile, plastic clamps are widely used to hold single or multiple water, fuel or brake pipes of various diameters to vehicle body at various locations such as underbody (prone to stone chipping) or engine room (prone to high temperatures), etc. Plastic clamps are preferred over metallic clamps for their cost, weight, performance & productivity. Primarily, in all application areas, a clamp must be able to hold the pipes with consistent & sufficient performance that is quantified through parameters such as thrust force and pipe removal force. Hence, selection of ideal material becomes an important factor. As an example, clamps at underbody application are highly prone to stone chipping, so the impact resistance specification of material becomes an important factor for the durability performance. On the other hand, the design aspect becomes significant in cases such as increasing safety protection of pipes from surrounding parts during crash event, dampening the vibration transfer from pipe to vehicle body for better NVH performance.
   This paper focuses on articulating perspectives of OEM's designers on available knowledge about plastic clamps based on their experiences and propose a novel approach for design & evaluation of plastic clamps.

AB  - Corynebacterium glutamicum, an important industrial strain, has a relatively slower reproduction rate. To acquire a growth-boosted C. glutamicum, a descendant strain was isolated from a continuous culture after 600 generations. The isolated descendant C. glutamicum, JH41 strain, was able to double 58% faster (t(d)=1.15 h) than the parental type strain (PT, t(d)=1.82 h). To understand the factors boosting reproduction, the transcriptomes of JH41 and PT strains were compared. The mRNAs involved in respiration and TCA cycle were upregulated. The intracellular ATP of the JH41 strain was 50% greater than the PT strain. The upregulation of NCgl1610 operon (a putative dyp-type heme peroxidase, a putative copper chaperone, and a putative copper importer) that presumed to role in the assembly and redox control of cytochrome c oxidase was found in the JH41 transcriptome. Plasmid-driven expression of the operon enabled the PT strain to double 19% faster (t(d)=1.82 h) than its control (t(d)=2.17 h) with 14% greater activity of cytochrome c oxidase and 27% greater intracellular ATP under the oxidative stress conditions. Upregulations of genes those might enhance translation fitness were also found in the JH41 transcriptome. Plasmid-driven expressions of NCgl0171 (encoding a cold-shock protein) and NCgl2435 (encoding a putative peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase) enabled the PT to double 22% and 32% faster than its control, respectively (empty vector: t(d)=1.93 h, CspA: t(d)=1.58 h, and Pth: t(d)=1.44 h). Based on the results, the factors boosting growth rate in C. gluctamicum were further discussed in the viewpoints of cellular energy state, oxidative stress management, and translation.

AB  - Laboratory selection experiments play a prominent role in understanding organismal adaptation. Although bacteria are not yet commonly used for such experiments, they are well suited for analyses of both the organismic and the genetic basis of adaptation. Bacteria can be maintained in large populations while occupying limited laboratory space, have short generation times, are well characterized physiologically, biochemically, and genetically, and are readily frozen and revived from the freezer. In addition, the genomes of many species are completely sequenced and knowledge of gene function is unparalleled. Here we review general aspects of selection experiments, the history of using selection experiments in combination with thermal biology and genomics, and highlight findings from six lines of Escherichia coli adapted to high temperature (41.5 degrees C), including changes in organismal fitness, physiological performance, gene complement and gene expression. Our results are an example of the powerful insights that can be discovered by combining the tools and analyses of many biological disciplines including genomics, evolutionary biology, genetics, and evolutionary physiology.

AB  - Air purification can effectively capture particulate matter and reduce the health risk from indoor air pollution. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate filtration materials with high filtration efficiency, low filtration resistance, and large dust holding capacity at the same time. Herein, we report Needle-punched Electret Air Filters (NEAFs) not only exhibiting the abovementioned performance, but also owning superior charge and filtration stability. By employing corona charging and MgSt charge enhancing additives, NEAFs exhibited high filtration efficiency (99.2%) and ultralow filtration resistance (13.93 Pa). Importantly, NEAFs only had 0.6% decline in filtration efficiency after heat treatment, which was much better than commercial meltblown materials. In addition, the needle-punching technique generated a unique 3D fluffy structure, resulting in a large dust holding capacity of 23.6 g m(-2). Our design of NEAFs may provide new guidelines for next-generation high-performance air filtration materials.

AB  - The biology and temperature-dependent development of Laricobius kangdingensis Zilahi-Balogh and Jelinek (Coleoptera: Derodontidae), a newly described predator of hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) were investigated and compared with a related HWA predator, L. nigrinus Fender, that has already been released. As with other Laricobius species, there are four larval instars. The female to male sex ratio was 1:1.1. Mean lifetime fecundity per female was 196.4 eggs and 97.9 eggs for the parental generation (P-1) and first filial generation (F-1), respectively. Developmental rates at 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18A degrees C were studied between fall 2002 and spring 2004 and used to determine low temperature development thresholds for the egg (2.8A degrees C), and larval (1.6A degrees C) stages. The egg and larval thresholds are lower than those observed for L. nigrinus. Laricobius kangdingensis individuals completed development only at 12 and 15A degrees C; however, the adults did not emerge from aestivation after pupation. Our results suggest that L. kangdingensis may be a promising addition to the complex of predators currently being reared for control of HWA. Laricobius kangdingensis is long-lived, exhibits high fecundity, and can complete development on North American HWA. However, further studies will be necessary to secure its clearance for release, and the source of high mortality in the laboratory must be identified in order to improve its survival for mass-rearing.

AB  - Organisms typically show evidence of adaptation to features within their local environment. However, many species undergo long-distance dispersal or migration across larger geographic regions that consist of highly heterogeneous habitats. Therefore, selection may influence adaptive genetic variation associated with landscape features at residing sites and along migration routes in migratory species. We tested for genomic adaptation to landscape features at natal spawning sites and along migration paths to the ocean of anadromous steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Columbia River Basin. Results from multivariate ordination, gene-environment association and outlier analyses using 24,526 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provided evidence that adaptive allele frequencies were more commonly associated with landscape features along migration paths than features at natal sites (91.8% vs. 8.2% of adaptive loci, respectively). Among the 45 landscape variables tested, migration distance to the ocean and mean annual precipitation along migration paths were significantly associated with adaptive genetic variation in three distinct genetic groups. Additionally, variables such as minimum migration water temperature and mean migration slope were significant only in inland stocks of steelhead that migrate up to 1,200km farther than those near the coast, indicating regional differences in migratory selective pressures. This study provides novel approaches for investigating migratory corridors and some of the first evidence that environment along migration paths can lead to substantial divergent selection. Consequently, our approach to understand genetic adaptation to migration conditions can be applied to other migratory species when migration or dispersal paths are generally known.

AB  - Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major component of genotypic and phenotypic variation in genomes. To date, our knowledge of genotypic variation and evolution has largely been acquired by means of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) analyses. Until recently, the adaptive role of structural variants (SVs) and particularly that of CNVs has been overlooked in wild populations, partly due to their challenging identification. Here, we document the usefulness of Rapture, a derived reduced-representation shotgun sequencing approach, to detect and investigate copy number variants (CNVs) alongside SNPs in American lobster (Homarus americanus) populations. We conducted a comparative study to examine the potential role of SNPs and CNVs in local adaptation by sequencing 1,141 lobsters from 21 sampling sites within the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, which experiences the highest yearly thermal variance of the Canadian marine coastal waters. Our results demonstrated that CNVs account for higher genetic differentiation than SNP markers. Contrary to SNPs, for which no significant genetic-environment association was found, 48 CNV candidates were significantly associated with the annual variance of sea surface temperature, leading to the genetic clustering of sampling locations despite their geographic separation. Altogether, we provide a strong empirical case that CNVs putatively contribute to local adaptation in marine species and unveil stronger spatial signal of population structure than SNPs. Our study provides the means to study CNVs in nonmodel species and highlights the importance of considering structural variants alongside SNPs to enhance our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes shaping adaptive population structure.

AB  - Thermal tolerance is a key determinant of species distribution. Despite much study, the genetic basis of adaptive evolution of thermal tolerance, including the relative contributions of transcriptional regulation versus protein evolution, remains unclear. Populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus are adapted to local thermal regimes across their broad geographic range. Upon thermal stress, adults from a heat tolerant southern population, San Diego (SD), upregulate several heat shock proteins (HSPs) to higher levels than those from a less tolerant northern population, Santa Cruz (SC). Suppression of a specific HSP, HSPB1, significantly reduces T. californicus survival following acute heat stress. Sequencing of HSPB1 revealed population specific nucleotide substitutions in both promoter and coding regions of the gene. HSPB1 promoters from heat tolerant populations contain two canonical heat shock elements (HSEs), the binding sites for heat shock transcription factor (HSF), whereas less tolerant populations have mutations in these conserved motifs. Allele specific expression of HSPB1 in F1 hybrids between tolerant and less tolerant populations showed significantly biased expression favoring alleles from tolerant populations and supporting the adaptive divergence in these cis-regulatory variants. The functional impact of population-specific nonsynonymous substitutions in HSPB1 coding sequences was tested by assessing the thermal stabilization properties of SD versus SC HSPB1 protein variants. Recombinant HSPB1 from the southern SD population showed greater capacity for protecting protein structure under elevated temperature. Our results indicate that both regulatory and protein coding sequence evolution within a single gene appear to contribute to thermal tolerance phenotypes and local adaptation among conspecific populations.

AB  - The consequences of emerging marine diseases on the evolutionary trajectories of affected host populations in the marine realm are largely unexplored. Evolution in response to natural selection depends on the genetic variation of the traits under selection and the interaction of these traits with the environment (GxE). However, in the case of diseases, pathogen genotypes add another dimension to this interaction. Therefore, the study of disease resistance needs to be extended to the interaction of host genotype, pathogen genotype and environment (GxGxE). In this study, we used a full-sib breeding design crossing two genetically differentiated populations of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1793), to determine the influence of host genotype, pathogen genotype and temperature on disease resistance. Based on a controlled infection experiment on two early life stages, that is, D-larvae and Pediveliger larvae at elevated and ambient water temperatures, we estimated disease resistance to allopatric and sympatric Vibrio sp. by measuring survival and growth within and between genetically differentiated oyster populations. In both populations, survival was higher upon infection with sympatric Vibrio sp., indicating that disease resistance has a genetic basis and is dependent on host genotype. In addition, we observed a significant GxGxE effect in D-larvae, where contrary to expectations, disease resistance was higher at warm than at cold temperatures. Using thermal reaction norms, we could further show that disease resistance is an environment dependent trait with high plasticity, which indicates the potential for a fast acclimatization to changing environmental conditions. These population-specific reaction norms disappeared in hybrid crosses between both populations which demonstrates that admixture between genetically differentiated populations can influence GxGxE interactions on larger scales.

AB  - This study discusses an approach to measuring and improving the economic and ecological efficiency of Kyoto Mechanism projects. The approach consists of Global Warming Eco-Efficiency (GWEE), Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) & joint Implementation (JI) Environmental-Efficiency (EE) and CDM & JI Economic-Productivity (EP). The GWEE indicator is based on the ratio of the value added of a system to its global warming influence in order to measure the eco-efficiency of a product in terms of the global warming issue. In addition, CDM & JI EE and CDM & JI EP are proposed to measure the environmental and economic performances of CDM and JI projects, respectively. While EE is defined as the ratio of the Certified Emission Reductions (CER) obtained from a CDM project or Emission Reduction Unit (ERU) from a JI project to total global warming influence relevant to the CDM or JI implemented, EP is defined as the ratio of the total of CER profit (and ERU profit) and the sales revenue to the costs of the CDM (and JI) implemented, Then, the feasibility of these indicators is examined through a case study for the power generations in the field of alternative energy.

AB  - The recent unexpected local establishment of a non-native predatory mite, Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), in the UK prompted us to undertake this study, which investigated the thermal biology of an alien species Typhlodromips montdorensis (Schicha) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Laboratory and field experiments on its cold tolerance were used to assess its establishment potential outside of glasshouse environments in the UK. Currently, T. montdorensis is being tested as a glasshouse biological control agent against thrips and spider mites, but is not yet licensed for release in the UK. Typhlodromips montdorensis has a developmental threshold of between 10.3 and 10.7 degreesC, and a thermal budget of between 108.7 and 105.3 degree-days when estimated by weighted and simple linear regression, respectively. Under outdoor conditions, T. montdorensis could theoretically complete up to six generations a year. The supercooling points of female and larval T. montdorensis were -22 to -24 degreesC with 100% pre-freeze mortality apparent in both acute and chronic low temperature exposures. Typhlodromips montdorensis were unable to enter diapause under a selected laboratory regime. No reproduction occurred in the field from November to March, with 100% mortality within 7-14 days of release during this period. It is concluded that T. montdorensis would be a 'safe candidate' for introduction as a glasshouse biological control agent in the UK.

AB  - A central goal of population ecology is to identify the factors that regulate population growth. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in eastern North America re-colonize the breeding range over several generations that result in population densities that vary across space and time during the breeding season. We used laboratory experiments to measure the strength of density-dependent intraspecific competition on egg laying rate and larval survival and then applied our results to density estimates of wild monarch populations to model the strength of density dependence during the breeding season. Egg laying rates did not change with density but larvae at high densities were smaller, had lower survival, and weighed less as adults compared to lower densities. Using mean larval densities from field surveys resulted in conservative estimates of density-dependent population reduction that varied between breeding regions and different phases of the breeding season. Our results suggest the highest levels of population reduction due to density-dependent intraspecific competition occur early in the breeding season in the southern portion of the breeding range. However, we also found that the strength of density dependence could be almost five times higher depending on how many life-stages were used as part of field estimates. Our study is the first to link experimental results of a density-dependent reduction in vital rates to observed monarch densities in the wild and show that the effects of density dependent competition in monarchs varies across space and time, providing valuable information for developing robust, year-round population models in this migratory organism.

AB  - The Paris Agreement limits global average temperature rise to 2 degrees C and commits to pursuing efforts in limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. This will require rapid reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases and the eventual decarbonisation of the global economy. Wind energy is an established technology to help achieve emissions reductions, with a cumulative global installed capacity of similar to 486 GW (2016). Focusing on Australia, we assess the future economic viability of wind energy using a 12-member ensemble of high-resolution regional climate simulations forced by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) output. We examine both near future (around 2030) and far future (around 2070) changes. Extractable wind power changes vary across the continent, though the most spatially coherent change is a small but significant decrease across southern regions. The cost of future wind energy generation, measured via the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE), increases negligibly in the future in regions with significant existing installed capacity. Technological developments in wind energy generation more than compensate for projected small reductions in wind, decreasing the LCOE by around 30%. These developments ensure viability for existing wind farms, and enhance the economic viability of proposed wind farms in Western Australian and Tasmania. Wind energy is therefore a resilient source of electricity over most of Australia and technological innovation entering the market will open new regions for energy production in the future.

AB  - Forest trees are the dominant species in many parts of the world and predicting how they might respond to climate change is a vital global concern. Trees are capable of long-distance gene flow, which can promote adaptive evolution in novel environments by increasing genetic variation for fitness. It is unclear, however, if this can compensate for maladaptive effects of gene flow and for the long-generation times of trees. We critically review data on the extent of long-distance gene flow and summarise theory that allows us to predict evolutionary responses of trees to climate change. Estimates of long-distance gene flow based both on direct observations and on genetic methods provide evidence that genes can move over spatial scales larger than habitat shifts predicted under climate change within one generation. Both theoretical and empirical data suggest that the positive effects of gene flow on adaptation may dominate in many instances. The balance of positive to negative consequences of gene flow may, however, differ for leading edge, core and rear sections of forest distributions. We propose future experimental and theoretical research that would better integrate dispersal biology with evolutionary quantitative genetics and improve predictions of tree responses to climate change.

AB  - One of the key factors that determine an animal's distribution and abundance is environmental temperature. This factor affects all the components of an organism's energy budget and fitness. In this study, we tested the effect of water temperature and starvation on patterns of space use in the intertidal fish Girella laevifrons. We postulated that starved animals would select cold temperatures as a mechanism of energy conservation while fed animals would prefer higher temperatures as a mechanism to facilitate digestive processes. In a thermal gradient tank, fishes, irrespective of treatment (fed and starved), actively selected temperatures between 15 and 18 degrees C. Starvation did not affect temperature selection, although it did alter the time and number of visits to thermal gradient extremes. Starved fishes stayed longer in, and visited the warmer temperatures of the gradient more frequently. In contrast, fed fishes stayed longer in, and visited cold temperatures more frequently. We discuss the ecological consequences of temperature selection and the possible relationship between water temperature, food selection and digestive processes.

AB  - In order to conserve and culture the cichlid fish Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, more information about its reproductive biology and its larval behavior and morphogenesis is necessary. Currently, temperatures ranging from 21 to 27 degrees C are used in ornamental aquaculture hatcheries. Lower temperatures are preferred to reduce the costs of water heating, and 23 degrees C is usually the selected temperature. However, there is limited information on culturing protocols for ornamental species and most of the information generated on this topic remains scarce. Thus, the present study examines the morphological development of Archocentrus nigrofasciatus during the yolk-sac period up to the age of 100 h post-hatching in relation to 2 temperature regimes used in ornamental aquaculture: a temperature of 27 degrees C (thermal optimum) and a decreased temperature of 23 degrees C (thermal tolerance). The results of this study suggest that the 27 degrees C temperature generates intense morphological changes in yolk-sac development in a shorter period. This has advantages as it reduces the time of yolk-sac larval development, and, thus, minimizes the transition phase to exogenous feeding and maximizes the efficiency at which yolk is converted into body tissues. The present paper provides necessary information to produce freshwater ornamental fish with better practices so as to increase larval survival and capitalize on time for growth.

AB  - Inbred strains of the brine shrimp were developed from dry dormant cysts of wild-type Artemia franciscana produced in the Great Salt Lake, U.S.A. The established strains were named GSL2, 4, and 7 They were raised in 2% natural sea salt solution at 28 degrees C under a long-day condition, and fed on food sold for Artemia. Ovoviviparous offspring (free-swimming nauplii) in each brood derived from full sib (sister x brother) matings were used for succeeding generations. The ordinal number of the filial generation increased at a rate of ten generations per year. The number was over 60, and the lineage was recorded. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses of the inbred strains revealed the uniqueness, homogeneity, and genetic similarity among them. Their life span, the time required to become sexually mature, brood size, mode of reproduction, and adaptation and tolerance to salinity changes were investigated. The inbred strains usually released free-swimming nauplii rather than spawning encysted gastrulae (dormant cysts). On the other hand, the opposite results were obtained from wild-type Artemia under the same conditions. Both adults and nauplii of the inbred strains appeared to be less adaptive and less tolerant to salinity changes compared to those of the wild type. The established inbred strains should provide a wider and deeper scope for Artemia biology in particular, and the life sciences in general.

AB  - Aim: The guppy was used to demonstrate the effect of continues full-sib mating to the genetic changes and occurrence of inbreeding depression through heat stress tolerance.
   Methodology: Inbreeding depression were assessed from data collected from microsatellite markers and thermal tolerance experiment. The AY and NA1 strains were selected for this experiment.
   Results: With the progress in the inbred generations, significant decrease in thermal tolerance was observed. The observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity also decreased, indicating the on going inbred process. Significant correlation was observed only in the NA1 strain between thermal tolerances with multilocus heterozygosity (MLH) experiment both in Internal Relatedness (IR) and Standardize Heterozygosity (SH), respectively.
   Interpretation: MLH can be used to determent inbreeding depression only when the samples are severely inbred.

AB  - This study reports temperature effects on paralarvae from a benthic octopus species, Octopus huttoni, found throughout New Zealand and temperate Australia. We quantified the thermal tolerance, thermal preference and temperature-dependent respiration rates in 1-5 days old paralarvae. Thermal stress (1 degrees C increase h(-1)) and thermal selection (similar to 10-24 degrees C vertical gradient) experiments were conducted with paralarvae reared for 4 days at 16 degrees C. In addition, measurement of oxygen consumption at 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C was made for paralarvae aged 1,4 and 5 days using microrespirometry. Onset of spasms, rigour (CTmax) and mortality (upper lethal limit) occurred for 50% of experimental animals at, respectively, 26.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C, 27.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C and 31.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C. The upper, 23.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C, and lower, 15.0 +/- 1.7 C, temperatures actively avoided by paralarvae correspond with the temperature range over which normal behaviours were observed in the thermal stress experiments. Over the temperature range of 10 degrees C-25 degrees C, respiration rates, standardized for an individual larva, increased with age, from 54.0 to 165.2 nmol larvae(-1) h(-1) in one-day old larvae to 40.1-99.4 nmol h(-1) at five days. Older larvae showed a lesser response to increased temperature: the effect of increasing temperature from 20 to 25 degrees C (Q(10)) on 5 days old larvae (Q(10)=1.35) was lower when compared with the 1 day old larvae (Q(10)=1.68). The lower Q(10) in older larvae may reflect age-related changes in metabolic processes or a greater scope of older larvae to respond to thermal stress such as by reducing activity. Collectively, our data indicate that temperatures > 25 degrees C may be a critical temperature. Further studies on the population-level variation in thermal tolerance in this species are warranted to predict how continued increases in ocean temperature will limit O. huttoni at early larval stages across the range of this species.

AB  - Background: Phenotypic changes in response to environmental influences can persist from one generation into the next. In many systems parental parasite experience influences offspring immune responses, known as transgenerational immune priming (TGIP). TGIP in vertebrates is mainly maternal and short-term, supporting the adaptive immune system of the offspring during its maturation. However, if fathers and offspring have a close physical connection, evolution of additional paternal immune priming can be adaptive. Biparental TGIP may result in maximized immunological protection. Here, we investigate multigenerational biparental TGIP in the sex-role reversed pipefish Syngnathus typhle by exposing grandparents to an immune challenge with heat-killed bacteria and assessing gene expression (44 target genes) of the F2-generation.
   Results: Grandparental immune challenge induced gene expression of immune genes in one-week-old grandoffspring. Similarly, genes mediating epigenetic regulation including DNA-methylation and histone modifications were involved in grandparental immune priming. While grand-maternal impact was strong on genes of the complement component system, grand-paternal exposure changed expression patterns of genes mediating innate immune defense.
   Conclusion: In a system with male pregnancy, grandparents influenced the immune system of their grandoffspring in a sex-specific manner, demonstrating multigenerational biparental TGIP. The involvement of epigenetic effects suggests that TGIP via the paternal line may not be limited to the pipefish system that displays male pregnancy. While the benefits and costs of grandparental TGIP depend on the temporal heterogeneity of environmental conditions, multigenerational TGIP may affect host-parasite coevolution by dampening the amplitude of Red Queen Dynamics.

AB  - 1. In oviparous species providing maternal care, the choice of nest site is crucial for the survival of both the eggs and the mother. Most embryos only develop successfully within a narrow range of incubation conditions, which may differ from the mothers own requirements.
   2. How, then, do nest-attending mothers select sites that provide suitable conditions for embryonic development, without compromising their own viability?
   3. We investigated nest-site selection in flat-rock spiders, Hemicloea major, a species that guards fixed egg sacs in a thermally challenging environment (under sun-exposed rocks). Females glue egg sacs beneath rocks during late spring and guard their eggs during summer, when temperatures beneath rocks often exceed 50 degrees C.
   4. Our field surveys show that spiders laid eggs beneath rocks that were larger and thinner, and thus hotter, than were most available rocks. However, the egg sacs almost invariably were glued to the coolest sites on the substrate beneath a rock, rather than to the (hotter, by about 9 degrees C) underside of the rock.
   5. By affixing their egg sacs to the coolest locations beneath the hottest rocks, females ensured that their developing offspring experienced moderate temperatures and avoided lethal extremes and, simultaneously, gave themselves access to much hotter areas (that enhance their feeding and growth rates) under the same rock. This strategy allows mobile adult spiders to actively select higher temperatures than can be tolerated by their embryos, while remaining close enough to their eggs for effective nest guarding.

AB  - Reproduction of isolated Gyrodactylus gasterostei from the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, has been investigated. Three lineages of isolated parasites, without opportunity for cross- or self-fertilisation, continued to reproduce for up to 19 generations (224 births) until experiments were discontinued. Most parasites gave birth to two daughters only, although four individuals in one lineage gave birth three times. After the final birth the empty uterus expanded, while a large oocyte remained in the seminal receptacle and appeared capable of development. Reproduction by isolated flukes was further analysed using quantitative genetic techniques, applied to the hamuli and marginal hooks. The variance of hamulus and marginal hook dimensions in lineages of isolated flukes (which, if sexual must be highly inbred) was similar to that observed in natural populations. Crude heritability appeared high, but a significant relationship between hook size and environmental temperature was noted, and when this was controlled for, the heritability of all characters became negligible. Genetic drift was not observed over 17 generations and variance within isolated lines accounted for almost all of the total variance. Genes controlling hamulus or marginal hook dimensions did not progress to fixation, although the number of generations (more than 10) was sufficient to ensure homozygosity if self-fertilisation were occurring. These observations indicate that reproduction by isolated G. gasterostei continues indefinitely, but does not involve sex. The limited variance of natural populations suggests that these are also clonal with observed variation being largely environmental. Sexual reproduction may therefore be rare in G. gasterostei.

AB  - 1. How thermal tolerance estimated in the laboratory can be extrapolated to natural settings remains a contentious subject. Here, we argue that the general premise that a single temperature can accurately describe upper or lower tolerance limits is incorrect.
   2. Survival probability is determined by both the intensity and the duration of a thermal stress, and the association between these variables can be adequately conveyed by a thermal tolerance landscape. Employing this framework, we demonstrate that the temperature range that an organism can tolerate is expected to narrow down with the duration of the thermal challenge.
   3. Analyses suggest that a trade-off exists between tolerances to acute and chronic exposition to thermal stress, and that changes in temperature means or extremes may result in drastically different selective pressures and subsequent evolutionary responses.
   4. After controlling for the duration of the thermal challenge, we also uncover latitudinal effects on upper lethal temperatures in insects that remained unnoticed in previous broad-scale comparative analyses.
   5. Ultimately, critical thermal limits have been adopted in the ecological literature for logistic reasons and are inadequate descriptors of thermal tolerance on conceptual grounds. We consider that tolerance landscapes provide a more suitable framework to study temperature tolerance and its potential impact in ecological settings.

T2  - HOT SHEET METAL FORMING OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE STEEL CHS2 (5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE)
LA  - English
CP  - 5th International Conference on Hot Sheet Metal Forming of High-Performance Steel (CHS2 2015)
AB  - The increasing needs of the automotive industries in order to shape thinner and more geometrically complex components along with continuous optimization of this process has put the tooling design limitation as a major challenge to be addressed. The main issues are related to thermophysical properties of the tool material, the cooling design possibilities to obtain a controlled temperature distribution over the tool working surface and the required tribological properties of the tool surface versus the blank condition. In the past few years, the challenge of obtaining high thermal conductivity tool steels with a hardenability of over 50BRc required for the tool of hot stamping has been addressed through the HTCS-lxx generation. The experience gathered with this generation confirmed the benefit of higher thermal conductivity for both the process productivity and component quality. It shows also that to face the challenges of complex shape and cooling design, the conventional hardening process on the pre-machined tool is the main limiting factor especially if one attempts to make advanced cooling design or/and complex one in the limit of machinability. Considering the promising perspectives for the emerging additive manufacturing process, more complex and sophisticated cooling lines is expected to emerge also. This paper presents the new grade of High Thermal Conductivity tool Steels (HTCS) which provides optimizations both in terms of material properties, by means of higher thermal conductivity at increased hardness levels, and also in terms of tool manufacturing. The material can be provided in a soft state in which machining is easy, but hard enough to serve for prototyping, and only a low temperature heat treatment is thereafter necessary to harden the entire block to hardness levels up to 5056 HRc. In addition to the benefit of eliminating the severe quenching requirement for hardening, cost and time consuming parts of tool manufacturing like hard machining can be avoided. Different applications in hot stamping require different properties from the tool material with respect to capacity to extract heat, tribological performance, toughness, environment resistance and reparability. In this contribution, general properties of the new tool steel grade, as well as its response to nitriding, welding, and deformation will be presented and supported by study cases.

AB  - We investigated individual nest site choice behaviour and its fitness consequences in female hawksbills nesting at Trois Ilets, Guadeloupe. We found a significant repeatability of nest site choice, suggesting that this behaviour is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. By looking at possible consequences of nest site choice, we found that hatching success was similar among different beach zones, but the ability of hatchlings to emerge from the nest was impaired in areas subject to tidal inundation. Sea-finding tests showed that hatchlings were more susceptible to disorientation in areas deeper in the forest. Maintaining phenotypic diversity in nest site choice could derive from variation in the environment, where a constantly shifting balance between phenotypes would be promoted by environmental change over time. Alternatively, the different nesting behaviours could be maintained though frequency-dependent selection. Phenotypic sex of sea turtle embryos is determined by the incubation temperature of the nests, and different beach zones have different thermal properties. Females that nest in areas that produce the rarer sex may therefore gain a fitness advantage. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hybridization significantly affects the ecology and evolution of numerous plant and animal lineages. Most studies have focused on endogenous drivers of hybridization and neglected variation in exogenous factors, such as seasonal weather patterns. In this study, we take advantage of a unique dataset consisting of records of hybridization between the butterflies Colias eurytheme and C. eriphyle (Pieridae) for 66 generations (22 years) to investigate the importance of seasonal weather on the production and survival of hybrid offspring. Important seasonal weather variables for each parental species and hybrid offspring were determined using model averaging, and these weather variables, along with butterfly abundances, were analyzed using path analysis. The most important drivers of hybridization were the abundance of C. eriphyle, summer minimum temperature, and spring maximum temperature. In contrast, the abundance of C. eurytheme and weather variables prior to the current flight season were relatively unimportant for variation in hybrid abundance. Parental abundances were mostly driven by weather variables prior to the flight season possibly because these variables affect host plant quality. Our results suggest that exogenous, climatic factors can influence hybridization in natural systems, and that these factors can act both directly on hybrid abundance and indirectly through the population dynamics of parental species.

AB  - The thermal environment experienced during embryonic development can profoundly affect the phenotype, and potentially the fitness, of ectothermic animals. We examined the effect of incubation temperature on the thermal preferences of juveniles in the oviparous lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Temperature preference trials were conducted in a laboratory thermal gradient within 48 hr of hatching and after 22-27 days of maintenance in a common laboratory environment. Incubation temperature had a significant effect on the upper limit of the interquartile range (IQR) of temperatures selected by A. carolinensis within the first 2 days after hatching. Between the first and second trials, the IQR of selected temperatures decreased significantly and both the lower limit of the IQR and the median selected temperature increased significantly. This, along with a significant incubation temperature by time interaction in the upper limit of the IQR, resulted in a pattern of convergence in thermoregulation among treatment groups. The initial differences in selected temperatures, as well as the shift in selected temperatures between first and second trials, demonstrate plasticity in temperature selection. As a previous study failed to find environmentally induced plasticity in temperature selection in adult A. carolinensis, this study suggests that this type of plasticity is exclusive to the period of neonatal development.

AB  - This article describes a method for manipulating the temperature inside aqueous droplets, utilizing a thermoelectric cooler to control the temperature of select portions of a microfluidic chip. To illustrate the adaptability of this approach, we have generated an "ice valve" to stop fluid flow in a microchannel. By taking advantage of the vastly different freezing points for aqueous solutions and immiscible oils, we froze a stream of aqueous droplets that were formed on-chip. By integrating this technique with cell encapsulation into aqueous droplets, we were also able to freeze single cells encased in flowing droplets. Using a live-dead stain, we confirmed the viability of cells was not adversely affected by the process of freezing in aqueous droplets provided cryoprotectants were utilized. When combined with current droplet methodologies, this technology has the potential to both selectively heat and cool portions of a chip for a variety of droplet-related applications, such as freezing, temperature cycling, sample archiving, and controlling reaction kinetics.

AB  - Background Platelets for transfusion have a storage time of 5-7 days at 22 degrees C-24 degrees C, which results in a strain on the supply chain and supply shortages. We describe a novel method to extend platelet storage using xenon (Xe) gas under high pressure and refrigeration. Study Design and Methods Apheresis platelets (APU) prepared in 65% platelet additive solution (PAS) were stored under standard conditions (SC) at 20 degrees C-24 degrees C to Day 5. Paired APUs were prepared with Xe and stored to Day 14 at 2 degrees C-6 degrees C under hyperbaric conditions (XHC). A standard panel of in vitro assays was conducted. Results XHC platelets were viable out to Day 14. The average pH of Day 14 platelets was 6.58, and 86% maintained some degree of swirl compared with 7.02 and 100% swirl for Day 5 SC platelets. The rate of glycolysis was reduced under XHC storage with less glucose consumption and lactate generation. Activation levels for Day 14 platelets, while increased, did not prevent response to agonists in vitro, including epinephrine + Adenosine 5-Diphosphate (EPI/ADP) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) aggregation. Thromboelastogram (TEG) assessment showed 80% or greater conservation of platelet function for Day 14 xenon stored platelets compared with Day 5 SC platelets. Discussion Platelet storage with the Xe/hyperbaric/cold method is a feasible candidate for extension of storage to 14 days based on in vitro characteristics. In vivo recovery and survival studies are indicated. The capability to extend platelet storage to 14 days would make large strides toward resolving issues of platelet outdating for prophylactic use.

AB  - Understanding airborne survival and decay of microorganisms is important for a range of public health and biodefense applications, including epidemiological and risk analysis modeling. Techniques for experimental aerosol generation, retention in the aerosol phase, and sampling require careful consideration and understanding so that they are representative of the conditions the bioaerosol would experience in the environment. This review explores the current understanding of atmospheric transport in relation to advances and limitations of aerosol generation, maintenance in the aerosol phase, and sampling techniques. Potential tools for the future are examined at the interface between atmospheric chemistry, aerosol physics, and molecular microbiology where the heterogeneity and variability of aerosols can be explored at the single-droplet and single-microorganism levels within a bioaerosol. The review highlights the importance of method comparison and validation in bioaerosol research and the benefits that the application of novel techniques could bring to increasing the understanding of aerobiological phenomena in diverse research fields, particularly during the progression of atmospheric transport, where complex interdependent physicochemical and biological processes occur within bioaerosol particles.

AB  - Secondary energy can be described as a surplus of electrical energy in a hydropower. The largest hydropower plant in Brazil and South America is Itaipu and it pertains Brazil and Paraguai. Itaipu has a lot of secondary energy disposal because of its size, the one is lost as energy spilled no turbined in the reservoir. In this study is proposed the use from this energy for electrolytical hydrogen production. The hydrogen is produced as a gas and after can be storaged as a liquid, pressurized gas, metal hydride, and transported for other places in the same country or to other country for use as energy (fuel for ZEV vehicles, electrical generation, heating, and others), used as energy carrier, or used as raw material in chemical industries (ammonia synthesis). In this study is determined the viability in the use of hydrogen of secondary energy from Itaipu as energy carrier and ammonia processing for nitrogen fertilizers.

AB  - A chromosome-level genome assembly for the rice pest, Chlorops oryzae, pinpoints molecular pathways that might contribute toward increased outbreaks for this important crop pest.
   Chlorops oryzae is a pest of rice that has caused severe damage to crops in major rice-growing areas in recent years. We generated a 447.60 Mb high-quality chromosome-level genome with contig and scaffold N50 values of 1.17 Mb and 117.57 Mb, respectively. Hi-C analysis anchored 93.22% scaffolds to 4 chromosomes. The relatively high expression level of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and antioxidant genes in response to thermal stress suggests these genes may play a role in the environmental adaptability of C. oryzae. The identification of multiple pathways that regulate reproductive development (juvenile hormone, 20-hydroxyecdsone, and insulin signaling pathways) provides evidence that these pathways also play an important role in vitellogenesis and thus insect population maintenance. These findings identify possible reasons for the increased frequency of outbreaks of C. oryzae in recent years. Our chromosome-level genome assembly may provide a basis for further genetic studies of C. oryzae, and promote the development of novel, sustainable strategies to control this pest.

AB  - Productivity in the machining of titanium alloys is adversely affected by rapid tool wear as a consequence of high cutting zone temperature. Conventional cutting fluids are ineffective in controlling the cutting temperature in the cutting zone. In this research work, an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of liquid nitrogen when it is applied to the rake surface, and the main and auxiliary flank surfaces through holes made in the cutting tool insert during the turning of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The cryogenic results of the cutting temperature, cutting forces, surface roughness and tool wear of the modified cutting tool insert have been compared with those of wet machining. It has been observed that in the cryogenic cooling method, the cutting temperature was reduced by 61-66% and the surface roughness was reduced to a maximum of 36% over wet machining. The cutting force was decreased by 35-42% and the flank wear was reduced by 27-39% in cryogenic cooling over that of wet machining. Cryogenic cooling enabled a substantial reduction in the geometry of tool wear through the control of the tool wear mechanisms. The application of liquid nitrogen to the heat generation zones through holes made in the cutting tool insert was considered to be more effective over conventional machining. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growth rates of four strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were measured and compared in a model broth system. The results for the fastest growing strain, based on 77 combinations of temperature and water activity (a(w)) using NaCl as the humectant, were summarised in the form of a predictive mathematical model. The model, of the square-root type includes a novel term to describe the effects of super-optimal water activity, and can be used to predict generation times for the temperature range (8-45 degrees C) and water activity range (0.936-0.995) which permit growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Predicted generation times from the model were compared to literature data, using bias and accuracy factors, for both laboratory media and foods. The model was shown to give realistic growth estimates, with a bias value of 1.01, and an accuracy factor of 1.38. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Background: The ability for an evolving population to adapt to a novel environment is achieved through a balance of robustness and evolvability. Robustness is the invariance of phenotype in the face of perturbation and evolvability is the capacity to adapt in response to selection. Genetic robustness has been posited, depending on the underlying mechanism, to either decrease the efficacy of selection, or increase the possibility of future adaptation. However, the true effect of genetic robustness on evolvability in biological systems remains uncertain.
   Results: Here we demonstrate that genetic robustness increases evolvability of thermotolerance in laboratory populations of the RNA virus phi 6. We observed that populations founded by robust clones evolved greater resistance to heat shock, relative to populations founded by brittle (less-robust) clones. Thus, we provide empirical evidence for the idea that robustness can promote evolvability in this environment, and further suggest that evolvability can arise indirectly via selection for robustness, rather than through direct selective action.
   Conclusion: Our data imply that greater tolerance of mutational change is associated with virus adaptability in a new niche, a finding generally relevant to evolutionary biology, and informative for elucidating how viruses might evolve to emerge in new habitats and/or overcome novel therapies.

AB  - Understanding the ecological processes that underpin the dynamics of community turnover in response to environmental change is critical to predicting how warming will influence ecosystem functioning. Here, we quantify the effect of changing temperature on community composition and ecosystem functioning via the action of ecological selection on population-level thermal traits. To achieve this, we use microbes isolated from a network of geothermal streams in Iceland where in situ temperatures span 8-38 degrees C within a single catchment. We first quantified variability in thermal tolerance between taxa, and then assembled synthetic communities along a broad thermal gradient to explore how temperature-driven selection on thermal tolerance traits shaped the emergent community structures and functions. We found marked changes in community structure and composition with temperature, such that communities exposed to extreme temperatures (10, 35 degrees C) had highly asymmetric biomass distributions and low taxonomic richness. Thermal optima were a good predictor of the presence and relative abundance of taxa in the high-temperature treatments. We also found that the evenness of the abundance distribution was related to ecosystem production, such that communities with more equitable abundance distribution were also the most productive. Our results highlight the utility of using a multi-level approach that links population-level traits with community structure and ecosystem functioning to better understand how ecological communities will respond to global warming.

AB  - Sewage sludge is a solid waste composed of water, rich in organic matter and nutrients, but concentrator of pathogenic microorganisms. Its use as agricultural fertilizer in the state of Parana, Brazil is common. However, it is necessary to eliminate or significantly reduce microorganisms by means of a hygiene process. This can be obtained thermally, requiring a source of energy for heat generation. In this sense, a pilot system was constructed consisting of a stainless steel radiant floor, capable of transferring heat to the sewage sludge from coils coupled in base, through which the heated water circulates. The energy comes from solar radiation and is complemented by biogas from the anaerobic sewage treatment. Aiming to investigate the system's ability to transfer heat and, consequently, to sanitize and dry the sludge, a layer of 0.10 m was deposited on the radiant floor, the temperature being monitored at two different heights, obtaining averages of 328.95 K (55.8 degrees C) and 336.95 K (63.8 degrees C), respectively. The sludge was still submitted to a drying process, where a 68.68% increase in the total solids content was verified. Finally, the energy consumption was measured where a demand of 29.22 Nm(3) of methane per m(3) of treated sludge had been estimated.

AB  - Simple Summary Wind farms represent one of the largest sources of anthropogenic mortality for bats. Wind proponents attempt to mitigate these effects via operational curtailment, such that wind energy is not produced on nights with low wind speeds during the late summer and fall. Our study modeled bat activity and mortality on two timescales (nightly and seasonally) and in response to a range of weather variables. We showed that bat mortality risks could be lowered and opportunities for wind energy production can be increased by focusing curtailment efforts to the periods of the night and year when bats are most active and by considering a wider range of weather variables, compared to standard curtailment strategies. Relatively high mortality of migratory bats at wind energy facilities has prompted research to understand the underlying spatial and temporal factors, with the goal of developing more effective mitigation approaches. We examined acoustic recordings of echolocation calls at 12 sites and post-construction carcass survey data collected at 10 wind energy facilities in Ontario, Canada, to quantify the degree to which timing and regional-scale weather predict bat activity and mortality. Rain and low temperatures consistently predicted low mortality and activity of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and three species of migratory tree bats: hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), eastern red bat (L. borealis), and silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Bat activity occurred in waves with distinct peaks through the season; regardless of seasonal timing, most activities occurred in the first half of the night. We conclude that wind energy facilities could adopt a novel and more effective curtailment strategy based on weather and seasonal and nocturnal timing that would minimize mortality risks for bats while increasing the opportunities for power generation, relative to the mitigation strategy of increasing cut-in wind speed to 5.5 m/s.

AB  - Global climate fluctuations have profoundly affected the current distribution patterns and created opportunities and challenges for the survival and development of species. Studies on geographical distribution and eco-adaptability are necessary for both biodiversity conservation and sustainable biological resource utilization. In this study, we focus on five species of Calligonum in Tarim Basin, i.e. Calligonum roborovskii, C. kurlaense, C. yengisaricum, C. juochiangense and C. taklimakanense to confirm the distribution range by carrying out field population survey, along with the studies of herbarium specimen and relevant literature and also to find out the associations between the five species, distribution correlated with climate and soil characteristics through the mean variance analysis and principal component analysis. The results of the study were as follows: (1) C. roborovskii was widely distributed in Tarim Basin, but C. kurlaense, C. yengisaricum, C. juochiangense and C. taklimakanense have narrow distribution. The distribution areas of four latter species were overlapping with that of C. roborovskii showing sympatric distribution. (2) All the five species belonged to the warm and arid zone. The adaptability of C. roborovskii to moisture was higher, that of C. juochiangense and C. taklimakanense which grew in more arid areas than that of C. kurlaense and C. yengisaricum, had stronger drought tolerance. The soil type of the five species main was brown desert soil with high salinity, alkaline, and low content of organic matter in the top soil. (3) Low temperature, moisture factor, salinity and alkalinity were the main reasons leading to the different distribution of the four narrow distributed species. (4) The main factors limiting the distribution range of the five species were high temperature and moisture factor, followed by soil properties. For C. juochiangense and C. taklimakanense, moisture factor was much stronger than temperature. The results of the research will provide basis for the protection, revegetation and reasonable utilization of Calligonum

AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are the first cellular line of antibacterial host defense. They sense pathogens through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by innate pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR). The aim of this study was to investigate whether PMN sense bacterial viability and explore which viability factor could be involved in this phenomenon. For this purpose, different functions were evaluated in isolated human PMN using live Escherichia coli (Ec) and heat-killed Ec (HK-Ec). We found that bacterial viability was indispensable to induce PMN activation, as measured by forward-scatter (FSC) increase, CD11b surface expression, chemotaxis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. As uncapped non-polyadenylated prokaryotic mRNA has been recognized as a PAMP associated to bacterial viability by macrophages and dendritic cells, total prokaryotic RNA (pRNA) from live Ec was purified and used as a stimulus for PMN. pRNA triggered similar responses to those observed with live bacteria. No RNA could be isolated from HK-Ec, explaining the lack of effect of dead bacteria. Moreover, the supernatant of dead bacteria was able to induce PMN activation, and this was associated with the presence of pRNA in this supernatant, which is released in the killing process. The induction of bactericidal functions (ROS and NETosis) by pRNA were abolished when the supernatant of dead bacteria or isolated pRNA were treated with RNAse. Moreover, endocytosis was necessary for pRNA-induced ROS generation and NETosis, and priming was required for the induction of pRNA-induced ROS in whole blood. However, responses related to movement and degranulation (FSC increase, CD11b up-regulation, and chemotaxis) were still triggered when pRNA was digested with RNase, and were not dependent on pRNA endocytosis or PMN priming. In conclusion, our results indicate that PMN sense live bacteria through recognition of pRNA, and this sensing triggers potent bactericidal mechanisms.

AB  - From a brief historical overview of the ideas on bubble generation, some directives for developing of efficient structures with nucleate boiling are deduced in the first part of the paper. Then, starting from the survival conditions of a vapour bubble in a liquid with a temperature gradient, a criterion is obtained for the creation of such structures. The efficiency of a heater surface covered with a structure is considered ideal if the driving temperature difference does not change with the heat flux. Experiments show that constancy of the wall superheat can be realized on surfaces provided with an appropriate micro-structure. The required properties of the structure are: It must be generated from identical elements which are arranged in a mono-pattern on the heating surface, the structure elements (protrusions) must trap vapour after bubble detachment and generate a possibly long three-phase-line (TPL) formed by intersection of the vapour-liquid interface with the heating surface.

AB  - Climate change affects all levels of biology and is a major threat for biodiversity. Hence, it is fundamental to run biodiversity monitoring programs to understand the effects of climate change on the biota and to be able to adjust management and conservation accordingly. So far, however, very few existing monitoring programs allow for the detection of climate change effects, as shown by a survey undertaken by the European project EuMon. Despite this shortcoming, several methods exist which allow to make inferences from existing data by integrating data across different monitoring programs: correlative analyses, meta-analyses and models. In addition, experiments are thought to be useful tools to understand the effects of climate change on plants and animals. Here, we evaluate the utility of these four main approaches. All these methods allow to evaluate long term effects of climate change and make predictions of species' future development, but they are arguable. We list and compare their benefits and inconveniences, which can lead to uncertainties in the extrapolation of species responses to global climate change. Individual characteristics and population parameters have to be more frequently monitored. The potential evolution of a species should be also modelled, to extrapolate results across spatial and temporal scales as well as to analyse the combined effects of different climatic and biotic factors, including intra but also interspecific relationships. We conclude that a combination of methodologies would be the most promising tool for the assessment of biological responses to climate change, and we provide some thoughts about how to do so. Particularly, we encourage long-term studies along natural gradients (altitudinal or latitudinal) on the same species/habitats to be able to extrapolate to large geographic scales, and to have more complete data sets, necessary to understand the mechanisms of responses. Such data may provide a more accurate base for simulations across spatial and temporal scales, especially if they are publicly available in a common database. These recommendations could allow the adaptation of species management and the development of conservation tools to climate change which threatens species.

T2  - STERILITY IN WHEAT IN SUBTROPICAL ASIA: EXTENT, CAUSES & SOLUTIONS
LA  - English
CP  - Workshop on Sterility in Wheat in Subtropical Asia - Extent, Causes and Solutions
AB  - Sterility in wheat is becoming one of the most important constraints to wheat production in Nepal. Cold temperatures during the reproductive phase at higher elevations and low concentrations of available soil boron at lower altitudes are the two major causes identified. Research in the last three decades has been concentrated on husbandry practices to tackle the problem, but there have been few practical recommendations made for the farmers. Earlier studies had indicated genetic variation for relative tolerance to both types of sterility. However, all types of soils, irrespective of altitude and cropping patterns, are deficient in available soil boron. Consequently, it is very likely that low-boron-induced sterility has been confounded with cold-induced sterility.
   In this study, well adapted modem varieties such as L-52, NL-297, Annapurna-3 and Paudur Local (a landrace) were identified as sterility-tolerant parents and included in a crossing program. Broad sense heritability (h(2)) and genetic gains for sterility tolerance were measured. Broad sense heritability of the means of the F-2 and F-3 plants for sterility tolerance was between 14% and 53%. Progeny of Annapurna-3/RR-21, Annapurna-3/BL-1142, Paudur Local/BL-1022 and Paudur Local/NL-297 showed transgressive segregation for sterility tolerance. The predicted genetic gain for sterility tolerance by early generation selection was between 10% and 44%. High predicted genetic gains from selection at early stages in some families were found, but further studies need to be conducted to prepare for a program to develop sterility-tolerant varieties.

AB  - A clustering method is an effective way to select the proper temperature sensor location for thermal error modeling of machine tools. In this paper, a new temperature sensor clustering method is proposed. By analyzing the characteristics of the temperature of the sensors in a heavy floor-type milling machine tool, an indicator involving both the Euclidean distance and the correlation coefficient was proposed to reflect the differences between temperature sensors, and the indicator was expressed by a distance matrix to be used for hierarchical clustering. Then, the weight coefficient in the distance matrix and the number of the clusters (groups) were optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA), and the fitness function of the GA was also rebuilt by establishing the thermal error model at one rotation speed, then deriving its accuracy at two different rotation speeds with a temperature disturbance. Thus, the parameters for clustering, as well as the final selection of the temperature sensors, were derived. Finally, the method proposed in this paper was verified on a machine tool. According to the selected temperature sensors, a thermal error model of the machine tool was established and used to predict the thermal error. The results indicate that the selected temperature sensors can accurately predict thermal error at different rotation speeds, and the proposed temperature sensor clustering method for sensor selection is expected to be used for the thermal error modeling for other machine tools.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuels and environmental issues that have been brought by them make researchers search for alternative energy resources. Geothermal energy as a reliable sustainable resource has significant potential in the mitigation of greenhouse gas and pollution emissions. In this article, three different geothermal-based systems are designed for hydrogen and electricity production. All three configurations used the same low temperature geothermal energy. The three proposed systems include ORC, APC and KCS system integrated with PEM technology. These systems are analyzed and compared to energy, exergy, thermoeconomic aspects. The net thermal productivity for the PEM-ORC system, PEM-APC system, and PEM-KCS system are respectively 11.89%, 13.46%, and 11.05%. The overall exergy efficiency for the PEM-ORC system, PEM-APC system, and PEMKCS system are respectively 50.82%, 48.41%, and 49.02%. The hydrogen production rate of three configurations of PEM-ORC, PEM-APC, and PEM-KCS is 4.78 kg/h, 5.154 kg/h and 4.581 kg/h. Besides the total SUCP of the PEM-ORC unit is 76.72 $/GJ. The net SUCP of the PEM-APC system is 78.89 $/GJ, this value for combined PEM-KCS is 259.9 $/GJ. Moreover, a comprehensive sensitivity evaluation is carried out on the system to evaluate the impact of the key variables on the operation of the plant. Then, optimization procedures are conducted for all three systems. Four TOED, EOED, SOED and MOED methods are employed for this purpose. The SOED method decreased the SUCP of the PEM-KSC system signifi-cantly about 22%. The MOED enhances the exergy productivity of the PEM-ORC system about 10%.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this paper is to point out the kinds of measures that should be implemented to protect the population from the health effects of cold and when to put them into action, thanks to meteorological thresholds.
   Study design: The authors used pertinence criteria to determine if an alert system would be relevant to trigger preventive measures.
   Methods: The pertinence criteria included ability to prevent health impact through specific measures, simplicity, reactivity, adaptability, and the possibility to find indicators able to predict a health impact of cold. This was investigated in two pilot cities, using time-series models to identify mortality-relevant thresholds, if any.
   Results: Short-term measures are mainly directed at homeless people while actions focussing on the general population are mostly limited to providing advice on how to protect oneself from exposure to cold. The main long-term measures are housing insulation and heating. Combined minimum and maximum temperatures are the best indicators to predict the health impact of cold temperatures on mortality. Associated optimal thresholds for action in Paris were -9 degrees C and -2 degrees C for minimum and maximum temperatures respectively while thresholds in Marseille were -3 degrees C and -4 degrees C. When both thresholds are reached in a given city, the risk of excess mortality is greater than 15%.
   Conclusion: Simple meteorological indicators could be used to improve the detection of dangerous cold episodes and promote communication. Nevertheless, long-term housing improvement and financial aids for home heating remain the best means to prevent the adverse effects of cold weather on community health.

AB  - Central receiver systems (CRS) are a promising concentrated solar power (CSP) technology for dispatchable electricity generation. The CRS levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is usually increased by low power-block capacity factors or by high thermal storage costs. The economical turnover is still positive for the Portuguese case but depends on the bonus feed-in tariffs. On the other hand, with biomass existing feed-in tariffs and raising prices, the viability of current biomass power plants is at risk. To address these issues, several base case power plants and hybrid biomass/CSP options are analyzed: wood gasification, refuse-derived fuel pellets, biogas from a wastewater anaerobic digester, biogas from a landfill and natural gas.
   The solution with lower LCOE was obtained for the hybridization of a 4 MWe CRS using an atmospheric volumetric receiver with biogas from an anaerobic digester using sludge from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Different results would be obtained for the hybrid systems if different CRS technologies are used. The hybrid CRS/anaerobic digester power plant LCOE is 0.15 (sic)/kWh, returning the investment in 13 years (assuming sludge collection and transport without cost) with the best net present value (15 million euro) and internal rate of return of all the hybrid options.

AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are highly reduced bacterial storage compounds that increase fitness in changing environments. We have previously shown that phaRBAC genes from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas sp. 14-3 are located in a genomic island containing other genes probably related with its adaptability to cold environments. In this paper, Pseudomonas sp. 14-3 and its PHA synthase-minus mutant (phaC) were used to asses the effect of PHA accumulation on the adaptability to cold conditions. The phaC mutant was unable to grow at 10A degrees C and was more susceptible to freezing than its parent strain. PHA was necessary for the development of the oxidative stress response induced by cold treatment. Addition of reduced compounds cystine and gluthathione suppressed the cold sensitive phenotype of the phaC mutant. Cold shock produced very rapid degradation of PHA in the wild type strain. The NADH/NAD ratio and NADPH content, estimated by diamide sensitivity, decreased strongly in the mutant after cold shock while only minor changes were observed in the wild type. Accordingly, the level of lipid peroxidation in the mutant strain was 25-fold higher after temperature downshift. We propose that PHA metabolism modulates the availability of reducing equivalents, contributing to alleviate the oxidative stress produced by low temperature.

Abundant food resources and moderate temperature convey advantages to those copepods living in coastal upwelling zones, however, there is a clear disadvantage in that coastal upwelling zones are highly advective environments. Typically, water circulation patterns are such that surface waters are carried offshore, deeper waters carried onshore and most of the water column over the continental shelf is moving equatorward. The challenge to copepod species that inhabit upwelling systems is Life cycle closure-how do eggs, nauplii, juveniles and adults avoid being swept out of these ecosystems in the face of persistent transport out of the system? In this review, I first list the species which dominate coastal upwelling ecosystems then discuss three variations on the multigenerational life cycle scheme that are observed in upwelling systems. The latter part of the review is devoted to discussion of how individuals are retained in the productive continental shelf waters within coastal upwelling ecosystems. The suggestion is made that the only copepod species that successfully achieve life cycle closure in such systems are those that are preadapted to upwelling circulation patterns. Our quantitative understanding of the relative importance of physical factors (such as advection) and biological factors (birth, growth, and mortality) on life cycle strategies and population dynamics is quite rudimentary. It would help our understanding if there were more field studies and more computer modeling studies that focused on seasonal cycles of abundance, development times and vertical distribution of life cycle stages, and measurements of water circulation patterns.

AB  - The choice of optimal plant species for phytoremediation and organic fertilization plays an important role in stabilizing the functions of soils contaminated with heavy metals. The influence of nickel, cobalt and cadmium on the biomass yield and calorific value of Festuca rubra, heavy metal concentrations in soil and plants and the microbiological, biochemical and physicochemical proprieties of soil were analyzed in a pot experiment. The tolerance index (TI) describing Festuca rubra's ability to tolerate heavy metals, as well as the translocation (TF), accumulation (AF) and bioaccumulation (BF) factors of heavy metals in Festuca rubra were calculated. The experiment was conducted in two series: In soil fertilized and not fertilized with compost. Nickel and cobalt significantly inhibited the growth and development of Festuca rubra. The experiment demonstrated that this plant species can be grown on soil contaminated with heavy metals. Festuca rubra contained on average 46.05% C, 34.59% O, 5.91% H, 3.49% N, 0.19% S and 9.76% ash. Festuca rubra has a stable calorific value which is not affected by heavy metals; therefore, biomass harvested from heavy metal-polluted soil can be used for energy generation. The calorific value of Festuca rubra ranged from 15.924 to 16.790 MJ kg(-1) plant d.m., and the heat of combustion from 17.696 to 18.576 MJ kg(-)(1). It has a stable calorific value which is not affected by heavy metals, therefore biomass harvested from heavy metal-polluted soil can be used for energy generation. Festuca rubra is particularly useful for the phytostabilization of soil contaminated with cadmium and cobalt. Compost minimizes the adverse effects of heavy metal pollution on the microbiological, biochemical and physicochemical properties of soil.

AB  - It is common in some cryosurgical procedures to rely on freeze-thaw cycle(s) to destroy undesirable tissues. Most research in cryosurgery focuses on the freezing process and much less attention has been paid to thawing or re-warming. However, as ice melts during thawing, the extracellular solution can become locally hypotonic, driving water into cells, resulting in cell expansion and ultimately, membrane rupture. Therefore, the thermal history of the target tissue during both the freezing and thawing processes is critical for cell viability. To better understand and predict the thermal history during cryosurgery, we developed a two-dimensional numerical model to describe the complete freeze-thaw cycle during liquid nitrogen cutaneous cryosurgery. A stratified anatomical structure of human skin is considered in the model. The numerical simulation applies temperature-dependent thermal and physical properties for human skin tissue and considers the typical thermal boundary conditions for clinical practice. Parametric studies are performed to explore the influence of spray cooling, spray duration and surface heating. Results are discussed concentrating on iceball front propagation, lethal temperature isotherm evolution, tissue temperature variation and cooling rates. These results are expected to provide both quantitative and graphical support to cutaneous cryosurgery and suggest approaches to optimize current cryosurgical protocols.

AB  - Biomass incineration is increasingly used for the generation of heat and/or electricity. After incineration two ash fractions remain. Bottom ashes (the coarser ash fraction) can usually be used as fertilizing agent on fields as it contains valuable elements for soils and plants and only minor concentrations of heavy metals. Fly ashes (the finer ash fraction) are in most cases disposed as their heavy metal concentrations are too high for a usage as soil enhancer. In this study highly heavy metal contaminated fly ash has been cleaned through extraction with hydrochloric acid. The heavy metals were removed from the extract by precipitation with sodium hydroxide. After the cleaning procedure the ash can be pelletized and be returned to the soils.

AB  - We report lasing from nonpolar p-i-n InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well core-shell single-nanowire lasers by optical pumping at room temperature. The nanowire lasers were fabricated using a hybrid approach consisting of a top-down two-step etch process followed by a bottom-up regrowth process, enabling precise geometrical control and high material gain and optical confinement. The modal gain spectra and the gain curves of the core-shell nanowire lasers were measured using micro-photoluminescence and analyzed using the Hakki-Paoli method. Significantly lower lasing thresholds due to high optical gain were measured compared to previously reported semipolar InGaN/GaN core-shell nanowires, despite significantly shorter cavity lengths and reduced active region volume. Mode simulations show that due to the core-shell architecture, annular shaped modes have higher optical confinement than solid transverse modes. The results show the viability of this p-i-n nonpolar core-shell nanowire architecture, previously investigated for next-generation light-emitting diodes, as low-threshold, coherent UV-visible nanoscale light emitters, and open a route toward monolithic, integrable, electrically injected single-nanowire lasers operating at room temperature.

AB  - The 1998 global coral bleaching event was the largest recorded historical disturbance of coral reefs and resulted in extensive habitat loss. Annual censuses of reef fish community structure over a 12-year period spanning the bleaching event revealed a marked phase shift from a prebleach to postbleach assemblage. Surprisingly, we found that the bleaching event had no detectable effect on the abundance, diversity or species richness of a local cryptobenthic reef fish community. Furthermore, there is no evidence of regeneration even after 5-35 generations of these short-lived species. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the response of coral reef ecosystems to global warming and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate criteria for evaluating reef resilience.

AB  - This research aimed at studing Telenomas remus Nixon biology reared on Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) eggs at different temperatures. Based on the development of the cycle (egg-adult), the thermal requirements and the number of parasitoid generations at constant temperatures were determined. Initially, 24-hour-old S. frugiperda eggs were submitted to parasitism by T remus during 5 h, being then transferred to acclimatized chambers regulated at 15, 20, 25, 28, 31, and 35 degrees C. The cycle (egg to adult) was influenced by temperature varying front 8.3 +/- 0.01 to 47.2 +/- 0.01 for females and 8.1 +/- 0.01 to 46.8 +/- 0.01 days for males at 31 and 15 degrees C, respectively. The emergency (%) was also influenced by temperature. A reduction in emergency was observed at 15 degrees C and no emergency at 35 degrees C. T remus sex ratio was not influenced by temperature. Sexual rate was not changed by temperature. Regarding to thermal requirements, thermal constant (K) and linferior thermal threshold (Tb) were higher for T remus females (158.88 degree-days anti 12.5 degrees C) when compared to males (154.12 degree-days and 12.6 degrees C). The estimated number of T. remus generation per year for males and females at laboratory conditions was 5.6 and 5.6, 16.9 and 17.3, 28.3 and 29.0, 35.1 and 36.0, 39.6 and 40.7 at 15, 20, 25, 28, and 31 degrees C, respectively.

AB  - An insect species' geographic distribution is probably delimited in part by physiological tolerances of environmental temperatures. Gloomy scale (Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock)) is a native insect herbivore in eastern U.S. forests. In eastern U.S. cities, where temperatures are warmer than nearby natural areas, M. tenebricosa is a primary pest of red maple (Acer rubrum L.; Sapindales: Sapindaceae) With warming, M. tenebricosa may spread to new cities or become pestilent in forests. To better understand current and future M. tenebricosa distribution boundaries, we examined M. tenebricosa thermal tolerance under laboratory conditions. We selected five hot and five cold experimental temperatures representative of locations in the known M. tenebricosa distribution. We built models to predict scale mortality based on duration of exposure to warm or cold experimental temperatures. We then used these models to estimate upper and lower lethal durations, i.e., temperature exposure durations that result in 50% mortality. We tested the thermal tolerance for M. tenebricosa populations from northern, mid, and southern locations of the species' known distribution. Scales were more heat and cold tolerant of temperatures representative of the midlatitudes of their distribution where their densities are the greatest. Moreover, the scale population from the northern distribution boundary could tolerate cold temperatures from the northern boundary for twice as long as the population collected near the southern boundary. Our results suggest that as the climate warms the M. tenebricosa distribution may expand poleward, but experience a contraction at its southern boundary.

AB  - Studies on the development and mortality of Paratanytarsus grimmii (Schneider) and Corynoneura scutellata (Winnertz), which can infest potable water distribution networks, were carried out at eight constant temperatures between 10 degreesC and 27 degreesC. Using weighted linear regression, the developmental thresholds were calculated as 7.9 and 8.7degreesC for P. grimmii and C. scutellata, respectively. Corynoneura scutellata had a day-degree requirement of 172.4 per generation and developed significantly faster (P < 0.001) than P. grimmii with a day-degree requirement of 294.1. Both species were identified as multivoltine with a maximum theoretical number of five generations per year for P. grimmii and seven for C. scutellata. These results are discussed in the context of the management of chironomid infestations within water-treatment works.

AB  - The paper provides an assessment of the current wind energy potential in Ukraine, and discusses developmental prospects for wind-hydrogen power generation in the country. Hydrogen utilization is a highly promising option for Ukraine's energy system, environment, and business. In Ukraine, an optimal way towards clean zero-carbon energy production is through the development of the wind-hydrogen sector. In order to make it possible, the energy potential of industrial hydrogen production and use has to be studied thoroughly.
   Ukraine possesses huge resources for wind energy supply. At the beginning of 2020, the total installed capacity of Ukrainian wind farms was 1.17 GW. Wind power generation in Ukraine has significant advantages in comparison to the use of traditional sources such as thermal and nuclear energy.
   In this work, an assessment of the wind resource potential in Ukraine is made via the geographical approach suggested by the authors, and according to the "Methodical guidelines for the assessment of average annual power generation by a wind turbine based on the long-term wind speed observation data". The paper analyses the long-term dynamics of average annual wind speed at 40 Ukrainian weather stations that provide valid data. The parameter for the vertical wind profile model is calculated based on the data reanalysis for 10 m and 50 m altitudes. The capacity factor (CF) for modern wind turbine generators is determined. The CF spatial distribution for an average 3 MW wind turbine and the power generation potential for the wind power plants across the territory of Ukraine are mapped.
   Based on the wind energy potential assessment, the equivalent possible production of water electrolysis-derived green hydrogen is estimated. The potential average annual production of green hydrogen across the territory of Ukraine is mapped.
   It is concluded that Ukraine can potentially establish wind power plants with a total capacity of 688 GW on its territory. The average annual electricity production of this system is supposed to reach up to 2174 bln kWh.

AB  - The objective of this research was to develop a microwave-vapor heat treatment (MW-VHT) for mangoes (Mangifera indica L.) cv. Namdokmai Si Thong to disinfest the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). The mortality of oriental fruit fly eggs and quality acceptability characterized by thermal-death-time and thermal-quality-time overlay plots were initially obtained by hot-water immersion. Two treatments within a range of acceptable quality were selected for inoculation experiments to confirm MW-VHT process. The acceptable range was temperature ranging from 46 to 55C with time ranging from 2 to 20 min. The MW-VHT using microwave for preheating followed by vapor for holding processes effectively disinfested oriental fruit fly eggs. Changes in physiochemical properties of mangoes, e.g., color, titratable acid (TA), total soluble solid (TSS), TSS/TA and firmness, of MW-VHT-treated mangoes were not significantly different (P > 0.05) from physiochemical properties of the nontreated mangoes. MW-VHT resulted in less heat damage of mangoes than conventional vapor heat treatment (VHT) and shortened process time more than 90% during the preheating period. MW-VHT also retained equivalent or better lethality of oriental fruit fly eggs than did conventional VHT.

AB  - In response to environmental change, organisms rely on both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to adjust key traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction. Given the accelerating rate of climate change, plasticity may be particularly important. For organisms in warming aquatic habitats, upper thermal tolerance is likely to be a key trait, and many organisms express plasticity in this trait in response to developmental or adulthood temperatures. Although plasticity at one life stage may influence plasticity at another life stage, relatively little is known about this possibility for thermal tolerance. Here, we used locally adapted populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus to investigate these potential effects in an intertidal ectotherm. We found that low latitude populations had greater critical thermal maxima (CTmax) than high latitude populations, and variation in developmental temperature altered CTmax plasticity in adults. After development at 25 degrees C, CTmax was plastic in adults, whereas no adulthood plasticity in this trait was observed after development at 20 degrees C. This pattern was identical across four populations, suggesting that local thermal adaptation has not shaped this effect among these populations. Differences in the capacities to maintain ATP synthesis rates and to induce heat shock proteins at high temperatures, two likely mechanisms of local adaptation in this species, were consistent with changes in CTmax owing to phenotypic plasticity, which suggests that there is likely mechanistic overlap between the effects of plasticity and adaptation. Together, these results indicate that developmental effects may have substantial impacts on upper thermal tolerance plasticity in adult ectotherms.

AB  - Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) is a widespread pest of stored products from Fabaceae family. The evolution of this species is associated with common bean domestication and the ability to invade other hosts in storages. To analyze the role of diverse nutrition in the ability of insects to shift to another host species we tested the effects of nutrition history on composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), the compounds that have various ecological and reproductive functions in insects. The study was performed on A. obtectus laboratory populations which were bred for 51 generations either on common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris (L), or on chickpea, Cicer arietinum (L), a novel and less suitable species for larval development. To obtain conclusions about short-term nutritional effects, we tested whether exposure of seed weevils to alternative hosts for just one generation might influence CHC composition. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were performed and compounds' relative abundances were computed from the corresponding GC-FID peak areas. A total of 21 compounds were identified, among which 38% showed significant abundance differences between selection regimes and for 33% of compounds short-term developmental effects were revealed. All except three compounds showed significant differences between genders. We hypothesized that long-term changes in quantitative levels of specific CHC compounds were the results of diverse selection pressures on weevils' metabolic pathways induced by chemically divergent hosts. However, long-term adaptations to host species did not influence the ability of A. obtectus to quickly respond to chemical specificities of novel hosts (i.e., short-term effects were significant) which could be one of the major reasons for the great expansiveness of this species. Differences in relative CHCs abundances between sexes implied their roles in chemical communication and mate recognition systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of cold- and heat hardening on resistance to both low and high temperature stress was examined in Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for resistance to either cold or heat. The hardening effect was positive when the hardening was of the same type as the stress in all selection regimes. The effect of cold hardening on survival after heat stress was further examined in the lines selected for cold resistance and corresponding controls. A cross-protection effect (increased heat resistance after cold hardening) was present and this effect was lower in the lines selected for resistance to cold than in the controls. The level of Hsp70 expression induced by a non-lethal cold hardening was examined, showing that cold hardening induced Hsp70 expression. The results suggest that the cross-protection effect is at least partly due to Hsp70 expression induced by cold exposure. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   Nunavik Inuit (northern Quebec, Canada) reside along the arctic coastline where for generations their daily energy intake has mainly been derived from animal fat. Given this particular diet it has been hypothesized that natural selection would lead to population specific allele frequency differences and unique variants in genes related to fatty acid metabolism. A group of genes, namely CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, CPT2, CRAT and CROT, encode for three carnitine acyltransferases that are important for the oxidation of fatty acids, a critical step in their metabolism.
   Methods
   Exome sequencing and SNP array genotyping were used to examine the genetic variations in the six genes encoding for the carnitine acyltransferases in 113 Nunavik Inuit individuals.
   Results
   Altogether ten missense variants were found in genes CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, CPT2 and CRAT, including three novel variants and one Inuit specific variant CPT1A p.P479L (rs80356779). The latter has the highest frequency (0.955) compared to other Inuit populations. We found that by comparison to Asians or Europeans, the Nunavik Inuit have an increased mutation burden in CPT1A, CPT2 and CRAT; there is also a high level of population differentiation based on carnitine acyltransferase gene variations between Nunavik Inuit and Asians.
   Conclusion
   The increased number and frequency of deleterious variants in these fatty acid metabolism genes in Nunavik Inuit may be the result of genetic adaptation to their diet and/or the extremely cold climate. In addition, the identification of these variants may help to understand some of the specific health risks of Nunavik Inuit.

AB  - Haemocytes comprise a major component of the non-specific defence mechanisms in marine bivalves.  Induction of stress protein (SP) synthesis and accumulation of SPs was studied in vitro to define the metabolic response of oyster (C. virginica) haemocytes to acute temperature changes.  An acute cold shock to near freezing had no significant effect on protein synthesis.  However, a comparable heat shock of 20-28-degrees-C above the acclimation temperature of 20-degrees-C provoked a robust increase in synthesis of several SPs, especially those of about 70 (SP70), 37, 34 and 32 kDa.  This response persisted for at least 24 h, during which time both isoforms of SP70-like immunoreactivity accumulated.  Concomitantly, there was a decrease in the synthesis, but not in the level, of an actin-like protein of about 45 kDa.  The extent of SP synthesis induction also was directly dependent on the duration of the preceding hyperthermia.  Extending the duration of heat shock necessitated a longer recovery period, during which time amino acid incorporation returned towards or beyond the initial control values and cell viability was retained.  After a severe heat shock at 46-degrees-C for 1 h, the predominant protein made for several days was SP70, which is known to be essential for stress tolerance in other biological systems.  The results suggest that oyster haemocytes are remarkably resilient, and that SPs may contribute to their ability to resist or repair heat-evoked damage.  This molecular adaptability could permit them to maintain immune surveillance during or immediately following serious threats to survival of these sessile ectotherms.

AB  - Fish mortality generally occurs during extreme summer temperatures in India which are apprehended to be more frequent in near future and may reduce the fish population, particularly in closed aquatic systems. This present study is conducted with the objectives to find out heat shock and associated oxidative stress responses that occurred in selected fishLabeo rohitadue to extremely high water temperature (treated, 37-38 degrees C against control, 28-30 degrees C) exposure for 2 weeks. Calculated mortality was 30% during the experimental period. The results revealed the biomolecules associated with both the anti-oxidative response (reduced glutathione in serum, liver, muscle; catalase activity in liver, muscle; superoxide dismutase gene expression in the liver) and the heat shock response (hsp70 gene expression in the liver) were elevated under thermal stress. Pro-inflammatory responses (expression of complement protein 3, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the liver) and oxidative damages (lipid peroxidation in all studied tissue and DNA fragmentation in the liver) were more under thermal stress. Extreme thermal stress induced by partial lethal temperature exposure in this study led to the activation of both the heat shock response and the anti-oxidative response. However, these responses were not elicited to the level so that they can protect from oxidative damages and inflammation in the liver of all the studied fish that caused partial mortality in fish. Thermal stress-induced hepatotoxicity caused fish death which was documented for the first time in freshwater fish.

AB  - The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is leading a national effort to develop next-generation cooling technologies for hybrid vehicle electronics, as part of the Advanced Power Electronics and Electrical Machines program area in the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Vehicle Technologies Program. The overarching goal is to reduce the size, weight, and cost of power electronic modules that convert direct current from the batteries to alternating current for the motor, and vice versa. Aggressive thermal management techniques help in achieving the goals of increased power density and reduced weight and volume, while keeping the chip temperatures within acceptable limits. The viability of aggressive cooling schemes such as spray and jet impingement in conjunction with enhanced surfaces is being explored as part of the program. In this work, we present results from a series of experiments with pool and spray boiling on enhanced surfaces, such as a microporous layer of copper and copper nanowires, using HFE-7100 as the working fluid. Spray impingement on the microporous coated surface showed an enhancement of 100%-300% in the heat transfer coefficient at a given wall superheat with respect to spray impingement on a plain surface under similar operating conditions. The critical heat flux also increased by 7%-20%, depending on the flow rates. Heat transfer coefficients obtained on the nanowire-grown surface are considerably better than those obtained on the plain surface, although the enhancement is lower than those obtained on the microporous surface. The critical heat flux is also considerably lower for the nanowire surface than for the plain surface.

AB  - The following work is an in-depth investigation of the heat transfer characteristics and cooling effectiveness of a full-scale fully cooled modern high-pressure turbine (HPT) vane as a result of genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, relative to a modern baseline film cooling configuration. Individual designs were evaluated using 3D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that modeled film cooling injection using a transpiration boundary condition and evaluated 10 cells from the wall with an isothermal surface condition. 1800 different cooling arrays were assessed for fitness within the optimization where film cooling parameters such as axial and radial hole location, hole size, injection angle, compound angle, and custom-designed row patterns were varied in the design space. The GA optimization terminated with a unique pressure side (PS) cooling array after only 13 generations. The fitness functions prescribed for the problem lowered the PS average near-wall surface temperature, lowered the near-wall maximum temperature, and maintained the level of near-wall average overall effectiveness. Results show how the optimization resulted in redistributed flow from overcooled areas on the vane PS to undercooled areas near the shroud. The optimized cooling array yielded a reduction of average near-wall gas temperature of 2 K, a reduction in the maximum near-wall gas temperature of 3 K, a reduction in maximum heat flux of 2 kW/m(2) and a reduction in pressure loss over the vane, all while maintaining a constant level of surface-averaged overall effectiveness. Methods used to improve pressure side film cooling performance here are promising in terms of eliminating hot spots on individual HPT components in their proper operating environments as well as increasing the potential to use less air for cooling purposes in a gas turbine engine.

AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans strains with the heat-sensitive mortal germline phenotype become progressively sterile over the course of a few tens of generations when maintained at temperatures near the upper range of C. elegans' tolerance. Mortal germline is transgenerationally heritable, and proximately under epigenetic control. Previous studies have suggested that mortal germline presents a relatively large mutational target and that mortal germline is not uncommon in natural populations of C. elegans. The mortal germline phenotype is not monolithic. Some strains exhibit a strong mortal germline phenotype, in which individuals invariably become sterile over a few generations, whereas other strains show a weaker (less penetrant) phenotype in which the onset of sterility is slower and more stochastic. We present results in which we (1) quantify the rate of mutation to the mortal germline phenotype and (2) quantify the frequency of mortal germline in a collection of 95 wild isolates. Over the course of similar to 16,000 meioses, we detected one mutation to a strong mortal germline phenotype, resulting in a point estimate of the mutation rate U-Mrt approximate to 6x 10(-5)/genome/generation. We detected no mutations to a weak mortal germline phenotype. Six out of 95 wild isolates have a strong mortal germline phenotype, and although quantification of the weak mortal germline phenotype is inexact, the weak mortal germline phenotype is not rare in nature. We estimate a strength of selection against mutations conferring the strong mortal germline phenotype s approximate to 0.1%, similar to selection against mutations affecting competitive fitness. The appreciable frequency of weak mortal germline variants in nature combined with the low mutation rate suggests that mortal germline may be maintained by balancing selection.

AB  - Pyrethroid-resistant Hyalella azteca with voltage-gated sodium channel mutations have been identified at multiple locations throughout California. In December 2013, H. azteca were collected from Mosher Slough in Stockton, CA, USA, a site with reported pyrethroid (primarily bifenthrin and cyfluthrin) sediment concentrations approximately twice the 10-d LC50 for laboratory-cultured H. azteca. These H. azteca were shipped to Southern Illinois University Carbondale and have been maintained in pyrethroid-free culture since collection. Even after 22 months in culture, resistant animals had approximately 53 times higher tolerance to permethrin than non-resistant laboratory-cultured H. azteca. Resistant animals held in culture also lacked the wild-type allele at the L925 locus, and had non-synonymous substitutions that resulted in either a leucine-isoleucine or leucine-valine substitution. Additionally, animals collected from the same site nearly three years later were again resistant to the pyrethroid permethrin. When resistant animals were compared to non-resistant animals, they showed lower reproductive capacity, lower upper thermal tolerance, and the data suggested greater sensitivity to, 4, 4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), copper (II) sulfate, and sodium chloride. Further testing of the greater heat and sodium chloride sensitivity of the resistant animals showed these effects to be unrelated to clade association. Fitness costs associated with resistance to pyrethroids are well documented in pest species (including mosquitoes, peach-potato aphids, and codling moths) and we believe that H. azteca collected from Mosher Slough also have fitness costs associated with the developed resistance.

AB  - Synopsis Understanding the biological impacts of extreme temperatures requires translating meteorological estimates into organismal responses, but that translation is complex. In general, the physiological stress induced by a given thermal extreme should increase with the extreme's magnitude and duration, though acclimation may buffer that stress. However, organisms can differ strikingly in their exposure to and tolerance of a given extreme temperatures. Moreover, their sensitivity to extremes can vary during ontogeny, across seasons, and among species; and that sensitivity and its variation should be subject to selection. We use a simple quantitative genetic model and demonstrate that thermal extremes-even when at low frequency-can substantially influence the evolution of thermal sensitivity, particularly when the extremes cause mortality or persistent physiological injury, or when organisms are unable to use behavior to buffer exposure to extremes. Thermal extremes can drive organisms in temperate and tropical sites to have similar thermal tolerances despite major differences in mean temperatures. Indeed, the model correctly predicts that Australian Drosophila should have shallower latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance than would be expected based only on gradients in mean conditions. Predicting responses to climate change requires understanding not only how past selection to tolerate thermal extremes has helped establish existing geographic gradients in thermal tolerances, but also how increasing the incidence of thermal extremes will alter geographic gradients in the future.

AB  - Bagasse is abundantly available agricultural crop waste obtained from renewable source, so it was used as raw material for ethanol production. Acid and heat pretreatment in combination with biological saccharificarion was evaluated for conversion of bagasse cellulose and hemicelluloses to fermentable sugars. Maximum yield of monomeric sugars (13.98 w/v) was achieved when acidic pretreatment in combination with heat was subsequently followed by enzymatic saccharificarion. The maximum ethanol production from S. cerevisae cells (1.6 x 10(9)) entrapped in sodium alginate beads of diameter 2.0-2.5 mm 14.0 g/L was achieved with ethanol productivity of 10 gL(-1) h(-1) and sugar utilization of 85% at dilution rate of 0.25 h(-1) by feeding 60 g/L glucose concentration in packed bed reactor at temperature 25 degrees C and pH 5.5. This system for ethanol production was operationally stable for 136 h (cycle of 68 h).

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) have been emerging as attractive and promising methods for tumor treatment in clinical approaches. CuS nanoparticles are effective and cost-effective agents for PIT. Recently, it was observed that CuS nanoparticles are also excellence candidates for PDT. However, the mechanisms for CuS nanoparticles as PDT agents have never been discussed. The goal here is to explore the killing mechanisms of CuS nanoparticles as PTT and PDT agents. CuS nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple wet chemistry method by coating with amphiphilic polymer and examined for their therapeutic potential on lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A-1 in vitro and in vivo using a murine cancer model. The CuS nanoparticles produce heat as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) when excited by 808 nm laser and show strong anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo. The heating effects and release of copper ions from CuS upon heating in the tumor acidic environments are the main mechanisms for the generation of reactive oxygen species which are lethal bullets for cancer destruction. As a dual-function agent for PTT and PDT, CuS nanoparticles are promising phototherapy agents for cancer treatment.

AB  - The presence of barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain-tumor barrier (BTB), limits the penetration of antineoplastic drugs into the brain, resulting in poor response to treatments. Many techniques have been developed to overcome the presence of these barriers, including direct injections of substances by intranasal or intrathecal routes, chemical modification of drugs or constituents of BBB, inhibition of efflux pumps, physical disruption of BBB by radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (EMP), laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT), focused ultrasounds (FUS) combined with microbubbles and convection enhanced delivery (CED). However, most of these strategies have been tested only in preclinical models or in phase 1-2 trials, and none of them have been approved for treatment of brain tumors yet. Concerning the treatment of brain metastases, many molecules have been developed in the last years with a better penetration across BBB (new generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors like osimertinib for non-small-cell lung carcinoma and neratinib/tucatinib for breast cancer), resulting in better progression-free survival and overall survival compared to older molecules. Promising studies concerning neural stem cells, CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptors) strategies and immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors are ongoing.

AB  - Geochemical investigations for correlating the petroleum (oil and gas) with source rocks and that with petroleum itself, which can be produced from a similar or dissimilar source rock, is important for the assessment of generation potential of a prolific or potential petroleum system. Analytical advancements have synergized the hydrocarbon exploration methods, with exploration geochemistry becoming increasingly an integral part of source rock characterization. Geochemical studies investigate the presence and properties of hydrocarbons trapped in geological formations, or the potential to generate such hydrocarbons and provide source rocks properties, by measuring the compositional changes associated with hydrocarbon generation, migration, accumulation and production. These are critical for proper and efficient management of the hydrocarbon assets at all stages. The source rocks and the petroleum are primarily characterized utilizing the organic geochemical and stable isotope techniques. Organic geochemistry deciphers the source, depositional environment and thermal maturity of sedimentary organic matter from which the hydrocarbons are generated and the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen describe the paleo productivity, origin, evolution and correlation of organic matter with generated or in situ hydrocarbon components. The paper presents an overview of the stable isotopic and organic geochemical properties of shales from Damodar Valley basin of India in the light of its gas generation potential.

AB  - Several decarbonised polygeneration schemes exploiting carbon capture and storage (CCS) or CO2 reuse technologies for the generation of clean fuels, chemicals, electricity and heat have been systematically analysed for techno-economic feasibility. Process simulation, energy integration and economic analysis were undertaken to analyse the effect of process configurations and operating conditions on the economic potential (EP) and risks. CO2 capture and reuse producing methane using Sabatier's reaction shows less favourable economics compared to the counterpart CCS based scheme, both producing electricity, hydrogen, acetic acid and methanol in common. Post-combustion CO2 tri-reforming into methanol production in addition to electricity generation shows overall favourable economics compared to the counterpart integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) with CCS scheme. Thus, increasing product portfolio from energy products in a cogeneration plant to chemical products evolved from thermodynamic and process integration synergies increases the techno-economic viability. Bio-oil can be processed as an alternative low carbon feedstock. While bio-oil creates environmental incentives, its economic competitiveness can be enhanced by introducing credits on product prices.

AB  - The occurrence of mafic dike swarms in Archean and Paleoproterozoic terranes is often cited as evidence for mantle plume activity associated with abnormally high mantle potential temperatures (T-p). Quantitative modeling of rare-carth-element (REE) abundances for the 2.04 Ga Kangamiut dike swarm in west Greenland and comparisons among other Paleoproterozoic dike swarms in northeast Laurentia indicates that the conditions for mantle melt generation were similar beneath much of Laurentia and only ca. 120 degreesC hotter than present-day ambient mantle (T-p ca. 1300 degreesC). These thermal conditions correspond closely to estimates of ambient mantle potential temperatures during the Paleoproterozoic era based on secular cooling models and continental freeboard constraints. Thus, the geochemistry of most Paleoproterozoic dikes of northeast Laurentia can be accounted for by partial melting of upwelling mantle accompanying passive rifting and do not necessitate plume activity. Ambient mantle conditions during the Paleoproterozoic (T-p ca. 1420 degreesC) are similar to those inferred for the Paleogene volcanic rift margins of the North Atlantic igneous province, where the rate of crustal production associated with early oceanic spreading was two to three times higher than at the modern ridge. Likewise, rifting under ambient mantle conditions in the Precambrian could have resulted in similar rates of crustal productivity and thus contributed significantly to continental growth.

AB  - The integration of electrochromic (EC) and thermochromic (TC) systems is important for realizingmulti-functional smart windows, which can adaptively control light transmittance and solar energy in response to diverse external stimuli. In this study, we developed an all-solid-state multifunctional smart window, in which tungsten oxide (WO3)-based EC and vanadium oxide (VO2)-based TC cells were integrated into a single device. In hybrid smart windows, the WO3-based EC layer modulates optical transmission in response to electrical voltage, while the VO2-based TC layer regulates solar energy transmission responding to the surrounding temperature. Therefore, such windows can control optical transmission and solar energy transmission in response to an electric stimulus and temperature change simultaneously or independently, allowing for a selective modulation of light in the visible and near-infrared regions. We demonstrated the viability of the proposed integrated smart window system by varying its optical transmission in four different optical states depending on its EC reaction and TC behavior. The concept for the integration of EC and TC cells into a single device can pave the way for next-generation multifunctional smart window systems.

AB  - The influence of ambient temperature and applied electric field on the electrical properties of high resistivity (1-30 k Omega cm), semi-insulating (>100 k Omega cm), and insulating (10(11)-10(12)Omega cm) single-crystal 6H-SiC is reported. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of lateral metal-semiconductor-metal test structures were measured in vacuum in a temperature range of 295-730 K and under moderate pulsed electric fields (0.5-80 kV/cm). It is shown that the resistivity of the undoped 6H-SiC varies strongly with the ambient temperature after a temperature/field function dominated by a factor containing the activation (ionization) energy of residual boron of 0.35 eV. The dominant activation energy of semi-insulating Vanadium-compensated material (6H-SiC:V) varies with the ambient temperature, increasing from similar to 0 eV at 295-320 K to similar to 0.8 eV at T greater than or equal to 600 K. This result can explain the relatively low decrease of the resistivity of insulating 6H-SiC at very high ambient temperatures and its viability as a substrate for next-generation high temperature microwave integrated circuits based on large band gap semiconductors.

AB  - The combustion of fossil fuels for purposes of energy production has accelerated the rate at which the planet is warming, thereby causing adverse effects on natural ecosystems across the globe. The consequences of climate change arising from the use of conventional fuels such as coal, oil, and gas deinands a shift towards the use of sustainable, emissions-free renewable energy technologies. When planning for the implementation of new energy systems, several factors must be examined in order to determine the viability of a system to Meet energy demands in a sustainable and efficient manner. This paper provides an overview of tidal current turbines (TCTs), examining how they function to produce electricity, the possible environmental impacts surrounding large-scale implementation, associated economic factors, and public acceptability. A case study of the Gulf of St. Lawrence is presented as an implementation site, demonstrating the potential for TCTs to assist in phasing out the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation on the Newfoundland island interconnected electricity system. A multi-criteria decision making matrix is presented to discern the benefits of TCTs compared to fossil fuels for the purpose of electricity generation. The paper concludes by examining the potential future of TCTs in the world.

AB  - Notwithstanding the commercial importance of Lithodes santolla in the southern tip of South America, little is known about settlement habitat and behavior of their larvae. Such information is relevant for understanding its life history and for management and development of fishery-stock enhancement programs. The aims of this study were to determine the natural substrata that larval stages, zoeae and megalopa select for recruitment, and the effects of megalopa density and diurnal-nocturnal phase on such selection. Different laboratory experiments with durations of 8 h to 4 weeks were performed in 6-L round containers with their bottoms divided in four equal portions, each filled with sand, gravel, cobble and broken shell as substrata. Containers were kept in a cold room at 7.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C and under 12:12 h light and dark photoperiod. Trials began with the release of larvae of different stages in the center of the containers. After different time periods, proportions of larvae swimming or settled on each substrate were determined. Larvae selected and settled on natural substrata immediately after being placed into the containers. Experiments showed that all larval stages (zoeae and megalopa) preferred complex substrata such as broken shell, cobble and gravel over sand which was rejected. The megalopa selects the substrate even during night period. Selection seems to be density-dependent since at the lowest density broken shell was the preferred substrate. Selection of complex substrata (i.e. mussel beds and/or shell fragments in nature) by all larval stages, even as early as the first zoea stage, provides a cryptic habitat which may reduce mortality by predation and/or cannibalism. Knowledge on habitat preference is useful for fishery management and also for assessing the different habitats in a potential stock enhancement program of southern king crab. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim: HSP90, one of the most important and multifunctional stress proteins in cells, plays important role in cell self-protection and environmental adaptability in crustacean. Our previous study showed that application of imidazole derivative KK-42 can increase survival rate of Penaeus vannumei. In an attempt to research the possible molecular mechanism of KK-42 increasing survival rate in P. vannumei, one HSP90 cDNA sequence from the hepatopancreas was first isolated and then its spatiotemporal expressions were analyzed.
   Material and Methods: The HSP90 was cloned from the hepatopancreas of P. vannumei using the rapid amplification of cDNAends methods and its sequence was analyzed with biological software. Expression level was determined by real-time PCR.
   Results: The full-length cDNA contains a 2163 bp open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 721 amino acids. The P. vannumei HSP90 protein sequence is most closely related to other HSP90 enzymes, the higher mRNA level is detected in hepatopancreas. The hepatopancreas HSP90 expression is significantly induced by KK-42 and increases more than 69.1 %, even up to 505.5 % and 481.7 % on day 2 and day 3, respectively.
   Conclusion: The up-regulation of HSP90 expression induced by KK-42 is beneficial to improve adaptability that is likely one of the molecular mechanisms of KK-42 increasing survival rate in P. vannumei.

AB  - Ethylene glycol-based nanogels (NGs) have demonstrated their potential for the development of next-generation formulations for biomedical applications due to their interesting properties. In this work, monodispersed NGs based on oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylates (OEG) were synthesized through free radical precipitation/dispersion polymerization assisted by ultrasonication. Di(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMA; M-n 475 g mol(-1)) were used as the main monomers, acrylic acid (AA) or itaconic acid (IA) as co-monomers (OEG-co-AA and OEG-co-IA, respectively) and tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as crosslinker. The physicochemical properties of OEG-co-AA and OEG-co-IA NGs were studied including hydrodynamic diameter, poly-dispersity index, zeta potential and pH/temperature responsiveness. Samples with 4 mol% of both AA and IA showed nanometric sizes. Regarding their thermo-responsiveness, unexpected differences between NGs with AA or with IA were observed. Besides, NGs did not impair the cell viability of a breast tumour cell line even when high concentrations were added to the culture medium. The properties of the synthetized NGs showed that either NGs with 4% AA or with 4% IA are outstanding candidates for biomedical applications.

AB  - On the path towards the decarbonization of the electricity supply, flexibility and demand response have become key factors to enhance the integration of distributed energy resources, shifting the consumption from peak hours to off-peak hours, optimizing the grid usage and maximizing the share of renewables. Despite the technical viability of flexible services, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has not been proven. Traditionally, emissions are calculated on a yearly average timescale, not providing any information about peak hours' environmental impact. Furthermore, peak-hours' environmental impacts are not always greater than on the base load, depending on the resources used for those time periods. This paper formulates a general methodology to assess the potential environmental impact of peak-hourly generation profiles, through attributional life cycle assessment. This methodology was applied to five different countries under the INVADE H2020 Project. Evaluation results demonstrate that countries like Spain and Bulgaria could benefit from implementing demand response activities considering environmental aspects, enhancing potential greenhouse gas reductions by up to 21% in peak hours.

AB  - The embryonic developmental response of two abalone species (disk abalone Haliotis discus discus, giant abalone Haliotis gigantea) to a drop in salinity with different exposure times was investigated to gain a better understanding of the reasons for the decrease in natural stock populations. Two experimental designs-first, combinations of two salinities (34 and 17 psu) and four exposure times (0, 1, 2 and 4 h), and second, combinations of three salinities (34, 24 and 14 psu) and four exposure times (0, 1, 3 and 6 h)-were tested on disk and giant abalone eggs to determine the effects on hatching onset time, hatching success, percentage of abnormality and survival rate. Hatching onset time increased significantly for both species as salinity dropped and exposure time increased. Both species followed a decreasing trend in terms of hatching success as exposure time increased at low salinity levels. As for abnormality, both species showed a significant negative effect of low salinity and long exposure times. Giant abalone showed better adaptability to long exposure time at low salinity levels, and hence a higher survival rate, than disk abalone.

AB  - Extreme heat events are mainly responsible for weather-related human mortality due to climate change. However, there is a lack of outdoor thermal management for protecting people from extreme heat events. We present a novel infrared -radiation -enhanced nanofiber membrane (NFM) that has good infrared resonance absorption and selectively radiates thermal radiation of the human body through the atmosphere and into the cold outer space. The NFM comprises polyamide 6 (PA6) nanofibers and randomly distributed SiO2 submicron spheres and has sufficient air permeability and thermal-moisture comfortability because of its interconnect nanopores and micropores. We measure the sky 'radiative cooling performance under a clear sky, and PA6/SiO2 NFM produces temperatures that are about 0.4-1.7 degrees C lower than those of commercial textiles when covering dry and wet hands and temperatures 1.0-2.5 degrees C lower than the ambient temperature when thermal conduction and convection are isolated in a closed device. Our processed PA6/Si02 NFM combines sky radiative cooling with thermal management of the human body very well, which will promote the development of radiative cooling textiles.

AB  - Marine organisms need to adapt in order to cope with the adverse effects of ocean acidification and warming. Transgenerational exposure to CO2 stress has been shown to enhance resilience to ocean acidification in offspring from a number of species. However, the molecular basis underlying such adaptive responses is currently unknown. Here, we compared the transcriptional profiles of two genetically distinct oyster breeding lines following transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2 in order to explore the molecular basis of acclimation or adaptation to ocean acidification in these organisms. The expression of key target genes associated with antioxidant defence, metabolism and the cytoskeleton was assessed in oysters exposed to elevated CO2 over three consecutive generations. This set of target genes was chosen specifically to test whether altered responsiveness of intracellular stress mechanisms contributes to the differential acclimation of oyster populations to climate stressors. Transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2 resulted in changes to both basal and inducible expression of those key target genes (e.g. ecSOD, catalase and peroxiredoxin 6), particularly in oysters derived from the disease-resistant, fast-growing B2 line. Exposure to CO2 stress over consecutive generations produced opposite and less evident effects on transcription in a second population that was derived from wild-type (nonselected) oysters. The analysis of key target genes revealed that the acute responses of oysters to CO2 stress appear to be affected by population-specific genetic and/or phenotypic traits and by the CO2 conditions to which their parents had been exposed. This supports the contention that the capacity for heritable change in response to ocean acidification varies between oyster breeding lines and is mediated by parental conditioning.

AB  - Mass mortalities of juvenile Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in aquaculture operations have been linked to the ostreid herpes virus 1 (OsHV-1) or its variants. This oyster has heritable resilience to the virus which can provide a basis for selective breeding for higher OsHV-1 resistance, however, controlled challenge methods for improving selection response towards increased OsHV-1 resistance are required. The objective of this studywas to compare the survival of sibling juvenile oysters exposed to either a laboratory virus challenge or a heat shock challenge (as proxy for the virus challenge) and the survival of the same families on two oyster farms where they were exposed to natural field conditions including the presence of OsHV-1. A strong correlation between the family rankings was observed for the two farm sites. Estimated narrow sense heritabilities (h(2)) on the underlying liability scale were 0.38 (on-farm survival), 0.45 (laboratory virus challenge survival) and 0.15 (heat shock challenge survival). Only on-farm survival and laboratory virus challenge had a high genetic correlation. The method for measuring heat shock resistance in juvenile oysters produced high variability in survival among families but low estimates of heritability. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the laboratory virus challenge is a simple and relatively effective tool for selective breeding specifically towards OsHV-1 resistance or as part of a controlled multi-trait program.
   Statement of relevance: The OsHV-1 virus is a serious problem for commercial aquaculture of Pacific oysters in numerous countries. This paper tests two ways of evaluating oysters for resistance to OsHV-1 that can be incorporated into selective breeding programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Noctuidonema guyanense is an interesting ectoparasite of adult Lepidoptera that feeds on hosts from at least five families with its long styler. Noctuidonema guyanense spends its entire life on the adult moth and is sustained as it is passed from moth to moth during host mating. Overlapping host generations are essential for parasite survival. This nematode occurs throughout tropical and subtropical America and is transported by at least one of its hosts, Spodoptera frugiperda, during migration to northern sites in the United States each spring. Noctuidonema guyanense debilitates its hosts, Research conducted to help determine the biological control importance of this nematode is reviewed. Two additional species, N. daptria and N. dibolia, are now known for Noctuidonema.

AB  - The best option to overcome the energy penalty in Ca-looping is to take advantage of the surplus heat by external integration to produce additional power and increase net efficiency. As calciner represents the main energy consumption, another possibility is to internally use the surplus heat to preheat the solids entering this reactor. The objective of internal integration is to reduce the energy demand per captured tonne of CO2. It represents a reduction of the coal and oxygen needs and also a total decrease in the CO2 generation regarding the ordinary configuration. However, the amount of available heat for extra power generation by external integration, essential for the viability of this technology, is also reduced. This is the case of the configurations including a cyclonic preheater or a mixing seal valve. This study assess the energy penalty minimization that may be reached by external integration of these internal energy integration configurations. A methodological process has been applied to obtain a reduction of the energy penalty with respect to the ordinary configuration. This energy saving combined with the lower size of equipment and reduced capital cost would make the cyclonic preheater the most suitable configuration to improve the viability of this technology.

AB  - Bioenergy is considered to be an attractive option mainly due to driving forces of an environmental nature (e.g. climate change and sustainability issues). This is particularly the case for energy crops, which show higher productivity per land unit than their conventional counterparts. In addition, by comparison, such crops are more homogeneous in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics than residual resources that are often described as the biomass resource of the future. However, despite the long-term research and the considerable efforts to promote them, implementation is still rather slow across Europe. In this paper, two perennial energy crops, cardoon and giant reed, are evaluated in Rodopi, northern Greece, as alternative land use, through comparative financial appraisal with the main conventional crops.
   Based on the output of this analysis, the breakeven for the two energy crops is defined and an economic and socio-economic evaluation of a biomass district heating system is conducted.
   Results prove that energy crops can be attractive alternatives if they are properly integrated into existing agricultural activities and complement the current cropping options. As such, they provide raw material for local heat applications, thus resulting in increased income for the region and an increase in the number of jobs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundReducing fresh water consumption and nutrient addition will be an effective way to reduce the whole cost of bioethanol production. On the other hand, treatment of biogas slurry derived from anaerobic digestion (AD), in which a great amount of nutrients is still left, costs too much to remove these pollutants. It would be beneficial for both digestate valorization and ethanol production if biogas slurry is used for producing bioethanol. However, both hyperosmosis and potential biotoxic components of the biogas slurry can severely inhibit fermentation.ResultsIn this study, two rounds of atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis combined with adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) were applied to improve the adaptability and genetic stability of Zymomonas mobilis in biogas slurry. Mutants D95 and S912 were identified. Growth of the mutants was remarkably improved in biogas slurry. The highest ethanol productivity reached 0.63g/L/h which was 61.7% higher than ZM4 (0.39g/L/h). Genomic re-sequencing results also revealed that single nucleic variations (SNVs) and Indels occurred in the mutants, which are likely related to inhibitor in biogas slurry and low pH tolerance.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that these mutant strains have great potential to produce ethanol using biogas slurry to replace fresh water and nutrients.

AB  - Forest removal is a global threat to amphibian diversity. Declines occur within these areas, but many amphibians also avoid moving into or through disturbed areas. Understanding which cues result in avoidance may provide targets for preservation of amphibian occupancy and population connectivity. Negative phototaxis is known from many amphibians, but light can serve as a cue or as a proxy for other environmental cues like temperature. This study sought to evaluate whether larval salamander habitat selection was influenced most by light or temperature cues. Because some individuals choose to remain in deforested habitat, we also assessed whether differences in habitat selection existed between individuals from forested and deforested habitat. Using a laboratory experiment, we found that salamanders use both light and temperature cues for habitat selection. Although salamanders demonstrated larger responses to temperature, they were willing to move into warmer habitats to avoid light. Individuals from deforested regions preferred brighter and warmer areas than individuals from forested regions although plasticity was higher with respect to light relative to temperature. We also noted that salamander thermal preferences were lower than daytime temperatures in small (< 60 m) deforested regions. Overall, a combination of light and thermal cues following forest removal may contribute to avoidance of deforested regions, but more research is necessary to understand why some salamanders continue to occupy warm and bright-disturbed areas.

AB  - The effect of the gene-enzyme system of esterase-6 (EST-6) on the expression of viability traits in Drosophila melanogaster was studied at normal and high temperatures. Interline, ontogenetic, and sexual differences of beta-esterase activity in tissue extracts were found. The differences were not correlated with the viability parameters of the flies. Some flies in the b line, in contrast to the other lines examined (N, Canton S, cn, vg), had EST-6 forms with different electrophoretic mobility. This indicates genetic polymorphism of this line at EST-6 locus. The b(S) and b F lines, isogenic at the chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 and homozygous for Est-6(S) and Est-6(F), respectively, were derived from a heterozygous line b female by means of a special crossing scheme and selection. The S allozyme had lesser mobility but was more resistant to high temperature (57 degrees C). Flies from the b(S) line were more resistant to high temperature and were two times as fertile as the b(F) flies. These selective advantages of the b(S) line persisted for 20-45 generations at permissive high temperatures (29 degrees C). in the experimental population that started with a 1 : 1 ratio of Est-6(S) and Est-6(F) and was kept at 29 degrees C, an increase in the allele S frequency was demonstrated. Thus, the S allele of EST-6 can be considered as a part of the adaptational gene complex arising in population under high temperature conditions.

AB  - A mechanistic model was developed to assess the impact of predation of juvenile Notonecta maculata on size structured Daphnia magna populations and to provide a framework for quantifying the back-swimmers uptake of food. Results of experiments and model predictions clearly demonstrate selective predation of backswimmers when fed with a choice of daphnid size classes, with patterns of selectivity differing across N. maculata instars. The model describes the foraging process empirically on the base of a general predation cycle including four conditional events instead of using classic functional response curves. For model parameterisation components of predation, namely probability of encounter, attack and success as well as time spent on handling prey was directly observed by means of video tracking experiments. Since attack rate, capture success and handling time appeared to be a function of prey size differing between Notonecta instars, the model takes into account ontogenic changes in both predator and prey characteristics. Independent data of functional response and size selectivity experiments were used for model validation and proved the model outcome to be consistent with observations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The capelin is a small pelagic fish that performs long distance migrations. It is a key species in the Barents Sea ecosystem and its distribution is highly climate dependent. Here we use an individual based model to investigate consequences of global warming on capelin distribution and population dynamics. The model relies on input on physics and plankton from a biophysical ocean model, and the entire life cycle of capelin including spawning of eggs, larval drift and adult movement is simulated. Spawning day and adult movement strategies are adapted by a genetic algorithm. Spawning has to take place in designated near-shore spawning areas. The output generated by the model is capelin migration/distribution and population dynamics. We present simulations with present day climate and a future climate scenario. For the present climate the model evolves a spatial distribution resembling typical spatial dynamics of capelin with the coasts of Northern Norway and Murman as the main spawning areas. For the climate change simulation, the capelin is predicted to shift spawning eastwards and also utilize new spawning areas along Novaya Zemlya. There is also a shift in the adult distribution towards the north eastern part of the Barents Sea and earlier spawning associated with the warming.

AB  - During 2005-2008 species composition, abundance patterns, natural mortality rates and salinity effects on zooplankton were studied in the Bosphorus regions of the Black and Marmara Seas. The tendencies to diminish for abundance and biomass of the Black Sea originated zooplankton species and to increase for the proportion of their carcasses in the direction from the Black Sea toward the Marmara Sea were found. The mortality in the Black Sea species increased with depth in the Marmara Sea. The contribution of organic matter of carcasses of the Black Sea originated organisms to bacterial processes in the deep strata of the Marmara Sea was estimated. Different salinity and temperature regimes restrict mutual penetration of the species in these seas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parasitoids are key regulators of the population dynamics of their arthropod hosts, are integral to the structure and dynamics of food webs, and provide ecosystem services by suppressing agricultural pests. Despite their ecological and functional importance, relatively few studies have considered the effects of a warming climate on hostparasitoid interactions. The three primary modes through which parasitoids might respond to a warming climate are by (i) shifting distributions into cooler environments, (ii) altering phenology, and (iii) adjusting to persist in situ through phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary adaptation. Here, we focus on examples of altered distributions and phenology in response to climate warming. We suggest that the responses of parasitoids to elevated temperatures and the population dynamic consequences for their hosts will be linked to two key traits: the dispersal ability of both partners, and the host specificity of parasitoids. Effects of climate warming on hostparasitoid interactions will be complicated by interactions with other co-occurring environmental changes, such as elevated carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and to interactions with competitors, mutualists, and antagonists. These factors will complicate efforts to generate predictive models of hostparasitoid interactions, for example in the context of the ecosystem service of biological pest control.

AB  - The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is the most economically valuable pollinator of agricultural crops worldwide. Bees are also crucial in maintaining biodiversity by pollinating numerous plant species whose fertilisation requires an obligatory pollinator. Apis mellifera is a species that has shown great adaptive potential, as it is found almost everywhere in the world and in highly diverse climates. In a context of climate change, the variability of the honey bee's life-history traits as regards temperature and the environment shows that the species possesses such plasticity and genetic variability that this could give rise to the selection of development cycles suited to new environmental conditions. Although we do not know the precise impact of potential environmental changes on honey bees as a result of climate change, there is a large body of data at our disposal indicating that environmental changes have a direct influence on honey bee development. In this article, the authors examine the potential impact of climate change on honey bee behaviour, physiology and distribution, as well as on the evolution of the honey bee's interaction with diseases. Conservation measures will be needed to prevent the loss of this rich genetic diversity of honey bees and to preserve ecotypes that are so valuable for world biodiversity.

AB  - The study assessed the potential and economic viability of solar PV standalone systems for embedded generation, taking into account its benefits to small off-grid rural communities in forty meteorological sites in Nigeria. A specific electric load profile was developed to suite the communities consisting 200 homes, a school and community health centre. Data (daily mean relative humidity, maximum and minimum temperatures, and daily global solar radiation for 24 years spanning 1987-2010) obtained from the Nigeria Meteorological Agency were used. It focused on the assessment of design that will optimally meet daily load demand for the rural communities with an LOLP of 0.01. The HOMER (R) software optimizing tool was engaged for the feasibility study and design. A 15 MW PV distributed generation system was utilized to economically compare the different sites in terms of life cycle cost as well as levelised cost of producing energy. A profit for potential investors in the range of $ 0.01/kWh to $ 0.17/kWh was discovered for 29 of the 40 available meteorological sites, while the remaining sites were not profitable with the present tariff regime in Nigeria.

AB  - Combined Heat & Power (CHP) generation is the most efficient way of energy supply in urban area available today. It delivers significant benefits to its host facilities and urban distributed network (UDN) to which is connected. Economic viability of CHP generation for many sites requires integration with the UDN for backup and supplementary power needs and in some case the export of excess power to the UDN. CHP system integration into existing UDN entail installation costs. How these integration costs are distributed will have considerable impact on development and implementation of CHP generation in urban areas. The objective of this paper is to use analytical and statistical methods to develop an algorithm that provide means of determining the optimum capacity of a CHP generating plant that can be accommodated within the UDN, which correspond to Least Cost Technically Acceptable (LCTA) principle, and the UDN long term network planning policy. In order to determine optimal size of CHP generating plant that could be connected at any particular busbar on the UDN without causing a significant adverse impact on performance of the UDN, an algorithm is created that incorporate an analytical and multiple regression analysis model. It is tested using data obtained from ERAC power analysing software incorporating load flow, fault current level and power losses analysis. Additional data needed for effective algorithm creation was obtained via surveys of local UDN operators and planners. These analyses are performed on a 34 busbar network resembling part of the real UDN of Cork city for validation purposes and accuracy of the algorithm proposed.

AB  - A novel use of selection was applied to the examination of the genetics of phenotypic plasticity. The approach provides a sensitive way of detecting genotype-environment (g x e) interactions and also allows the form of any interactions across an environmental gradient to be investigated through changes in the shapes of the reaction norms. The wing pattern of the butterfly B, anynana varies with season; eyespot size increases with development temperature. Selection lines to increase and to decrease eyespot size at 28 degrees C were carried out. The effect of selection on the eyespot reaction norms with temperature was examined. Selection produced divergent reaction norms across the entire range of temperature in most eyespots. Significant g x e interactions were sometimes present but the degree of interaction was always relatively small. When present, the form of the interaction varied between the sexes. There was a high degree of genetic independence between the eyespots on the ventral and on the dorsal wing surfaces, except in the dorsal eyespot in the wing cell corresponding to the wing cell of the selected ventral wing surface eyespot. The significance of the results for the maintenance of genetic variation in B, anynana is considered.

AB  - High-temperature steam has been directly generated from hot water based on a solid sorption heat pump system by employing silane functionalized zeolite 13X (XS). The adsorbent is prepared by a liquid phase grafting method to modify functional groups on the zeolite surface with a silane coupling agent. The static water contact angle (WCA) and surface functional groups are analyzed by optical contact angle measuring instruments and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Analytical results confirm the successful preparation of surface hydrophobic zeolite. The water adsorption capacity of XS is slightly less than that of 13X, while the overall adsorption heat remains almost constant. Dry air at 130 degrees C is utilized for the regeneration of the wet zeolite in cyclic experiments. Steam at 207 degrees C is generated from input hot water at 72 degrees C in a packed bed filled with XS-25 (zeolite 13X functionalized by a saline solution concentration of 25%). The thermal response during the steam generation process is accelerated by utilizing XS. The mass of steam product does not change during the generation with XS, whereas cyclic time is shortened. Moreover, XS facilitates the regeneration process by decreasing the heat demand for the removal of free water. System evaluation results show that a higher Sp (steam productivity) is obtained for XS than that for zeolite 13X. COPh (coefficient of performance for heating) and SHP (specific heating power) are elevated by 23.6% and 5.7% for XS compared with those for zeolite 13X, respectively.

AB  - When environmental variation is spatially continuous, dispersing individuals move among nearby sites with similar habitat conditions. But as an environmental gradient becomes steeper, gene flow may connect more divergent habitats, and this is predicted to reduce the slope of the adaptive dine that evolves. We compared quantitative genetic divergence of Rana temporaria frog populations along a 2,000-m elevational gradient in eastern Switzerland (new experimental results) with divergence along a 1,550-km latitudinal gradient in Fennoscandia (previously published results). Both studies found significant countergradient variation in larval development rate (i.e., animals from cold climates developed more rapidly). The dine was weaker with elevation than with latitude. Animals collected on both gradients were genotyped at similar to 2,000 singlenucleotide polymorphism markers, revealing that dispersal distance was 30% farther on the latitudinal gradient but 3.9 times greater with respect to environmental conditions on the elevational gradient. A meta-analysis of 19 experimental studies of anuran populations spanning temperature gradients revealed that countergradient variation in larval development, while significant overal I, was weaker when measured on steeper gradients. These findings support the prediction that adaptive population divergence is less pronounced, and maladaptation more pervasive, on steep environmental gradients.

AB  - Most experimental studies on adaptation to stressful environments are performed under conditions that are rather constant and rarely ecologically relevant. Fluctuations in natural environmental conditions are ubiquitous and include for example variation in intensity and duration of temperature, droughts, parasite loads, and availability of nutrients, predators and competitors. The frequency and amplitude of many of these fluctuations are expected to increase with climate change. Tolerance curves are often used to describe fitness components across environmental gradients. Such curves can be obtained by assessing performance in a range of constant environmental conditions. In this perspective we briefly list theoretical and experimental evidence why results obtained under constant environmental conditions might be misleading for processes in nature and therefore may not be suitable for predicting fitness and future species distribution and abundance. We further suggest experimental avenues that can provide a better foundation for forecasts of the distribution of biota.

AB  - An experimentally easy to perform method for the generation of alumina-supported Fe3O4 nanoparticles [(6 +/- 1)nm size, 0.67wt%]and the use of this material in hydrazine-mediated heterogeneously catalyzed reductions of nitroarenes to anilines under batch and continuous-flow conditions is presented. The bench-stable, reusable nano-Fe3O4@Al2O3 catalyst can selectively reduce functionalized nitroarenes at 1mol% catalyst loading by using a 20mol% excess of hydrazine hydrate in an elevated temperature regime (150 degrees C, reaction time 2-6min in batch). For continuous-flow processing, the catalyst material is packed into dedicated cartridges and used in a commercially available high-temperature/-pressure flow device. In continuous mode, reaction times can be reduced to less than 1min at 150 degrees C (30bar back pressure) in a highly intensified process. The nano-Fe3O4@Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated stable reduction of nitrobenzene (0.5M in MeOH) for more than 10h on stream at a productivity of 30mmolh(-1) (0.72mol per day). Importantly, virtually no leaching of the catalytically active material could be observed by inductively coupled plasma MS monitoring.

AB  - Current intensive grain crops production is often associated with environmental burdens. However, very few studies deal with the environmental performance of both current and alternative systems of barley production. This study was undertaken to evaluate energy consumption and environmental impacts of irrigated and rain-fed barley production. Additionally, three alternative scenarios were examined for irrigated barley fields including conservation tillage and biomass utilization policies. The findings showed that around 25 GJ/ha energy is needed in order to produce 2300 kg/ha irrigated barley and 13 GJ/ha for 1100 kg/ha rain-fed barley. Life cycle assessment (LCA) results indicated that irrigated farms had more environmental impacts than rain-fed farms. Electricity generation and consumption had the highest effect on the abiotic depletion potential, human toxicity potential, freshwater and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential. However, alternative scenarios revealed that using soil conservation tillage systems and biomass consumption vs. gas for electricity generation at power plants can significantly mitigate environmental impacts of irrigated barley production similar to the rain-fed conditions while higher yield is obtained.

AB  - Plasma spraying of large-scale components (such as paper mill rolls, rocket exit nozzles, parts of the land-based turbines for power generation, thermally sprayed free-standing tubes, etc.) and also powder spheroidization) are just several examples of industrial applications where the processing time and costs are critical. To ensure productivity and cost-effectivity of the process, it is beneficial to use plasma torches which can process high powder throughputs, i.e. with feed rates in tens of kilograms per hour. Such torches must have sufficiently high enthalpy and plasma temperature, to ensure homogeneous particle treatment and high deposition efficiency. Hybrid water-stabilized plasma (WSP-H) system with its enthalpy of more than 140 MJ/kg and plasma temperature of 25 000 K is able to process up to 40 kg of powders per hour. Since the WSP-H torch consumes typically only 15 slm of Ar at full power of 180 kW, it is a very powerful and also economical tool that meets all the prerequisites for large-scale plasma spraying applications. Spraying of three representative ceramics: alumina, zircon, and yttria-stabilized-zirconia is presented in this study. It reveals only limited influence of increasing powder throughput on particle velocity, temperature and coating microstructure. Deposition efficiency of the processes is discussed and the deposited coatings are analyzed by SEM and XRD.

AB  - Drought, in combination with high temperature and low humidity affects the productivity of Hevea brasiliensis, the natural rubber tree and its expansion to non-traditional regions. The genotypes of H. brasiliensis that perform well in traditional regions often failed in non-traditional regions thus necessitating breeding for stress-tolerant genotypes. This can be accomplished by adopting molecular-assisted selection method. Recent developments in identification of drought-responsive transcripts from H. brasiliensis and the findings on role of small RNAs indicate the possibility of employing them as markers for identification of suitable genotypes. In this study, we attempted to identify drought-responsive miRNAs from H. brasiliensis through next-generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq) method. The results revealed the expression of 33 conserved and 32 novel drought-responsive miRNAs. Further, validation of differentially expressed miRNAs by quantitative expression analysis indicated the association of two novel miRNAs, viz., HbmiRn_63 and HbmiRn_42 and two conserved miRNAs, viz., miR168 and miR160 miRNAs with drought tolerance. These miRNAs can be employed as markers for drought tolerance after validation in a larger set of genotypes. This study opens up the possibility of employing miRNAs as markers for drought tolerance in Hevea.

AB  - Global warming has become a problem in many areas. The orientation of farmers towards an agriculture adapted to drought conditions, which uses dry-farming systems, allows the responsible and sustainable management of agricultural lands, without fragmenting habitats and contributing to the extinction of some species of flora and fauna. The survival of some species with a role in biodiversity for agricultural crops, the adaptability of some of them in dry areas and the improvement to create different hybrids with resistance to increasingly aggressive environmental factors, is due to this type of agriculture and to the new directions in specialized research. The study was conducted as an open-field experience, in the southeastern part of Romania, at the Agricultural Research and Development Station, Braila. The research started with the agricultural year 2019 but its climatic conditions were registered as excessive, which is why the capitalization of the results was made only for the agricultural year 2020-2021. Of the 7 cultivated plant species that do not normally fit into the crop plan in the study area, only three species ( flax, sorghum, mustard) coped with climate stress and could be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB  - Our understanding of the plastic and evolutionary potential of ectothermic organisms and their populational impacts in the face of rapid global change remains limited. Studies attempting on the relationship between the magnitude of thermal variability across latitude and the degree of phenotypic plasticity exhibited by marine ectotherms are inconclusive. We state that the latter arises from the narrow range of thermal variability captured by the limited span of the latitudinal gradients studied to date.
   Using a mechanistic ecophysiological approach and a satellite-based assessment of the relevant environmental variables (i.e. temperature and food availability), we studied individuals of the intertidal barnacle Jehlius cirratus from seven local populations widely spread along the Humboldt current system that spanning two biogeographic regions. At the same time, we synthesized published information on the local abundance of our study species across a total of 76 sites representing 20 degrees of latitude, and spanning from 18 to 42 degrees S.
   We examined the effects of latitude and environmental variability on metabolic rate plasticity, thermal tolerance (thermal breadth and thermal safety margins) and their impacts on the abundance of this widespread marine invertebrate.
   We demonstrate that the phenotypic plasticity of metabolic rate in J. cirratus populations is not related to latitude. In turn, thermal breadth is explained by the temperature variability each population experiences. Furthermore, we found clinal variation with a poleward decrease of the critical thermal minimum, suggesting that episodic extreme low temperatures represent a ubiquitous selective force on the lower thermal limit for ectotherms.
   Across our study gradient, plasticity patterns indicate that populations at the equatorial extreme are more vulnerable to a warming climate, while populations located in the biogeographic transitional zone (i.e. high environmental heterogeneity), on the centre of the gradient, display higher levels of phenotypic plasticity and may represent a genetic buffer for the effects of ocean warming. Together, our results suggest the existence of a fitness trade-off involving the metabolic cost of plasticity and population density that is evident only across the vast latitudinal gradient examined.

AB  - The thermal density of electronic parts and systems has been increased continuously as high speed and high density are required for them. The heat generation of the CPU of a notebook PC of higher than the Pentium-II grade has been recently increased to be more than 10W, and the available packaging space has been compacted. Therefore, it has become inevitable to perform cooling by using miniature heat pipes. In the present study, new woven-wired-type wick with a large capillary limit and a high productivity has been developed, and hear pipes with the diameter of 3mm or 4mm to cooling of small-sized electronic parts such as CPU of a notebook PC, have been designed and manufactured. Further, in as much as the operational characteristics of miniature heat pipes(MHPs) with the diameter of 3mm or 4mm are different from those of general medium-sized heat pipes, a performance test has been performed in order to review heat-transfer characteristics and affects of various factors on the performance of MHPs. The operational factors include charging ratio of working fluid, the total length of heat pipes, lengths of an evaporator and a condenser, inclination of installation, number of wick strands, thermal load, etc. The limiting powers of 3mm MHP and 4mm MHP are shown to be 6.8W and 19.5W, respectively, with angle of inclination of -5 degrees. These show that there is a high possibility of application if one or two MHPs are installed for cooling of CPU more than 10W.

AB  - Literature on biodiesel production over the last 10 years (2007-2018) has been critically reviewed directing further research toward membrane-based sustainable and green production. The manuscript discusses how biodiesel production strategies have evolved in the recent years through adoption of better feedstock, better catalysts, more efficient reactor technology, and through incorporation of more efficient downstream separation-purification techniques. The review reveals that though transesterification reaction between alcohol and plant oil/animal fats leading to production of biodiesel is simple, the downstream separation and purification of the final product (fatty acid methyl esters) is quite challenging. This review shows that productivity can be enhanced through new generation catalysts, use of green solvents, and a more efficient reactor technology while the use of tailor-made membrane in appropriate modules holds the promise of low-cost and eco-friendly downstream purification. It is exposed that a membrane-based technology can bring about high degree of process intensification, whereas recovery and reuse of catalysts and alcohol are likely to add to the economy of the process, resulting in sustainable production technology.

AB  - We studied dynamics of the artificial thermal selection of siblings in individual hog slater families at various levels of environmental pollution with cadmium sulfate. At pollutant concentrations below 0.90 mg/l, thermal selection for families resistant to high temperature is inefficient due to uneven and variable change of the organism thermostability in individual families affecting their selective range. Double and higher increase in the dose decreases the mean population thermostability, which increases expected survival rate of the families with relatively high thermostability.

AB  - Simple Summary Study of mating-induced trade-offs between reproduction and survival is conducive to provide evolutionary insights into reproductive strategies and aging. Using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics, we found that mating induced changes of genes and pathways related to reproduction and survival in females of a pine sawfly. Mating induced substantial downregulation on genes associated to immunity, stress response, and longevity. However, mating induced divergent reproductive response, with downregulation on genes related to egg production while upregulation on genes related to egg fertilization. Considering the nature of limited resources in adults, low fecundity and egg protection behavior in this sawfly, we suggest that mating triggers trade-offs between reproduction and survival in this insect and females of this species have evolved specific strategies to adapt to the living conditions, e.g., restrict whole fecundity to ensure higher fertilization and offspring's survival. Investigation of mating-induced trade-offs between reproduction and survival is conducive to provide evolutionary insights into reproductive strategies and aging. Here, we used RNAseq and bioinformatics to reveal mating-induced changes of genes and pathways related to reproduction and survival in female Cephalcia chuxiongica, a pine defoliator with facultative parthenogenesis and long larval dormancy. Results showed that mating induced substantial downregulation on genes and pathways associated to immunity, stress response, and longevity. However, mating induced divergent reproductive response, with downregulation on genes and pathways related to egg production while upregulation on genes and pathways related to egg fertilization. Considering the nature of limited resources in adults, low fecundity, and egg protection behavior in C. chuxiongica, we suggest that mating triggers trade-offs between reproduction and survival in this insect and females of this species may have evolved specific strategies to adapt to the environmental and hosts' conditions, e.g., restrict whole fecundity to ensure higher fertilization and offspring's survival. Moreover, mating induced significant responses on genes and pathways that play important roles in vertebrate reproduction while their function in insects are unclear, such as the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway; the significant regulation after mating suggests that their function may be evolutionarily conserved in animal kingdom.

AB  - I test for macroscale intraspecific variation of abundance, mortality, and regeneration of four eastern US tree species (Tsuga canadensis, Betula lenta, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus prinus) by splitting them into three climatic zones based on plant hardiness zones (PHZs). The primary goals of the analysis are to assess the differences in environmental heterogeneity and demographic responses among climatic zones, map regional species groups based on decision tree rules, and evaluate univariate and multivariate patterns of species demography with respect to environmental variables. I use the Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data to derive abundance, mortality, and regeneration indices and split the range into three climatic zones based on USDA PHZs: (1) cold adapted, leading region; (2) middle, well-adapted region; and (3) warm adapted, trailing region. I employ decision tree ensemble methods to assess the importance of environmental predictors on the abundance of the species between the cold and warm zones and map zonal variations in species groups. Multivariate regression trees are used to simultaneously explore abundance, mortality, and regeneration in tandem to assess species vulnerability. Analyses point to the relative importance of climate in the warm adapted, trailing zone (especially moisture) compared to the cold adapted, leading zone. Higher mortality and lower regeneration patterns in the warm trailing zone point to its vulnerability to growing season temperature and precipitation changes that could figure more prominently in the future. This study highlights the need to account for intraspecific variation of demography in order to understand environmental heterogeneity and differential adaptation. It provides a methodology for assessing the vulnerability of tree species by delineating climatic zones based on easily available PHZ data, and FIA derived abundance, mortality, and regeneration indices as a proxy for overall growth and fitness. Based on decision tree rules, ecologically meaningful variations in species abundance among the climatic zones can be related to environmental variability and mapped.

AB  - We studied the potential effects of predicted climate change on the energetic demands of juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and their consequences for local population size and structure in Idaho, USA. Projected increases in water temperature incurred on average a 10% higher energetic cost by 2040 (range 7.0%-12.5% among study reaches in the watershed) and a 16% increase (range 8.5%-21.3%) by 2080 following the A1B scenario. The predicted increase in energetic cost was largest in the coolest stream reaches, where the proportional increases in energetic cost exceed that of temperature. Energetically, and in absence of increases in food supply, local densities were consequently expected to decline. We examined which factors best described the shape of current size distributions to explore future size distributions as temperatures increase. Mass distribution skewness was best explained by local biomass (positive relationship) and water temperature (negative relationship). The results suggest that local steelhead cohorts will approach a platykurtic, slightly negatively skewed distribution with increasing temperatures and demonstrate that temperature can exacerbate demographic density dependence in fish populations.

AB  - The climate crisis is affecting the production yield of rice, wheat, corn, coffee, beans and other food crops in the country and internationally. The objective of the research was to quantify the impact of climate change on the net income of organic quinoa producers under dry farming conditions in the Altiplano region. Using the Ricardian approach, the impact of climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) on the yield of organic quinoa was estimated in the districts of Cabana, Capachica and Ilave in the Altiplano region, and with primary data collected through a survey to A sample of 237 farmers estimated the value of land productivity. The climatic variables were provided by the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Puno. The results reveal an average production of 1,497 kilos per hectare, obtaining a net income of 14,969 soles per hectare, for a market price of 9.60 soles per kilo. The adaptability of the quinoa producer to climate change was relevant to improve the productivity of the crop. In conclusion, the impact of the agroclimatic variables on the productivity-economic income of organic quinoa producers was marginal in the 2015-2016 agricultural season in the Puno Region.

T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - This paper addresses the need to define distinct population segments within species of salmonid fishes. The paper focuses on identifying the smallest detectable population with unique sets of characters (i.e. a 'species' under the phylogenetic species concept); such units require identification before any subsequent groupings under which individual populations may ultimately be managed. Stream distance measurements between populations fail to identify ancestral discontinuities and are therefore excluded as a basis for estimating relationships. The requirement for genetic information in distinguishing populations has been met through characters reflecting ancestral lineages (including adequate biochemical genetic surveys and congruent meristic information), and those reflecting local adaptations (such as timings of migration and spawning, and distinct temperature tolerances). These different types of genetic information form complementary data sets for distinguishing populations because they reflect different evolutionary processes and time scales. Within distinct ancestral groupings defined by biochemical genetic data may exist adaptively distinct populations that cannot be distinguished in the absence of life history and ecological information. Examples are summarized in which a logical process has been applied for distinguishing populations; this includes an initial survey that focuses on identifying ancestral groupings followed by a systematic search for adaptive distinctions within these groupings.

AB  - As climate changes, species' ability to spatially track suitable climate depends on their spread velocity, a function of their population growth and dispersal capacity. When climate changes faster than species can spread, the climate experienced at species' expanding range edges may ameliorate as conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this boosts species' growth rates, their spread accelerates. Here, we use simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore how climatic amelioration interacts with dispersal evolution and local adaptation to determine the dynamics of spread. We found that depending on the timing of dispersal evolution, spread velocity can show contrasting trajectories, sometimes transiently exceeding the climate velocity before decelerating. Climatic amelioration can also accelerate the spread of populations composed of genotypes best adapted to local climatic conditions, but the exact dynamics depends on the pattern of climatic adaptation. We conclude that failing to account for demographic variation across climatic gradients can lead to erroneous conclusions about species' capacity to spatially track suitable climate.

TI  - Nuclear Fission, Today and Tomorrow: From Renaissance to Technological Breakthrough (Generation IV) - Part I
T2  - ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA  - English
AB  - This paper is an overview of the current Euratom FP-7 research and training actions in innovative nuclear fission reactors and fuel cycle technologies, including partitioning and transmutation. It is based on the more than 40 invited lectures that were delivered by research project coordinators and by keynote speakers at the FISA-2009 Conference, organised by the European Commission DG Research/Euratom. The education and training programmes in nuclear fission and radiation protection are also discussed, aiming at continuously increasing the level of nuclear competences across the EU.
   It is necessary to consider the most recent nuclear fission technologies (Generations of Nuclear Power Plants:
   GEN II: safety and reliability of nuclear facilities and energy independence;
   GEN III: continuous improvement of safety and reliability, and increased industrial competitiveness in a growing energy market;
   GEN IV: for increased sustainability, and proliferation resistance.
   The focus in this paper is on the design objectives and research issues associated to Generations IV systems that have been agreed upon internationally. Their benefits are discussed according to a series of ambitious criteria or technology goals established at the international level. One will have to produce not only electricity at lower costs but also heat at very high temperatures, while exploiting a maximum of fissile and fertile matters, and recycling all actinides, under safe and reliable conditions. Scientific viability studies and technological performance tests for each Generation IV system are now being carried out in many laboratories world-wide, in line with the intergovernmental GIF agreement. The ultimate phase of commercial deployment is forseen for 2040.
   In the Conclusion, it is shown to what extent Generation IV can be considered as a beneficial, responsible and sustainable response to the societal and industrial challenges of the future low-carbon economy (at the horizon 2040).

AB  - Climate change is causing habitat salinity to transform at unprecedented rates across the globe. While much of the research on climate change has focused on rapid shifts in temperature, far less attention has focused on the effects of changes in environmental salinity. Consequently, predictive studies on the physiological, evolutionary, and migratory responses of organisms and populations to the threats of salinity change are relatively lacking. This omission represents a major oversight, given that salinity is among the most important factors that define biogeographic boundaries in aquatic habitats. In this perspective, we briefly touch on responses of organisms and populations to rapid changes in salinity occurring on contemporary time scales. We then discuss factors that might confer resilience to certain taxa, enabling them to survive rapid salinity shifts. Next, we consider approaches for predicting how geographic distributions will shift in response to salinity change. Finally, we identify additional data that are needed to make better predictions in the future. Future studies on climate change should account for the multiple environmental factors that are rapidly changing, especially habitat salinity.

AB  - Does the development rate of common frog tadpoles accelerate if their habitat dries? To study this, the water level in experimental tanks was reduced shortly before time of metamorphosis. Water level remained high in control tanks. The experiment was performed at two different tadpole densities and replicated four times, with tadpoles from different source ponds. The experimental treatment, simulating a drying pond, resulted in earlier metamorphosis while no significant difference in size at metamorphosis was found. Resources per capita decreased as a result of the decreased water level so the increase in development rate was not an effect of feeding conditions. Temperatures in the tanks were such that it is unlikely that the increased development rate was due to temperature effects. I interpret the advancement of metamorphosis as an adaptive response to the threat of drying. This response has been documented for several other anuran species. All those breed in temporary water bodies, supporting the hypothesis that the trait is an evolved adaptation for breeding in such waters.

AB  - A synthesis of research on the responses of terrestrial biota (1095 effect sizes) to industrial pollution (206 point emission sources) was conducted to reveal regional and global patterns from small-scale observational studies. A meta-analysis, in combination with other statistical methods, showed that the effects of pollution depend on characteristics of the specific polluter (type, amount of emission, duration of impact on biota), the affected organism (trophic group, life history), the level at which the response was measured (organism, population, community), and the environment (biome, climate). In spite of high heterogeneity in responses, we have detected several general patterns. We suggest that the development of evolutionary adaptations to pollution is a common phenomenon and that the harmful effects of pollution on terrestrial ecosystems are likely to increase as the climate warms. We argue that community-and ecosystem-level responses to pollution should be explored directly, rather than deduced from organism-level studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current global changes are reshaping ecological communities and modifying environmental conditions. We need to recognize the combined impact of these biotic and abiotic factors on species interactions, community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, the strength of predator-prey interactions often depends on the presence of other natural enemies: it weakens with competition and interference or strengthens with facilitation. Such effects of multiple predators on prey are likely to be affected by changes in the abiotic environment, altering top-down control, a key structuring force in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Here, we investigated how warming alters the effects of multiple predators on prey suppression using a dynamic model coupled with empirical laboratory experiments with Drosophila-parasitoid communities. While multiple parasitoids enhanced top-down control under warming, parasitoid performance generally declined when another parasitoid was present owing to competitive interactions. This could reduce top-down control over multiple generations. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for interactive effects between abiotic and biotic factors to better predict community dynamics in a rapidly changing world and thus better preserve ecosystem functioning and services such as biological control.

AB  - Total lifetime costs of photovoltaic (PV) systems are important determinants of profitability. But such costs are not always accurately measured and compared against fluctuating electricity costs, which can be an important contributor to long-term profitability. In this paper, we consider the economics of concentrated photovoltaics (CPV), which offer significantly higher efficiency and greater energy production over traditional fixed flat-plate PV installations in high-irradiance regions, but are perceived to be risky investments.
   Working with two models, one a simple annual model that uses only direct normal solar insolation; the other a more complex hourly model that uses direct normal solar insolation, ambient temperature, and wind speed to predict energy yield, we calculated the energy production and corresponding revenue generation for a 28 kW CPV unit and a comparable single-axis tracker field in Nevada. Our resulting cost matrix shows how much revenue a CPV system can reasonably be expected to generate under different pricing schemes and time periods. While the values vary depending on the assumptions made, the matrix provides an index of profitability, enabling prospective buyers to compare the costs of purchasing, installing and maintaining a system against likely revenue.
   As a result of our calculations, we anticipate that CPV systems will still be viable in high flux areas because they offer the promise of profitability now and continued or increased profitability as cell costs decrease and/or overall efficiency increases. Nonetheless, other factors, such as long-term reliability and O&M costs, must be addressed if CPV is to compete with other simpler technologies, such as single-axis PV trackers, which have lower upfront costs and are therefore becoming more attractive to potential customers.

AB  - We evaluated the influence of host preference, mating, and release density on Telenomus remus (Nixon, 1937) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) parasitizing eggs of Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). First, we tested host preference of T. remus (free choice test) offered a choice between eggs of Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton, 1865) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and S. frugiperda. Parasitism capacity and host preference (S. frugiperda) of T. remus reared on either of the two hosts did not differ. Secondly, we evaluated the influence of mating behavior of T. remus females on its parasitism. Only the offspring sex ratio differed between treatments, indicating that the species reproduces by parthenogenesis of the arrhenotoky type. Finally, we evaluated the influence of release density on T. remus parasitism. This was tested by releasing different numbers of the parasitoid per S. frugiperda egg using T. remus reared for different numbers of generations on C cephalonica eggs. The regression analysis between percentage of parasitism and density of released T. remus females showed a quadratic effect for all tested parasitoid generations (F-35, F-40, and F-45) with maximum parasitism from 65.07% to 71.69%. Our results allow the conclusion that (a) T. remus prefers S. frugiperda eggs, regardless of the host on which this parasitoid was reared, showing no preimaginal conditioning; (b) Mating does not affect the number of eggs parasitized by T. remus or the development of its offspring; and (c) The optimal T. remus release density when reared on C. cephalonica is between 0.133 and 0.150 females/S. frugiperda.

AB  - Ecology Letters (2012) Abstract The geography of adaptive genetic variation is crucial to species conservation yet poorly understood in marine systems. We analyse the spatial scale of genetic variation in traits that broadly display adaptation throughout the range of a highly dispersive marine species. We conducted common garden experiments on the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, from 39 locations along its 3 000 km range thereby mapping genetic variation for growth rate, vertebral number and sex determination. Each trait displayed unique clinal patterns, with significant differences (adaptive or not) occurring over very small distances. Breakpoints in the cline differed among traits, corresponding only partially with presumed eco-geographical boundaries. Because clinal patterns are unique to each selected character, neutral genes or those coding for a single character cannot serve as proxies for the genetic structure as a whole. Conservation plans designed to protect essential genetic subunits of a species will need to account for such complex spatial structures.

AB  - Many euryhaline wanderer species exhibit seasonal habitat changes, and temperature is suggested to play a key role in this phenomenon. To examine this possibility, we tested the hypothesis that adaptable temperature ranges of euryhaline wanderers are narrower in a non-natal osmotic environment than in their natal osmotic environment using dace Tribolodon hakonensis, a freshwater born euryhaline fish, and black porgy Acanthopagrus schlegelii, a marine born euryhaline fish. In both species, all individuals survived for 48 h in all the tested temperatures in their natal osmotic environments. In non-natal osmotic environments, however, both low (dace: 6 A degrees C, black porgy: 10 A degrees C) and high temperatures (dace: 30 A degrees C, black porgy: 33 A degrees C) significantly reduced their survival. These results indicate that euryhaline wanderers have a narrowed adaptable temperature range in non-natal osmotic environments. The similar trend observed in these two species of freshwater and marine fishes suggests that this may be a general characteristic in euryhaline wanderers and could be one of the causes of their seasonal movements.

AB  - Lizards may experience population declines and extinctions on a similar scale to that experienced by amphibians, and climate warming is one hypothesis proposed to explain these declines and extinctions. Within lizards, viviparous species are hypothesized to be more vulnerable to climate warming, because they have evolved reduced body temperature and heat tolerance, but this idea remains untested. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three temperatures (20, 24, and 28 A degrees C) x two species [Phrynocephalus przewalskii (oviparous) and P. putjatia (viviparous)] factorial design experiment that simulated warming on oviparous versus viviparous lizards. Our manipulation of ambient temperature affected activity and thermal preference in both species, birth date in P. putjatia, and egg mass in P. przewalskii; other examined traits (fecundity, reproductive output, and size, morphology, and sprint speed of offspring) were not affected. Neither in P. putjatia nor in P. przewalskii behavioral responses to rising temperatures differ between the sexes. The viviparous species thermoregulated more actively than did the oviparous species, but the two species did not differ in thermal preference. Warming reduced the activity time allotted for thermoregulation in both species, but the effect was more dramatic in the viviparous species. Our data support one of the central predictions that lead to the hypothesis that viviparous lizards are more vulnerable to climate warming; however, this is not because viviparous lizards have evolved reduced body temperature and heat tolerance, but, because warming constrains activity more dramatically in viviparous species.

AB  - In order to overcome the increasing demand-supply energy gap due to the rapid urbanization, labor productivity, consumerism and depletion of fossil fuel resources, there is a need for the development of technologies with renewable energy sources. Phase change materials are one of the most appropriate materials for effective utilization of thermal energy from the renewable energy resources. As evident from the literature, development of phase change materials is one of the most active research fields for thermal energy storage with higher efficiency. This review focuses on the application of various phase change materials based on their thermophysical properties. In particular, the melting point, thermal energy storage density and thermal conductivity of the organic, inorganic and eutectic phase change materials are the major selection criteria for various thermal energy storage applications with a wider operating temperature range. The strategy adopted in improving the thermal energy storage characteristics of the phase change materials through encapsulation as well as nanomaterials additives, are discussed in detail. Specifically, the future research trends in the encapsulation and nanomaterials are also highlighted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ensuring fruit productivity and mitigation climate change under low consumption of fertilizer and irrigation can contribute to sustainable agriculture. The objective of this study was to determine whether higher fruit production and lower net global warming potential (Net-GWP) could be realized concomitantly by reducing the amount of fertilizer and water applied. The effect of water and fertilizer management on fruit yield, N2O and CH4 emissions variation was measured over a two-year period to gain insight into Net-GWP and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in wine grape vineyard (WGV) and table grape vineyard (TGV) in North China. Two fertilizer and water managements were set in each vineyard: optimized practice (OP) treatment and traditional practice (TP) treatment. The results showed that the OP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased grape fruit by 10.2 % and 10.7 % in WGV and TGV, respectively, in comparison with TP treatment. Besides, the fluxes N2O and CH4 showed significant seasonal variation and the maximum were occurred from April to September and the N2O emissions were strongly decreased in OP treatment. Compared with the TP treatment, the OP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the Net-GWP and GHGI by 13.2 % and 21.5 % in WGV, as well as decreased that by 21 % and 28.6 % in TGV. The process of manufacture and transport of N fertilizer, the N2O emission and the electricity generation for pumping irrigation were the three main contributors to vineyard Net-GWP. Thus we concluded that higher fruit production and lower Net-GWP could be realized concomitantly by reducing fertilizer and water application in WGV and TGV in North China.

AB  - There is an abundance of woody biomass in Japan. However, its economic feasibility is limited. There have been several discussions on whether generation of heat or electrical power is more suitable for woody biomass. In this study, we clarified the feasibility of generating heat and electricity from the viewpoint of biomass unit price and biomass productivity based on actual operation data for the first time. It was determined that heat production is feasible for a small-scale biomass energy use of 2,660 t/year or more. Electrical power generation is feasible only for a large-scale biomass energy use of 13,100 t/year or more, but it allows use of woody biomass with a higher unit price.

AB  - In coming age, new technologies for survivals of human beings on our earth are required. These technologies include for energy and natural resources conservation, waste disposal techniques, and reduction of global warming gases. To achieve this advanced functions of materials are essential. In this paper, new frontiers of microwave dielectrics are presented in relations with these energy issues.
   The microwave dielectrics are familiar with radio frequency wave. The low loss dielectric materials are resonated by microwaves in air and change it to electric current in circuit, and vice versa. It is well known that the microwave materials have three important characteristic properties such as high quality factor Q, dielectric constant er and temperature coefficient of resonant frequency TCf. These properties enable the following functions: (1) electromagnetic resonance, (2) electromagnetic-wave shortening, (3) electromagnetic-wave delay, (4) temperature variation of resonant frequency, (5) electromagnetic-wave absorption, and (6) other functions: such as transparency and refractive index. In this paper, for future excellent usages of these functions, some applications are presented showing the fundamental explanations. The content in this paper is planned for the publication in a handbook of advancements of functional ceramics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigate the effect of electrically induced thermal load on interconnect reliability and aging. We propose new models for uniform and non-uniform temperature evolution and its steady state distribution in interconnects considering Joule heating and heat convection. The models are verified by comparing the results against those of finite element experiments. We apply our models to study material migration induced aging and failures. We discuss how different non-uniform temperature profiles affect interconnect lifetime. We propose new formulas for accurate temperature aware assessment of the mortality of interconnects. We demonstrate that neglecting thermal effects in modern technologies may lead to incorrect conclusions about interconnect mortality. We also provide a method for modeling the true mean time to failure based on underlying physics.

AB  - One theory of the evolution of longevity says that improvement in life span is dependent on an increased ability to resist environmental stresses of all kind. Selective breeding of Drosophila melanogaster populations for longevity has demonstrably increased life span and also altered a number of other traits, such as resistance to starvation, desiccation, and ethanol fumes, and the ability to sustain longer flight. While the exact physiologic basis of some of these traits is not yet fully understood, at least some are known to derive from the properties of metabolic substrates of glycolysis. Improvement in those characters can depend partially, therefore, on altered stores of metabolites created from glycogen. Based on the known general relationship of some traits and the suspected basis in metabolism of others, we examine the possibility here that increased life span is accompanied by other traits that also confer physiologic resistance to stress. Specifically, we test the prediction that long-lived populations of fruit flies should be more resistant to low (prefreezing) and freezing temperature extremes. Both selected and control populations were found to be susceptible to prefreezing (1.5 degrees C) and freezing temperatures (0 degrees C) here, but adults and pupae of the long-lived populations generally survived better in both situations, and at all durations of exposure. The resistance of individuals improved with acclimatization, but was superior in the long-lived populations whether thermal decline was rapid or stepwise. Cold resistant, long-lived populations also had significantly higher in vitro levels of glycerol, a cryoprotectant metabolite produced from glycogen. However, while adults and pupae of long-lived stocks were more resistant to cold, larvae of those stocks were more sensitive and survived relatively poorly at every length of exposure and acclimation. This surprising result implies that larvae maintain lower levels of cryoprotectant substances. Upon becoming pupae, however, stage-specific capabilities for environmental resistance and long life emerge. This conclusion agrees with a prior study of these stocks indicating that the uptake and use of nutrients in developing larvae are restricted in long-lived populations.

AB  - Mountain lizards are highly vulnerable to climate change, and the continuous warming of their habitats could be seriously threatening their survival. We aim to compare the thermal ecology and microhabitat selection of a mountain lizard, Iberolacerta galani, and a widely distributed lizard, Podarcis bocagei, in a montane area. Both species are currently in close syntopy in the study area, at 1,400 m above the sea level. We determined the precision, accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation, and the thermal quality of habitat for both species. We also compared the selection of thermal microhabitats between both species. Results show that I. galani is a cold-adapted thermal specialist with a preferred temperature range of 27.929.7 degrees C, while P. bocagei would be a thermal generalist, with a broader and higher preferred temperature range (30.134.5 degrees C). In addition, I. galani selects rocky substrates while P. bocagei selects warmer soil and leaf litter substrates. The thermal quality of the habitat is higher for P. bocagei than for I. galani. Finally, P. bocagei achieves a significantly higher effectiveness of thermoregulation (0.87) than I. galani (0.80). Therefore, these mountain habitat conditions seem currently more suitable for performance of thermophilic generalist lizards than for cold-specialist lizards.

AB  - It is unclear whether transport by human vectors can increase the robustness of translocated populations and thereby enhance their invasiveness. To test this concept, we investigated the effect of heat stress on the tolerance of mussel populations towards a second stress event of the same kind. The heat challenges we mimicked can be faced by marine invertebrates that are transported through regions with high sea surface temperatures on ship hulls or in ballast water tanks. The study included 5 mussel species that were collected at sites in Brazil, Chile, Finland, Germany (Baltic Sea) and Portugal. In parallel laboratory experiments, monospecific groups of individuals were exposed to heat challenges that caused 60-83% mortality in the experimental groups within 15-28days. The surviving individuals were exposed to a second stress event of the same kind, while their survival was then compared to the robustness of conspecifics that had not been exposed to elevated temperatures before. We observed that thermal tolerance was significantly enhanced by previous heat stress experience in case of Semimytilus algosus from Chile and in case of Mytilus edulis from Germany. Our results suggest that heat challenges, which marine invertebrates experience during transport, can enhance stress tolerance in founder populations of these species in their non-native range by potentially increasing the frequency of genetically adapted genotypes. This points at the necessity to learn more about selection acting on organisms during human-mediated transportin the aquatic but also in the terrestrial environment.

AB  - Understanding how natural selection generates and maintains adaptive genetic diversity in heterogeneous environments is key to predicting the evolutionary response of populations to rapid environmental change. Detecting selection in complex spatial environments remains challenging, especially for threatened species where the effects of strong genetic drift may overwhelm signatures of selection. We carried out a basinwide riverscape genomic analysis in the threatened southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis), an ecological specialist with low dispersal potential. High-resolution environmental data and 5162 high-quality filtered SNPs were used to clarify spatial population structure and to assess footprints of selection associated with a steep hydroclimatic gradient and with human disturbance across the naturally and anthropogenically fragmented Murray-Darling Basin (Australia). Our approach included FST outlier tests to define neutral loci, and a combination of spatially explicit genotype-environment association analyses to identify candidate adaptive loci while controlling for the effects of landscape structure and shared population history. We found low levels of genetic diversity and strong neutral population structure consistent with expectations based on spatial stream hierarchy and life history. In contrast, variables related to precipitation and temperature appeared as the most important environmental surrogates for putatively adaptive genetic variation at both regional and local scales. Human disturbance also influenced the variation in candidate loci for adaptation, but only at a local scale. Our study contributes to understanding of adaptive evolution along naturally and anthropogenically fragmented ecosystems. It also offers a tangible example of the potential contributions of landscape genomics for informing in situ and ex situ conservation management of biodiversity.

AB  - This study assesses for the first time the relationship between annual cycles of different biological indices with growth patterns of a marine pejerrey Odontesthes argentinensis population near its southern-distribution boundary in North Patagonia. The reproductive period is between September and November evidenced by an increase in the gonado-somatic index with a peak in October corresponding to spawning. The reproductive cycle was also coupled with metabolic processes related to energy allocation as shown by changes in the hepato-somatic index and body condition. Total length (LT) at maturity was 270 for females and 282 mm for males, whereas fecundity was estimated at mean +/- s.d. = 9380 +/- 1797 mature oocytes. Based on the marginal increment analysis, most of the scales showed a maximum value during summer, with a sharp decline thereafter during autumn and winter, indicating that scale rings are formed during the latter period and only once a year. Growth fitted by the von Bertalanffy model for both males and females did not show significant differences and showed a rapid growth during the first 2 years. The shorter reproductive period compared with that of the northern O. argentinensis populations inhabiting tropical and subtropical areas was interpreted as an adjustment to temperate environmental conditions. The larger maximum LT and LT at first maturity are in agreement with the counter-gradient hypothesis and could be related to the selective effects of low temperature and a shorter growing season. This latitude dependency argues strongly against the application of the same fishing regulations for different O. argentinensis populations as a whole and reinforces the need to assess basic biological features at a population scale to promote local sustainable fisheries management.

AB  - Adaptation to sublethal stress can confer increased survival capability on foodborne pathogens. In this article, we report on the adaptive response of Cronobacter spp. to heat and compare the survival of heat adapted to unadapted Cronobacter spp. Five different isolates, representing at least three different Cronobacter spp., were adapted at 46 degrees C for 30 min and subjected to a lethal stress at 52 degrees C. All showed increased survival upon adaptation. Survival was greater in milk-grown cells, but broth-grown cells showed a higher degree of adaptation. The survival potential acquired following adaptation was not transferred to survival in a dry environment or to survival during reconstitution of artificially contaminated milk powder by conventional or microwave heat. The ratio of membrane unsaturated to saturated fatty acids decreased, possibly resulting in a more rigid membrane in adapted cells. Heat-adapted cells showed increased survival potential to lethal heat stress, but not to dry stress. Alterations in the ratio of fatty acids in the membrane may explain this adaptation.

AB  - Little is known about how quickly natural populations adapt to changes in their environment and how temporal and spatial variation in selection pressures interact to shape patterns of genetic diversity. We here address these issues with a series of genome scans in four overfished populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) studied over an 80-year period. Screening of >1000 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified 77 loci that showed highly elevated levels of differentiation, likely as an effect of directional selection, in either time, space or both. Exploratory analysis suggested that temporal allele frequency shifts at certain loci may correlate with local temperature variation and with life history changes suggested to be fisheries induced. Interestingly, however, largely nonoverlapping sets of loci were temporal outliers in the different populations and outliers from the 1928 to 1960 period showed almost complete stability during later decades. The contrasting microevolutionary trajectories among populations resulted in sequential shifts in spatial outliers, with no locus maintaining elevated spatial differentiation throughout the study period. Simulations of migration coupled with observations of temporally stable spatial structure at neutral loci suggest that population replacement or gene flow alone could not explain all the observed allele frequency variation. Thus, the genetic changes are likely to at least partly be driven by highly dynamic temporally and spatially varying selection. These findings have important implications for our understanding of local adaptation and evolutionary potential in high gene flow organisms and underscore the need to carefully consider all dimensions of biocomplexity for evolutionarily sustainable management.

AB  - Laboratory and field studies were conducted to determine whether all larval stages of Culicoides variipennis sonorensis Wirth and Jones were susceptible to parasitism by Heleidomermis magnapapula Poinar and Mullens. All four larval instars (L1-L4) were readily attacked in the laboratory, although parasites took significantly longer to enter older hosts (average of 119 s for L1 to 199 s for L4). Field studies indicated that free-living adult nematodes, and presumably the preparasitic (infective) stages, were distributed above the waterline, where early-stage host larvae (L1 and L2) were most common. Dissection of field-collected hosts over a full host generation showed maximum parasitism was lower in L4 (40%) than in L1 (71%), L2 (64%), and L3 (64%) hosts. Second stage parasites were found only in L1 and L2 hosts. Absence of second stage parasites in L3 and L4 hosts showed that older larvae were seldom attacked in nature. The mature parasites emerge primarily from L4 hosts. Collecting L4 hosts in the field can significantly underestimate parasitism due to emergence of H. magnapapula from L4 hosts prior to sampling or premature host mortality due to parasitism. Dissection of L3 hosts should result in the most accurate parasitism estimates, but these estimates still ignore some parasite-induced mortality in the early host stages. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - Despite the implementation of technical management measures to facilitate stock recovery of European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), the survival rate of discarded hook-and-line caught sea bass remains unknown. This makes the effectiveness of management measures that result in discarding difficult to assess. Therefore, a questionnaire was distributed to 421 UK-based commercial hook-and-line fishers (65 respondents) to characterise how sea bass are caught, handled and released. Responses suggested fishing was selective with a reported estimated mean discard rate of 12.9% (+/- 3.3% SE). Low rates of foul and deep hooking, and short periods of air exposure were reported. Combined with data from a post-release mortality experiment using hook-and-line caught captive sea bass, a fleet-wide discard survival rate of 89.3% (+/- 2.6% SE) was calculated for the UK commercial hook-and-line sea bass fishery. This survival rate suggests that technical management measures, for example minimum conservation reference sizes and catch limits, could be effective tools for managing the sea bass hook-and-line fishery.

AB  - Forecasting which species/ecosystems are most vulnerable to climate warming is essential to guide conservation strategies to minimize extinction. Tropical/mid-latitude species are predicted to be most at risk as they live close to their upper critical thermal limits (CTLs). However, these assessments assume that upper CTL estimates, such as CTmax, are accurate predictors of vulnerability and ignore the potential for evolution to ameliorate temperature increases. Here, we use experimental evolution to assess extinction risk and adaptation in tropical and widespread Drosophila species. We find tropical species succumb to extinction before widespread species. Male fertility thermal limits, which are much lower than CTmax, are better predictors of species' current distributions and extinction in the laboratory. We find little evidence of adaptive responses to warming in any species. These results suggest that species are living closer to their upper thermal limits than currently presumed and evolution/plasticity are unlikely to rescue populations from extinction. Trait-based approaches assume upper critical thermal limits (CTLs) are good predictors of climate change vulnerability. Here, the authors show that male fertility thermal limits, which are lower than CTLs, are better at predicting Drosophila extinction in the lab, suggesting species may be living close to their thermal limits.

AB  - In temperate climates, low ambient temperatures in late winter and in spring can result in cold stress conditions in brood areas of weakened honey bee colonies, leading to increased levels of developmental interruptions and death of the brood. Very little is known about the physiological and molecular mechanisms that regulate honey bee brood responses to acute cold-stress. Here, we hypothesized that central regulatory pathways mediated by insulin/insulin-like peptide signalling (IIS) and adipokinetic hormone (AKH) are linked to metabolic changes in cold-stressed honey bee brood. A. mellifera brood reared at suboptimal temperatures showed diminished growth rate and arrested development progress. Notably, cold-stressed brood rapidly recovers the growth in the first 24 h after returning at control rearing temperature, sustained by the induction of compensatory mechanisms. We determined fast changes in the expression of components of IIS and AKH pathways in cold-stressed brood supporting their participation in metabolic events, growth and stress responses. We also showed that metabolic rate keeps high in brood exposed to stress suggesting a role in energy supply for growth and cell repair. Additionally, transcript levels of the uncoupling protein MUP2 were elevated in cold-stressed brood, which could indicate that this protein acts in the heat generation through mitochondrial decoupling mechanisms and/or in the ROS attenuation. Physiological, metabolic and molecular mechanisms that shape the responses to cold-stress in honey bee brood are addressed and discussed.

AB  - The viability of starter cultures is essential for an adequate contribution to the fermentation process and end-product. Therefore, robustness during processing and storage is an important characteristic of starter culture strains. For instance, during spray drying cells are exposed to heat and oxidative stress, generally resulting in loss of viability. In this study, we exposed the industrially relevant but stress-sensitive Lactococcus lactis strain SK11 to two cycles of heat stress, with intermediate recovery and cultivation at moderate temperatures. After these two cycles of heat exposure, the abundance of robust derivatives was increased as compared with the original culture, which enabled isolation of heat-resistant subpopulations displaying up to 1,000-fold enhanced heat stress survival. Moreover, this heat-resistant subpopulation demonstrated an increased survival during spray drying. Derivatives from two independent lineages displayed different transcriptome changes as compared with the wild type strain, indicating that the increased robustness within these lineages was established by different adaptive strategies. Nevertheless, an overlap in differential gene expression in all five derivatives tested in both lineages included three genes in an operon involved in zinc transport. The link between zinc homeostasis and heat stress survival in L. lactis was experimentally established by culturing of the wild type strain SK11 in medium with various levels of zinc ions, which resulted in alterations in heat stress survival phenotypes. This study demonstrates that robust derivatives of a relatively sensitive L. lactis strain can be isolated by repeated exposure to heat stress. Moreover, this work demonstrates that transcriptome analysis of these robust derivatives can provide clues for improvement of the robustness of the original strain. This could boost the industrial application of strains with specific desirable traits but inadequate robustness characteristics.

AB  - In recent years, trochoidal milling has become greatly widespread since it provides high productivity and long tool life, especially when cutting difficult-to-machine materials. Numerous studies have dealt with the analytical description and the experimental investigation of the evolution of cutting force, temperature, tool wear, chatter stability, etc. However, most of these analyses are focusing on the conventional circular and cycloid-shape trajectories. Only a few studies address the potential of improving the efficiency by modifying the tool path shape, leaving significant reserves untapped. If the mathematical formulation of the trajectory cannot be described easily, then a sophisticated optimisation algorithm is needed to determine the appropriate tool path shape. To overcome these difficulties at trochoidal milling of straight slots, the present work proposes a new tool path generation algorithm that can maximize the average material removal rate (MRR) while controlling the tool load. In this approach, the tool path is modelled by a B-spline curve whose control points are optimised using a differential evolution algorithm. The developed tool path generation strategy was compared through simulations and experiments with two widely used solutions viz the traditional cycloid-shaped tool path and a modern approach used in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems. The results reveal that the developed method is able to control the tool load and the smoothness of the tool path, and most importantly, also exceeds the existing methods in terms of productivity.

AB  - Physiological responses to temperature reflect the evolutionary adaptations of organisms to their thermal environment and the capability of animals to tolerate thermal stress. Contrary to conventional metabolism theory, increasing environmental temperatures have been shown to reduce metabolic rate in rocky-eulittoral-fringe species inhabiting highly variable environments, possibly as a strategy for energy conservation. To study the physiological adaptations of an intertidal-subtidal species to the extreme and unpredictable heat stress of the intertidal zone, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression were quantified in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Using simulate natural temperatures, the relationship between temperature, physiological performance (oxygen consumption and heat shock proteins) and thermotolerance were assessed. Depression of oxygen consumption rate and upregulation of heat shock protein genes (hsps) occurred in sequence when ambient temperature was increased from 24 to 30 degrees C. Large-scale mortality of the sea cucumber occurred when temperatures rose beyond 30 degrees C, suggesting that the upregulation of heat shock proteins and mortality are closely related to the depression of aerobic metabolism, a phenomenon that is in line with the concept of oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT). The physiologically-related thermotolerance of this sea cucumber should be an adaptation to its local environment.

TI  - A coal-fired heat exchanger for an externally fired gas turbine
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA  - English
AB  - Significant improvements in efficiency for electricity generation from coal can be achieved by cycles that employ a high temperature, highly recuperative gas turbine topping cycle. The principal difficulty of employing a gas turbine in a coal-fired power generation system is the possible erosion and corrosion of the high-temperature rotating gas turbine components caused by the coal's inorganic and organically bound constituents (ash, sulfur, and alkali metals). One route to overcome this problem is the development of an externally fired gas turbine system employing a coal fired heat exchanger. The solution discussed in this paper is the design of a Radiatively Enhanced, Aerodynamically Cleaned Heat-Exchanger (REACH-Exchanger). The REACH-Exchanger is fired by radiative and convective heat transfer from a moderately clean fuel stream and radiative heat transfer from the same of a much larger uncleaned fuel stream, which supplies most of the heat. The approach is to utilize the best ceramic technology available for high-temperature parts of the REACH-Exchanger and to shield the high-temperature surfaces from interaction with coal minerals by employing clean combustion gases that sweep the tube surface exposed to the coal flame. This paper presents a combined experimental/computational study to assess the viability, of the REACH-Exchanger concept. Experimental results indicated that the REACH-Exchanger can be effectively fired using radiation from the coal flame. Both computation and experiments indicate that the ceramic heat exchanger can be aerodynamically protected by a tertiary stream with an acceptably low pow rate.

AB  - This paper describes a recent development of the Synthetic Eddy Method (SEM) proposed by Jarrin et al. (Int J Heat Fluid Flow 30(3):435-442, 2009) for generation of synthetic turbulence. The present scheme is designed to produce a divergence-free turbulence field that can reproduce almost all possible states of Reynolds stress anisotropy. This improved representation, when used to provide inlet conditions for an LES, leads to reduced near-inlet pressure fluctuations in the LES and to a reduced development length, both of which lead to lower computer resource requirements. An advantage of this method with respect to forcing approaches (which require an iterative approach) is the suitability for direct usage with embedded LES. Results for a turbulent channel flow are reported here and compared to those from the original SEM, and other direct approaches such as the VORTEX method of Sergent (2002) and the Synthesized Turbulence approach of Davidson and Billson (Int J Heat Fluid Flow 27(6):1028-1042, 2006), showing overall improved performance and a more accurate representation of turbulence structures immediately downstream of the inlet.

AB  - Common obstacles for establishment of newly-introduced biological control agents include climate and the activity of native antagonists. In temperate climates, these obstacles can disproportionately affect overwintering life-stages because they are exposed to low winter temperatures, and may rely on passive defence from predators. We conducted a series of field exposure experiments with predator-exclusion treatments, in Ontario, Canada, to identify mortality factors for the pupae of Hypena opulenta, a biological control agent for invasive swallow-worts in North America. During two winters, predation rates in containers with large holes, that enabled predation, were relatively low (mean: 23.75%) but non-predation mortality in closed containers was high (mean: 66.25%), particularly during the colder of the two winters (87.5% vs. 52.5%). During the summer, non-predation mortality in closed containers was low (mean: 7.5%) but predation rates in containers with large holes were higher than during the winter (mean: 53.33%), increasing as the summer progressed. Predation in containers with large holes was 70% during late summer, compared with 25% during the spring. Across all seasons, pupal predation was dominated by large non-arthropod predators. Hypena opulenta can complete 2 generations per year. Photoperiods that induce diapause occur earlier in the introduced range than in the native range, however, and H. opulenta individuals in parts of the introduced range are likely to enter diapause early after a single generation. Our results highlight additional vulnerabilities encountered by such individuals, and can contribute to models predicting population dynamics of H. opulenta across its introduced range.

AB  - Accurate forecasting of a building thermal performance can help to optimize its energy consumption. In addition, obtaining the Heat Loss Coefficient (HLC) allows characterizing the thermal envelope of the building under conditions of use. The aim of this work is to study the thermal inertia of a building developing a new methodology based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This approach was applied to the Rectorate building of the University of Basque Country (UPV/EHU), located in the north of Spain. A comparison of different time-lags selected to catch the thermal inertia has been carried out using the CV(RMSE) and the MBE errors, as advised by ASHRAE. The main contribution of this work lies in the analysis of thermal inertia detection and its influence on the thermal behavior of the building, obtaining a model capable of predicting the thermal demand with an error between 12 and 21%. Moreover, the viability of LSTM neural networks to estimate the HLC of an in-use building with an error below 4% was demonstrated.

AB  - Temperature differentially influences developmental trajectories of traits during early life stages that can affect survival and recruitment. Experiments were conducted to quantify temperature-induced developmental responses of White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) yolk-sac larvae (YSL) reared at temperatures encountered across the species' range (12.5, 14.0, 15.5, and 17.0 degrees C). We quantified effects of temperature on timing of transitions between sequential developmental stages from hatch to initiation of exogenous feeding. Rate of development significantly increased at warmer compared to cooler temperatures; no significant difference was observed between 15.5 and 17.0 degrees C or 12.5 and 14.0 degrees C. When standardized by relative timing of development (RTi), developmental rate was not significantly different among treatments. Morphological traits (total length; body area; yolk-sac area; head area; gill filament area; mouth area; pectoral fin area) were measured daily, though only data for YSL reared at 12.5 and 17.0 degrees C was used to quantify phenotypic variation. Morphological traits (excluding yolk-sac area) were generally larger 48+ hours post hatch for YSL reared at 17. 0 degrees C compared to 12.5 degrees C. In contrast, these same traits, with the exception of gill filament area, were larger in 12.5 degrees C reared YSL when considered as a function of developmental stage. These opposing results suggest trade-offs associated with allocating resources to a particular trait depended on rearing temperature. Our results provide the ability to estimate timing of critical early life stages (i.e., hatch, emergence) as a function of temperature which is an important management tool to understand how early life development contributes to recruitment processes and adaptability in thermally altered systems.

AB  - Social Group Optimization (SGO), developed by Satapathy et al. in the year 2016, is a class of metaheuristic optimization inspired by social behavior. It has two phases: improving phase and acquiring phase. In the improving phase, each individual improves its knowledge by interacting with the best person/solution and in acquiring phase, the individuals interact with randomly selected individuals and the best person simultaneously to acquire knowledge. Modified Social Group Optimization (MSGO) is the improved version of SGO, where the acquiring phase is modified. A self-awareness probability factor is added in the acquiring phase, which enhances the learning capability of an individual from the best-learned person in the societal setup. It is observed that this modification has improved both exploration and exploitation abilities in comparison with the conventional SGO. To analyze the performance of the MSGO, an exhaustive performance comparison is made with GA, PSO, DE, ABC, and a few newer algorithms of the years 2010-2019. The results are tabulated in six experiments. Later, MSGO is applied to solve the short-term hydrothermal scheduling (HTS) problem. The central objective of the HTS problem is to ascertain the optimal plan of action for hydro and thermal generation minimizing the fuel cost of thermal plants and, at the same time satisfying various operational and physical constraints. The valve point loading effect related to the thermal power plants, transmission loss, and other constraints lead HTS as a complex non-linear, non-convex, and non-smooth optimization problem. Simulation results clearly show that the MSGO method is capable of obtaining a better solution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Under strong pathogen pressure, insects often evolve resistance to infection. Many insects are also protected via immune memory (immune priming), whereby sublethal exposure to a pathogen enhances survival after secondary infection. Theory predicts that immune memory should evolve when the pathogen is highly virulent, or when pathogen exposure is relatively rare. However, there are no empirical tests of these hypotheses, and the adaptive benefits of immune memory relative to direct resistance against a pathogen are poorly understood. To determine the selective pressures and ecological conditions that shape immune evolution, we imposed strong pathogen selection on flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) populations, infecting them with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for 11 generations. Populations injected first with heat-killed and then live Bt evolved high basal resistance against multiple Bt strains. By contrast, populations injected only with a high dose of live Bt evolved a less effective but strain-specific priming response. Control populations injected with heat-killed Bt did not evolve priming; and in the ancestor, priming was effective only against a low Bt dose. Intriguingly, one replicate population first evolved priming and subsequently evolved basal resistance, suggesting the potential for dynamic evolution of different immune strategies. Our work is the first report showing that pathogens can select for rapid modulation of insect priming ability, allowing hosts to evolve divergent immune strategies (generalized resistance versus specific immune memory) with potentially distinct mechanisms.

AB  - Interspecific hybrids between eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) and Himalayan blue pine (P. wallichiana A.B. Jacks.) were created in Ontario, Canada, to introduce blister rust (caused by Cronartium ribicola Fisch.) resistance genes to the former. In this paper, we report the survival, growth, and wood specific gravity of these interspecific hybrids from field trials established between the 1970s and 1990s. Results indicate that while P. wallichiana generally performed poorly due to insufficient cold hardiness, progressive improvement in survival and growth was evident for the first generation hybrids (F-1) and backcrosses (B-1) to P. strobus, with a trend of better performance with increasing parentage of P. strobus. In southern Ontario, where climatic conditions were relatively mild, some interspecific hybrids outperformed P. strobus in 20- to 40-year-old trials. In northern Ontario, insufficient cold hardiness seemed to limit the survival and growth of the interspecific hybrids. Measured wood specific gravity was highest for P. wallichiana and lowest for P. strobus, with that of the interspecific hybrids being intermediate. Implications of the field trial results to breeding for increasing blister rust resistance of eastern white pine are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The industrial application of microorganisms as starters or probiotics requires their preservation to assure viability and metabolic activity. Freezing is routinely used for this purpose, but the cold damage caused by ice crystal formation may result in severe decrease in microbial activity. In this study, adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) technique was applied to a lactic acid bacterium to select tolerant strains against freezing and thawing stresses. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was subjected to freeze-thaw-growth (FTG) for 150 cycles with four replicates. After 150 cycles, FTG-evolved mutants showed improved fitness (survival rates), faster growth rate, and shortened lag phase than those of the ancestor. Genome sequencing analysis of two evolved mutants showed genetic variants at distant loci in six genes and one intergenic space. Loss-of-function mutations were thought to alter the structure of the microbial cell membrane (one insertion in c/s), peptidoglycan (two missense mutations in dacA and murQ), and capsular polysaccharides (one missense mutation in wze), resulting in an increase in cellular fluidity. Consequently, L. rhamnosus GG was successfully evolved into stress-tolerant mutants using FTG-ALE in a concerted mode at distal loci of DNA. This study reports for the first time the functioning of dacA and murQ in freeze-thaw sensitivity of cells and demonstrates that simple treatment of ALE designed appropriately can lead to an intelligent genetic changes at multiple target genes in the host microbial cell.

AB  - In the present study, we observed that Leptinaria unilamellata responds to changes in microclimatic conditions through shifts in shell morphology. Over three laboratory generations, shell differences between two populations, representing distinct morphotypes, became less evident. Only F1 generations from both populations showed shell morphometry very similar to the field parental snails, suggesting maternal effect. Snails from the locality with higher values of rainfall, relative humidity and evaporation index and smaller values of temperature and insolation produced more and larger hatchlings. Snails from the locality with less favorable climatic conditions presented shells traits that offer protection against desiccation, but reduce reproductive success. These snails showed smaller offspring production and faster response to a desiccation regime, through changes in conchiometrics. In addition, the results of the present study suggest that the spire index plays a less important role in determining protective properties of the shell of L. unilamellata, in response to desiccation risk, compared to aperture dimension. As shell aperture dimension is an important trait related to resistance to desiccation, and at the same time to reproduction, plastic responses to environmental conditions promoting the balance between survival and reproductive success are critical for the species adaptive success.

AB  - An understanding of the process of local adaptation would allow managers to better protect and conserve species. Many salmonids are in need of such efforts, and because they often persist in differing, isolated environments, they are useful organisms for studying local adaptation. In addition, the temperature sensitivity of salmonids provides a likely target for natural selection. We studied thermal adaptation in four wild populations and one hatchery stock of westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi. The mean summer temperatures of source streams ranged from 6.7 degrees C to 11.2 degrees C. Embryos were collected from the wild, and embryonic development, embryonic survival, and juvenile growth were determined. A significant relationship between median embryonic survival and source stream temperature was detected. Based on a rank test, populations from colder streams had a greater decline in median embryonic survival at warm temperatures than populations from warmer streams. Embryonic development and juvenile growth did not appear to be influenced by source. These findings suggest that populations are thermally adapted to their source streams and this should be considered by managers. However, further study is necessary to sort out the potential confounding factors, whether genetic or epigenetic.

AB  - The design flexibility of FOWLP plays a crucial role in meeting the rising demand for higher performance advanced semiconductor packages at lower cost. From a manufacturing standpoint, the requirements are not only for increased wafer throughput and tighter defects density specification, but also for low resistance interconnects. Keeping Rc low can be particularly challenging in UBM/RDL processes since the widely used organic passivation films and polymer-based substrates are inherently incompatible with plasma processes.
   This work presents the experimental characterization of Rc values achieved with two state-of-the-art multi-chambers PVD platforms used for volume manufacturing in WLP, namely Cluster-type and Indexer-type systems. In particular, the study highlights how the Indexer platform, which reaches 40% higher productivity due to faster chamber-to-chamber wafer transfer, also shows 50% lower Rc baseline. The Rc values measured on single-contact Kelvin resistors are: 1.2 mOhm for the Cluster with a corresponding throughput of 31.5 wafers/hour and 0.6 mOhm for the Indexer system running the same process flow with a throughput of 51 wafers/hour. The impact of hardware configuration and process control on Rc baseline is discussed. In addition, Rc of 0.3 mOhm was measured on Kelvin resistors manufactured in molded wafers with PBO passivation and processed on the FOWLP Indexer with throughput of 45 wafers/hour. The peak wafer temperature during the whole process did not exceed 120 degrees C. Similar Rc performance was measured on test vehicles with Al-Ti-Cu and Cu-Ti-Cu interfaces. TEM and EDX analysis of the contact interfaces excluded the presence of metal oxide or other contamination films.

AB  - Labour exposure to heat stress driven by climate change will increase significantly with the rising global temperatures. Under heat stress, workers have to reduce work intensity and take longer breaks from work to prevent occupational illness and injuries. This study explores how the global warming and the resulting increase in heat stress can directly affect productivity of workers and indirectly impact upon the broader economy. Occupational statistics for 269 European regions are combined with daily heat stress indicator derived from a set of high-resolution climate scenarios. The novel approach, enabled by using a set of published exposure-response functions, assesses workers productivity losses differentiated by occupations. A macro econometric model of the European economy is then used to asses implications of change in productivity in monetary terms. The study finds that, compared to nowadays, productivity of labour can be 1.6% lower in Europe in 2080s, with a clear geographical gradient showing that southern and eastern regions are much more affected (e.g. up to 5.4% productivity loss in Greece). Furthermore, regions where the dominant occupations have relative lower earnings would also experience higher productivity loses. The analysis also focuses on the potential role of adaptation to reduce the productivity and economic losses, via air conditioning and a preliminary assessment of the potential of wearable robotics, which can reduce damages by 30%-40%.

AB  - Gene interactions, or epistasis, play a large role in determining evolutionary outcomes. The ruggedness of fitness landscapes, and thus the predictability of evolution and the accessibility of high-fitness genotypes, is determined largely by the pervasiveness of epistasis and the degree of correlation between similar genotypes. We created all possible pairings of three sets of five beneficial first-step mutations fixed during adaptive walks under three different regimes: selection on growth rate alone, on growth rate and thermal stability, and on growth rate and pH stability. All 30 double-mutants displayed negative, antagonistic epistasis with regard to growth rate and fitness, but positive epistasis and additivity were common for the stability phenotypes. This suggested that biophysically simple phenotypes, such as capsid stability, may on average behave more additively than complex phenotypes like viral growth rate. Growth rate epistasis was also smaller in magnitude when the individual effects of single mutations were smaller. Significant sign epistasis, such that the effect of a mutation that is beneficial in the wild-type background is deleterious in combination with a second mutation, emerged more frequently in intragenic mutational pairings than in intergenic pairs, and was evident in nearly half of the double-mutants, indicating that the fitness landscape is moderately uncorrelated and of intermediate ruggedness. Together, our results indicated that mutations may interact additively with regard to phenotype when considered at a basic, biophysical level, but that epistasis arises as a result of pleiotropic interactions between the individual components of complex phenotypes and diminishing returns arising from intermediate phenotypic optima.

AB  - Altered thermal regimes under climate change may influence host-parasite interactions and invasive species, both potentially impacting valuable ecosystem services. There is considerable interest in how parasite life cycle rates, growth, and impacts on hosts will change under altered environmental temperatures. Likewise, transformed thermal regimes may reduce natural resistance and barriers preventing establishment of invasive species or alter the range and impacts of established exotic species. The Laurentian Great Lakes are some of the most invaded ecosystems and have been profoundly shaped by exotic species. Invasion by the parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) contributed to major declines in many Great Lakes fish populations. In Lake Superior, substantial progress has been made towards controlling invasive sea lamprey and rehabilitating native fish populations. Surface water temperatures in Lake Superior have been increasing rapidly since 1980 presenting a new challenge for management. Here we test how thermal changes in Lake Superior have impacted the feeding and growth of the parasitic sea lamprey. Sea lamprey have increased in size corresponding with longer durations of thermal habitat (i.e., longer growing seasons) for their preferred hosts. To compare regional differences in sea lamprey feeding and growth rates, we used a bioenergetics model with temperature estimates from a lake-wide hydrodynamic model hindcast from 1979-2006. Spatial differences in patterns of warming across the lake result in regionally different predictions for increases in sea lamprey feeding rates and size. These predictions were matched by data from adult sea lamprey spawning in streams draining into these different thermal regions. Larger sea lampreys will be more fecund and have increased feeding rates, thus increasing mortality among host fishes. Resource management should consider these climate driven regional impacts when allocating resources to sea lamprey control efforts. Under new and evolving thermal regimes, successful management systems may need to be restructured for changing phenology, growth, and shifts in host-parasite systems towards greater impacts on host populations.

AB  - The Dictyostelium genome contains a single rapA gene, which encodes a Rap1 monomeric G protein. As attempts at generating rapA-null Dictyostelium cells had been unsuccessful, expression of antisense RNA from the rapA gene under control of the folate repressible discoidin promoter was used to reduce cellular levels of the Rapt protein. As Rap1 levels gradually decreased following antisense rapA RNA induction, growth rate and cell viability also decreased, a result consistent with the idea that rapA is an essential gene.
   The Rap1-depleted cells exhibited reduced viability in response to osmotic shock. The accumulation of cGMP in response to 0.4 M sorbitol was reduced after rapA antisense RNA induction and was enhanced in cells expressing the constitutively activated Rap1(G12V) protein, suggesting a role for Rap1 in the generation of cGMP. Dictyostelium Rap1 formed a complex with the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS only when it was in a GTP-bound state. This assay was used to demonstrate that activation of Rap1 in response to 0.4 M sorbitol occurred with initial kinetics similar to those observed for the accumulation of cGMP. Furthermore, the addition of 2 mM EDTA to osmotically shocked cells, a treatment that enhances cGMP accumulation, also enhanced Rap1 activation. These results suggest a direct role for Rap1 in the activation of guanylyl cyclase during the response to hyperosmotic conditions. Rap1 was also activated in response to low temperature but not in response to low osmolarity or high temperature.

AB  - The solution heat treatment, forming and cold die quenching (HFQ) process has been developed and adopted for forming high strength complex-shaped components of light alloys in the automotive industry. In order to exploit and increase the competitiveness of this technology, production cycle time and manufacturing costs need to be reduced to enable high productivity and energy efficiency. This can be realised by reducing the cycle time for heating a metallic sheet to its solution heat treatment temperature during the HFQ process, and by decreasing post ageing time. Rapid heating methods are capable of providing a solution to be integrated into this novel forming technique of HFQ. This paper presents feasibility study on the adoption of the direct flame impingement (DFI) heating method that has a high potential for non-ferrous blanks to achieve higher heating rate in HFQ processes, compared to convection heating in a conventional furnace. The adaptability of DFI heating for HFQ process has been validated, in terms of capability of high heating rate, quality of surface layer examination and lap-shear strength measurement of bonded samples.

AB  - Steel coils in cold rolling mill of an integrated steel plant are annealed to remove the mechanical distortions ensued by hot and cold rolling. It is an extremely crucial process upon which the final quality of product depends. In annealing process coils are heated following a pre-defined thermal regime and then cooled slowly. Thermal regime or heating cycle basically depends on coil dimensions and steel grade. However in practical there are no well established co-relations are available, which can determine the thermal regime to be followed for a given set of coil parameters. Such indeterminate applications are the fittest areas, where the theoretical concepts of Artificial Intelligence or expert system in particular can be applied in real time process control. A close loop expert system guided heating control system has been developed for Annealing Furnaces of Line # 1 at Bokaro Steel Plant. The integrated automation is based on the concepts of hierarchical control, wherein a Level-II rule based expert system selects most appropriate thermal regime for a given set of steel coils and Level-I PAC controls and supervises the furnace heating operation as per the guidelines of expert system. The application has rendered significant improvement in plants performance in terms of productivity, quality and energy savings.

AB  - Gill Na+-K+-ATPase activities, haematocrit, and plasma osmolarity, cortisol, chloride and sodium concentrations were monitored over a 1-year period in freshwater stocks of salmon and in 24-h-seawater-challenged salmon.  Salmon (0+ to 1 year old) failed to adapt to seawater from December to March (austral summer) when seawater temperatures were higher than 16-degrees-C.  In freshwater-sampled salmon, smoltification coincided with high gill Na+-K+-ATPase activities and plasma cortisol levels (> 35 ng/ml) and low plasma chloride levels (< 120 mmol/l).  Seawater survival was highly correlated with the 24-h-seawater-challenge samples of plasma cortisol and ionic levels which provide the best indicators for successful seawater adaptation.

AB  - Although Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacteria] diarrhoeal disease in humans worldwide, its potential to adapt to the stressful conditions and survive in extra-intestinal environment is still poorly understood. We tested the effect of heat shock (55 degrees C, 3 min) and oxidative stress (3 mM H2O2 for 10 min or prolonged incubation at atmosphere oxygen concentration) on non-starved and starved cells of Campylobacter jejuni from different growth phases. Viability as assessed with the Bacteria] Viability Kit LIVE/DEAD (R) BacLight (TM) dying before fluorescent microscopy and culturability of the cells (CFU ml(-1)) from both growth phases showed that starvation increased heat but not oxidative resistance. High temperature and oxidative stress invoked quick transformation from culturable spiral shaped to nonculturable spiral and coccoid cells. Despite physiological changes of the cells we were not able to document clear differences in the expression of heat shock and starvation genes (dnaK, htpG, groEL), oxidative (ahpC, sodB), virulence (flaA) and housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, rpoD) after heat treatment (55 degrees C, 3 min) or oxidative stresses applied. When starving, no induction of expression of any of these genes was noticed, chloramphenicol had no influence on their gene expression. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that at least 10-20 min of heat shock was necessary to evidently increase the amount of groEL and rpoD transcripts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We have been developing an electron beam recorder for next-generation optical disk mastering. Using a ZEP-520 resist that had high resolution, we fabricated read-only memory disks and obtained sufficient reproduction performance. But the recording velocity was 0.7 m/s to obtain sufficient jitter of the disk. We could not expect such low recording velocity to be used in mass production. Therefore we decided to use a chemically amplified resist, which had high sensitivity. To reduce the recording time, we adopted the resist to the optical disk mastering and investigated the process conditions. We examined the effect of development power and post-exposure banking (PEB) temperature on the jitter of the reproduced signals and obtained 6.4% jitter at a 2.5 m/s recording velocity.

AB  - 1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability.
   2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature.
   3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change.
   4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution.
   5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.

AB  - The present study aimed to test the effect of three stocking densities: 100, 200, and 300 ind m(-3) (D100, D200, and D300, respectively) on survival, growth (weight and total length), and condition factor of Microphis brachyurus. At the end of the six-week trial, there were no significant differences in the fish's survival, growth, and condition. The results suggest that this species presents high adaptability under culture conditions. A suboptimal stocking density generates a suboptimal use of infrastructure and decreases the production system's profitability. Based on the present study, a stocking density of 300 ind m(-3) is recommended to increase the aquaculture infrastructure's profitability for ornamental or conservation purposes.

AB  - The Bemisia tabaci Mediterranean (MED) cryptic species has been rapidly invading most parts of the world owing to its strong ecological adaptability, particularly its strong resistance to temperature stress. Epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in mediating ecological plasticity. In particular, DNA methylation has been the focus of attempts to understand the mechanism of phenotypic plasticity. The relationship between temperature and DNA methylation and how it affects the adaptability of invasive insects remain unknown. To investigate the temperature resistance role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) in MED, we cloned and sequenced BtDnmt1 homology and identified its functions under various temperature conditions. The full-length cDNA of MED BtDnmt1 homology was 5,958 bp and has a 4,287 bp open reading frame that encodes a 1,428-amino-acid protein. BtDnmt1 mRNA expression levels were significantly down-regulated after feeding with dsRNA. Furthermore, after feeding with dsBtDnmt1, the MED adults exhibited significantly higher mortality under temperature stress conditions than the controls, suggesting that MED BtDnmt1 homology plays an essential role in the temperature tolerance capacity of MED. Our data improve our understanding of the temperature resistance and temperature adaptability mechanisms that have allowed the successful invasion and colonization of various environments by this alien species.

AB  - Predicting how climate warming affects vector borne diseases is a key research priority. The prevailing approach uses the basic reproductive number (R-0) to predict warming effects. However, R-0 is derived under assumptions of stationary thermal environments; using it to predict disease spread in non-stationary environments could lead to erroneous predictions. Here, we develop a trait-based mathematical model that can predict disease spread and prevalence for any vector borne disease under any type of non-stationary environment. We parameterize the model with trait response data for the Malaria vector and pathogen to test the latest IPCC predictions on warmer-than-average winters and hotter-than-average summers. We report three key findings. First, the R-0 formulation commonly used to investigate warming effects on disease spread violates the assumptions underlying its derivation as the dominant eigenvalue of a linearized host-vector model. As a result, it overestimates disease spread in cooler environments and underestimates it in warmer environments, proving its predictions to be unreliable even in a constant thermal environment. Second, hotter-than-average summers both narrow the thermal limits for disease prevalence, and reduce prevalence within those limits, to a much greater degree than warmer-than-average winters, highlighting the importance of hot extremes in driving disease burden. Third, while warming reduces infected vector populations through the compounding effects of adult mortality, and infected host populations through the interactive effects of mortality and transmission, uninfected vector populations prove surprisingly robust to warming. This suggests that ecological predictions of warming-induced reductions in disease burden should be tempered by the evolutionary possibility of vector adaptation to both cooler and warmer climates.

AB  - The common cutworm, Spodoptera litura, has become a major pest of soybean (Glycine max) throughout its Indian range. With a changing climate, there is the potential for this insect to become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions due to increased habitat suitability. To examine this possibility, we developed temperature-based phenology model for S. litura, by constructing thermal reaction norms for cohorts of single life stages, at both constant and fluctuating temperatures within the ecologically relevant range (15-38 degrees C) for its development. Life table parameters were estimated stochastically using cohort updating and rate summation approach. The model was implemented in the geographic information system to examine the potential future pest status of S. litura using temperature change projections from SRES A(1)B climate change scenario for the year 2050. The changes were visualized by means of three spatial indices demonstrating the risks for establishment, number of generations per year and pest abundance according to the temperature conditions. The results revealed that the development rate as a function of temperature increased linearly for all the immature stages of S. litura until approximately 34-36 degrees C, after which it became non-linear. The extreme temperature of 38 degrees C was found lethal to larval and pupal stages of S. litura wherein no development to the next stage occurred. Females could lay no eggs at the extreme low (15 degrees C) and high (>35 degrees C) test temperatures, demonstrating the importance of optimum temperature in determining the suitability of climate for the mating and reproduction in S. litura. The risk mapping predicts that due to temperature increase under future climate change, much of the soybean areas in Indian states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, will become suitable for S. litura establishment and increased pest activity, indicating the expansion of the suitable and favourable areas over time. This has serious implication in terms of soybean production since these areas produce approximately 95% of the total soybeans in India. As the present model results are based on temperature only, and the effects of other abiotic and biotic factors determining the pest population dynamics were excluded, it presents only the potential population growth parameters for S. litura. However, if combined with the field observations, the model results could certainly contribute to gaining insight into the field dynamics of S. litura.

AB  - Temperature and pH are known to vary in a wound site due to the immune response and subsequent healing processes. This study used a multifactorial design to examine the cellular responses of Staphylococcus aureus to hydrogen peroxide (0-100 mM) when bacteria were grown in temperatures of 37 +/- 2 degrees C and pH 7 +/- 1, conditions potentially encountered in wound sites. A centroid sample was included in the design which represented the mid-point values of all three environmental parameters (37 degrees C, pH 7, 50 mM H2O2). Cytoplasmic extracts and corresponding medium supernatants were analysed for amino acid composition by gas chromatography. Exposures of S. aureus to H2O2 during the inoculation process resulted in extended lag phases lasting well after the peroxide had been neutralised by the bacterium's antioxidant systems, after which the bacteria eventually resumed growth at equivalent rates to the controls. Even though the subsequent growth rates appeared normal, the cells exhibited a variant metabolic regime at the mid-exponential phase of growth as a result of the initial exposure to peroxide. The alterations in metabolism were reflected by the differential amino acid profiles measured in the cytoplasmic extracts (P < 0.0001). The data indicated that the metabolic responses to H2O2 challenge were uniquely different depending on the variations of temperature and pH. The uptake patterns of amino acids from the media also altered depending on prevailing environmental conditions. From these results, it was proposed that a specific reproducible homeostasis could be induced under a specific set of defined environmental conditions. It was also evident that early toxic insults on the bacterial culture could have lasting impacts on cellular homeostasis after successive generations, even after the offending chemical had been removed and initial cell integrity restored. It was concluded that metabolic homeostasis would be continually adjusting and responding to changing environmental conditions to deploy defensive proteins as well as optimising processes for survival. The powerful ability to continually and rapidly adapt to the environment may represent the key feature supporting the virulence of S. aureus as an opportunistic pathogen invading the wound site.

AB  - A 2D G-S pseudo-homogeneous steady-state plug flow, non-isobaric and non-isothermal model is used to investigate the effects of operating conditions and catalyst thermal properties on the behaviour of a multi-tubular fixed bed for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. This simulator allows observing, quantifying and discussing the influences of the gas velocity, the tube diameter, the type of catalyst used (monolithic foam or extrudates) and the heat conductivity of the support (alumina or silicon carbide). The observed responses are the effective thermal parameters of the catalytic bed, the radial and axial temperature profiles and the global performances of the reactor (yield, productivity and selectivity). Thermal properties of the support exhibit a strong influence when low fluid velocities and/or large tube diameters are employed. Because of the high void fraction of a foam structure these effects are less pronounced than with packed beds. This structural difference allows a wider range of operating conditions in terms of fluid velocity and tube diameter but underlines the necessity to tune the void fraction of a foam bed to obtain the best compromise between its volumetric catalytic activity and a good thermal behaviour.

AB  - Global climate change is of particular concern for small and isolated populations of reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination because low genetic variation can limit adaptive response in pivotal temperatures, leading to skewed sex ratios. We explore the demographic consequences of skewed sex ratios on the viability of a tuatara population characterized by low genetic diversity. We studied the rare species of tuatara (Sphenodon guntheri) on the 4 ha North Brother Island in New Zealand over two nesting seasons and captured 477 individuals, with a 60% male bias in the adult population. Females first breed at 15 years and have extremely low rates of gravidity, producing clutches of three to eight eggs every 9 years. Simulations of the population using population viability analysis showed that the current population is expected to persist for at least 2000 years at hatchling sex ratios of up to 75% male, but populations with 85% male hatchlings are expected to become extinct within approximately 300 years (some eight generations). Incorporation of inbreeding depression increased the probability of extinction under male biased sex ratios, with no simulated populations surviving at hatchling sex ratios >75% male. Because recent models have predicted that climate change could lead to the production of all male S. guntheri hatchlings by 2085, we examined whether periodic intervention to produce mixed or female biased sex ratios would allow the population to survive if only males were produced in natural nests. We show that intervention every 2-3 years could buffer the effects of climate change on population sex ratios, but translocation to cooler environs might be more cost-effective. Climate change threatens tuatara populations because neither modified nesting behaviour nor adaptive response of the pivotal temperature can modify hatchling sex ratios fast enough in species with long generation intervals.

AB  - Adults Exochomus quadrzpustulatus L. were utilized to determine the effect of various environmental factors (mainly temperature) on the longevity, adaptability (hysteresis) and diapause termination either under controlled laboratory conditions or field insectary conditions. Newly eclosed male and female adults E. quadripustulatus from previously field collected pupae were studied for the lifespan of adults under different constant temperatures (15 and 20 degrees C) and naturally fluctuating (ambient) temperatures using starved (no food), liquid diets (water, and 10% honey solution) and natural prey (mussel scale Lepidosaphes ulmi L.) on apple. Access to distilled water compared to starvation did not increase the longevity of adult but significantly prolonged the life span when honey solution was provided. Longevity in constant conditions and ambient depended on both temperature and food. Coccinellid E. quadripustulatus survived longer time (>= 10 months) under field conditions on natural prey L. ulmi than under constant temperature (<= 4 months). Prey L. ulmi was the best food for survival than 10% honey solution. The degree of adaptability (hysteresis) of adult E. quadripustulatus at alternating temperature regimes (ascending and descending) showed significant differences in feeding at decreasing temperature than increasing ones. The results indicate that, in natural conditions, the adult beetles may be well adapted if they are introduced to different climatic regions where it has not yet been tested. Still more detailed information is to be investigated to prove this hypothesis. Results on diapause termination of female adult E. quadripustulatus showed that temperature did not effect diapause termination under the present experimental conditions. This may be because this species is of univoltine strain in the north-east England.

AB  - We evaluated a ground-based handheld thermal imaging system for measuring water temperatures using data from eight southwestern USA streams and rivers. We found handheld thermal imagers could provide considerably more spatial information on water temperature (for our unit one image D 19,600 individual temperature measurements) than traditional methods could supply without a prohibitive amount of effort. Furthermore, they could provide measurements of stream surface temperature almost instantaneously compared with most traditional handheld thermometers (e.g., >20 s/reading). Spatial temperature analysis is important for measurement of subtle temperature differences across waterways, and identification of warm and cold groundwater inputs. Handheld thermal imaging is less expensive and equipment intensive than airborne thermal imaging methods and is useful under riparian canopies. Disadvantages of handheld thermal imagers include their current higher expense than thermometers, their susceptibility to interference when used incorrectly, and their slightly lower accuracy than traditional temperature measurement methods. Thermal imagers can only measure surface temperature, but this usually corresponds to subsurface temperatures in well-mixed streams and rivers. Using thermal imaging in select applications, such as where spatial investigations of water temperature are needed, or in conjunction with stationary temperature data loggers or handheld electronic or liquid-in-glass thermometers to characterize stream temperatures by both time and space, could provide valuable information on stream temperature dynamics. These tools will become increasingly important to fisheries biologists as costs continue to decline.

AB  - Background: Gene regulation plays a central role in the adaptation of organisms to their environments. There are many molecular components to gene regulation, and it is often difficult to determine both the genetic basis of adaptation and the evolutionary forces that influence regulation. In multiple evolution experiments with the bacteriophage phi X174, adaptive substitutions in cis-acting regulatory sequences sweep through the phage population as the result of strong positive selection at high temperatures that are non-permissive for laboratory-adapted phage. For one cis-regulatory region, we investigate the individual effects of four adaptive substitutions on transcript levels and fitness for phage growing on three hosts at two temperatures.
   Results: The effect of the four individual substitutions on transcript levels is to down-regulate gene expression, regardless of temperature or host. To ascertain the conditions under which these substitutions are adaptive, fitness was measured by a variety of methods for several bacterial hosts growing at two temperatures, the control temperature of 37 degrees C and the selective temperature of 42 degrees C. Time to lysis and doublings per hour indicate that the four substitutions individually improve fitness over the ancestral strain at high temperature independent of the bacterial host in which the fitness was measured. Competition assays between the ancestral strain and either of two mutant strains indicate that both mutants out-compete the ancestor at high temperature, but the relative frequencies of each phage remain the same at the control temperature.
   Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that gene transcription plays an important role in influencing fitness in the bacteriophage phi X174, and different point mutations in a single cis-regulatory region provided the genetic basis for this role in adaptation to high temperature. We speculate that the adaptive nature of these substitutions is due to the physiology of the host at high temperature or the need to maintain particular ratios of phage proteins during capsid assembly. Our investigation of regulatory evolution contributes to interpreting genome-level assessments of regulatory variation, as well as to understanding the molecular basis of adaptation.

AB  - Background The energy generation efficiencies of thermal power and hydropower, which are the two main forces of electric power in China, are important factors affecting the energy conservation, emission reduction, and green development of the country's whole power industry. Methods Considering regional differences and multiple efficient decision-making units (DMUs), this research uses the meta-Frontier super-efficiency slack-based measure (meta-SE-SBM) undesirable model to comprehensively evaluate the efficiencies of hydropower and thermal power generation in China. The CO2 emissions of thermal power generation are taken as the undesirable output. Results The ranking of the average meta-efficiency of thermal power generation in China is Eastern China > Central China > Western China, and all regions show an upward trend. However, the ranking of the average meta-efficiency of hydropower generation is Western China > Central China > Eastern China, and all these regions present a downward trend. In 2017, the technology gap ratio (TGR) values for the thermal power generation efficiency of the eastern and western regions showed a rising trend, while that for the central region showed a declining trend. The TGR values of the hydropower generation efficiency of the western region continued to increase, while those of the central and eastern regions decreased. The development trends of the TGR values of the thermal power or hydropower generation efficiencies of the three regions were not consistent with each other, indicating that technological convergence has not been achieved. In the three regions, the technology gaps in hydropower have slightly expanded, but the technology gaps in thermal power have gradually narrowed. The undesirable output CO2 of the thermal power energy efficiency of the three regions is in a surplus, and the generation of hydropower in the eastern and central regions is insufficient. Conclusions The government and power industry managers should fully consider regional heterogeneity in the efficiency of hydropower and thermal power to reduce the technology gap in China. The thermal power industry is relatively mature, but its CO2 emissions should be controlled. The hydropower industry needs further policy support to promote an efficiency improvement in it under the condition of resource endowments.

AB  - The reactions of catalytic autothermal and steam conversion of n-C16H34 (model compound simulating diesel fuel), and partial oxidation of natural gas and LPG were studied using 0.24wt%Rh/(12wt%Zr0.25Ce0.25O2-delta-eta-Al2O3)/Fecralloy wire mesh honeycomb modules. The experiments were carried out in a flow setup in the temperature range of 550 960 C and at atmospheric pressure. It was shown that the observed syngas (CO + H-2) productivities were 65 and 53 m(3)Lcat(-1)h(-1) (STP) at GHSV of 100,000 and 80,000 h(-1) in natural gas and liquid petroleum gas catalytic partial oxidation processes, respectively. The product distributions were still close to the calculated equilibrium values. The catalyst activity was very high and, potentially, the maximum syngas productivity may even exceed experimentally demonstrated values.
   It was shown also that 0.24wt%Rh/(12wt%Zr0.25Ce0.75O2-delta-eta-Al2O3)/Fecralloy catalyst provided complete n-hexadecane conversion with the maximum syngas (CO + H-2) productivity of 6.2 m(3)Lcat(-1)h(-1) (STP) at GHSV of 13,300 h-1. The proposed concept of hydrogen-rich gas production from various hydrocarbon feedstocks in a multi-fuel catalytic reformer over single composite catalyst was proved feasible. The produced synthesis gas can be supplied as a fuel for power generation units based on high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermal models of buildings are often used to identify energy savings within a building. Given that a significant proportion of that energy is typically used to maintain building temperature, establishing the optimal control of the buildings thermal system is important. This requires an understanding of the thermal dynamics of the building, which is often obtained from physical thermal models. However, these models require detailed building parameters to be specified and these can often be difficult to determine. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary approach to parameter identification for thermal models that are formulated as an optimization task. A state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm, i.e., SaNSDE+, has been developed. A fitness function is defined, which quantifies the difference between the energy-consumption time-series data that are derived from the identified parameters and that given by simulation with a set of predetermined target model parameters. In comparison with a conventional genetic algorithm, fast evolutionary programming, and two state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, our experimental results show that the proposed SaNSDE+ has significantly improved both the solution quality and the convergence speed, suggesting this is an effective tool for parameter identification for simulated building thermal models.

AB  - Temperature modulates marine ectotherm physiology, influencing survival, abundance and species distribution. While native species could be susceptible to ocean warming, thermal tolerance might favour the spread of non-native species. Determining the success of invasive species in response to climate change is confounded by the cumulative, synergistic or antagonistic effects of environmental drivers, which vary at a geographical and temporal scale. Thus, an organism's acclimation or adaptive potential could play an important evolutionary role by enabling or conditioning species tolerance to stressful environmental conditions. We investigated developmental performance of early life stages of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis (derived from populations of anthropogenically impacted and control sites) to an extreme weather event (i.e. marine heatwave). Fertilization rate, embryo and larval development, settlement, metamorphosis success and juvenile heart rate were assessed as experimental endpoints. With the exception of fertilization and heart rates, temperature influenced all analysed endpoints. C. intestinalis derived from control sites were the most negatively affected by increased temperature conditions. By contrast, C. intestinalis from anthropogenically impacted sites showed a positive response to thermal stress, with a higher proportion of larvae development, settlement and metamorphosis success being observed under increased temperature conditions. No differences were observed for heart rates between sampled populations and experimental temperature conditions. Moreover, interaction between temperature and populations was statistically significant for embryo and larvae development, and metamorphosis. We hypothesize that selection resulting from anthropogenic forcing could shape stress resilience of species in their native range and subsequently confer advantageous traits underlying their invasive potential.

AB  - The green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) is a highly migratory, oceanic, anadromous species with a complex life history that makes it vulnerable to species-wide threats in both freshwater and at sea. Green sturgeon population declines have preceded legal protection and curtailment of activities in marine environments deemed to increase its extinction risk. Yet, its marine habitat is poorly understood. We built a statistical model to characterize green sturgeon marine habitat using data from a coastal tracking array located along the Siletz Reef near Newport, Oregon, USA that recorded the passage of 37 acoustically tagged green sturgeon. We classified seafloor physical habitat features with high-resolution bathymetric and backscatter data. We then described the distribution of habitat components and their relationship to green sturgeon presence using ordination and subsequently used generalized linear model selection to identify important habitat components. Finally, we summarized depth and temperature recordings from seven green sturgeon present off the Oregon coast that were fitted with pop-off archival geolocation tags. Our analyses indicated that green sturgeon, on average, spent a longer duration in areas with high seafloor complexity, especially where a greater proportion of the substrate consists of boulders. Green sturgeon in marine habitats are primarily found at depths of 20-60 meters and from 9.5-16.0 degrees C. Many sturgeon in this study were likely migrating in a northward direction, moving deeper, and may have been using complex seafloor habitat because it coincides with the distribution of benthic prey taxa or provides refuge from predators. Identifying important green sturgeon marine habitat is an essential step towards accurately defining the conditions that are necessary for its survival and will eventually yield range-wide, spatially explicit predictions of green sturgeon distribution.

AB  - As stream temperatures increase due to factors such as heated runoff from impervious surfaces, deforestation, and climate change, fish species adapted to cold water streams are forced to move to more suitable habitat, acclimate or adapt to increased thermal regimes, or die. To estimate the potential for adaptation, a (within individual) repeatable metric of thermal tolerance is imperative. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) is a dynamic test that is widely used to measure thermal tolerance across many taxa and has been used in fishes for decades, but its repeatability in most species is unknown. CTmax tests increase water temperature steadily over time until loss of equilibrium (LOE) is achieved. To determine if CTmax is a consistent metric within individual fish, we measured CTmax on the same lab-held individually-marked adult brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis at three different times (August & September 2016, September 2017). We found that CTmax is a repeatable trait (Repeatability +/- S.E.: 0.48 +/- 0.14). CTmax of individuals males was consistent over time, but the CTmax of females increased slightly over time. This result indicates that CTmax is a robust, repeatable estimate of thermal tolerance in a cold-water adapted fish.

AB  - The efficacy of biological control agents depends on the amount of mortality they impose on pests in the field. Quantifying their impact on a pest is critical for guiding decision-making in its management. Here, we quantify the relation of population levels of natural unmanipulated populations of a pest to mortality rates imposed by naturally occurring enemies. Mortality beyond first instar caused by natural enemies of Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) on fruit was studied in four unsprayed citrus orchards in a warm temperate coastal environment in New South Wales, Australia, over approximately three pest generations in the course of a year. The percentage of hosts on fruit suffering parasitism and predation was usually independent of host density. There was no consistent evidence that one parasitoid influenced another, nor that parasitism and predation rates were related. At the orchard scale, it was apparent that parasitism and predation over a time series were related to current or previous host numbers and could become high enough in relation to fecundity rates to cause pest numbers to decline. Temporal feedback to density could be causing the pest populations to fluctuate between limits at economically sustainable levels given additional mortality of the first instars due to expected rates of dispersal and subsequent pre- and post-settlement failures.

AB  - We used a clone of the bacterium Escherichia coli previously adapted to 37-degrees to found replicate populations propagated at constant 32-degrees-C, constant 37-degrees-C, constant 42-degrees-C, and a daily alternation between 32-degrees and 42-degrees-C. Several criteria indicate that 42-degrees-C was stressful for the ancestor, while 32-degrees and 37-degrees-C were not. For example, 42-degrees-C was within 1-degrees-C of the limit for extinction, and yield was substantially reduced at this temperature. Adaptation was assayed by competing derived genotypes against their common ancestor at various temperatures. Bacteria adapted much more rapidly to 42-degrees-C than to either lower temperature. Also, bacteria propagated in the alternating environment exhibited greater adaptation to 42-degrees-C than to 32-degrees-C. Adaptation was temperature-specific in all groups, but adaptation to 42-degrees-C entailed little loss of fitness at lower temperatures. Nor did adaptation to 42-degrees-C much extend the upper limit for population persistence, although we isolated more thermotolerant mutants by imposing hard selection. Thus, whereas the stressful 42-degrees-C environment consistently led to more rapid adaptive evolution than did nonstressful regimes, superstressful temperatures caused either extremely rapid adaptive evolution or extinction. Although defining stress in general terms is difficult, one can evaluate specific criteria and test evolutionary hypotheses using appropriate experimental systems.

AB  - Introduction In climate change, breeding crop plants with improved productivity, sustainability, and adaptability has become a daunting challenge to ensure global food security for the ever-growing global population. Correspondingly, climate-smart crops are also the need to regulate biomass production, which is imperative for the maintenance of ecosystem services worldwide. Since conventional breeding technologies for crop improvement are limited, time-consuming, and involve laborious selection processes to foster new and improved crop varieties. An urgent need is to accelerate the plant breeding cycle using artificial intelligence (AI) to depict plant responses to environmental perturbations in real-time. Materials and methods The review is a collection of authorized information from various sources such as journals, books, book chapters, technical bulletins, conference papers, and verified online contents. Conclusions Speed breeding has emerged as an essential strategy for accelerating the breeding cycles of crop plants by growing them under artificial light and temperature conditions. Furthermore, speed breeding can also integrate marker-assisted selection and cutting-edged gene-editing tools for early selection and manipulation of essential crops with superior agronomic traits. Scientists have recently applied next-generation AI to delve deeper into the complex biological and molecular mechanisms that govern plant functions under environmental cues. In addition, AIs can integrate, assimilate, and analyze complex OMICS data sets, an essential prerequisite for successful speed breeding protocol implementation to breed crop plants with superior yield and adaptability.

AB  - Ocean acidification has the potential to affect growth and calcification of benthic marine invertebrates, particularly during their early life history. We exposed field-collected juveniles of Asterias rubens from Kiel Fjord (western Baltic Sea) to 3 seawater CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) levels (ranging from around 650 to 3500 mu atm) in a long-term (39 wk) and a short-term (6 wk) experiment. In both experiments, survival and calcification were not affected by elevated pCO(2). However, feeding rates decreased strongly with increasing pCO(2), while aerobic metabolism and NH4+ excretion were not significantly affected by CO2 exposure. Consequently, high pCO(2) reduced the scope for growth in A. rubens. Growth rates decreased substantially with increasing pCO(2) and were reduced even at pCO(2) levels occurring in the habitat today (e.g. during upwelling events). Sea stars were not able to acclimate to higher pCO(2), and growth performance did not recover during the long-term experiment. Therefore, the top-down control exerted by this keystone species may be diminished during periods of high environmental pCO(2) that already occur occasionally and will be even higher in the future. However, some individuals were able to grow at high rates even at high pCO(2), indicating potential for rapid adaption. The selection of adapted specimens of A. rubens in this seasonally acidified habitat may lead to higher CO2 tolerance in adult sea stars of this population compared to the juvenile stage. Future studies need to address the synergistic effects of multiple stressors such as acidification, warming and reduced salinity, which will simultaneously impact the performance of sea stars in this habitat.

AB  - This paper depicts Cuba as a relic of the Cold War Its coverage of healthcare demonstrates steadfastness and success in surmounting hurdles of complacency and disregard to socialized medicine - an extension of Soviet patronage and third world alliances. The literature relays a mission of inclusivity underpinned by political ideology and a conviction to humanity. With the aid of endorsements, it speaks to contrasts and critiques in service and results by reflecting on the delivery of free healthcare for all Cuban citizens and its impression on the eradication of numerous diseases, reduced mortality rate and increased life expectancy. Punished by the longest trade embargo in modern history, the regime is in possession of limited resources to expedite remedy to its subjects. Such, much to the dislike of the authorities, elevates elements of distinction in association with the dispensation of service and drugs demonstrated by an evolving two-tier system for the disenfranchised and privileged clientele while simultaneously impacting the maintenance of facilities and equipment. Consequently, it recognizes harsh ramifications attributed to compliance with ideology and subtle adjustments to withstand external exertion. The Cuban replica is currently a tale of sorts awaiting a comprehensible definition for future generations.

AB  - Temperature and salinity and their interaction exert a major control on the life cycle of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), affecting reproduction, development, growth, and mortality. Quantifying specific temperature and salinity relationships on oyster growth and mortality has, however, proven difficult, with data suggesting potentially region-specific responses. Legacy and recent data from field tray studies from public oyster grounds in Barataria Bay (BA) and Breton Sound (BS) were used to estimate growth and mortality rates as a function of temperature and salinity. Previous studies conducted in BA and BS reported differences in growth and mortality between the basins. In the present study, environmental conditions were synchronized to compare growth and mortality between basins at similar combinations of temperature and salinity. Results indicate that when temperature and salinity are the same (synchronized), seasonal oyster growth and mortality rates still differ between BA and BS. Given the same salinity and temperature conditions, differences in growth and mortality rates between estuaries may persist because of differences in other environmental conditions (i.e., food quality and composition, hydrology, site history, and salinity variation) or localized genetic adaptations to environmental conditions.

AB  - Genetic variation complicates predictions of both the initial tolerance and the long-term (micro-evolutionary) response of natural Daphnia populations to chemical stressors from results of standard single-clone laboratory ecotoxicity tests. In order to investigate possible solutions to this problem, we aimed to compare the initial sub-lethal tolerance to Cd of 10 naive natural pond populations of Daphnia magna as well as their evolutionary potential to develop increased resistance. We did so by measuring reproductive performance of 120 clones, i.e. 12 clones hatched from the recent dormant egg bank of each of 10 populations, both in absence (Cd-free control) and presence of 4.4 mu g Cd/L. We show that the initial tolerance, defined as the reproductive performance of individuals of the first generation exposed to Cd relative to that in a Cd-free control was not significantly different among the 10 studied pond populations and averaged 0.82 +/- 0.04 over these populations. Moreover, these populations' initial tolerances were also not significantly different from the mean initial tolerance of 0.87 +/- 0.08 at 4.0 mu g Cd/L measured for a group of 7 often-used laboratory clones, collected from a range of European ecotoxicity testing laboratories. This indicates that the initial response of naive natural pond populations to sub-lethal Cd can be relatively accurately predicted from ecotoxicity test data from only a handful of laboratory clones. We then used estimates of broad-sense heritability of Cd tolerance (H-2) - based on the same dataset - as a proxy of these populations' capacities to evolutionarily respond to Cd in terms of the development of increased resistance, which is here defined as the increase with time of the frequency of clones with a higher Cd tolerance in the population (accompanied with an increase of mean Cd-tolerance of the population above the initial tolerance). We show that the populations' estimated H-2 values of Cd-tolerance cover almost the entire theoretically possible range, ranging from not significantly different from zero (for five populations) to between 0.48 and 0.81 (for the five other populations). This indicates that, unlike the initial tolerance to Cd, the (long-term) micro-evolutionary response to Cd may be very different among natural pond populations. Therefore, we conclude that it may be very difficult to predict the long-term response of an unstudied population to chemical stress from tolerance data on a sample of other populations. It is therefore suggested that new methods for forecasting long-term responses should be explored, such as the development of predictive models based on the combination of population-genomic and tolerance time-series data.

AB  - The ecosystems in the arid inland areas of Central Asia are fragile and severely degraded. Understanding and assessing ecosystem resilience is a challenge facing ecosystems. Based on the net primary productivity (NPP) data estimated by the CASA model, this study conducted a quantitative analysis of the ecosystem's resilience and comprehensively reflected its resilience from multiple dimensions. Furthermore, a comprehensive resilience index was constructed. The result showed that plain oasis's ecosystem resilience is the highest, followed by deserts and mountainous areas. From the perspective of vegetation types, the highest resilience is artificial vegetation and the lowest is forest. In warm deserts, the resilience is higher in shrubs and meadows and lower in grassland vegetation. High coverage and biomass are not the same as the strong adaptability of the ecosystem. Moderate and slightly inelastic areas mainly dominate the ecosystem resilience of the study area. The new method is easy to use. The evaluation result is reliable. It can quantitatively analyze the resilience latitude and recovery rate, a beneficial improvement to the current ecosystem resilience evaluation.

AB  - The natural occurrence of Salvadora persica L., stretching from the coastal area of the Arabian sea to northward along the Indus floodplains, was surveyed to document the pattern of its occurrence with the available meteorological record showing increasing trends of frost northwards. Information was compiled from various sources to generate the past and present temperature data in order to establish relationship between the changing temperature factors and the extent of the area available due to climate change over the years for introducing species beyond its range of natural distribution. In addition, the species was experimentally introduced in the warmed-up zones to monitor its performance and to evaluate its adaptability. The reconnaissance survey showed that the natural populations of thorn forest communities with S. persica, as associate, are now surviving only as degraded remnants. Its common occurrence is documented in zones where the mean winter temperatures are above the threshold level of frost, whereas it is rarely found in zones where it drops below this level for a single month, which seems to be its range edge. S. persica does not occur in zones where low temperature could persist for 2 months. Recent temperature data suggests that the month of December has warmed up above the threshold level; therefore, it was expected that correspondingly the range edge of the frost-sensitive species has potentially shifted further northwards. The response of the species introduced at the experimental sites beyond its natural occurrence suggests high survival and growth, demonstrating its adaptability to the new sites beyond its limit of distribution.

AB  - In a warming world an increasing number of people are being exposed to heat, making a comfortable thermal environment an important need. This study explores the potential of using Regional Internet Search Frequencies (RISF) for air conditioning devices as an indicator for thermal discomfort (i.e. dissatisfaction with the thermal environment) with the aim to quantify the adaptation potential of individuals living across different climate zones and at the high end of the temperature range, in India, where access to health data is limited. We related RISF for the years 2011-2015 to daily daytime outdoor temperature in 17 states and determined at which temperature RISF for air conditioning starts to peak, i.e. crosses a heat 'threshold', in each state. Using the spatial variation in heat thresholds, we explored whether people continuously exposed to higher temperatures show a lower response to heat extremes through adaptation (e.g. physiological, behavioural or psychological). State-level heat thresholds ranged from 25.9 degrees C in Madhya Pradesh to 31.0 degrees C in Orissa. Local adaptation was found to occur at state level: the higher the average temperature in a state, the higher the heat threshold; and the higher the intra-annual temperature range (warmest minus coldest month) the lower the heat threshold. These results indicate there is potential within India to adapt to warmer temperatures, but that a large intra-annual temperature variability attenuates this potential to adapt to extreme heat. This winter 'reset' mechanism should be taken into account when assessing the impact of global warming, with changes in minimum temperatures being an important factor in addition to the change in maximum temperatures itself. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of local heat thresholds and people's adaptive capacity, which can support the design of local thermal comfort standards and early heat warning systems.

AB  - There is growing evidence that bioenergetics can explain relationships between environmental conditions and fish behaviour, distribution and fitness. Fish energetic needs increase predictably with water temperature, but metabolic performance (i.e., aerobic scope) exhibits varied relationships, and there is debate about its role in shaping fish ecology. Here we present an energetics-performance framework, which posits that ecological context determines whether energy expenditure or metabolic performance influence fish behaviour and fitness. From this framework, we present testable predictions about how temperature-driven variability in energetic demands and metabolic performance interact with ecological conditions to influence fish behaviour, distribution and fitness. Specifically, factors such as prey availability and the spatial distributions of prey and predators may alter fish temperature selection relative to metabolic and energetic optima. Furthermore, metabolic flexibility is a key determinant of how fish will respond to changing conditions, such as those predicted with climate change. With few exceptions, these predictions have rarely been tested in the wild due partly to difficulties in remotely measuring aspects of fish energetics. However, with recent advances in technology and measurement techniques, we now have a better capacity to measure bioenergetics parameters in the wild. Testing these predictions will provide a more mechanistic understanding of how ecological factors affect fish fitness and population dynamics, advancing our knowledge of how species and ecosystems will respond to rapidly changing environments.

AB  - This paper investigates the intensification of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) in open-cell foam structures. For confirming this point, the metallic foams with different alloy (aluminum and FeCrAl), pore density (10-40 ppi), and (20% Co-0.5% Re)/Al2O3 catalyst layer thicknesses were prepared. Catalytic results of aluminum foams show excellent thermal behavior but catalyst coatings thicker than similar to 70 mu m suffer from catalyst effectiveness loss, increasing methane selectivity, and decreasing C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity. Conversely, FeCrAl foams also exhibited a similar critical maximum catalyst layer thickness but with diffusional and thermal limitations resulting in both temperature and selectivity runaways at higher thicknesses. Finally, the observed good thermal control and tortuosity of the narrow porous structure for aluminum foams permitted enhanced production of C5+ hydrocarbons to 87 kg(C5+) m(-3) h(-1) at 250 degrees C, 26% higher than the productivity obtained with parallel channel aluminum monolith coated with a similar catalyst amount.

AB  - Within a framework of renewed interest in crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst ex R.E. Fries) sourcing raw materials for the bio-based industry, the adaptability and productive performances of this oil crop have been evaluated under contrasting Mediterranean environments (i.e., a fertile site in the northern part of Po valley vs. a semi-arid site of southern Sicily) during two consecutive growing seasons, aiming at its possible stable introduction in this area. The trial set in northern Italy compared three commercial varieties of crambe (Galactica, Nebula and Mario) in spring sowing, while in southern Italy only the var. Mario was tested with autumn sowing. Regardless of location and variety, thermal time for maturity was quite stable (1200-1400 degrees C), and the crop provided satisfactory seed yields (grand mean 2.29 Mg hulled seeds ha(-1)), with average oil content of 400 g kg(-1) (on dehulled seeds) and 52% of erucic acid. Significantly higher seed and oil yields were reached in northern than in southern Italy. Furthermore, crambe thermal use efficiency (THUE) was also higher in the north than in the south, possibly due to better environmental adaptability of the crop. The limited intraspecific variability within crambe was confirmed, with better productive performances showed by the domestic selection Mario. Promising traits were revealed in Nebula, showing greater seed weight, root length density and area, and thinner roots, although the root growth of crambe was generally modeft compared with modern high erucic acid rapeseed hybrids. Available crambe varieties could be efficiently included in crop rotations across a wide range of environments within the Mediterranean basin. The short growth cycle represents an outstanding added value for this species, allowing the avoidance of prolonged drought and heat stress typical of late spring/early summer months under the Mediterranean climate. However, increased yields are needed to meet the market requests; nonetheless, the little genetic variability suggests that there is large scope for future breeding improvements, maybe exploiting advanced techniques to improve the existing genetic resources.

AB  - Glazed roof has a convenient place to receive solar radiation, however its bad thermal mass affects the indoor thermal environment and energy consumption. In the present work, the effect of glazed roof filled with phase change material on its thermal mass was experimentally investigated and compared with conventional glazed roof. Experiments with different PCM melting temperatures, PCM layer thicknesses and glazed roof slopes were performed to analyze their effect on the energy consumption and dissatisfaction rate of indoor thermal environment. Also, a general economic analysis was performed to assess the viability of glazing units containing PCM. The results show that the energy consumption of glazed roof filled with PCM is significantly less than that of air, and up to 47.5% of energy saving can be achieved. Payback period can be reduced to 3.3 years by proper selection of PCM melting temperature. Increasing the melting temperature of PCM can effectively decrease the temperature of internal surface of glazed roof, but has a slight influence on the dissatisfaction rate of indoor thermal environment. Increasing the thickness of PCM layer decreases the peak temperature of internal surface of glazed roof and indoor chamber, the energy consumption and the dissatisfaction rate. The highest energy consumption and dissatisfaction rate are obtained at 20 degrees of the inclination angle.

AB  - Combined NOx storage and reduction (NSR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) were conducted in a bench flow reactor comprising a Pt/Rh/BaO/Al2O3 lean NOx trap (LNT) catalyst and either Fe-ZSM-5 or Cu-SSZ-13 SCR catalyst. Simulated exhaust gas containing C3H6 or CO reductant was used to evaluate catalyst performance in terms of cycle-averaged NOx conversion and product selectivities over a range of feed concentrations and temperatures, and gas hourly space velocities (GHSV). Instantaneous concentration and temperature measurements reveal strong coupling of mass and energy between the LNT and SCR. The data show the importance of NH3 generation by the LNT for effective use of the downstream SCR. Operating conditions are identified that maximize utilization of the downstream SCR. A non-NH3 SCR pathway is found to be significant for Cu-SSZ-13 at intermediate temperature and high space velocity. The post-LNT NH3 to NOx ratio (ANR) correlates with the incremental NOx conversion achieved for Fe-ZSM-5, noting that ANR similar to 1 favors NH3-based standard SCR at high conversion. A reactor system productivity metric for N-2 generation (space-time yield analog) is used to rank-order the LNT + SCR systems and together with the propylene conversion are used to identify conditions giving the best performance. The combination of an overall GHSV of 135 k h(-1) and 350 degrees C feed temperature generates a SCR feed from the LNT that results in the highest incremental cycle-averaged NOx conversion in the SCR (similar to 30% with Cu-SSZ-13) and high cycle-averaged conversions of NOx (similar to 90%) and propylene (similar to 80%). The Cu-SSZ-13 out-performs the Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst under most conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The outstretched applications of biosensors in diverse domains has become the reason for their attraction for scientific communities. Because they are analytical devices, they can detect both quantitative and qualitative biological components through the generation of detectable signals. In the recent past, biosensors witnessed significant changes and developments in their design as well as features. Nanotechnology has revolutionized sensing phenomena by increasing biodiagnostic capacity in terms of specificity, size, and cost, resulting in exceptional sensitivity and flexibility. The steep increase of non-communicable diseases across the world has emerged as a matter of concern. In parallel, the abrupt outbreak of communicable diseases poses a serious threat to mankind. For decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with various communicable and non-communicable diseases, early detection and subsequent treatment are indispensable. Detection of different biological markers generates quantifiable signals that can be electrochemical, mass-based, optical, thermal, or piezoelectric.

AB  - It is well known that the thermal behavior of moulds used for thermoplastics processing has an important effect on both the part quality and the process productivity. The present work reports a study on the evaluation of the relative effect of different geometric and operational parameters on the thermal behavior of injection moulds. It uses a mathematical model developed to simulate the thermal transient exchanged during the entire moulding cycle. the model is based on a 2D Fourier equation, uses an adaptive grid and describes the thermal contact resistance at mould/polymer interface. The cooling time and the interface temperature distribution are calculated from the computed temperature field in the domain under study. Experimental data, obtained with an instrumented tool during typical production conditions, is used to validate the developed model. the evaluation analysis is based on the Taguchi methodology used to rank the relative effective of the parameters on the selected variables (cooling time, temperature distribution and number of cycles to reach the thermal steady state).

AB  - The cultivation of Bt maize, genetically modified to be resistant to insect pests, has led to intense scientific and political debate about its possible adverse impacts on biodiversity. To better address this question we developed an individual-based simulation model (LepiX). LepiX considers the temporal dynamics of maize pollen shedding and larval phonology, and pollen deposition on host plants related to distance from the maize field, in order to estimate mortality of lepidopteran larvae exposed to toxic Bt pollen. We employed a refined exposure analysis, comparison to previous approaches, using recent evidence on leaf pollen deposition and accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of pollen on leaves. Moreover, we used a stochastic approach, considering literature data on a minimum dataset for butterfly biology in combination with historic data on temporal pollen deposition to predict the coincidence between larval phenology and pollen deposition. Since conservation management actions may act at the level of the individual for protected species, LepiX, as an individual based spatially explicit model, is suited to assist both risk assessment and management measures based on threshold mortalities. We tested our model using Inachis io (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) as butterfly species and the cultivation of insect resistant MON810 maize. In accordance to predictions based on other models we identified mortality risks of I. io larvae for the second larval generation. An analysis of the sensitivity of input parameters stressed the importance of both the slope and the LC50 value of the dose-response curve as well as the earliest day of larval hatching. Using different published data to characterize the dose-response of MON810 pollen to I. io we revealed consequences due to uncertainties in ecotoxicological parameters and thus highlight the importance of key biological parameters for reliable estimates of effects, and decision making (e.g. isolation distances) in risk assessment.

AB  - Linking ecology and evolution can be challenging, particularly as these fields evolve rapidly tracking technological and theoretical developments. Thus, it is important for practitioners of different biological disciplines to understand new opportunities and challenges. Since theory and methods evolve, so will research programmes-often tracking opportunity. Here, we describe a research programme where we have investigated the population biology of grayling Thymallus thymallus in a Norwegian alpine landscape over three decades. Starting with classical ecological studies, we identified a set of populations that had evolved population-specific phenotypic traits over a relatively short time span (10-30 generations). These observations led us into evolutionary studies at various levels of biological organization, using population and quantitative genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Overall, the results show that the populations exhibit evolutionary responses to local-scale differences in environment (mainly water temperature during early development). Further, plastic responses are important in the early phase of population diversification. Population genomic studies are now becoming possible following the completion of an annotated genome. This will help us and others in addressing questions about the genetic architecture of traits important for local adaptation, thus emphasizing that combining ecological and evolutionary approaches is more important and interesting than ever.

AB  - Protandry is the earlier adult emergence of males than females. This is predicted from sexual selection theory because, under certain circumstances, earlier emergence of males will maximize their mating opportunities. The tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, is adapted to highly seasonal environments and selection pressures for protandry may vary across seasons. To examine such effects, we compared protandry across a wide range of rearing temperatures in the laboratory which match those that occur in the different seasons. The absolute amount of protandry (in days) remained constant at intermediate and high temperatures (wet season), but increased with temperature at lower temperatures (dry season). Nevertheless, average male development time as a percentage of female development time remained constant. We also compared lines established by artificial selection on development time and pupal weight across temperatures to assess the impact of different selection pressures on protandry. Data for the pupal weight selected lines were inconclusive. The male to female development time ratio did not change across temperatures for the development time selected lines. However, females were relatively slower than males in the slow selected lines (lower male: female development time ratio) than in either the fast lines or the stock. This indicates that sex-specific components to development time are present in B. anynana and that there is scope for a response of protandry to selection.

AB  - Interactions between environmental factors and complex life-history characteristics of marine organisms produce the genetic diversity and structure observed within species. Our main goal was to test for genetic differentiation among eastern oyster populations from the coastal region of Canadian Maritimes against expected genetic homogeneity caused by historical events, taking into account spatial and environmental (temperature, salinity, turbidity) variation. This was achieved by genotyping 486 individuals originating from 13 locations using RADSeq. A total of 11,321 filtered SNPs were used in a combination of population genomics and environmental association analyses. We revealed significant neutral genetic differentiation (mean F-ST = 0.009) between sampling locations, and the occurrence of six major genetic clusters within the studied system. Redundancy analyses (RDAs) revealed that spatial and environmental variables explained 3.1% and 4.9% of the neutral genetic variation and 38.6% and 12.2% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation, respectively. These results indicate that these environmental factors play a role in the distribution of both neutral and putatively adaptive genetic diversity in the system. Moreover, polygenic selection was suggested by genotype-environment association analysis and significant correlations between additive polygenic scores and temperature and salinity. We discuss our results in the context of their conservation and management implications for the eastern oyster.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity are presently seriously threatened by global development and population growth, leading to increases in nutrient inputs and intensification of eutrophication-induced problems in receiving fresh waters, particularly in lakes. Climate change constitutes another threat exacerbating the symptoms of eutrophication and species migration and loss. Unequivocal evidence of climate change impacts is still highly fragmented despite the intensive research, in part due to the variety and uncertainty of climate models and underlying emission scenarios but also due to the different approaches applied to study its effects. We first describe the strengths and weaknesses of the multi-faceted approaches that are presently available for elucidating the effects of climate change in lakes, including space-for-time substitution, time series, experiments, palaeoecology and modelling. Reviewing combined results from studies based on the various approaches, we describe the likely effects of climate changes on biological communities, trophic dynamics and the ecological state of lakes. We further discuss potential mitigation and adaptation measures to counteract the effects of climate change on lakes and, finally, we highlight some of the future challenges that we face to improve our capacity for successful prediction.

AB  - The sizes at which female and male western rock lobster Panulirus cygnus become mature were examined over 32 years from records at six localities along the coast of Western Australia. The size of males at maturity was estimated from a subset of these data by a morphometric and a physiological method, with both producing statistically similar results. Males were larger at first maturity than females at the same sites. For both sexes, the sizes at first maturity at each location correlated (P < 0.05) with the mean annual water temperature at that location, decreasing from south to north along the mainland coast and being smallest at the offshore Abrolhos Islands. Smaller sizes at maturity were recorded for both sexes than have been published previously. One certain explanation for these differences is that management measures protecting females with ovigerous setae have distorted size compositions and the ratio of immature to mature females, thereby increasing the likelihood of capturing small mature females. However, these fishing effects cannot fully account for the progressive decline in CL50 observed over the past 20 years. Other possible hypotheses considered include increases in water temperature over this period, as well as whether this change could be consistent with a genotypic response caused by the selective removal of large lobsters combined with high exploitation rates.

AB  - Recent studies of evolution in heterogeneous environments have concentrated on the role of coarse-grained environmental variation. Here I explore the potential for a modular organism to adapt to fine-grained environmental variation through within-individual variation among modules. I describe the pattern of variation among leaves of single individuals and report results of initial analyses of genetic variation for within-individual variability in leaf traits and of genetic correlations that could influence the rate of further evolution of within-individual variation of these traits. Plants from 24 paternal half-sib families were raised in growth chambers, and five traits were measured for two leaves produced by each plant. Four of the five traits differed significantly between sampling times. Genetic analyses revealed significant additive genetic variation for within-individual variation in several traits. Estimates of family mean correlations between traits expressed at different times suggest few relationships that would be expected to impede response to selection for changes in the pattern of within-individual variation in leaf traits. These results support the possibility that within-individual variation could evolve as an adaptive response to fine-grained environmental variation and suggest a need for further investigation to improve understanding of evolution in heterogeneous environments.

AB  - Survival of microorganisms in the Antarctic and Arctic conditions of life requires of the relevant genera and species special adaptability and resistance against stressors such as lack of substrate, UV-radiation, low temperatures for a long time and short-term intense heat during the Antarctic and Arctic summer. Therefore genetic adaptation of Antarctic and Arctic organisms to stress factors would be expected. All this suggests in a global aspect synthesis of new metabolites with unique structures and specific biological activity. Antarctic and Arctic polar regions are considered as a huge reservoir of microorganisms with versatile antimicrobial potential. Our studies are motivated by an interest in the functional role played by natural products in the ecological interactions of the polar strains with the other members of the microbial community. This overview presents some of the most important secondary metabolites (antibiotics, alkaloids, high carbon amino acids, nitro compounds, diketopiperazines etc.) produced by Antarctic and Arctic microorganisms. The secondary metabolites biosynthesis probably plays an important role in the adaptation and survival of microorganisms in the ice deserts of Antarctica and the Arctic.

AB  - Temperature plays an important role in the growth, development, and geographic distribution of insects. There is convincing evidence that heat-shock proteins (HSPs) play important roles in helping organisms adapt to thermal stress. To better understand the physiological and ecological influence of thermal stress on the different development stages of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Mediterranean species (MED), nymphs and adults were shocked with temperatures of 35, 38, and 41 degrees C for 1 and 2 h, respectively, and the survival rate, fecundity, and developmental duration were investigated in the laboratory. The expression levels of the hsp40,hsp70, and hsp90 genes were assessed using real-time PCR. The results indicate that the survival rates of the nymphs and adults decreased with increased temperature. A 2-h heat shock at 41 degrees C induced a significant reduction in fecundity in adults and an increase in developmental duration in young nymphs. Hsp90 showed higher temperature responses to thermal stress than hsp40 or hsp70. The expression levels of the hsps in the adults were significantly down-regulated by a 2-h heat shock at 41 degrees C compared with that by a 1-h treatment. A significant decrease in the expression levels of the hsps also occurred in the adults when the temperature increased from 38 to 41 degrees C for the 2-h treatment, whereas no significant decrease occurred in the nymphs. Compared with previous studies, we provide some evidence indicating that MED has the potential to adapt to a wider temperature range than the Middle East-Asia Minor 1 species.

AB  - Despite increasing evidence that current exploitation rates can contribute to shifts in life-history traits and the collapse of marine fish stocks, few empirical studies have investigated the likely evolutionary impacts. Here, we used DNA recovered from a temporal series of archived North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, to investigate genetic diversity within the Flamborough Head population between 1954 and 1998, during which time the population underwent two successive declines.
   Microsatellite data indicated a significant reduction in genetic diversity between 1954 and 1970 (total number of alleles: 1954, 46; 1960, 42; 1970, 37), and a subsequent recovery between 1970 and 1998 (total number of alleles: 1970, 37; 1981, 42; 1998, 45). Furthermore, estimates of genetic differentiation (F-ST and R-ST) showed a significant divergence between 1998 and earlier samples.
   Data are consistent with a period of prolonged genetic drift, accompanied by a replacement of the Flamborough Head population through an increased effective migration rate that occurred during a period of high exploitation and appreciable demographic and phenotypic change. Other studies indicate that diversity at neutral microsatellite loci may be correlated with variability at selected genes, thus compromising a population's subsequent recovery and adaptive potential. Such effects are especially pertinent to North Sea cod, which are threatened by continuing exploitation and rising sea temperatures.

AB  - The yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, Psacothea hilaris, which is a serious pest of mulberry and fig trees, was collected from different localities between 24 degrees N and 36 degrees N in Japan. The egg periods were checked under constant temperature conditions. Most populations showed similar developmental zeros (slightly lower than 11 degrees C). However, there were great Variations in the effective cumulative days(ECD). The highest ECD was found in the Hino strain which had been reared over 30 generations in the laboratory and mainly overwinters in the egg stage in the field. The obtained ECD does not explain how so many eggs of this strain overwinter without hatching, so factors delaying egg development were investigated. The hibernaculum of this species is mostly under mulberry bark. The results show that the host plant per se had large growth-retarding effects on P. hilaris eggs. However low temperature and wet conditions also had some effect.

AB  - Background, aim, and scope Beneficial use of coal combustion products (CCPs) in industrial or construction operations has the potential to minimize environmental and human health impacts that would otherwise be associated with disposal of CCPs in the life cycle of coal used for electricity generation. To assess opportunities for reducing impacts associated with four CCP materials considered in this study, fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) material, this paper reports results of expanding a life cycle inventory of raw material and emissions (part 1 of this series of papers) by performing life cycle impact assessment on five scenarios of CCP management.
   Materials and methods SimaPro 5.1 software (PRe Consultants) was used to calculate comparative environmental impacts of all scenarios using CML2001 and Environmental Design of Industrial Products 1997 midpoint impact assessment methods and Heirarchist and Individualist levels of the Eco-indicator 99 end point method. Trends were compared for global and local environmental and human health impact categories of global warming, acidification, smog formation, human toxicity, and ecotoxicity.
   Results In each impact category, beneficial use of fly ash, bottom ash, and FGD material resulted in a reduced impact compared to disposal of these materials. The extent to which beneficial use reduced impacts depended on several factors, including the impact category in consideration, the magnitude of potentially avoided impacts associated with producing raw materials that CCPs replace, and the potential impact of CCP disposal methods. Global warming impacts were reduced by the substitution of fly ash for Portland cement in concrete production, as production of Portland cement generates large quantities of CO2. However, for categories of global warming, smog formation, and acidification, impact reductions from CCP beneficial use are small, less than 6%, as these impacts were attributable, in greater part, to upstream processes of coal mining, transportation, and combustion. Human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories showed larger but more varied reductions, from 0% to 50%, caused by diverting CCPs from landfills and surface impoundments.
   Discussion When comparing beneficial use scenarios, the four impact assessment methods used showed similar trends in categories of global warming, acidification, and smog formation. However, results diverged for human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories due to the lack of consensus among methods in classification and characterization of impacts from heavy metal release. Similarly, when assessing sensitivity of these results to changes in assumptions or system boundaries, human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories were most susceptible to change, while other impact categories had more robust results.
   Conclussions Impact assessment results showed that beneficial use of CCPs presented opportunities for reduced environmental impacts in the life cycle of coal combusted for electricity generation, as compared to the baseline scenario of 100% CCP disposal, although the impact reductions varied depending on the CCPs used, the ultimate beneficial use, and the impact category in consideration.
   Recommendations and perspectives As regulators and electric utilities increasingly consider viability and economics of the use of CCPs in various applications, this study provides a first-basis study of selected beneficial use alternatives. With these initial results, future studies should be directed towards beneficial uses that promise significant economic and environmental savings, such as use of fly ash in concrete, to quantify the currently unknown risk of these applications.

AB  - The spotted-wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii Matsumura) is native to eastern Asia, but has become a global threat to fruit production. In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting was established in this species allowing for functional genomic and genetic control studies. Here, we report the generation and characterization of Cas9-expressing strains of D. suzukii. Five independent transgenic lines were generated using a piggyBac construct containing the EGFP fluorescent marker gene and the Cas9 gene under the control of the D. melanogaster heat shock protein 70 promoter and 3'UTR. Heat-shock (HS) treated embryos were analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR, revealing strong heat inducibility of the transgenic Cas9 expression. By injecting gRNA targeting EGFP into one selected line, 50.0% of G(0) flies showed mosaic loss-of-fluorescence phenotype, and 45.5% of G(0) flies produced G(1) mutants without HS. Such somatic and germline mutagenesis rates were increased to 95.4% and 85.7%, respectively, by applying a HS. Parental flies receiving HS resulted in high inheritance of the mutation (92%) in their progeny. Additionally, targeting the endogenous gene yellow led to the lack of pigmentation and male lethality. We discuss the potential use of these efficient and temperature-dependent Cas9-expressing strains for the genetic studies in D. suzukii.

AB  - Aim The expansive spatial scale of pelagic communities and the difficulty in acquiring pelagic species' functional traits have stymied an understanding of marine community dynamics. We assembled and analysed a shark trait database and community phylogeny to identify the major axes of trait variation that define shark functional groups. We tested whether membership to biophysical macroecological strata is related to these functional or phylogenetic relationships. Location Northeastern Pacific, 180-255 degrees E and 0-50 degrees N. Taxon Sharks (Class: Chondrichthyes, superorder: Selachimorpha). Methods We built a community phylogeny and collected habitat, reproductive, somatic growth, trophic and dentition traits. We used principal coordinates analyses to identify axes of trait variation and hierarchical clustering to classify functional groups. We tested whether functional or phylogenetic relatedness determined species' membership to strata from five macroecological gradients: latitude, habitat type, thermal, carbon source and bathymetry. Results We assembled 38 traits from 1225 records from 130 sources, 260 pictographs from seven sources and 631 teeth from 79 jaw specimens. Life history, r versus K selection, was responsible for the biggest division in the functional dendrogram. Vertical habitat preference, growth rates, diet and dental morphology generated further divisions between r- or K-selected species. Vertical habitat preference, carbon source and biochemical habitat type were significantly dispersed or clustered on the functional dendrogram or phylogram. Main Conclusions Habitat and reproductive traits were the most important trait suites driving shark functional diversity. Through ordination and clustering, we were able to associate major axes of trait variation to the membership of shark functional groups. The phylogram approximated well the functional dendrogram's backbone but was a poor substitute for the trait diversity at the tips. Given the long evolutionary history of sharks and coincident expansive trait diversity, merging functional and phylogenetic approaches was necessary to capture the dimensions of shark biodiversity.

AB  - Ambient temperature modulates reproductive processes, especially in poikilotherms such as teleosts. Consequently, global warming is expected to impact the reproductive function of fish, which has implications for wild population dynamics, fisheries and aquaculture. In this extensive review spanning tropical and cold-water environments, we examine the impact of higher-than-optimal temperatures on teleost reproductive development and physiology across reproductive stages, species, generations and sexes. In doing so, we demonstrate that warmer-than-optimal temperatures can affect every stage of reproductive development from puberty through to the act of spawning, and these responses are mediated by age at spawning and are associated with changes in physiology at multiple levels of the brain-pituitary-gonad axis. Response to temperature is often species-specific and changes with environmental history/transgenerational conditioning, and the amplitude, timing and duration of thermal exposure within a generation. Thermally driven changes to physiology, gamete development and maturation typically culminate in poor sperm and oocyte quality, and/or advancement/delay/inhibition of ovulation/spermiation and spawning. Although the field of teleost reproduction and temperature is advanced in many respects, we identify areas where research is lacking, especially for males and egg quality from "omics" perspectives. Climate-driven warming will continue to disturb teleost reproductive performance and therefore guide future research, especially in the emerging areas of transgenerational acclimation and epigenetic studies, which will help to understand and project climate change impacts on wild populations and could also have implications for aquaculture.

AB  - The molten salt reactor (MSR) represents one of the promising high temperature nuclear reactor types for future generation of electricity which is characterized by remarkable advantages in inherent safety, fuel cycle, miniaturization, effective utilization of nuclear resources and proliferation resistance.
   The molten salt reactor is characterized by circulation of fuel salt (mixture of molten salt and fissile-fertile isotopes). The circulation of fuel salt serves the purpose of coolant as well as fuel simultaneously. This results in strongly coupled neutronics and thermo-hydraulics system. These special features require a modification to mathematical models applicable to static fuel system.
   In this paper, coupled point kinetics equations and core heat transfer have been modeled by developing a mathematical model for MSR based on lumped parameters technique and modes of transients such as: reactivity insertion, fuel mass flow rate variations, and the inlet temperature drop conditions. The results showed that the program is a suitable tool for MSR transient analysis.

AB  - On-fault processes during earthquakes contribute to seismic rupture propagation and slip. Here we investigate clast fragmentation in an experimental pseudotachylyte (solidified seismic melt) produced with a rotary shear machine. We slid for 0.44 m (corresponding to Mw > 6 earthquakes), at slip rates > 1 m/s, pre-cut samples of quartz + phyllosilicates + plagioclase + sillimanite + garnet -bearing ultramylonite, that hosts pseudotachylytes in nature. The ultramylonite minerals extensively preserved as clasts in the experimental pseudotachylyte are quartz, plagioclase, and sillimanite. Garnet is scarcely preserved, despite having a melting temperature similar to plagioclase, probably due to having low thermal shock resistance. This selective clast survival is identical to the one found in the natural pseudotachylytes. Based on these experimental observations and assuming nonequilibrium melting, the preservation of a mineral, as a clast, in the melt appears to be controlled by its thermal shock properties as well as by its melting temperature. Since the mechanical effects of rupture propagation in these experiments were negligible, we conclude that, for Mw > 6 earthquakes, (i) frictional slip and heating of the slipping zone plus (ii) thermomechanical properties of minerals, rather than fault rupture processes, control mineral comminution and clast survival in frictional melts.

AB  - The use of thermal energy storage (TES) systems is essential for solar power systems because of fluctuations in the solar energy input. Several classes of storage may be required for a single installation, depending on the type and scale of the solar power plant itself, and the nature of its integration with conventional utility systems. For heating and hot water applications, water and phase change materials (PCMs) constitute the principle storage media. Soil, rock and other solids are used as well. Water has the advantage of approximately 80% less volume than that of water for a temperature variation of 10 degrees C, which is the difference between temperatures of a fully charged and a fully discharged storage tank. Some PCMs are viscous and corrosive, and must be segregated within the container in order to be used as a heat transfer medium. For heat storage, two PCMs must be available, unless heat pumping is employed. A variety of solids is also used; rock particles of 20 to 50 mn in size are most prevalent. Well-designed packed rock beds have several desirable characteristics for energy storage. The heat transfer coefficient between the air and the solid is high, the cost of the storage material is low, the conductivity of the bed is low when air flow is not present and a large heat transfer area can be achieved at low cost by reducing the size of particles. TES systems have also been suggested for storing thermal energy at medium (38-304 degrees C) and high temperatures (120-566 degrees C). For instance, systems in an oil-rock system for hot water and heat-recovery applications are examples of medium-temperature applications, while those in molten nitrate salt systems (an excellent storage medium) for steam production for process applications are for high temperatures. Oil-rock TES, in which the energy is stored in a mixture of oil and rock in a tank, is less expensive than molten nitrate salt TES, but is limited to low-temperature applications. However, this oil-rock TES has been proven successful for solar thermal applications. The selection of the type of TES depends on various factors such as the storage period (diurnal or seasonal), economic viability, operating conditions, etc. Zn this article, a study of TES systems (including materials) is presented particularly with solar thermal applications in mind. The evaluation of their performances, cost and economic viability, ease of installation, cleanliness, environmental impact, safety factors, technological usability and applicability are discussed.

AB  - GridPix is a gas-filled detector with an aluminium mesh stretched 50 m above the Timepix CMOS pixel chip. This defines a high electric field where gas amplification occurs. A feasibility study is ongoing at Nikhef for the application of the GridPix technology as a charge sensitive device in a dual phase noble gas Time Projection Chamber (TPC), within the framework of the DARWIN design study for next generation dark matter experiments. The smallness of the device and well defined materials allow for high radio-purity and low outgassing. The high granularity of a pixel readout and the high detection efficiency of single electrons of GridPix bring benefits especially in terms of energy resolution for small energy deposits. This feature is interesting also for the measurement of the scintillation yield and the ionisation yield of noble liquids. The accurate measurements of such quantities have a direct impact on the data interpretation of dark matter experiments. The application in dual phase argon or xenon TPCs implies several technological challenges, such as the survival of the device at cryogenic temperature as well as the operation in a pure noble gas atmosphere without discharges. We describe here the recent developments of the project.

AB  - We conducted a study of the peculiarities of the motor activity of juvenile and adult individuals of Daphnia magna in the process of thermal selection. On the example of Daphnia, we experimentally proved the assumption that the decrease in the motor activity of the ectotherms in the selected temperature range is a behaviour mechanism typical for thermal selection. The experiment was conducted on the offspring of one parthenogenetic female (pure line) of a laboratory culture maintained over several years at room temperature. The Daphnia individuals had been beforehand acclimated over several generations to 23.4 degrees C, and then were placed in a thermogradient apparatus. The control individuals were maintained at room temperature. The final temperature preference was determined using the so-called "chronic" method, when the tested organisms are maintained in a thermogradient apparatus over several days. The positions of the Daphnia individuals were recorded daily during 24 days. As a parameter which would characterize the motor activity of Daphnia, we used the parameter of average relative shifting, which was calculated as a difference (in cm) between the position they were found in two sequential records, divided by time (in min) between these records. Over the first 3 days, in the conditions of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia mostly selected heightened temperatures (24-28 degrees C). During the period from the 4th to 24th day, 74% of the Daphnia selected the range of 1823 degrees C and 85% -17-24 degrees C. Thus, the range of the ultimate selected temperatures decreased by 4 degrees C compared to the initially selected temperatures and enlarged by 3 degrees C towards the lower temperatures. In the thermogradient apparatus, the parthenogenetic females had the lowest value of the mean relative movement. In the control, at room temperature, this parameter of the adults was by 43% higher compared to the gradient. The pattern of the dynamic of the indicator in both variants of the experiment was similar for the periods and phases of fluctuations. With the juveniles the value of the parameter of mean relative shifting in the gradient was higher by 40% compared to the adult Daphnia, but close to the parameter of the adults in the control. We determined a relationship between the juveniles selecting the higher temperatures and higher mean relative shifting, which indicates a relationship between the behavioural selective reaction of juvenile Daphnia and general physiological condition of their organism. During the absence of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia were observed to show symmetry in their motor reaction. Occurrence of the asymmetry of the motor reaction of the Daphnia in the condition of the thermogradient, manifesting in the prevalence of shifting to lower or higher temperatures, can indicate more clearly manifested search reaction in the condition of a non-uniform environment.

AB  - Selection for secondary sexual trait (SST) elaboration may increase intralocus sexual conflict over the optimal values of traits expressed from shared genomes. This conflict can reduce female fitness, and the resulting gender load can be exacerbated by environmental stress, with consequences for a population's ability to adapt to novel environments. However, how the evolution of SSTs interacts with environment in determining female fitness is not well understood. Here, we investigated this question using replicate lines of bulb mites selected for increased or decreased prevalence of a male SST-thickened legs used as weapons. The fitness of females from these lines was measured at a temperature to which the mites were adapted (24 degrees C), as well as at two novel temperatures: 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. We found the prevalence of the SST interacted with temperature in determining female fecundity. At 28 degrees C, females from populations with high SST prevalence were less fecund than females from populations in which the SST was rare, but the reverse was true at 18 degrees C. Thus, a novel, environment does not universally depress female fitness more in populations with a high degree of sexually selected dimorphism. We discuss possible consequences of the interaction we detected for adaptation to novel environments.

AB  - Ice nucleation and ice repellence are properties which appear to be contradictory. Both are of great importance: The former for ice generation in the food and cooling industry and the latter for avoiding the adhesion of ice to structures. By mimicking a peculiar survival mechanism of some cold-adapted organisms a new type of coating system, able to both nucleate and repel the ice was developed. A heterogeneous surface containing locally isolated nucleation points in a low surface energy matrix were synthesised by a sol-gel process. The ice nucleating and ice releasing performance of the new ice nucleating coatings (INC) has been tested in a specially designed crystallisation chamber in comparison to commercial low surface energy coating systems. A mixture of demineralised water and a water freezing point depressant was used in the experiments. Compared to the commercial coatings, the INC surfaces showed a much higher ice nucleation rate but also a distinctly better ice releasing ability. Obviously the novel concept of local embedded nucleation points improves the ice repellent properties of surfaces.

AB  - Molecular technologies have enabled the generation of various transgenic insect strains for the area-wide control of agricultural pests and vectors of human diseases. Individual maintenance of several diverse transgenic lines or strains involves a lot of resources, and sometimes problems arise that threaten the strains being maintained. Here, we present a way to cost-effectively maintain transgenic lines or strains of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata by extending their generation time. Immature stages were kept at 20 degrees C instead of 28 degrees C, and the subsequent generation of transgenic flies kept at different temperatures were found to have laboratory fecundity comparable to the untreated transgenic flies. Extension of generation time offers inexpensive strain maintenance as it reduces the resources, time and energy spent on maintenance of transgenic medfly strains, in addition to minimizing exposure of strains to problems sometimes associated with strain maintenance.

AB  - To evaluate differences in growth and adaptability of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), we studied growth, polycyclism, needle tissue carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) as an estimate of water-use efficiency (WUE) and survival of seven populations at 10 years of age growing in a performance trial at a provenance test site in Escaroupim, Portugal. Six populations were from relatively high rainfall sites in Portugal and southwestern France (Atlantic group), and one Population was front a more and Mediterranean site in Spain. There were significant differences between some populations in total height, diameter at breast height, delta C-13 of bulk needle tissue, polycyclism and survival. A population from central Portugal (Leiria, on the Atlantic coast) was the tallest and had the lowest delta C-13. Overall, the variation in delta C-13 was better explained by the mean minimum temperatures of the coldest month than by annual precipitation at the place of origin. Analyses of the relationships between delta C-13 and growth Or Survival revealed a distinct pattern for the Mediterranean population, with low delta C-13 (and WUE) associated with the lowest growth potential and reduced survival. There were significant negative cot-relations between C and height or survival in the Atlantic group. Variation in polycyclism was correlated with annual precipitation at the place of origin. Some Atlantic populations maintained a high growth potential while experiencing moderate water stress. A detailed knowledge of the relationships between growth, survival and delta C-13 in contrasting environments will enhance our ability to select populations for forestry or conservation.

AB  - Green-sustainable approaches prompt urgent attention for recycling end-of-life spent solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs), which are candidates for next-generation energy storage systems. Here, we propose a green method of deformation-driven re-sintering (DDR) to recycle spent SSLBs with emphasis on garnet-type solid-state electrolyte (SSE) recovery. The recycled fine SSE particles via DDR provide sufficient sintering activity for grain fusion and promote Li absorption with the Li2O atmosphere. The severe deformation accelerates the phase transformation process from the tetragonal phase to cubic phase and inhibits the proton/lithium exchange process. The homogeneous distribution of Li-ions eliminates discontinuous connection areas, facilitating the establishment of fast ionic pathways. The critical current density of DDR-SSE reaches 1.24 mA.cm(-2 ), indicating a stable process of the stripping and plating lithium. SSLBs assembled by the DDR-SSE and LiFePO4 cathode show a superior cycling performance with a discharge capacity of 126.7 mAh.g(-1) and capacity retention of 89.7% after 400 cycles (0.5 C) at room temperature. The work firstly provides a feasible green-sustainable method for spent SSEs with high performances, promoting the environmental benignity and economic viability for the sustainable solution of resources.

AB  - In biological systems, expression dynamics that can provide fitted phenotype patterns with respect to a specific function have evolved through mutations. This has been observed in the evolution of proteins for realizing folding dynamics through which a target structure is shaped. We study this evolutionary process by introducing a statistical-mechanical model of interacting spins, where a configuration of spins and their interactions J represent a phenotype and genotype, respectively. The phenotype dynamics are given by a stochastic process with temperature T-S under a Hamiltonian with J. The evolution of J is also stochastic with temperature T-J and follows mutations introduced into J and selection based on a fitness defined for a configuration of a given set of target spins. Below a certain temperature T-S(c2), the interactions J that achieve the target pattern evolve, whereas another phase transition is observed at T-S(c1)< T-S(c2). At low temperatures T-S < T-S(c1), the Hamiltonian exhibits a spin-glass-like phase, where the dynamics toward the target pattern require long time steps, and the fitness often decreases drastically as a result of a single mutation to J. In the intermediate-temperature region, the dynamics to shape the target pattern proceed rapidly and are robust to mutations of J. The interactions in this region have no frustration around the target pattern and results in funnel-type dynamics. We propose that the ubiquity of funnel-type dynamics, as observed in protein folding, is a consequence of evolution subjected to thermal noise beyond a certain level; this also leads to mutational robustness of the fitness.

AB  - A fundamental assumption underlying the importance of genetic risks within conservation biology is that inbreeding increases the extinction probability of populations. Although inbreeding has been shown to have a detrimental impact on individual fitness, its contribution to extinction is still poorly understood. We have studied the consequences of different levels of prior inbreeding for the persistence of small populations using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. To this end, we determined the extinction rate of small vial populations differing in the level of inbreeding under both optimal and stress conditions, i.e. high temperature stress and ethanol stress. We show that inbred populations have a significantly higher short-term probability of extinction than non-inbred populations, even for low levels of inbreeding, and that the extinction probability increases with increasing inbreeding levels. In addition, we observed that the effects of inbreeding become greatly enhanced under stressful environmental conditions. More importantly, our results show that the impact of environmental stress becomes significantly greater for higher inbreeding levels, demonstrating explicitly that inbreeding and environmental stress are not independent but can act synergistically. These effects seem long lasting as the impact of prior inbreeding was still qualitatively the same after the inbred populations had been expanded to appreciable numbers and maintained as such for approximately 50 generations. Our observations have significant consequences for conservation biology.

AB  - The spatial scale at which climate and species' occupancy data are gathered, and the resolution at which ecological models are run, can strongly influence predictions of species performance and distributions. Running model simulations at coarse rather than fine spatial resolutions, for example, can determine if a model accurately predicts the distribution of a species. The impacts of spatial scale on a model's accuracy are particularly pronounced across mountainous terrain. Understanding how these discrepancies arise requires a modelling approach in which the underlying processes that determine a species' distribution are explicitly described. Here we use a process-based model to explore how spatial resolution, topography and behaviour alter predictions of a species thermal niche, which in turn constrains its survival and geographic distribution. The model incorporates biophysical equations to predict the operative temperature (T-e), thermal-dependent performance and survival of a typical insect, with a complex life-cycle, in its microclimate. We run this model with geographic data from a mountainous terrain in South Africa using climate data at three spatial resolutions. We also explore how behavioural thermoregulation affects predictions of a species performance and survival by allowing the animal to select the optimum thermal location within each coarse-grid cell. At the regional level, coarse-resolution models predicted lower T-e at low elevations and higher T-e at high elevations than models run at fine-resolutions. These differences were more prominent on steep, north-facing slopes. The discrepancies in T-e in turn affected estimates of the species thermal niche. The modelling framework revealed how spatial resolution and topography influence predictions of species distribution models, including the potential impacts of climate change. These systematic biases must be accounted for when interpreting the outputs of future modelling studies, particularly when species distributions are predicted to shift from uniform to topographically heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - Most research in physiological ecology has focused on the effects of mean changes in temperature under the classic "hot vs cold" acclimation treatment; however, current evidence suggests that an increment in both the mean and variance of temperature could act synergistically to amplify the negative effects of global temperature increase and how it would affect fitness and performance-related traits in ectothermic organisms. We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments were 20 degrees C +/- 0.1 SD (constant) and 20 degrees C +/- 1.5 SD (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Z(max)), and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the "vertical shift or faster-slower" hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second, there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by means of significant repeatability estimates.
   Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual organismal performance. We encourage the use of temperature fluctuation acclimation treatments to better understand the variability of physiological traits, which predict ecological and evolutionary responses to global change.

AB  - Steam production has a wide range of applications such as seawater desalination, waste sterilization, and power generation. The utilization of solar energy for this purpose has attracted much attention due to its inexhaustibility and pollution-free nature. Here, direct solar steam generation at low-concentrated solar power using plasmonic nanofluids containing gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was investigated experimentally. The key factors required for highly efficient solar steam generation, including Au NP concentration and solar power intensity, were studied in a simulated solar system by measuring the water weight loss and system temperature change. The best evaporation performance was obtained using a plasmonic nanofluid containing 178 ppm of Au NPs under 10 sun (1 sun =1 kW m(-2)) illumination intensity, and the total efficiency reached 65%. However, the total efficiency of pure water was only 16%, which means that the plasmonic nanofluids reached a similar to 300% enhancement in efficiency. Higher solar power led to a higher evaporation rate, higher specific vapor productivity (SVP), and higher Au NP concentrations resulted in better evaporation performance. Localized solar heating at the fluid-air interface was shown to contribute more to solar steam generation than to bulk fluid heating. Furthermore, the model of photothermal heating of plasmonic nanoparticle was established and the numerical results demonstrated the photothermal conversion process of plasmonic NPs from the light absorption to the heat dissipation into the bulk fluid.

AB  - In his PAA presidential address and corresponding article in Demography, David Lam (Demography 48: 1231-1262, 2011) documented the extraordinary progress of humankind-vis-a-vis poverty alleviation, increased schooling, and reductions in mortality and fertility-since 1960 and noted that he expects further improvements by 2050. However, although Lam briefly covered the problems of global warming and pollution, he did not address several other major environmental problems that are closely related to the rapid human population growth in recent decades and to the progress he described. This commentary highlights some of these problems to provide a more balanced perspective on the situation of the world. Specifically, humans currently are using resources at an unsustainable level. Groundwater depletion and overuse of river water are major problems on multiple continents. Fossil fuel resources and several minerals are being depleted. Other major problems include deforestation, with the annual forest clearing globally estimated to be an area the size of New York State; and species extinction, with rates estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times higher than background rates. Principles of ecological economics are presented that allow an integration of ecology and economic development and better potential for preservation of the world for future generations.

AB  - The optimization problem of an absolute radiometer's timing parameters is investigated for comparison experiments of Total Solar Irradiance Monitor (TSIM). Comparison experiments were performed to establish the TSIM's contact with other space radiometers for measuring total solar irradiance (TSI). Since the comparison experiments had to be performed on a tight schedule under the impact of weather conditions, the measurement parameters for the comparison experiments were selected carefully using optimized solutions of timing parameters. The optimized solutions were identified by a genetic algorithm (GA) based on a thermal model of an absolute radiometer. The thermal model includes terms of heat radiation, air conduction, etc. Fitness value function and constraints of GA are constructed using the thermal model. The experimental results indicate that the selected measurement parameters are sufficient to implement accurate calibration of TSI, providing more opportunities for solar observation.

AB  - A mortality rate higher than 90 % was observed in a larva-rearing facility for Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus, in China. Larvae showing clinical signs of infection were collected. Initial suspicion of nervous necrosis virus (NNV) infection was confirmed by sequencing, absolute quantification real-time PCR (A-qPCR), and electron microscopy. The nucleotide sequence of RNA2 was 1,375 bases long (GenBank no. KM576685), coding for a single ORF corresponding to the capsid protein from residues 21 to 1034. Phylogenetic analysis of the capsid protein sequence showed that PCNNV belongs to the barfin flounder NNV (BFNVV) genotype. An amino acid sequence alignment revealed 39 differences between the cold- and warm-resistant viral groups, suggesting that PCNNV evolved under temperature selection. The 3-D structure of the predicted capsid protein was modeled to identify potential epitopes, and the gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding a protein with a molecular mass of 55 kDa. During PCNNV outbreaks, the viral copy number was found to reach 10(7) per ng of total RNA, which could be considered the lethal copy number of NNV in cod. The gonads, eggs, fertilized eggs and asymptomatic cod fry were all positive for PCNNV, indicating viral vertical transmission as the main source of the viral load. The amount of virus in the apparent healthy fry or survivors seemed to decrease gradually with development. These results might lead to efficient diagnostic methods to help farmers select NNV-free broodfish for cod breeding.

AB  - 1. Changes in temperature disrupt the fluidity of cellular membranes, which can negatively impact membrane integrity and cellular processes. Many ectotherms, including Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen), adjust the glycerophospholipid composition of their membranes to restore optimal fluidity when temperatures change, a type of trait plasticity termed homeoviscous adaptation.
   2. Existing data suggest that plasticity in the relative abundances of the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) underlies cellular adaptation to temporal variability in the thermal environment. For example, laboratory populations of D. melanogaster evolved in the presence of temporally variable temperatures have greater developmental plasticity of the ratio of PE to PC (PE/PC) and greater fecundity than do populations evolved at constant temperatures.
   3. Here, we extend this work to natural populations of D. melanogaster by evaluating thermal plasticity of glycerophospholipid composition at different life stages, in genotypes isolated from Vermont, Indiana and North Carolina, USA. We also quantify the covariance between developmental and adult (reversible) plasticity, and between adult responses of the membrane to cool and warm thermal shifts.
   4. As predicted by physiological models of homeoviscous adaptation, flies from all populations decrease PE/PC and the degree of lipid unsaturation in response to warm temperatures. Furthermore, these populations have diverged in their degree of membrane plasticity. Flies from the most variable thermal environment (Vermont, USA) decrease PE/PC to a greater extent than do other populations when developed at a warm temperature, a pattern that matches our previous observation in laboratory-evolved populations. We also find that developmental plasticity and adult plasticity of PE/PC covary across genotypes, but that adult responses to cool and warm thermal shifts do not.
   5. When combined with our previous observations of laboratory-evolved populations, our findings implicate developmental plasticity of PE/PC as a mechanism of thermal adaptation in temporally variable environments. While little is known about the genetic bases of plastic responses to temperature, our observations suggest that both environmentally sensitive and environmentally specific alleles contribute to thermal adaptation of membranes and that costs of plasticity may arise when the adult environment differs from that experienced during development.

AB  - The temporal change of phenotypes during the adaptive process remains largely unexplored, as do the genetic changes that affect these phenotypic changes. Here we focused on three mutations that rose to high frequency in the early stages of adaptation within 12 Escherichia coli populations subjected to thermal stress (42 degrees C). All the mutations were in the rpoB gene, which encodes the RNA polymerase beta subunit. For each mutation, we measured the growth curves and gene expression (mRNAseq) of clones at 42 degrees C. We also compared growth and gene expression with their ancestor under unstressed (37 degrees C) and stressed conditions (42 degrees C). Each of the three mutations changed the expression of hundreds of genes and conferred large fitness advantages, apparently through the restoration of global gene expression from the stressed toward the prestressed state. These three mutations had a similar effect on gene expression as another single mutation in a distinct domain of the rpoB protein. Finally, we compared the phenotypic characteristics of one mutant, I572L, with two high-temperature adapted clones that have this mutation plus additional background mutations. The background mutations increased fitness, but they did not substantially change gene expression. We conclude that early mutations in a global transcriptional regulator cause extensive changes in gene expression, many of which are likely under positive selection for their effect in restoring the prestress physiology.

AB  - 1. We examined the effect of thermal acclimation on fighting success and underlying performance traits in the crayfish Cherax destructor. We tested the hypothesis that animals will be more successful when fighting at their acclimation temperature than at a colder or warmer temperature, and that changes in metabolic capacity underlie differences in behavioural performance.
   2. Thermal acclimation (to 20 degrees C and to 30 degrees C) had a significant effect on behavioural contests, and the likelihood of winning was significantly greater when individuals fought at their acclimation temperature against an individual from an alternate acclimation temperature.
   3. The ratio of ADP stimulated respiration to proton leak (respiratory control ratio) of isolated mitochondria increased significantly in chelae muscle of the cold-acclimated group, and differences in respiratory control ratio between winners and losers were significantly correlated with the outcome of agonistic encounters. However, acclimation did not affect tall muscle mitochondria or the activity of pyruvate kinase in either chelae or tail muscle.
   4. The force produced by closing chelae was thermally insensitive within acclimation groups, and there were no significant differences between acclimation treatments. None the less, differences in chelae width between contestants were significantly correlated with the outcome of agonistic encounters, but this perceived resource holding power did not reflect the actual power of force production.
   5. Thermal acclimation in C destructor has beneficial consequences for dominance and competitive ability, and the success of cold acclimated animals at the cold temperatures can be at least partly explained by concomitant up-regulation of oxidative ATP production capacity.

AB  - Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials (KIMM) investigated a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) cycle for a heat recovery power generation system for several years. The objective of the study focuses on the development of the technologies and the establishment of the development procedure of turbomachinery, heat exchangers, and auxiliary equipment for the sCO2 power cycle. A motor-driven centrifugal starter pump with an inducer is developed for startup operation. The main pump-drive turbine module adopts magnetic bearings as axial and radial bearings to remove oil lubrication and exhibits a hermetic structure to eliminate leakage problems. The power turbine and a generator are linked via a gearbox in the power turbine-generator module. An oil bearing and floating ring seal with dry gas injection are applied to minimize sCO2 leakage. The recuperator is developed as a printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) owing to its high efficiency and compactness.
   The integrated test facility is designed as a 250-kWe class sCO2 recuperated Rankine cycle to evaluate the performance of the core modules as opposed to demonstrating the viability of a particular sCO2 cycle. The test facility is proven to successfully operate in startup mode and self-sustaining mode using the starter pump and the main pump-drive turbine module. An overview of the operation of the startup mode and self-sustaining mode is presented.

AB  - This study is to analyze how to extend the sugar plants by a polygeneration technology to produce sugar, bioethanol, biogas and bioelectricity. The possibility of selling the bioelectricity to the national grid in Brazil is also investigated through optimizing the energy production at an industrial plant. The viability of the generation rates for renewable energy proposed by the regulatory bodies within the Brazilian electricity sector is analyzed. The plant's short-term planning was obtained by applying non-trivial optimal solutions that allow officials to choose the best alternative for planning production employing the most economical combinations of sugar, bioethanol, biogas, and electricity. We calculated the cost of exporting electricity to the electrical grid from January 2008 to December 2009, concluding that the spot market prices were too low to stimulate the sale of the bioelectricity to the electrical grid. Moreover, the remuneration guaranteed by the Brazilian Program of Incentives for Renewable Resources (PROINFA) was not sufficient to stimulate the sale of the bioelectricity. However, the price set by the Brazilian Electrical Regulating Agency (ANEEL) in the 2009 auction was sufficient to support exporting electricity for all the months except December 2009.

AB  - Following on from successful experimental trials employing ammonia/hydrogen blends in a model gas turbine combustor, with favorable NO. and unburned fuel emissions, a detailed numerical study has been undertaken to assess the viability of using steelworks by-product ammonia in gas turbines. Every metric ton (tonne) of steel manufactured using a blast furnace results in approximately 1.5 kg of by-product ammonia, usually present in a vapor form, from the cleansing of coke oven gas (COG). This study numerically investigates the potential to utilize this by-product for power generation. Ammonia combustion presents some major challenges, including poor reactivity and a propensity for excessive NO. emissions. Ammonia combustion has been shown to be greatly enhanced through the addition of support fuels, hydrogen and methane (both major components of COG). CHEMKIN-PRO is employed to demonstrate the optimal ratio of ammonia vapor, and alternatively anhydrous ammonia recovered from the vapor, to COG or methane at equivalence ratios between 1.0 and 1.4 under an elevated inlet temperature of 550K. Aspen Plus was used to design a Brayton-Rankine cycle with integrated recuperation, and overall cycle efficiencies were calculated for a range of favorable equivalence ratios, identified from the combustion models. The results have been used to specify a series of emissions experiments in a model gas turbine combustor.

AB  - Long-term changes in temperature can negatively affect human livelihoods with resulting implications for health outcomes. While increasing attention has been paid to the direct health consequences of climate change, there has been less focus on indirect health effects, partly due to the relative complexity of establishing and modeling these outcomes. Here, I leverage a dataset of over 400,000 individuals across 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, coupled with high-resolution climate data for the region, to test the effect of long-run temperature changes on HIV prevalence. I find that warmer periods are linked with an increase in HIV prevalence, particularly for younger generations. Both economic and behavioral changes likely drive this linkage: I find evidence that male migration and sex-market use increase with higher temperatures. I generate projections for future HIV prevalence using two methods. First, I project directly using the empirical estimate, an approach frequently used in econometric studies of climate change impacts. Second, I develop a mechanistic model of HIV spread, incorporating the estimated temperature effect. I find that agreement between the models is strong (77%). Under the RCP8.5 scenario for warming, I find that climate change will lead to between 11.6 and 16.0 million additional cases of HIV by 2050, an increase in prevalence of 1.4-2.1 percentage points.

AB  - Thigh skin temperature was studied during bicycle ergometry graded exercise by means of Infrared Functional Imaging (IRFI). Executing of graded exercise determined a decreasing of the skin temperature throughout the exercise period, while it increased during the after-exercise recovery. Skin cooling and warming processes depended on the fitness level of the subjects, as estimated by the maximal oxygen consumption. IRFI permitted to record skin temperature time evolution of different regions involved in the exercise. IRFI may provide indirect complementary information about the hemodynamic recruitment by the muscular masses and the thermal processes associated with the exercise.

AB  - The presented method selects optimal inputs for compensation models based on the Thermal Adaptive Learning Control methodology. The number of inputs and the individual inputs for each considered thermal error are automatically adapted. The intelligent combination of k-means clustering and Time Series Cluster Kernel enables the approach to handle time series of thermal error measurements with missing data due to operational reasons. The results show that the adaptive sensor selection approach, tested on a 5-axis-machine tool, significantly increases the robustness of the used compensation model. The productivity loss due to on-machine measurements is reduced by approximately 40 percent. (C) 2020 CIRP. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genetic Algorithms (GA) are adaptive search algorithms based on the theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest. In this study, GA was used to derive a thermal compact model of a micro lead frame package. The GA derived model was then used to compute the junction temperature (T-j) of the package for various boundary conditions. The results obtained were checked against simulation results of a detailed thermal model and were found to be within +/- 1.5% of error. Computational time taken by the detailed finite element model required approximately 4 min whereas the GA derived model took less than 35 s to generate the T-j of the package. Further, the study shows the feasibility and potential of applying GA as a powerful tool for optimization.

AB  - The thermal physiology determines the whole biology of ectotherm organisms, by limiting their acquisition and allocation of resources. Herein, we aim to add knowledge on how different species use the thermal resources when they coexist in a habitat, studying the thermal physiology of three sympatric and syntopic liolaemid lizards, Phymaturus querque, Phymaturus zapalensis, and Liolaemus elongatus during the summer season. We measured the body temperatures at capture places, the operative microenvironmental temperatures in the field, and the preferred body temperature in an experimental thermal gradient in the laboratory. We found that the three species are thermoregulators, selecting cooler thermal microenvironments than the ones expected by chance, and even cooler than the temperatures they selected in a laboratory environment. Liolaemus elongatus is a more efficient thermoregulator (E = 0.671) than the two Phymaturus species, P. querque (E = 0.441) and P. zapalensis (E = 0.471), which are moderate thermoregulators and, apparently, specialists in finding specific types of shelters, since they seem to select certain types of rock crevices. Herein, we found that during the summer season, although individuals have access to warm microenvironments, they spend time on cool refuges, probably to prevent overheating. This highlights the importance of an adequate spatial distribution of operative temperatures (T-e), more than just a mere availability of appropriate temperatures.

AB  - Cobia Rachycentron canadum is a marine finfish species with emerging global potential for mariculture. Positive culture attributes include capacity for natural and induced tank spawning, growth rates in excess of 6 kg/year, high disease resistance, high survival rates (post-larviculture stage) in tanks and net pens, adaptability to commercially available extruded diets, and high-quality fillets suitable for the sashimi as well as white tablecloth restaurant markets. Nonetheless, cobia production faces several bottlenecks limiting industrial expansion including limitations in fingerling production per unit volume. This paper will provide an overview of production limitations, and focus on recent spawning and larviculture research results and ongoing research initiatives. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We analyzed a mathematical model of in vitro evolution conducted by repetition of mutagenesis and selection processes. The selection process consists of the selective enrichment and subsequent sampling as follows: each mutant with fitness W is amplified by the Boltzmann factor exp(rW/k(B)T(the)), where the fitness W is defined as the negative Gibbs free energy (-Delta G) in a reaction of the phenotypic molecules and r is the round number of the selective enrichment; then, an arbitrary mutant is randomly chosen from the resulting mutant population and it becomes a new parent in the next generation. As a result, we found that the evolutionary dynamics is described in a mathematical framework similar to thermodynamics: the "evolution constant" k(E) and "evolutionary temperature" T-evo play key roles similar to the Boltzmann constant k(B) and thermodynamic temperature T-the, respectively. In the stationary state of the evolutionary dynamics, the attractor of the fitness is in inverse proportion to k(E)T(evo). Furthermore, beyond the mathematical analogy, we obtained a biophysical connection between evolutionary dynamics and thermodynamics. Particularly, we found that T-evo and T-the are connected by k(E)T(evo) approximate to k(B)T(the)/2r. These results suggest that we can predict the fitness value in the stationary state by the thermodynamic temperature T-the in the experimental setup. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biogas has emerged as an alternative renewable fuel to natural gas. However, the presence of trace contaminants and large quantities of CO2 in biogas necessitates its purification and upgrading to increase its calorific value. Different technologies have been developed to upgrade biogas to biomethane. Among these, chemical absorption is commonly employed due to its high process efficiency and less solvent requirement due to high selectivity compared to physical absorption. However, the chemical decomposition of amine-based solvents, toxicological impact, high plant maintenance costs, high enthalpy of reaction, and corrosivity associated with chemical absorption limit its large-scale application. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have garnered attention as alternative absorption media to conventional solvents. ILs have a high CO2 uptake, thermal stability, and negligible vapor pressure. Recent process simulation studies featuring ILs as solvents for biogas upgrading reveal the suitability of these approaches as alternatives to laborious experimental work to assess the practical, technical, and economic viability of ILs. As per the authors' knowledge, this is the first review comparing biogas upgrading technologies from a technical, environmental, and economic perspective. Primarily, studies relating to IL-based biogas upgrading are considered, and challenges associated with the large-scale adoption of ILs as absorption media are discussed. Process simulations and techno-economic assessments of IL-based biogas upgrading techniques are presented. A conceptual design approach is proposed for the successful scale-up of IL-based biogas upgrading. Based on results, deep eutectic solvents are recommended as next-generation solvents for absorption as technical and economic aspects are found superior to conventional amines and ionic liquids.

AB  - A number of geophysical arguments point out the possibility that global mantle convection could have been extremely sluggish or even absent during a large part of Martian history. This implies that early mantle thermal anomalies produced during planetary formation might not have been quickly erased by vigorous convection. One likely mechanism of early thermal inhomogeneity is large impacts at the end of heavy bombardment. We suggest that Tharsis province might be related to such an impact-induced thermal anomaly rather than a convective plume. The shape of the present-day geoid for our preferred model is in good agreement with the geoid measured by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).

AB  - Gene expression is known to be highly responsive to the environment and important for adjustment of metabolism but there is also growing evidence that differences in gene regulation contribute to species divergence and differences among locally adapted populations. However, most studies so far investigated populations when divergence had already occurred. Selection acting on expression levels at the onset of adaptation to an environmental change has not been characterized. Understanding the mechanisms is further complicated by the fact that environmental change is often multivariate, meaning that organisms are exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously with potentially interactive effects. Here we use a novel approach by combining fitness and whole-transcriptome data in a large-scale experiment to investigate responses to drought, heat and their combination in Tribolium castaneum. We found that fitness was reduced by both stressors and their combined effect was almost additive. Expression data showed that stressor responses were acting independently and did not interfere physiologically. Since we measured expression and fitness within the same individuals, we were able to estimate selection on gene expression levels. We found that variation in fitness can be attributed to gene expression variation and that selection pressures were environment dependent and opposite between control and stress conditions. We could further show that plastic responses of expression were largely adaptive, i.e. in the direction that should increase fitness.
   Author summary
   During environmental change organisms are exposed to several stressors simultaneously to which they can show plastic and evolutionary responses. Gene regulation can play a crucial role in both processes. Measuring gene expression gives us detailed insights into underlying molecular pathways, relative importance of different stressors and how they may interfere with each other in combination. However, it is challenging to understand how plastic responses are ultimately linked to fitness and adaptation. We combined measurements of a fitness component (offspring number) with gene expression data to study responses of the model organism T. castaneum (red flour beetle) to single and joint effects of drought and heat. Higher temperatures resulted in a stronger reduction of offspring number and a larger number of differently expressed genes compared to reduced humidity. We could show that stressors affected different physiological processes and consequently responses did not show much modification in combination. Combining fitness and transcriptomic data of the same individuals enabled us to estimate selection on gene expression levels. We found that selection under control conditions (to which the beetles are adapted) was in general opposite to selection under the new, stressful conditions and that large parts of the response to heat were adaptive.

AB  - Alkyl xanthates are by far the most widely used collectors in the froth flotation beneficiation of base metal sulfide and precious metal ores. However, the commercial xanthate production process suffers from low yield, low productivity, poor containment and environmental pollution. To address these issues, an effective method was developed for the synthesis of xanthates using carbon disulfide as both a reactant and the solvent. This study involved the optimization of various process parameters, including solvent dosage, temperature, caustic alkali particle size, and agitation speed, to intensify the conversion of sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) and elucidate the reaction kinetics. The results indicated that carbon disulfide leads to a higher yield and better purity than solvents such as dichloromethane, petroleum ether, acetone, and water. Moreover, the addition of solvent allows the synthesis of high-purity xanthates by employing commercial grainy/sheet caustic soda as the raw material without further pulverization. The rate of the xanthation reaction was controlled by the rate of diffusion through the product layer, and the apparent activation energy was calculated to be 15 kJ.mol(-1). In addition, the thermal behavior of xanthate synthesis in a medium was monitored in a 2 L reaction calorimeter (RC1e) under the optimal conditions. Finally, a pilot-plant process was conducted in a 4000 L stainless-steel-jacketed reactor. The results demonstrated that xanthate production using excess carbon disulfide as a self-solvent gave excellent yield (>95%) and purity (>90%), whereas the kneader approach provided SIBX in only a 91% yield and 84% purity. Furthermore, this technology has widespread adaptability for the preparation of C-2 to C-8 xanthates. Compared with the traditional kneader approach, this new synthesis technology completely eliminates the required pulverization of caustic alkali, intensifies mass and heat transfer via the solvent, raises the productivity and improves the manufacturing environment, offering an effective and promising approach for the clean production of xanthates.

AB  - Live fish waterless transport strategy for the purpose of consumption or ornament is a novel technology, which can implement the larger volume transportation with high survival results as well as less wastewater pollution. The aim of this study was to establish an accurate survival prediction system based on the least physiological stress variations in different temperature ranges, which statistically analyzes the trend of key stress factors under the well life-supported temperatures to improve the final survival result. Furthermore, the accuracy of survival prediction can be adaptively and dynamically improved in consideration of the historical survival series in different seasons. In order to verify the practicability and performance of the system, Paralichthys olivaceus was selected as experimental subjects to carry out dynamic survival prediction experiments for over 30 hours waterless transportation, and the accuracy of the survival prediction system has verified over 97.2% in 0.5-2.5C degrees, which show that mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) by less than 0.2 and 0.07 to produce the most accurate estimation in the comparison. The development of this survival prediction system can significantly optimize the current waterless delivery management by reducing the potential mortality and providing the managerial references for industrialization of the live fish waterless logistics.

AB  - We outline the strategy and constraints adopted for the design of medium-power lead-alloy-cooled actinide-burning reactors that strive for a lower cost than accelerator-driven systems and for robust safety. Reduced cost is pursued through the use of (1) a modular design and maximum power rating to capitalize on an economy of scale within the constraints imposed by modularity, (2) a very compact and simple supercritical-CO2 power cycle, and (3) simplifications of the primary system allowed by the use of lead coolant. Excellent safety is pursued by adopting the integral fast reactor approach of achieving a self-controllable reactor that responds to all key abnormal occurrences, including anticipated transients without scrams, by a safe shutdown without exceeding core integrity limits. The three concepts developed are the fertile-free actinide burner for incineration of all transuranics from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel, the fertile-free minor actinide (MA) burner for preferential burning of MAs working in tandem with LWRs or gas-cooled thermal reactors, and the actinide burner with thorium fuel aimed also at reducing the electricity generation costs through longer-cycle operation.

AB  - Aphelinus mali (Haldeman) is an effective natural enemy of woolly apple aphid (WAA), Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann). Previous studies have found that, with WAA from Shandong Province (Qingdao) as the host, there are significant differences in various biological characteristics between a Shandong clade and Liaoning clade of A. mali. The ability of the Shandong clade to control this aphidwas significantly higher than that of the Liaoning clade in Shandong Province. In order to determine whether differences were caused by better adaptation of the Shandong parasitoid clade to the population of the host in that province or if it represents a more general fitness of this clade to control the host regardless of location, we compared the same parasitoid clades with hosts from Hebei Province. We found no significant differences in the developmental threshold temperature, effective accumulated temperature, fecundity, longevity, and oviposition period of the two clades, but the duration of host searching of the Shandong clade was significantly longer than that of the Liaoning clade. The instantaneous attack rate, the control ability (a/Th), the search parameter (Q) of the Shandong clade (0.0946, 0.543, 0.0725) of A. mali were higher than that of the Liaoning clade (0.0713, 0.382, 0.0381), and therefore, with WAA from Hebei Province as the host, the host adaptability of the Shandong clade of A. mali was not worse than that of the Liaoning clade, while the pest control ability of the Shandong clade was still greater than that of the Liaoning clade.

AB  - Recombinant retroviruses offer many advantages for the genetic modification of human hematepoietic cells, although their use in clinical protocols has thus far given disappointing results. There is therefore an important need to develop new strategies that will allow effectively transduced primitive hematopoietic target populations to be both rapidly characterized and isolated free of residual nontransduced but biologically equivalent cells. To address this need, we constructed a murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based retroviral vector containing the 228-bp coding sequence of the murine heat-stable antigen (HSA) and generated helper virus-free amphotropic MSCV-HSA producer cells by transfection of GP-env AM12 packaging cells. Light density and, in some cases, lineage marker-negative (lin(-)) normal human marrow or mobilized peripheral blood cells preactivated by exposure to interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and Steel factor in vitro for 48 hours were then infected by cocultivation with these MSCV-HSA producer cells for a further 48 hours in the presence of the same cytokines. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the cells 24 hours later showed 21% to 41% (mean, 27%) of those that were still CD34(+) to have acquired the ability to express HSA, The extent of gene transfer to erythroid and granulopoietic progenitors (burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage), as assessed by the ability of these cells to form colonies of mature progeny in the presence of normally toxic concentrations of G418, averaged 11% and 12%, respectively, in 6 experiments. These values could be increased to 100% and 77%, respectively, by prior isolation of the CD34(+)HSA(+) cell fraction and were correspondingly decreased to an average of 2% and 5%, respectively, in the CD34(+)HSA(-) cells. In addition, the extent of gene transfer to long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) was assessed by G418 resistance. The average gene transfer to LTC-IC-derived colony-forming cells in the unsorted population was less than or equal to 7% in 4 experiments. FACS selection of the initially CD34(+)HSA(+) cells increased this value to 86% and decreased it to 3% for the LTC-IC plated from the CD34(+)HSA(-) cells. Transfer of HSA gene expression to a phenotypically defined more primitive subpopulation of CD34(+) cells, ie, those expressing little or no CD38, could also be shown by FACS analysis of infected populations 24 hours after infection. These findings underscore the potential use of retroviral vectors encoding HSA for the specific identification and nontoxic selection immediately after infection of retrovirally transduced populations of primitive human hematopoietic cells. In addition, such vectors should facilitate the subsequent tracking of their marked progeny using multiparameter flow cytometry. (C) 1996 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB  - Since the Brazilian Sugarcane Mills have adopted the practice of mechanized harvesting, the large amounts of straw mulching on the soil surface have become an important issue to be investigated. This residue represents a valuable feedstock for 2nd generation ethanol production and bioelectricity cogeneration while could be left in the field for agronomic purposes. In the present study, we assess the temporal variability of moisture content, soil temperature and sugarcane yield in response to different amounts of straw mulching (SM), along two seasons (2014/2015 and 2015/2016) in three important locations of sugarcane expansion areas in Brazil. The treatments were bare soil, 50% and 100% straw mulch(SM) and dielectric sensors MPS-2 measured soil water potential and temperature every 6 hours at a depth of 0.20 m.SM suppressed soil temperature during the initial crop development (regrowth); water storage was improved by SM and enhanced the soil moisture maintenance, which in dry periods (early harvest) is essential to the crop establishment; sugarcane yield increased in response to 100 SM in clayey soils, with amounts above 14.9 Mg ha(-1)of SM; no increase in sugarcane yield was observed in sandy soil with amounts below 9.2 Mg ha(-1)of SM.

AB  - We examined latitudinal variation in adult and larval heat tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster from eastern Australia. Adults were assessed using static and ramping assays. Basal and hardened static heat knockdown time showed significant linear clines; heat tolerance increased towards the tropics, particularly for hardened flies, suggesting that tropical populations have a greater hardening response. A similar pattern was evident for ramping heat knockdown time at 0.06 degrees C min-1 increase. There was no cline for ramping heat knockdown temperature (CTmax) at 0.1 degrees C min-1 increase. Acute (static) heat knockdown temperature increased towards temperate latitudes, probably reflecting a greater capacity of temperate flies to withstand sudden temperature increases during summer in temperate Australia. Larval viability showed a quadratic association with latitude under heat stress. Thus, patterns of heat resistance depend on assay methods. Genetic correlations in thermotolerance across life stages and evolutionary potential for critical thermal limits should be the focus of future studies.

AB  - A model composed of two straight lines describes the relation between overwintering spring adults of Colorado potato beetle [Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)] and potato yield. Potato vines (Solanum tubersoum (L.), cv. 'Superior') had a damage boundary of around 5.8 spring adults per plant. However, under conditions favorable for reproduction, overwintering adults of 0.07 beetles per plant would produce a large population of first-generation larvae that would reduce considerably the potato yield if not controlled. There is no appreciable seasonal overlapping between adults and young larvae in the field. Monitoring activities should therefore be directed at the beginning of the season against overwintering adults and later against first-generation larvae. For summer adults, an action threshold of 10 per plant is proposed.

AB  - Neuronal activity is temperature sensitive and affects behavioral traits important for individual fitness, such as locomotion and courtship. Yet, we do not know enough about the evolutionary response of neuronal phenotypes in new temperature environments. Here, we use long-term experimental evolution of Drosophila simulans populations exposed to novel temperature regimes. Here, we demonstrate a direct relationship between thermal selective pressure and the evolution of neuronally expressed molecular and behavioral phenotypes. Several essential neuronal genes evolve lower expression at high temperatures and higher expression at low temperatures, with dopaminergic neurons standing out by displaying the most consistent expression change across independent replicates. We functionally validate the link between evolved gene expression and behavioral changes by pharmacological intervention in the experimentally evolved D. simulans populations as well as by genetically triggered expression changes of key genes in D. melanogaster. As natural temperature clines confirm our results for Drosophila and Anopheles populations, we conclude that neuronal dopamine evolution is a key factor for temperature adaptation.

AB  - To examine the role of impacts in the evolution of asteroids as seen through their chondritic offspring, we have performed a quantitative three dimensional (3D) study of metal grains in a suite of increasingly shocked L chondrites with synchrotron X-ray microtomography (XMT). Our data allow rigorous quantification of size-number distributions and collective morphology of Fe(Ni) metal phases in chondritic meteorites. At the resolution of our XMT measurements (8.4-17.9 mu m/voxel), the number of metal particles increase with higher degrees of petrographically identified shock loading, indicating a coalescing of Fe-Ni metal at or below this scale. Our results demonstrate that collective degrees of metal grain preferred orientation increase with greater degrees of impact-related compaction and shock loading. Ductile metal grains in L chondrites begin to show foliation at peak shock pressures < 5 GPa, pressures great enough to compact and indurate loosely bound chondritic material, and Our results Constitute evidence for multiple generations of impact events acting on the L parent body or bodies.

AB  - The genetic differentiation of teak meta-population in India was investigated in relation to geographical and climatic variations employing dominant ISSR markers followed by Bayesian statistical analysis to understand adaptability of the species. The analysis based on 290 teak genotypes representing 29 locations of its natural distribution and 43 ISSR loci exhibited an insignificant structure and low 2.76% LD (>= 0.1 R-2 values, p < 0.001) in teak meta-population. The genetic and geographical variables despite acting independently with each other resulted in three sub-population clusters in the meta-population. The geographical barrier played a significant role in direction/restriction of gene flow. The integration of spatial/climatic variables altered the clustering pattern of the teak meta-population with signature of the adaptation to the temperature and longitudinal gradients that was also verified by the similar adaptation pattern of meta-population towards predicted global climate modeling for year 2050. The findings can help tackle the sustainable management and conservation of the species and its survival quotient in threat of changing climatic conditions.

T2  - IEE PROCEEDINGS-GENERATION TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION
LA  - English
KW  - POWER
AB  - The commercial viability of wind-driven embedded renewable generation (ERG) projects is sensitive lo connection costs. These costs vary with the voltage level at which the ERG is connected; generally the higher the voltage, the higher the cost. Windfarm developers of ERG therefore prefer to connect at lower voltages. However, because distribution networks are normally limited by permissible voltage fluctuations rather than by thermal considerations, network operators prefer to connect ERG at higher voltages where their overall impact on voltage profiles is minimal. This conflict of objectives between ERG developers and network operators is usually settled through simple deterministic load flow studies, usually based on one critical case representing conditions of minimum load and maximum ERG output. Such studies only consider extreme events and do not take into account the likelihood of these events occurring. However, new European standards describe voltage characteristics in statistical terms. Although these standards are not intended for use in assessing the level of penetration of ERG, they point to statistical and probabilistic approaches as the way forward in such assessments. This is particularly important for wind generation because of its: stochastic output. Two simple wind speed models based on the Markov modelling technique are presented, which may be used to evaluate the impact of windfarms. The models give satisfactory results when applied to the evaluation of voltage profiles in distribution networks. The probability density function of voltage call be obtained and used in assessing the level of ERG that might be accepted on an existing network. A 281-node generic distribution system model based on a real network is used to illustrate the application of the proposed models.

AB  - A typical industrial thermal processing operation has multifold complexity, with varying charge dimensions, multiple grades and inconsistent loading patterns as well as the absence of in situ sensors. These operational characteristics and restrictions invariably lead to empirical design for the temperature time cycles, which often results in suboptimal operation in terms of higher energy consumption, inconsistent quality and lower productivity. In the present work, a process model is proposed for designing the heating cycles for bundles of packed rods with different rod diameters, bundle diameters and packing fractions in a continuous annealing furnace. The process model has the capability of predicting spatial and temporal evolution of temperature and hardness in the bundle as it traverses through the furnace. Interestingly, the model based process cycles are found to be counterintuitive as compared with the empirically designed cycles normally employed in the plant. It is shown that instead of designing the process cycles on the basis of rod diameters, which is the general practice in the plant, it should be based on bundle characteristics, such as bundle diameter and packing fraction. These concepts have been implemented in an industrial operation resulting in around 20% energy reduction and 15% productivity enhancement.

AB  - Space conditioning, and cooling in particular, is a key factor in human productivity and well-being across the globe. During the 21st century, global cooling demand is expected to grow significantly due to the increase in wealth and population in sunny nations across the globe and the advance of global warming. The same locations that see high demand for cooling are also ideal for electricity generation via photovoltaics (PV). Despite the apparent synergy between cooling demand and PV generation, the potential of the cooling sector to sustain PV generation has not been assessed on a global scale. Here, we perform a global assessment of increased PV electricity adoption enabled by the residential cooling sector during the 21st century. Already today, utilizing PV production for cooling could facilitate an additional installed PV capacity of approximately 540 GW, more than the global PV capacity of today. Using established scenarios of population and income growth, as well as accounting for future global warming, we further project that the global residential cooling sector could sustain an added PV capacity between 20-200 GW each year for most of the 21st century, on par with the current global manufacturing capacity of 100 GW. Furthermore, we find that without storage, PV could directly power approximately 50% of cooling demand, and that this fraction is set to increase from 49% to 56% during the 21st century, as cooling demand grows in locations where PV and cooling have a higher synergy. With this geographic shift in demand, the potential of distributed storage also grows. We simulate that with a 1 m3 water-based latent thermal storage per household, the fraction of cooling demand met with PV would increase from 55% to 70% during the century. These results show that the synergy between cooling and PV is notable and could significantly accelerate the growth of the global PV industry.

AB  - Ocean warming and acidification driven by anthropogenic carbon emissions pose an existential threat to marine calcifying communities. A similar perturbation to global carbon cycling and ocean chemistry occurred similar to 56 Ma during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), but microfossil records of the marine biotic response are distorted by sediment mixing. Here, we use the carbon isotope excursion marking the PETM to distinguish planktic foraminifer shells calcified during the PETM from those calcified prior to the event and then isotopically filter anachronous specimens from the PETM microfossil assemblages. We find that nearly one-half of foraminifer shells in a deep-sea PETM record from the central Pacific (Ocean Drilling Program Site 865) are reworked contaminants. Contrary to previous interpretations, corrected assemblages reveal a transient but significant decrease in tropical planktic foraminifer diversity at this open-ocean site during the PETM. The decrease in local diversity was caused by extirpation of shallow- and deep-dwelling taxa as they underwent extratropical migrations in response to heat stress, with one prominent lineage showing signs of impaired calcification possibly due to ocean acidification. An absence of subbotinids in the corrected assemblages suggests that ocean deoxygenation may have rendered thermocline depths uninhabitable for some deeper-dwelling taxa. Latitudinal range shifts provided a rapid-response survival mechanism for tropical planktic foraminifers during the PETM, but the rapidity of ocean warming and acidification projected for the coming centuries will likely strain the adaptability of these resilient calcifiers.

AB  - Ships and boats may transport whole communities of non-indigenous species (NIS) through hull biofouling, some members of which may become invasive. Several studies have evaluated the diversity of these communities, but very few have analyzed the survival of organisms after their voyages into different and potentially inhospitable conditions. This factor is important to consider because the last port of call approach for risk assessments assumes that if the conditions observed in the last port of call are different from those observed in a receiving port, risks are diminished or null. Using an innovative experimental system, we tested the survival and recovery of the marine blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by exposing them to adverse salinity conditions at varying temperatures to simulate ships and boats transiting to ports or marinas with contrasting environmental conditions. Both mussel species, which are well-known for their adaptability to new environments as aquatic NIS, survived better at colder temperatures, with blue mussels surviving up to 14 days in freshwater, and zebra mussels up to 8 days in marine water. This highlights the importance of considering the resistance of fouling organisms to adverse conditions in vector and species risk assessments.

AB  - Governments across Europe have ambitious visions for the construction sector sector. For example, in the UK, as part of the Clean Growth Grand Challenge within the Governments Industrial Strategy, we are aiming to halve the energy use of new buildings by 2030; delivering new construction assets at a third of the cost and significantly quicker; provide assets that are cheaper to run, smarter, safer with lower emissions; and ultimately create cleaner air. As part of this deal and the wider The 'Construction Sector Deal' sets out an ambitious partnership between the industry and Government that aims to transform the sector's productivity through innovative technologies and a more highly skilled workforce aims to transform the efficiency of construction techniques through digital technologies like Business Information Modelling; reduce running costs through energy generation and storage technologies; and conduct research and development and demonstration programmes supporting innovations. The core aim of the project is to seamlessly combine four integrated layers with high structural performance, which would provide high levels of insulation, a healthy indoor environment, high aesthetic value, along with CO2 capture, and greywater management. The competitive advantage of the Green INSTRUCT panel is (1) sustainable and cost effective - using more than 70% wt. C&DW including concrete, bricks, plastic, metals; (2) safety and energy efficiency - meeting Eurocode standards for fire safety, thermal insulation with U-value of 0.14 W/m(2).K and acoustic insulation coefficient under 60dB and (3) Customisation potential - multi-layered, modular & prefabricated building block for new and old building. This paper will discuss key project achievements in terms of material development and innovation and challenges faced so far during the project.

AB  - Numerous animal lineages have maternally inherited symbionts that are required for host reproduction and growth. Endosymbionts also pose a risk to their hosts because of the mutational decay of their genomes through genetic drift or to selfish mutations that favor symbiont fitness over host fitness. One model for heritable endosymbiosis is the association of aphids with their obligate bacterial symbiont, Buchnera. We experimentally established heteroplasmic pea aphid matrilines containing pairs of closely related Buchnera haplotypes and used deep sequencing of diagnostic markers to measure haplotype frequencies in successive host generations. These frequencies were used to estimate the effective population size of Buchnera within hosts (i.e., the transmission bottleneck size) and the extent of within-host selection. The within-host effective population size was in the range of 10 to 20, indicating a strong potential for genetic drift and fixation of deleterious mutations. Remarkably, closely related haplotypes were subject to strong within-host selection, with selection coefficients as high as 0.5 per aphid generation. In one case, the direction of selection depended on the thermal environment and went in the same direction as between-host selection. In another, a new mutant haplotype had a strong within-host advantage under both environments but had no discernible effect on host-level fitness under laboratory conditions. Thus, within-host selection can be strong, resulting in a rapid fixation of mutations with little impact on host-level fitness. Together, these results show that within-host selection can drive evolution of an obligate symbiont, accelerating sequence evolution.

AB  - Bay of Bengal is a shallow marine basin exposed to seasonal fluctuation in precipitation and run-off. Thus, salinity, temperature, nutrient and productivity vary along the latitudinal and onshore-offshore gradient in the Bay of Bengal. These parameters directly affect primary productivity, including that of dinoflagellate cysts. The spatial distribution of organic walled dinoflagellates cyst is studied in the 50 surface samples of eight transects from the western Bay of Bengal, to infer variation in the environmental conditions in the region. The cyst diversity consists of 40 taxa with an overall high dominance of protoperidinioid cysts over gonyalaucoides. Based on the study distinct onshore and offshore dinocyst assemblages are identified. The high productive coastal upwelling region is characterised by the dominance of gonyalaucoid dinocyst species Bitectatodinium spongium (Zonneveld 1997) Zonneveld and Jurkschat 1999 indicating its adaptability to the fluctuating salinity and high nutrient conditions. The outer shelf to middle slope regions of western Bay of Bengal is dominated by the protoperidinioid species. This is in contrast to the gonyalaucoid dinocyst assemblages of the outer shelf to middle slope regions in other oceans. Since protoperidinioids prefer high nutrient and reducing environmental conditions for growth and preservation, their presence suggest high nutrient availability due to the river discharge and low oxygen condition in the slope region in Bay of Bengal. Statistical analyses of the sea surface parameters and dinoflagellate cyst abundance data indicate that salinity and silicates as a major source of nutrient played a major role in the distribution of dinoflagellate cyst in the Bay of Bengal.

AB  - Utilizing the potential and untapped productivity of the sea through the development of stock enhancement technology has a long history in Japan. In 1997, of the 88 species of seed produced in Japan by 284 facilities, 73 species were released. The total numbers of finfish seeds produced and released were 97 million from 36 species, and 71 million from 30 species, respectively. Over 10 million seed were produced for each of three finfish species: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and red sea bream (Pagrus major), which have been developed throughout Japan, and black sea bream (Acanthopagrus schlegeli), which has been developed only in the Seto Inland Sea region and the Japan Sea region.
   Steady progress made by stock enhancement programs, based on the release of hatchery-raised juveniles, has highlighted the importance of physiological, morphological, and ecological characteristics of the hatchery-raised juveniles in the effectiveness of the release operations. Fish health (or physiological wellness) and fish quality (or ecological robustness, described in terms of behavior and feeding activity) determine the ability of hatchery-raised juveniles to adapt to natural conditions in released environments. The releasing time, which is dependent upon the spawning time, is another important factor affecting the recovery rate of released hatchery-raised seed. Technological development of broodstock management is in induced spawning techniques, including manipulating temperature and photoperiod.
   Technological development of seed production in Japan has shifted its focus from quantity to quality, since health and adaptability of hatchery-raised seed are the most important factors determining the recovery rate. As a result, the focus of development of stock enhancement technology for the Japanese flounder and red sea bream is on raising the quality of health and the adaptability of the seeds.

AB  - Climate variability and change are currently recognised global challenges. However, the impacts of rising temperatures may be greatest on tropical freshwater fish, which already exist in warm environments and may be living close to their critical thermal maximum. However, there is limited species-specific information on tropical species' adaptive capacity to increased temperature. This study examined various growth attributes in juvenile populations (farmed, L. Kacheera and L. Nabisojjo) of a critically endangered tropical Oreochromis esculentus to determine its adaptive potential. Fish were acclimated at 25, 28, 31 and 34 degrees C for 28 days. Overall, survival rates were high. Growth coefficient b was not significantly different from three (b = 3) in all treatments, implying isometric growth. The specific growth rates (SGRs), body condition K, and hepato-somatic indices (his) declined as the acclimation temperatures increased. Although SGR showed significant variations only among populations, the highest in L. Nabisojjo, K and HSI showed significant variations among treatments. Overall, the growth attributes declined at higher acclimation temperatures, but remained within acceptable ranges, implying that the species may attain normal growth at elevated temperatures experienced in outdoor aquaculture systems, despite its warm environmental background. Hence, we recommend selective breeding for temperature resilience and species introduction into aquaculture using broodstock from L. Nabisojjo.

AB  - Germ cells are maintained in a pristine non-aging state as they proliferate over generations. Here, we show that a novel function of the Caenorhabditis elegans RNA interference proteins RNAi spreading defective (RSD)-2 and RSD-6 is to promote germ cell immortality at high temperature. rsd mutants cultured at high temperatures became progressively sterile and displayed loss of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target spermatogenesis genes, simple repeats, and transposons. Desilencing of spermatogenesis genes occurred in late-generation rsd mutants, although defective spermatogenesis was insufficient to explain the majority of sterility. Increased expression of repetitive loci occurred in both germ and somatic cells of late-generation rsd mutant adults, suggesting that desilencing of many heterochromatic segments of the genome contributes to sterility. Nuclear RNAi defective (NRDE)-2 promotes nuclear silencing in response to exogenous double-stranded RNA, and our data imply that RSD-2, RSD-6, and NRDE-2 function in a common transgenerational nuclear silencing pathway that responds to endogenous siRNAs. We propose that RSD-2 and RSD-6 promote germ cell immortality at stressful temperatures by maintaining transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of endogenous siRNA populations that promote genome silencing.

AB  - High temperature inhibits the growth of the wild-type bacteriophage phi X174. Three different point mutations were identified that each recovered growth at high temperature. Two affected the major capsid protein (residues F188 and F242), and one affected the internal scaffolding protein (B114). One of the major capsid mutations (F242) is located in a beta strand that contacts B114 in the procapsid during viral maturation, whereas the other capsid mutation (F188) is involved in subunit interactions at the threefold axis of symmetry. Selective coefficients of these mutations ranged from 13.9 to 3.8 in the inhibitory, hot environment, bur all mutations reduced fitness at normal temperature. The selective effect of one of the mutations (F242) was evaluated at high temperature in four different genetic backgrounds and exhibited epistasis of diminishing returns: as log fitness of the background genotype increased from -0.1 to 4.1, the fitness boost provided by the F242 mutation decreased from 3.9 to 0.8. These results support a model in which viral fitness is bounded by an upper limit and the benefit of a mutation is scaled according to the remaining opportunity for fitness improvement in the genome.

AB  - To predict and mitigate the effects of climate change on communities and ecosystems, the joint effects of extreme climatic events on species interactions need to be understood. Using the common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.)-leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) system, we investigated the effects of heat wave and elevated CO2 on common ragweed growth, secondary metabolism, and the consequent impacts on the beetle. The results showed that elevated CO2 and heat wave facilitated A. artemisiifolia growth; further, A. artemisiifolia accumulated large amounts of defensive secondary metabolites. Being fed on A. artemisiifolia grown under elevated CO2 and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of O. communa (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Overall, under elevated CO2, heat wave improved the defensive ability of A. artemisiifolia against herbivores. On the other hand, enhanced adaptability to climatic changes may aggravate invasive plant distribution, posing a challenge to the control of invasive plants in the future.
   Key message Being fed on A. artemisiifolia grown under elevated CO2 and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of O. communa (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Elevated CO2 and heat waves resulted in the accumulation of secondary metabolites in A. artemisiifolia. After feeding on the secondary metabolites accumulated by A. artemisiifolia, the mortality of O. communa increased.

AB  - A set of discrete formulae that calculates the hypothetical impact of aerial spraying on a tsetse population is derived and the work is thought to be novel. Both the original population and the subsequent generations which survive the aerial spraying, may ultimately be thought of as deriving from two, distinct sources. These origins are, however, neither distinct, nor relevant by the third generation. It is for this reason that the female population is considered to be composed of the following four categories for the purposes of derivation: Original flies which existed as such at the commencement of spraying; original pupae which existed as such at the commencement of spraying; the immediate descendants of both the aforementioned categories, during spraying; third and higher generation descendants. In theory, the latter category is a recurrence relation. In practice, the third generation's pupal stage has hardly come into existence, even by the end of a completed operation. Implicit in the formulae is the assumption of one, temperature-dependent mortality rate for the entire pupal stage, a second for the period between eclosion and ovulation and yet a third for the entire, adult life-span. Gravid female resistance to the insecticide is assumed to be inconsequential. A further assumption of the formulae is that at least one male is always available (degree of sterility variable).

AB  - Ethanol generation from lignocellulose materials provides an alternative energy-production system. This study investigates the effect of pre-treatment conditions: maximum temperature (range 423.15-483.15 K) and sulfuric-acid concentration (interval 0.002-0.059 kmol/m(3)) on fuel-ethanol production from simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of olive-pruning debris by Saccharomyces cerevisiae IR2-9a (a thermal acclimatized microorganism, 313.15 K). The influence of these two variables was determined by using a response-surface methodology. Cellulose percentage in pre-treated solids reached a maximum of 71.6% of the content in raw material at 483.15 K and 0.010 kmol/m(3) of acid concentration. The conversion of hemicellulose into monosaccharides and oligosaccharides also was analyzed. After the wash and filtration of solids, a significant quantity of D-glucose was obtained in the liquid fraction. For ethanol generation, the bio-fuel yield (maximum of 9.6 kg from 100 kg olive-pruning debris), and volumetric ethanol productivity (maximum of 0.27 kg/(m(3) h)), strongly depended on pre-treatments conditions. According to statistical optimization, the highest ethanol yield (9.9 kg ethanol from 100 kg olive-pruning debris) is achieved at 480.15 K using a catalyst concentration of 0.016 kmol/m(3). A maximum overall process yield of 15.3 kg ethanol/100 kg olive-pruning debris may result when taking into account ethanol from SSF and D-glucose present in the pre-hydrolysate, assuming its theoretical conversion (22.8 kg ethanol/100 kg raw material, also considering the total conversion of D-xylose in the filtrate).

AB  - Climate change and human-mediated dispersal are increasingly influencing species' geographic distributions. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are widely used in forecasting species' distributions, but are weak in extrapolation to novel environments because they rely on available distributional data and do not incorporate mechanistic information, such as species' physiological response to abiotic conditions. To improve accuracy of ENMs, we incorporated physiological knowledge through Bayesian analysis. In a case study of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, we used native and global occurrences to obtain native and global models representing narrower and broader understanding of zebra mussel' response to temperature. We also obtained thermal limit and survival information for zebra mussel from peer-reviewed literature and used the two types of information separately and jointly to calibrate native models. We showed that, compared to global models, native models predicted lower relative probability of presence along zebra mussel's upper thermal limit, suggesting the shortcoming of native models in predicting zebra mussel's response to warm temperature. We also found that native models showed improved prediction of relative probability of presence when thermal limit was used alone, and best approximated global models when both thermal limit and survival data were used. Our result suggests that integration of physiological knowledge enhances extrapolation of ENM in novel environments. Our modeling framework can be generalized for other species or other physiological limits and may incorporate evolutionary information (e.g. evolved thermal tolerance), thus has the potential to improve predictions of species' invasive potential and distributional response to climate change.

AB  - Icing conditions may cause wind turbine generators to partially lose productivity or to be completely shut down to avoid structural damage. At present, commercially available technologies to mitigate this problem consist of expensive, energy hungry heating elements, which costs roughly 70,000 euro per medium size turbine. Conventional passive ice protection coating systems heavily rely on delicate surface structures and expensive materials to create water repellent superhydrophobic / low surface energy surfaces, which have been proven to be ineffective against ice accumulation. The lack of performance among conventional ice protection materials stems from a flaw in the approach to the problem: failure to recognize that water in its liquid form (WATER) and water in its solid form (ICE) are two different things. Something that works for WATER does not automatically work for ICE. Another reason is that many superhydrophobic materials are often reliant upon often fragile micro-structured surfaces to achieve their intended effects. This paper discusses a fundamentally different approach to the creation of a robust, low cost, durable, and multifunctional materials for ice release and erosion resistance. This National Science Foundation sponsored ice-release coating technology holds promise for protecting wind turbine blades and towers, thus potentially increasing reliability for power generation under icing conditions. Because of the vulnerability of wind turbine blades to ice buildup and erosion damages, wind farm facilities stand to reap considerable benefits.

TI  - Robustness against extinction by stochastic sex determination in small populations
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA  - English
KW  - SIZE
AB  - Sexually reproducing populations with a small number of individuals may go extinct by stochastic fluctuations in sex determination, causing all their members to become male or female in a generation. In this work we calculate the time to extinction of isolated populations with fixed number N of individuals that are updated according to the Moran birth and death process. At each time step, one individual is randomly selected and replaced by its offspring resulting from mating with another individual of the opposite sex; the offspring can be male or female with equal probability. A set of N time steps is called a generation, the average time it takes for the entire population to be replaced. The number k of females fluctuates in time, similarly to a random walk, and extinction, which is the only asymptotic possibility, occurs when k = 0 or k = N. We show that it takes only one generation for an arbitrary initial distribution of males and females to approach the binomial distribution. This distribution, however, is unstable and the population eventually goes extinct in 2(N) / N generations. We also discuss the robustness of these results against bias in the determination of the sex of the offspring, a characteristic promoted by infection by the bacteria Wolbachia in some arthropod species or by temperature in reptiles.

AB  - In the pursuit of controlling the propensity of Cu-mordenite (MOR) for the selective oxidation of CH4, we take a closer look at intrinsic zeolite parameters. Via synthesis design, we vary the relative proportion of Al situated near the 8-rings and 12-rings of MOR zeolite. This is accomplished using different Al sources impacting the local degree of silica dissolution and zeolite formation as evidenced by crystallization times and morphological differences. Interrogating the crystalline system with steric probe molecules in conjunction with spectroscopic techniques such as H-1 magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, infrared spectroscopy, as well as temperature-programmed desorption confirms discrete changes of the Al within the unit cell. The subsequent copper exchange allows for the generation of Cu-MOR materials of different inclinations for the activation of methane in the stepwise formation of MeOH. Here, an increasing degree of acid sites in more easily accessible locations (e.g., 12-ring) correlates with increasing maximum productivity toward MeOH at moderate exchange degrees. X-ray absorption spectroscopy supports this notion, finding a higher concentration of self-reduction-resistant framework-associated Cu2+ species, previously established as the active sites in the selective oxidation of CH4.

AB  - Striped bass Morone saxatilis, originally a coastal and estuarine species, has been introduced in reservoirs in the southeastern and western United States. Although such stocking established many successful fisheries, there were troublesome die-offs of adult striped bass (3-9 kg, generally >5 kg) in some waters, usually in late summer. In contrast, juveniles and small adults thrived. In response to these patterns, my students and I conducted several years of telemetry studies of adult striped bass, primarily in Cherokee and Watts Bar reservoirs, Tennessee, and laboratory studies of juvenile temperature selection. In 1985, I published the "temperature oxygen squeeze" hypothesis to explain mortalities of large fish on the basis of limited availability of cool (<25 degrees C), oxygenated (>2 mg/L) water in summer while juveniles successfully occupied a warmer thermal niche (>25 degrees C). We now have more than 20 years of research and management since 1985, primarily across the Southeast, in which the published hypothesis has, explicitly or not, been tested, generally confirmed, and applied to management. This retrospective paper reviews the studies our team conducted to develop and test the hypothesis and about 20 years of relevant studies by others that have added important nuances, addressed lingering issues, and turned a controversial idea into generally accepted understanding and management practice. Nonetheless, issues remain for understanding the effects of poor summer habitat on striped bass, such as why some studies show striped bass occupying warmer temperatures without mortalities and the role of prey availability in survival of fish obliged to occupy warm water. Other papers in this volume augment and extend the saga of progressively developing knowledge that this paper recalls of striped bass habitat requirements, thermal niche segregation by size (or age), and management constraints and opportunities.

AB  - For a more in-depth analysis on the marine chemical condition during the earliest Cambrian, mechanism of organic matter enrichment and exploration potential of shale gas resources, based on the petrology, organic geochemistry, and elemental characteristics of the W207 Well, this study discuss the Early Cambrian paleo-ocean environment and factors controlling of organic matter enrichment during the deposition of black strata Qiongzhusi Formation in the upslope areas, southwestern Sichuan Basin, Yangtze Block, China. The sedimentary cycles show that during the depositon of fine-grained Qiongzhusi Fm, interactive cycles of multiple deep-water and shallow-water shelf developed, and were controlled by the rise and fall in sea level. In particular, the slope turbidite (fan) and gravity flow sediments indicate that the shallow-water shelf facies were dominant in the upslope area (SW Sichuan Basin), where not in deep water for a long time, and the sedimentary thickness of the organic rich black shale was limited. Evidence from organic geochemistry indicates that the organic matter of the Qiongzhusi Fm from the W207 Well was mainly of type I kerogen, with a high degree of thermal evolution, little residual hydrocarbon, and low capacity for hydrocarbon generation. The redox parameters indicate that the marine environment on the upslope was medium restrictive, with some upwelling. The seawater had undergone a transformation according to anoxic-oxidic. Therefore, paleo-ocean productivity in the upslope area was generally low, and exhibited a prominent downward trend from bottom to top. Given its high risk of exploration, the authors suggest that the direction of shale gas resource evaluation should change to the intracratonic sag (downslope) area, which is characterized by deep-water shelf facies.

AB  - Fatty acid composition and total fatty acids of field-caught Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF) Thunnus orientalis larvae were investigated to identify relationships between spawning ground, physiological condition, and growth rate. Multivariate statistical analyses revealed that both growth rate and environmental conditions at spawning grounds were substantially associated with variations in fatty acid compositions. Fast-growing larvae typically contained more a-linolenic acid and 22:5n-3, which are important as metabolic precursors of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Larval PBF fatty acid compositions differed by spawning ground; larvae caught around the Nansei Islands contained more 15:0, 17:0, 19:0, and 22:5n-6, and less EPA and arachidonic acid (ARA) than those from the Sea of Japan. Differences in larval odd-numbered fatty acid compositions might indicate different degrees of dependence on microbial loop energy supply between spawning grounds. Environments subject to sudden changes, such as those in water temperature and prey density in the Sea of Japan, might cause variability in fatty acid profiles, including extremely low %DHA. We suggest that continuous food intake and subsequent fatty acid catabolism for energy generation would be needed to facilitate fast growth.

AB  - In this study we investigated the physiological mechanisms underlying temperature tolerance using Drosophila melanogaster lines with rapid intermediate or slow recovery from heat or chill coma that were established by artificial selection or by free recombination without selection Specifically we focused on the relationships among their recovery from heat or chill coma survival after severe heat or cold and survival enhanced by rapid cold hardening (RCH) or heat hardening The recovery time from heat coma was not related to the survival rate after severe heat The line with rapid recovery from chill coma showed a higher survival rate after severe cold exposure and therefore the same mechanisms are likely to underlie these phenotypes The recovery time from chill coma and survival rate after severe cold were unrelated to RCH-enhanced survival We also examined the expression of two genes Heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70)and Frost in these lines to understand the contribution of these stress-inducible genes to intraspecific variation in recovery from temperature coma The line showing rapid recovery from heat coma did not exhibit higher expression of Hsp70 and Frost In addition Hsp70 and Frost transcription levels were not correlated with the recovery time from chill coma Thus Hsp70 and Frost transcriptional regulation was not involved in the intraspecific variation in recovery from temperature coma (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity enables a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes in response to environmental variation. Plasticity may play a critical role in the colonization of novel environments, but its role in adaptive evolution is controversial. Here we suggest that rapid parallel regulatory adaptation of Anolis lizards to urban heat islands is due primarily to selection for reduced and/or reversed heat-induced plasticity that is maladaptive in urban thermal conditions. We identify evidence for polygenic selection across genes of the skeletal muscle transcriptome associated with heat tolerance. Forest lizards raised in common garden conditions exhibit heat-induced changes in expression of these genes that largely correlate with decreased heat tolerance, consistent with maladaptive regulatory response to high-temperature environments. In contrast, urban lizards display reduced gene expression plasticity after heat challenge in common garden and a significant increase in gene expression change that is congruent with greater heat tolerance, a putatively adaptive state in warmer urban environments. Genes displaying maladaptive heat-induced plasticity repeatedly show greater genetic divergence between urban and forest habitats than those displaying adaptive plasticity. These results highlight the role of selection against maladaptive regulatory plasticity during rapid adaptive modification of complex systems in the wild.
   Anthropogenic change, such as urban heat islands, present challenges to biodiversity that can be overcome through phenotypic plasticity. Unlike their ancestral counterparts, urban lizards have fewer maladaptive gene expression responses to higher temperatures in a common garden experiment, suggesting the evolution of adaptive plasticity.

AB  - Nitrates are widely used as fertilizer and oxidizing agents. Commercial nitrate production from nitrogen involves high-temperature-high-pressure multi-step processes. Therefore, an alternative nitrate production method under ambient environment is of importance. Herein, an electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) approach is developed to produce nitrate catalyzed by ZnFexCo2-xO4 spinel oxides. Theoretical and experimental results show Fe aids the formation of the first N-O bond on the *N site, while high oxidation state Co assists in stabilizing the absorbed OH- for the generation of the second and third N-O bonds. Owing to the concerted catalysis, the ZnFe0.4Co1.6O4 oxide demonstrates the highest nitrate production rate of 130 +/- 12 mu mol h(-1) g(MO)(-1) at an applied potential of 1.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

AB  - Hatching from cysts and eggsacs of six successive generations of Heterodera cajani produced on cowpea during a single growing season in the glasshouse was compared in distilled water, soil leachate and host root diffusate from four week old plants. The majority of eggs in eggsacs hatched within 7 days in all treatments and there were no differences between generations. Hatch from cysts in all treatments was similar over the first four generations but the fifth and sixth generations, produced on senescing plants, showed a marked dependency on host root diffusate for hatch. The ratio of eggs in eggsacs to eggs in cysts decreased with each succeeding generation and a comparison between third and sixth generations indicated that, in the older generation, more lipid reserves are partitioned into the encysted J2 than into the J2 in eggsacs. The results are discussed in the context of the survival requirements of H. cajani in the absence of a host.

AB  - This review paper provides a perspective on residue generation, reasons for on-site burning of residue, its ill effects on soil properties, environment, soil biota, challenges faced by the farmers in managing a huge quantity of residue and various schemes, policies, and punishments undertaken by the government to curb the problem of on-site residue burning. Several studies show that crop residue burning in the field has a negative impact on soil organic carbon, soil fertility, soil microbes, and environment and also hinders the long-term sustainability of crop production. Crop residue is a good source of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur; on burning, these cause the loss of nutrients as CO, CO2, NO, particulate matter, and smoke, which are lost into the atmosphere, thereby creating the problem of air pollution and global warming, which will also pose threat to human health.

AB  - In terrestrial snails, thermal selection acts on shell coloration. However, the biological relevance of small differences in the intensity of shell pigmentation and the associated thermodynamic, physiological, and evolutionary consequences for snail diversity within the course of environmental warming are still insufficiently understood. To relate temperature-driven internal heating, protein and membrane integrity impairment, escape behavior, place of residence selection, water loss, and mortality, we used experimentally warmed open-top chambers and field observations with a total of >11,000 naturally or experimentally colored individuals of the highly polymorphic species Theba pisana (O.F. MuLLER, 1774). We show that solar radiation in their natural Mediterranean habitat in Southern France poses intensifying thermal stress on increasingly pigmented snails that cannot be compensated for by behavioral responses. Individuals of all morphs acted neither jointly nor actively competed in climbing behavior, but acted similarly regardless of neighbor pigmentation intensity. Consequently, dark morphs progressively suffered from high internal temperatures, oxidative stress, and a breakdown of the chaperone system. Concomitant with increasing water loss, mortality increased with more intense pigmentation under simulated global warming conditions. In parallel with an increase in mean ambient temperature of 1.34 degrees C over the past 30 years, the mortality rate of pigmented individuals in the field is, currently, about 50% higher than that of white morphs. A further increase of 1.12 degrees C, as experimentally simulated in our study, would elevate this rate by another 26%. For 34 T. pisana populations from locations that are up to 2.7 degrees C warmer than our experimental site, we show that both the frequency of pigmented morphs and overall pigmentation intensity decrease with an increase in average summer temperatures. We therefore predict a continuing strong decline in the frequency of pigmented morphs and a decrease in overall pigmentation intensity with ongoing global change in areas with strong solar radiation.

AB  - This paper focuses on the thermo-economic analysis of a 2.1-MWe and 960 kWt hybrid solar-biomass combined heat and power (CHP) system composed of a 1.4-MWe Externally Fired Gas-Turbine (EFGT) and a 0.7-MWe bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plant. The primary thermal energy input is provided by a hybrid Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) collector array covering a total ground area of 22,000-32,000 m(2), coupled to a biomass boiler. The CSP collector array is based on parabolic-trough concentrators (PTCs) with molten salts as the heat transfer fluid (HTF), upstream of a 4.5-9.1 MWt fluidized-bed furnace for direct biomass combustion. In addition, two molten-salt tanks are considered that provide 4.8-18 MWh (corresponding to 1.3-5.0 h) of Thermal Energy Storage (TES), as a means of reducing the variations in the plant's operating conditions, increasing the plant's capacity factor and total operating hours (from 5500-6000 to 8000 h per year). On the basis of the results of the thermodynamic simulations, upfront and operational costs assessments, and considering an Italian energy policy scenario (feed-in tariffs, or FiTs, for renewable electricity), the global energy conversion efficiency and investment profitability of this plant are estimated for different sizes of CSP and biomass furnaces, different operation strategies (baseload and modulating) and cogenerative vs. electricity-only system configurations. Upfront costs in the range 4.3-9.5 MEur are reported, with operating costs in the range 1.5-2.3 MEur annually. Levelized costs of energy from around 100 Eur/MWh to above 220 Eur/MWh are found, along with net present values (NPVs) from close to 13,000 to -3000 kEur and internal rates of return (IRRs) from 30% down to almost zero when prioritizing electrical power generation (i.e., not in cogenerative mode). In all cases the economic viability of the systems deteriorate for larger CSP section sizes. The results indicate the low economic profitability of CSP integration in comparison to biomass-only plants, due to high investment costs of the former, which are not compensated by the higher global energy conversion efficiency and energy sales revenues.

AB  - The first generation of forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments has successfully provided deeper understanding about how forests respond to an increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Located in aggrading stands in the temperate zone, they have provided a strong foundation for testing critical assumptions in terrestrial biosphere models that are being used to project future interactions between forest productivity and the atmosphere, despite the limited inference space of these experiments with regards to the range of global ecosystems. Now, a new generation of FACE experiments in mature forests in different biomes and over a wide range of climate space and biodiversity will significantly expand the inference space. These new experiments are: EucFACE in a mature Eucalyptus stand on highly weathered soil in subtropical Australia; AmazonFACE in a highly diverse, primary rainforest in Brazil; BIFoR-FACE in a 150-yr-old deciduous woodland stand in central England; and SwedFACE proposed in a hemiboreal, Pinus sylvestris stand in Sweden. We now have a unique opportunity to initiate a model-data interaction as an integral part of experimental design and to address a set of cross-site science questions on topics including responses of mature forests; interactions with temperature, water stress, and phosphorus limitation; and the influence of biodiversity.

AB  - The focus of bone graft properties has developed through generations, from the ability to withstand mechanical stress to the ability to integrate with the biological structure. In recent years, the use of hydroxyapatite (HA) as bone graft material in orthopedic and dental applications has been increasing. HA is a natural occuring mineral with excellent bioactivity but relatively poor mechanical properties. It constitutes 96% portion of enamel in teeth and 67% portion of bone. HA can be extracted from animal bones or fabricated from synthetic or biologic sources. In this study, eggshells were used as raw material to synthesize eggshell-derived HA (EHA) via mechanochemical method. The synthesis of EHA involved CaO, which was obtained from the calcination of eggshells, and reaction with dicalcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrous (DCPD) or phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The effects of rotational speed and heat treatment temperature on EHA's characteristics were investigated. The characterization studies were carried out by using the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). HA powder was successfully synthesized with crystallite and particle sizes in the range of 8-47 nm and 250-550 nm respectively. It was observed from this study that the increase of milling rotational speed had increased the phase purity of EHA samples. Furthermore, the higher heating temperature of HA samples resulted in higher degree of crystallinity of HA and the appearance of beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) as secondary phase.

AB  - BackgroundPest eradication using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) involves high-density releases of sterilized males that mate with wild females and ultimately suppress the population. Sterilized females are not required for SIT and their removal or separation from males prior to release remains challenging. In order to develop genetic sexing strains (GSS), conditional traits such as temperature sensitive lethality are required.ResultsHere we introduce a known Drosophila melanogaster temperature sensitive embryonic lethal mutation into Bactrocera tryoni, a serious horticultural pest in Australia. A non-synonymous point mutation in the D. melanogaster gene shibire causes embryonic lethality at 29 degrees C and we successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to recreate the orthologous shibire temperature sensitive-1 (shi(ts1)) mutation in B. tryoni. Genotypic analyses over three generations revealed that a high fitness cost was associated with the shi(ts1) mutant allele and shi(ts1) homozygotes were not viable at 21 degrees C, which is a more severe phenotype than that documented in D. melanogaster.ConclusionsWe have demonstrated the first successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce precise single base substitutions in an endogenous gene via homology-directed repair in an agricultural pest insect and this technology can be used to trial other conditional mutations for the ultimate aim of generating genetic sexing strains for SIT.

AB  - Generation of biodiesel from microalgae has been extensively investigated; however, its quality is often not suitable for use as fuel. Our investigation involved the evaluation of biodiesel quality using a native isolate Chlorella sorokiniana MIC-G5, as specified by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), after transesterification of lipids with methanol, in the presence of sodium methoxide. Total quantity of lipids extracted from dry biomass, of approximately 410-450 mg g(-1) was characterized using FTIR and H-1 NMR. After transesterification, the total saturated and unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were 43% and 57%, respectively. The major FAMEs present in the biodiesel were methyl palmitate (C16:0), methyl oleate (C18:1), and methyl linoleate (C18:2), and the H-1 NMR spectra matched with criteria prescribed for high-quality biodiesel. The biodiesel exhibited a density of 0.873 g cm(-3), viscosity of 3.418 mm(2) s(-1), cetane number (CN) of 57.85, high heating value (HHV) of 40.25, iodine value of 71.823 g I-2 100 g(-1), degree of unsaturation (DU) of 58%, and a cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of -5.22 degrees C. Critical fuel parameters, including oxidation stability, CN, HHV, iodine value, flash point, cloud point, pour point, density, and viscosity were in accordance with the methyl ester composition and structural configuration. Hence, C. sorokiniana can be a promising feedstock for biodiesel generation.

AB  - Maternal stress is a common source of heritable health and behavioral variation. This type of maternal effect could be particularly important for honey bees (Apis mellifera), as a single queen is responsible for many generations of workers who perform all colony functions including raising subsequent worker generations. Multiple factors work synergistically to cause colony loss, but a role for maternal stress effects is unstudied. We used an artificial cold temperature treatment as a proof-of-concept approach to investigate whether acute queen stress causes changes in worker phenotypes, including egg hatching rate, development time, and adult behavior and immune function. We found that queen stress impacts early-life phenotypes (egg hatching and development time), with more limited impacts on adult phenotypes (behavior and immune function). Thus, if maternal stress impacts colony health, it is likely through cumulative impacts on worker population numbers, not through phenotypic effects that impact individual adult worker behavior or health resilience. This study addresses an important and overlooked question, and provides a baseline understanding of the likely impacts of queen stress on worker phenotypes.

AB  - P> Thermal acclimation is one of the basic strategies by which organisms cope with thermal heterogeneity of the environment. Under predictable variation in environmental temperatures, theory predicts that selection favours acclimation of thermal performance curves over fixed phenotypes.
   We examined the influence of diel fluctuations in developmental temperatures on the thermal sensitivity of the maximal swimming capacity in larvae of the alpine newt, Triturus alpestris.
   We incubated newt eggs under three thermal regimes with varying daily amplitudes (1, 5 and 9 degrees C) and similar means (17 center dot 6-17 center dot 9 degrees C), and accordingly we measured the swimming speed of hatched larvae at three experimental temperatures (12, 17 and 22 degrees C), which they would normally experience in their natural habitat.
   Embryonic development under low and middle temperature fluctuations produced larvae with similar swimming speeds across experimental temperatures. In contrast, the most fluctuating regime induced development of phenotypes, which at 12 degrees C swam faster than larvae developed under moderate diel fluctuations.
   Our results provide evidence that diel temperature fluctuations induce acclimation of thermal dependence of locomotor performance. In ectotherms experiencing diel cycles in environmental temperatures, this plastic response may act as an important pacemaker in the evolution of thermal sensitivity.

AB  - Liquid metals have been used in various applications in nuclear systems. Lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) is foreseen as a coolant and target for neutron generation in accelerator-driven systems (ADS), whereas pure lead will be used as coolant in Gen IV-type lead-cooled fast reactors (LFR). The advantage of heavy liquid metal alloys is their high thermal conductivity and their relative safety in case of an accident. A major problem in non-isothermal systems is the corrosion of their structural components. consisting mainly of ferritic/martensitic and austenitic stainless steels, since the solubility of dissolved elements depends strongly on temperature. The formation of oxide scales on structural components is considered a viable approach to limiting the corrosion rates. To maintain a specific oxygen content in lead or LBE. an oxygen control system (OCS) is crucial. This requires continuous measurement of the oxygen activity in the liquid metal by means of electrochemical sensors. It must be assured that no oxides of the liquid metal itself are formed; otherwise, the system can be blocked. Therefore. this paper addresses the development of oxygen sensors for corrosion control of martensitic and austenitic steels in a lead-bismuth eutectic system at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany).

AB  - In order to study strain-specific differences in their growth behaviour at different, and particularly lower, temperatures, generation times for 45 strains of Salmonella enteritidis isolated from food were determined impedimetrically over a temperature range from 7 to 42 degrees C. In practical terms, 7 degrees C is the minimum requirement for Salm. enteritidis growth, and generation time variability increases markedly as this temperature is reached. Reports in the literature describing psychrotrophic behaviour and multiplication at lower temperatures cannot be confirmed. Generation time variability increased as temperature moved away from the optimal range with variation coefficients tending to rise as temperature fell. The great variability of multiplication parameters near the growth limit found in Salm. enteritidis may also be a characteristic of other bacterial species. It is therefore imperative to commence studies on larger numbers of strains to allow prediction of their behaviour at lower temperatures.

AB  - In the present paper, a new attitude has been proposed for optimization of the separation efficiency (SE) and the Gaudin's selectivity index (SI) in a flotation process by Hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). The chemical reagent's dosage (collector, frother and fuel oil), pH, solid percentage, feed rate, Cu, Mo, and Fe grades in the flotation feed were selected as input variables and the SE-Cu and SI-Mo and SI-Fe were selected as output ones. Multilayer NN with back propagation (BP) algorithm was trained by the standard Bayesian regulation algorithm in which the validation data set did not required to be apart from its training. This algorithm with four-layer was used to relate output and input variables. Employment of Hybrid GA-ANN method resulted in significant improvement on GA fitnesses, as SE-Cu = 88, SI-Mo = 4.47 and SI of Fe = 12.85 were achieved. The input parameters corresponding to the fitnesses were as follows: pH = 12.25; the grade of Cu = 0.55%, Mo = 0.04% and Fe = 5.53%; the collector, frother and fuel-oil concentrations being 16.55, 15.54 and 2.71 (g/ton), respectively; the solid percentage was 25.84% and feed rate was 38,380 ton/day. The best fitness of GA was obtained after 10 generations by MSE value of 2.23.

AB  - Drier parts of Kenya's Central Highlands endure persistent crop failure and declining agricultural productivity. These have, in part, attributed to high temperatures, prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall. Understanding spatial-temporal variability of climatic indices such as rainfall at seasonal level is critical for optimal rain-fed agricultural productivity and natural resource management in the study area. However, the predominant setbacks in analysing hydro-meteorological events are occasioned by either lack, inadequate, or inconsistent meteorological data. Like in most other places, the sole sources of climatic data in the study region are scarce and only limited to single stations, yet with persistent missing/unrecorded data making their utilization a challenge. This study examined seasonal anomalies and variability in rainfall, drought occurrence and the efficacy of interpolation techniques in the drier regions of eastern Kenyan. Rainfall data from five stations (Machang'a, Kiritiri, Kiambere and Kindaruma and Embu) were sourced from both the Kenya Meteorology Department and on-site primary recording. Owing to some experimental work ongoing, automated recording for primary dailies in Machang'a have been ongoing since the year 2000 to date; thus, Machang'a was treated as reference (for period of record) station for selection of other stations in the region. The other stations had data sets of over 15 years with missing data of less than 10 % as required by the world meteorological organization whose quality check is subject to the Centre for Climate Systems Modeling (C2SM) through MeteoSwiss and EMPA bodies. The dailies were also subjected to homogeneity testing to evaluate whether they came from the same population. Rainfall anomaly index, coefficients of variance and probability were utilized in the analyses of rainfall variability. Spline, kriging and inverse distance weighting interpolation techniques were assessed using daily rainfall data and digital elevation model in ArcGIS environment. Validation of the selected interpolation methods were based on goodness of fit between gauged (observed) and generated rainfall derived from residual errors statistics, coefficient of determination (R (2)), mean absolute errors (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) statistics. Analyses showed 90 % chance of below cropping-threshold rainfall (500 mm) exceeding 258.1 mm during short rains in Embu for 1 year return period. Rainfall variability was found to be high in seasonal amounts (e.g. coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.56, 0.47, 0.59) and in number of rainy days (e.g. CV = 0.88, 0.53) in Machang'a and Kiritiri, respectively. Monthly rainfall variability was found to be equally high during April and November (e.g. CV = 0.48, 0.49 and 0.76) with high probabilities (0.67) of droughts exceeding 15 days in Machang'a. Dry spell probabilities within growing months were high, e.g. 81 and 60 % in Machang'a and Embu, respectively. Kriging interpolation method emerged as the most appropriate geostatistical interpolation technique suitable for spatial rainfall maps generation for the study region.

AB  - Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a potentially advanced strategy for highly precise cancer treatment. Tumor-microenvironment-activatable agents provide useful tools for PTT, but their photothermal conversion capacities vary and cannot be evaluated in vivo; thus, a general PTT prescription does not work with individual activatable agents. Here, glutathione (GSH)-activatable nanocomposites, silicomolybdate-functionalized NaLuF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4@NaLuF4:Nd are prepared, for customized PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer. By simultaneously determining intratumoral GSH concentration and the amount of accumulated agent using multiple orthogonal luminescent emissions of nanocomposites, near-infrared absorbance of photothermal conversion agents is evaluated in vivo, based on the optimized irradiating prescriptions (irradiating power density and time) established. This allows customized PTT of each individual case with high efficacy and viability. This work also includes a method for investigating individual intratumoral variation, and the development of the next generation of customized nanomedicine for efficacious PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is predicted to permit persistence in new environments, and may subsequently evolve to enhance fitness. Colonizing environments with lower winter temperatures can lead to the evolution of lower critical thermal minima; the corresponding physiological traits associated with temperature tolerance are predicted to involve mitochondrial function. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have colonized freshwater lakes along the Pacific Northwest. These freshwater populations are known to exhibit cold-induced increases in mitochondrial volume density in pectoral muscle, but whether such plasticity evolved before or after colonization is uncertain. Here, we measure critical thermal minima (CTmin) in one marine and one freshwater population of threespine stickleback, and mitochondrial volume density in pectoral and cardiac tissue of both populations acclimated to different temperature treatments (6.2, 14.5 and 20.6 celcius). Mitochondrial volume density increased with cold acclimation in pectoral muscle; cardiac muscle was non-plastic but had elevated mitochondrial volume densities compared to pectoral muscle across all temperature treatments. There were no differences in the levels of plasticity between marine and freshwater stickleback, but neither were there differences in CTmin. Importantly, marine stickleback exhibited plasticity under low-salinity conditions, suggesting that marine stickleback had at least one necessary phenotype for persistence in freshwater environments before colonization occurred.

AB  - BackgroundThe fishery and aquaculture of the widely distributed mangrove crab Scylla serrata is a steadily growing, high-value, global industry. Climate change poses a risk to this industry as temperature elevations are expected to threaten the mangrove crab habitat and the supply of mangrove crab juveniles from the wild. It is therefore important to understand the genomic and molecular basis of how mangrove crab populations from sites with different climate profiles respond to heat stress. Towards this, we performed RNA-seq on the gill tissue of S. serrata individuals sampled from 3 sites (Cagayan, Bicol, and Bataan) in the Philippines, under normal and heat-stressed conditions. To compare the transcriptome expression profiles, we designed a 2-factor generalized linear model containing interaction terms, which allowed us to simultaneously analyze within-site response to heat-stress and across-site differences in the response.ResultsWe present the first ever transcriptome assembly of S. serrata obtained from a data set containing 66 Gbases of cleaned RNA-seq reads. With lowly-expressed and short contigs excluded, the assembly contains roughly 17,000 genes with an N50 length of 2,366 bp. Our assembly contains many almost full-length transcripts - 5229 shrimp and 3049 fruit fly proteins have alignments that cover >80% of their sequence lengths to a contig. Differential expression analysis found population-specific differences in heat-stress response. Within-site analysis of heat-stress response showed 177, 755, and 221 differentially expressed (DE) genes in the Cagayan, Bataan, and Bicol group, respectively. Across-site analysis showed that between Cagayan and Bataan, there were 389 genes associated with 48 signaling and stress-response pathways, for which there was an effect of site in the response to heat; and between Cagayan and Bicol, there were 101 such genes affecting 8 pathways.ConclusionIn light of previous work on climate profiling and on population genetics of marine species in the Philippines, our findings suggest that the variation in thermal response among populations might be derived from acclimatory plasticity due to pre-exposure to extreme temperature variations or from population structure shaped by connectivity which leads to adaptive genetic differences among populations.

AB  - Although more than sixty hot springs have been reported in West Malaysia, their geochemistry, geothermometry and utilization as a potential energy source have not been considered yet. This study reports the geochemistry, geothermometry and mineral saturation indices of a number of hot springs in West Malaysia. The potential of these hot springs as a source of geothermal energy as well as their origin and possible mixing with surface cold waters have been discussed.
   Surface temperatures of the studied hot springs range from 41 to 99 degrees C and pH values vary between 5.5 and 9. Geochemical data showed that among cations, Si, Na, Ca and K occur in relatively high contents, while Mg and Fe show very low concentrations. On the other hand, HCO3 is present in relatively high concentration compared to other anions (SO4, Cl and F). Data also illustrated that most of the studied hot springs are K-Na-bicarbonate rich waters although they represent different geological provenances in West Malaysia reflecting homogeneity in the geological formations and/or hydrochemical processes governing the characteristics of these waters. This homogeneity also indicates the insignificant effect of local geology on the chemistry of the studied hot springs. Saturation indices calculations of the studied thermal waters indicate that most of the secondary mineral phases such as goethite and hematite are apparently supersaturated while quartz and chalcedony are saturated. Conversely, amorphous silica is slightly under-saturated. These results suggest similar rock-water interactions for both geothermal and non-geothermal waters.
   The geological settings of the studied hot springs either in or close to granitic masses or along the major fault or shear zones as well as the Na-bicarbonate nature of the waters and low sulfate concentrations suggest their non-volcanic origin. They are also similar in their geological setting and water chemistry to other non-volcanic hot springs in other parts of the world. However, the possible mixing of the original hot waters with near surface cold water is evident from the clear disagreement between the silica and cation geothermometers as well as the disequilibrium with their associated host rocks as indicated from the plot of studied hot springs in the Na-K-Mg ternary diagram and saturation indices calculations.
   Quartz geothermometers gave equilibrium temperatures ranging from 93 degrees C in the Ayer Hangat hot spring to 154 degrees C in the Lojing hot spring. This requires 398 to 649 kJ/kg energy to heat the water suggesting an intermediate enthalpy. These results also pointed out that some of the studied hot springs have potential to generate adequate heat, which could be harnessed for energy generation upon further work to prove their viability.

AB  - The fresh water scarcity is the contemporary issue for all areas around the globe due to available water getting polluted by various anthropogenic activities. The conventional Reverse osmosis (RO) system for purification of water needs electricity for its working and generation of electricity by conventional source emits polluting elements which is detrimental for the environment. Unlike conventional RO system, solar based water purification system called solar still is environment friendly and has the potential to mitigate the contemporary issue of fresh water scarcity. Various designs and material selection has been reported by researchers around the globe. In this review work, an effort by authors have been put to summarize double slope solar based water purification units by incorporating different kinds of collectors. After studying different solar based double slope water purification units, a comparison has been made on the basis of yield. It has been concluded that solar based double slope water purification unit incorporated with evacuated tubular collectors is better than other similar setups. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Regiella insecticola is a bacterial endosymbiont in insects that exhibits a negative effect on the fitness of hosts. Thus, it is not clear why this costly endosymbiont can persist in host populations. Here, we tested a hypothesis that the infection pattern and negative roles of the endosymbiont were not constant but environmentally dependent. The grain aphids Sitobion avenae, belonging to different genotypes and infected with Regiella or not, were used in this study. We found that S. avenae populations were infected with Regiella, Hamiltonella defensa, Serratia symbiotica and Rickettsia. The predominant endosymbionts in the aphid populations varied with season. Serratia and Rickettsia were predominant from December to February while Regiella predominated from March to May. The vertical transmission of Regiella was poorer at high temperature, but following conditioning for seven generations, the transmission rate improved. Regiella inhibited the production of winged aphids at 25 degrees C, but it did not affect winged morph production at the higher temperatures of 28 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Regiella infection decreased the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) of aphids at 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C. However, at 31 degrees C, the effect of Regiella on the r(m) varied depending on the aphid genotype and density. Thus, the negative effects of this endosymbiont on its host were environmentally dependent.

AB  - For ectothermic animals, ambient temperature strongly influences developmental growth rate and individual fitness. While many ectotherms live in environments that are spatially hetero-thermal, the coupling between behavioural phenotypes (e.g., shy or bold behaviour) and thermal preferences remains uncertain. Relative to shy counterparts, bolder phenotypes may exert higher preference for ambient temperatures that are closer to their thermal optimum, thereby accelerating development. In addition, ectotherms should select colder temperatures in low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) according to the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis. Using wild caught carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus), this study examined thermoregulatory behaviour in individuals exhibiting consistent behavioural phenotypes along the shy-bold continuum and between ecologically relevant normal oxygen concentration (normoxic) and hypoxic treatments. Furthermore, the behaviour observed in the laboratory was compared to environmental data from the natal stream. Results demonstrated that individual shy-bold behavioural phenotype was consistent before and after a simulated aerial predator attack, indicating consistency of behaviour across situations. Individual preferred and avoidance temperatures varied substantially, but were unrelated to shy-bold behavioural phenotypes. In contrast, individual preferred and maximum avoidance temperatures were significantly reduced in hypoxia, consistent with the OCLTT hypothesis. These findings might indicate suppressed development rates in hypoxia, not only by the limited oxygen for aerobic metabolism, but also by the preference for colder water in hypoxia. Furthermore, the tolerated thermal ranges were reduced in hypoxia. Using test conditions confirmed by field data, our study demonstrates the strong influence of oxygen availability on thermoregulatory behaviours and preferences in aquatic environments.

AB  - Packed bed thermal energy storage (TES) systems have been identified in the last years as one of the most promising TES alternatives in terms of thermal efficiency and economic viability. The relative simplicity of this storage concept opens an important opportunity to its implementation in many environments, from the renewable solar-thermal frame to the industrial waste heat recovery. In addition, its implicit flexibility allows the use of a wide variety of solid materials and heat transfer fluids, which leads to its deployment in very different applications. Its potential to overcome current heat storage system limitations regarding suitable temperature ranges or storage capacities has also been pointed out. However, the full implementation of the packed bed storage concept is still incomplete since no industrial scale units are under operation. The main underlying reasons are associated to the lack of a complete extraction of the full potential of this storage technology, derived from a successful system optimization in terms of material selection, design, and thermal management. These points have been evidenced as critical in order to attain high thermal efficiency values, comparable to the state-of-the-art storage technologies, with improved technoeconomic performance. In order to bring this storage technology to a more mature status, closer to a successful industrial deployment, this paper proposes a double approach. First, a low-cost by-product material with high thermal performance is used as heat storage material in the packed bed. Second, a complete energetic and efficiency analysis of the storage system is introduced as a function of the thermal operation. Overall, the impact of both the selected storage material and the different thermal operation strategies is discussed by means of a thermal model which permits a careful discussion about the implications of each TES deployment strategy and the underlying governing mechanisms. The results show the paramount importance of the selected operation method, able to increase the resulting cycle and material usage efficiency up to values comparable to standard currently used TES solutions.

AB  - Bioclimatic envelope models of species' responses to climate change are used to predict how species will respond to increasing temperatures. These models are frequently based on the assumption that the northern and southern boundaries of a species' range define its thermal niche. However, this assumption may be violated if populations are adapted to local temperature regimes and have evolved population-specific thermal optima. Considering the prevalence of local adaptation, the assumption of a species-wide thermal optimum may be violated for many species. We used spatially and temporally extensive demographic data for American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) to examine range-wide variation in response of population growth rate (.) to climatic factors. Our results suggest adaptation to local temperature, but not precipitation. For each population,. was maximized when annual temperatures were similar to site-specific, long-term mean temperatures. Populations from disparate climatic zones responded differently to temperature variation, and there was a linear relation between population-level thermal optima and the 30-year mean temperature at each site. For species that are locally adapted to temperature, bioclimatic envelope models may underestimate the extent to which increasing temperatures will decrease population growth rate. Because any directional change from long-term mean temperatures will decrease population growth rates, all populations throughout a species' range will be adversely affected by temperature increase, not just populations at southern and low-elevation boundaries. Additionally, when a species' local thermal niche is narrower than its range-wide thermal niche, a smaller temperature increase than would be predicted by bioclimatic envelope approaches may be sufficient to decrease population growth.

AB  - Selected results of thermal analyzes of heating systems with vapor compressor heat pumps and horizontal ground heat exchangers are presented in this paper. Operation of this system for two lengths of heat exchanger pipes was considered and compared. The thermal analyzes concern two consecutive heating seasons. During heating seasons the heat pump works periodically, supplying heat to a small residential house. Heat is also periodically transferred from the ground to the heat pump unit. The demand for heat for this house, variable in time, was calculated. The heat pump is supported by an additional, conventional heat source when heat pump productivity is insufficient. The characteristic operating parameters of this system (among others: characteristic temperatures, heat fluxes, electric driving power of the compressor) are variable in time. The thermal state of the ground is also variable in time. Natural, thermal regeneration of the ground during spring and summer, when the heat pump system does not operate, was taken into account. The thermal analyzes of the system enable one to compare the electric energy consumption in the system: heat pump-ground heat exchanger and energy transferred from the additional heat source to the heated space during the first and the second heating seasons. The results presented in this paper also make it possible to determine the influence of the length of the horizontal ground heat exchanger pipes on the functioning parameters of this system during two-seasonal operation.

AB  - The biomass gasification coupled with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for combined heat and power generations. For the development and improvement of the integrated process systems, the optimization problem has more than one conflicting objective functions to be optimized (i.e., thermodynamic performance, environmental impacts, annual profit, capital and operating costs) simultaneously. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are used to find a set of optimal (or non-dominated) solutions. In this work, MOO of a sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification (SEG) integrated with an SOFC and gas turbine (GT) system, for combined heat and power production from Eucalyptus wood chips as biomass feedstock, is investigated. Firstly, the model of this integrated plant is developed in Aspen Plus that can be divided into five parts: (1) SEG, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC, (4) catalytic burning, GT and CO2 compression, and (5) Portland cement production. As the annual profit demonstrates the economic viability of the plant and annualized capital cost (ACC) indicates availability of investments, the MOO of the integrated plant is performed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions based on the minimization of ACC and maximization of annual profit with five important decision variables. After that, ten selection methods are used to recommend practical solutions for implementing in the integrated plant. In order to explore the effect of decision variables uncertainty on obtained Pareto-optimal solutions, random variations in decision variables are used to quantify deviations in objective functions. The Pareto-optimal solutions are ranked based on the normalized variations for decision variables uncertainty. At the end of this study, robust MOO of the integrated plant is performed, with respect to uncertainties in the market and operating parameters.

AB  - Aim To understand whether climate limits current sea turtle nesting distributions and shapes the ecological niche of the terrestrial life-history stage of these wide-ranging marine vertebrates. Location Coastlines world-wide. Methods I predicted the spatial distributions of nesting habitat under current climatic conditions for seven sea turtle species using information criteria and maximum entropy modelling. I also compared niche similarity among species using three niche metrics: I, Schoener's D and relative rank. Results Sea turtles currently nest across their entire bioclimatic envelopes, with up to six species predicted to nest on a single beach. The Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Australasia support high nesting diversity, with most regional areas supporting three to five species. Despite large overlap in nesting distributions among species, loggerhead and green turtles have the broadest environmental niches, while Kemp's ridley and flatback turtles have very narrow niches. Main conclusions The terrestrial nesting habitat of sea turtles is characterized by distinct climatic conditions, which are linked to the physical conditions necessary for eggs to hatch successfully and allow hatchlings to disperse from natal areas. Despite broad geographic patterns of overlap and similar embryonic tolerances to temperature and moisture among species, sea turtles partition habitat by nesting in different niche spaces. The tight link between current geographic patterns of nesting and climate, along with the dependence of developing embryos on nest microclimate, imply that regional or global changes in environmental conditions could differentially influence the distribution of sea turtle species under climate change. This could influence the adaptive potential of different populations, and predicting these responses before they occur will be important in mitigating the effects of climate change.

AB  - The importance of water cannot be overstated. It is the most important natural resource for our survival and development. The development of suitable materials for efficient water purification will provide a critical contribution for sustainable water use. In this context, a gel-emulsion-templated synthesis of a polymeric aerogel has been developed for water treatment. Owing to its hydrophobic nature, the aerogel shows high sorption (nearly 20 times its weight) for organic liquids, such as toluene, phenol, and nitrobenzene, and can be used to remove them from water. The aerogel shows low thermal conductivity (0.032 W m(-1) K-1) and excellent light absorption efficiency (>92 %) after carbonization, which provides the possibility for the construction of an interfacial solar vapor generation system. The as-prepared materials are used to develop a two-step approach to remove both organic and inorganic contaminants (salts) from water. Importantly, the aerogel shows excellent reusability and high efficiency both for oil sorption and for solar vapor generation. Moreover, the low cost and easy scale-up of the preparation process lay a solid foundation for practical application. It is anticipated that the prepared aerogels would contribute not only to water purification but also to other related areas.

AB  - Growth and survival of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) were studied in tryptic soy broth (TSB), brain-heart infusion (BHI), and whole milk at 12, 9.5, 8.5, 7.5, 6.5, and 5.5 degrees C (+/-0.2 degrees C). Colony forming units (cfu) were enumerated by surface plating on eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Growth curves were plotted and lag and generation times were determined. Results indicated that the average generation times for each strain was similar in each medium (4.6+/-0.9 h) at 12 degrees C. However, at 9.5 degrees C the average generation time differed significantly among the media (P<0.05). The average generation time was longer in BHI compared to TSB and whole milk at 9.5 degrees C (14 h in BHI vs 11 h in milk and TSB). Also, the generation time of individual strains in BHI varied from 9.5-22 h at 9.5 degrees C. Decrease of temperature to 8.5 degrees C resulted in lack of growth of two strains in BHI. At 7.5 degrees C none of the strains grew in BHI, one grew in TSB, whereas all grew in milk. A further decrease of temperature to 6.5 degrees C did not allow growth of any of the strains in TSB or BHI whereas all grew in milk. Addition of 5% lactose to TSB and BHI enabled survival and growth of all strains at 6.5 degrees C. The results of this study demonstrate the influence of growth medium composition on the minimum growth temperature of verotoxigenic E. coli. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB  - Aimed at improving the tensile strength and creep resistance of a rare earth-modified A356 alloy, this study adjusted the Mg and Mn concentration in the alloy, specifically aiming to transform the harmful Al5FeSi and Al9FeSi3Mg5 phase into Al-15(Fe,Mn)(3)Si-2. It was found that lowering the Mg concentration from 0.49 to 0.25 wt.% and raising the Mn concentration from 0.10 to 0.41 wt.% resulted in a near complete transformation of the Fe-bearing phases. This transformation led to a greater total volume fraction of Fe-intermetallics (2.9 to 4.1%), without affecting the volume fraction of the desirable, temperature-resistant, AlSiRE phase. Moreover, the chemistry modification led to a shift in the morphology of the AlSiRE phase while reducing its size. Combined with the decreased volume fraction of the harmful Fe precipitates, the chemistry modification improved the yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and modulus of elasticity by similar to 14%, 9%, and 10%, respectively. In addition, the steady-state creep rates of the high Mn alloy were lower at all stresses as compared to the low Mn alloy and the fracture stress was similar to 15 MPa higher, reaching 100% of the alloy's original 250 degrees C YS.

AB  - Tadpole development was compared in three amphibian species (Bufo calamita, B. bufo and Rana temporaria) that suffer different risks of pond desiccation in nature. Using a replicated pond system, development was monitored in desiccating and non-desiccating ponds, and in vertical-sided and gently shelving ('shoreline') ponds. In desiccating ponds, tadpoles suffered from crowding effects and metamorphosed at a smaller size, but development was not accelerated in response to desiccation in any of the three species. Desiccating ponds had higher maximum temperatures but also lower minimum temperatures, which may explain the lack of ally difference in development time between desiccating and non-desiccating ponds. Although shoreline ponds were slightly warmer than vertical-sided ponds, development under these conditions was also consistent with a crowding, rather than a temperature, effect. In shoreline ponds, metamorphosis generally took longer, was less synchronized between individuals, and resulted in a smaller size at metamorphosis, compared to development in vertical-sided ponds. The lack of species-by-desiccation interactions indicated that there were no differences between the three species in developmental plasticity. Developmental constraints may place a limit on the degree of plasticity that can evolve in a species such as B, calamita, which breeds only in ephemeral ponds with a variable hydroperiod. Alternatively, low genetic variability within British populations of B. calamita may have cont;trained the evolution of adaptive plasticity in this species.

AB  - Cyclic seasonal variation of genotype-specific fertility could interact with endemic diseases characterized by seasonal variation of severity resulting in changes of gene frequencies in the course of generations. Assuming that a given allele A has a frequency p(w) in infants conceived in the cold season and a frequency of p(s) in those conceived in the warm season and assuming that general fertility is the same in the two seasonal periods, the gene frequency in the population is p(m) = (p(w) + p(s))/2; this frequency remains constant over the course of generations. The introduction of an endemic disease bearing negatively on general fertility and characterized by a seasonal pattern of severity could result in variations of the A allele frequency. If the maximum of endemicity coincides with the maximum value of the allele A frequency, the frequency of allele A will progressively decrease. A simple mathematical algorithm has been applied to two polymorphic enzymes (ACP1 and G6PD) correlated with past malarial morbidity in Sardinia and the Po River delta. The two systems show differences in gene frequency in relation to season of conception. The theoretical changes fit quite well with the data observed in Sardinian and Po delta populations, thus suggesting a mechanism that is an alternative to or concurrent with the classical mechanism that assumes a direct connection between the genetic systems and the biology of the malarial parasite.

AB  - Variation in climatic conditions is an important driving force of ecological processes. Populations are under selection to respond to climatic changes with respect to phenology of the annual cycle (e.g. breeding, migration) and life-history. As teleconnections can reflect climate on a global scale, the responses of terrestrial animals are often investigated in relation to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation. However, investigation of other teleconnections and local climate is often neglected. In this study, we examined over a 33-year period the relationships between four teleconnections (El Nino-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, East Atlantic Pattern), local weather parameters (temperature and precipitation) and reproduction in great tits Parus major and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus in the Carpathian Basin, Hungary. Furthermore, we explored how annual variations in the timing of food availability were correlated with breeding performance. In both species, annual laying date was negatively associated with the Arctic Oscillation. The date of peak abundance of caterpillars was negatively associated with local temperatures in December-January, while laying date was negatively related to January-March temperature. We found that date of peak abundance of caterpillars and laying date of great tits advanced, while in blue tits clutch size decreased over the decades but laying date did not advance. The results suggest that weather conditions during the months that preceded the breeding season, as well as temporally more distant winter conditions, were connected to breeding date. Our results highlight that phenological synchronization to food availability was different between the two tit species, namely it was disrupted in blue tits only. Additionally, the results suggest that in order to find the climatic drivers of the phenological changes of organisms, we should analyze a broader range of global meteorological parameters.

AB  - Elevation of active sigma(E) levels in Escherichia coli by either repressing the expression of rseA encoding an anti-sigma(E) factor or cloning rpoE in a multicopy plasmid, led to a large decrease in the number of dead cells and the accumulation of cellular proteins in the medium in the stationary phase. The numbers of CFU, however, were nearly the same as those of the wild type or cells devoid of the cloned gene. In the wild-type cells, rpoE expression was increased in the stationary phase and a low-level release of intracellular proteins was observed. These results suggest that dead fell lysis in stationary-phase E. coli occurs in a sigma(E)-dependent fashion. We propose there is a novel physiological function of the sigma(E) regulon that may guarantee cell survival in prolonged stationary phase by providing nutrients from dead cells for the next generation.

AB  - Most animal species have a complex life cycle (CLC) with metamorphosis. It is thus of interest to examine possible benefits of such life histories. The prevailing view is that CLC represents an adaptation for genetic decoupling of juvenile and adult traits, thereby allowing life stages to respond independently to different selective forces. Here I propose an additional potential advantage of CLCs that is, decreased variance in population growth rate due to habitat separation of life stages. Habitat separation of pre- and post-metamorphic stages means that the stages will experience different regimes of environmental variability. This is in contrast to species with simple life cycles (SLC) whose life stages often occupy one and the same habitat. The correlation in the fluctuations of the vital rates of life stages is therefore likely to be weaker in complex than in simple life cycles. By a theoretical framework using an analytical approach, I have (1) derived the relative advantage, in terms of long-run growth rate, of CLC over SLC phenotypes for a broad spectrum of life histories, and (2) explored which life histories that benefit most by a CLC, that is avoid correlation in vital rates between life stages. The direction and magnitude of gain depended on life history type and fluctuating vital rate. One implication of our study is that species with CLCs should, on average, be more robust to increased environmental variability caused by global warming than species with SLCs.

AB  - During anaerobic digestion, organic matter is converted to carbon dioxide and methane, and organic nitrogen is converted to ammonia. Generally, ammonia is recycled as a fertilizer or removed via nitrification-denitrification in treatment systems; alternatively it could be recovered and catalytically converted to hydrogen, thus supplying additional fuel. To provide a basis for further investigation, a theoretical energy balance for a model system that incorporates anaerobic digestion, ammonia separation and recovery, and conversion of the ammonia to hydrogen is reported. The model Anaerobic Digestion-Bioammonia to Hydrogen (ADBH) system energy demands including heating, pumping, mixing, and ammonia reforming were subtracted from the total energy output from methane and hydrogen to create an overall energy balance. The energy balance was examined for the ADBH system operating with a fixed feedstock loading rate with C:N ratios (gC/gN) ranging from 136 to 3 which imposed corresponding total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations of 20-10,000 mg/L. Normalizing total energy potential to the methane potential alone indicated that at a C:N ratio of 17, the energy output was greater for the ADBH system than from anaerobic digestion generating only methane. Decreasing the C:N ratio increased the methane content of the biogas comprising primarily methane to >80% and increased the ammonia stripping energy demand. The system required 23-34% of the total energy generated as parasitic losses with no energy integration, but when internally produced heat and pressure differentials were recovered, parasitic losses were reduced to between 8 and 17%.

AB  - The effects of light intensity and salinity on eggs and yolk sac larvae of summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus were examined under controlled laboratory conditions. Fertilized eggs (early gastrula stage), obtained by induced spawning of captive broodstock, were stocked (53 eggs/L) into forty-eight 5-L translucent containers under light intensities of 0 (constant dark), 500, 1,000, and 2,000 Ix and at salinities of 26, 31, and 36 g/L. Temperature was 19 degrees C and photoperiod was 12 h light : 12 h dark. Light intensity and salinity produced significant (P < 0.05) additive effects on larval growth. At the stage when 97% of the yolk sac was absorbed (114-131 h postfertilization, hpf), at the first-feeding stage (129.5-135 hpf), and at yolk exhaustion (153.5-159 hpf), notochord lengths were generally maximal at low light intensity (500 Ix) and high salinity (36 g/L) and minimal at high intensity (2,000 1x) and low salinity (26 g/L). Yolk utilization efficiency declined significantly (P < 0.01) with increasing light intensity, presumably due to light-induced activity. Largest larvae were produced under low light intensity (500 Ix) and high-salinity (36 g/L), conditions consistent with shelf waters where eggs and early larvae of summer flounder prevail in nature. High survival (85.1%) to yolk exhaustion under all light intensities and salinities reflects an adaptability for inshore movement during the pelagic larval phase.

KW  - PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS
AB  - The main use of leather is to protect the body against external environment and to provide comfort. However, leather may be used for additional functions specific to 1) an adverse or extreme climate and 2) job-ambience or profession so as to enhance adaptability and productivity of the user. When such an application arises, the leather is termed as "smart material". Making leather perform the functions it did as a skin on a live animal renders it as smart leather. Hence, the futuristic objective is to make the processed skin termed "leather" retain its memory so as to result in "smart or intelligent leather". In this paper, it has been attempted to incorporate thermo responsive function into leathers using smart materials such as phase changing materials (PCM). PCMs are capable of absorbing or releasing large amount of heat during phase transitions between two solid states and/or liquid and solid states. Manufacture of syntans using PCM based on two different prepolymers viz, melamine formaldehyde and naphthalene sulfonic acid has been attempted in this paper. The retanning agents synthesized have been characterized using various techniques like FT-IR, DSC, TGA and SEM analysis. Leathers made using PCM incorporated retanning agents have been tested for various properties viz, strength properties, thermal stability, organoleptic properties to study the influence of the PCM incorporated retanning agents.

AB  - Co-occurring species often differ in intraspecific genetic diversity, which in turn can affect adaptation in response to environmental change. Specifically, the simultaneous evolutionary responses of co-occurring species to temporal environmental change may influence community dynamics. Local adaptation along environmental gradients combined with gene flow can enhance genetic diversity of traits within populations. Quantitative genetic theory shows that having greater gene flow results in (a) lower equilibrium population size due to maladaptive immigrant genotypes (migration load), but (b) faster adaptation to changing environments. Here, I build off this theory to study community dynamics of locally adapted species in response to temporal environmental changes akin to warming temperatures. Although an abrupt environmental change leaves all species initially maladapted, high gene flow species subsequently adapt faster due to greater genetic diversity. As a result, species can transiently reverse their relative abundances, but sometimes only after long lag periods. If constant temporal environmental change is applied, the community exhibits a shift toward stable dominance by species with intermediate gene flow. Notably, fast-adapting high gene flow species can increase in absolute abundance under environmental change (although often only for a transient period) because the change suppresses superior competitors with lower gene flow. This eco-evolutionary competitive release stabilizes ecosystem function. The eco-evolutionary community turnover studied here parallels the purely ecological successional dynamics following disturbances. My results demonstrate how interspecific variation in life history can have far-reaching impacts on eco-evolutionary community response to environmental change.

AB  - Failure of organisms to adapt to sudden environmental changes may lead to extinction. The type of mating system, by affecting fertility and the strength of sexual selection, may have a major impact on a population's chances to adapt and survive. Here, we use experimental evolution in bulb mites (Rhizoglyphus robini) to examine the effects of the mating system on population performance under environmental change. We demonstrate that populations in which monogamy was enforced suffered a dramatic fitness decline when evolving at an increased temperature, whereas the negative effects of change in a thermal environment were alleviated in polygamous populations. Strikingly, within 17 generations, all monogamous populations experiencing higher temperature went extinct, whereas all polygamous populations survived. Our results show that the mating system may have dramatic effects on the risk of extinction under environmental change.

AB  - An advanced oxidative process relying on the interaction of peroxymonosulphate and cobalt(II) was implemented for generating the sulphate radicals in flow analysis, in order to accomplish in-line sample preparation thus improving the spectrophotometric determination of phosphate and phosphite in liquid foliar fertilizers. To this end, a flow-batch system with a heated chamber was designed. The sample was handled twice, with and without the step of phosphite oxidation to phosphate, and the formed orthophosphate was quantified after interaction with the vanadate-molybdate reagent. Phosphite was determined as the difference in analytical signals corresponding to sample handling with and without the oxidation step. Influence of Co(II) on the peroxymonosulphate activation, reagent concentrations and added volumes, acidity, temperature and heating time were investigated like aiming at to improve analytical recovery and measurement repeatability, as well as the and system ruggedness. The 6.6-20.0 mg L-1 P2O5 standards were in-line prepared from a single stock solution. Detection limits were estimated as 0.8 and 0.1 mg L-1 for P2O5 and P-PO4. Twenty-four samples are were run per hour, and results are were in agreement with those obtained by the official procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here, we reared the loquat psyllid, Cacopsylla biwa Inoue (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) at different temperatures to examine the effects of temperature on their development. Cacopsylla biwa successfully developed in the 10-25 degrees C range, and the optimal temperature range from oviposition to adult emergence was 10-20 degrees C. The developmental zero (T-0) and effective accumulative temperature (k) for the development of eggs and oviposition to adult emergence were 7.0 degrees C and 127 degrees-days, and 6.5 degrees C and 521 degrees-days, respectively. Based on these values, the number of annual generations of C. biwa in Tokushima prefecture in the 2016-2017 was estimated to be 7 without reproductive diapause, developmental delay due to high temperatures, and pre-oviposition period. We also conducted a field study to monitor the occurrence of C. biwa adult using yellow sticky traps. During the occurrence period of the 3rd-6th generations after summer diapause, the data estimated laboratory experiments were consistent with the observed data in the field. However, the occurrence periods of the 1st-2nd generation and the 7th generation could not be confirmed owing to unclear peaks of caught adults. Based on the findings of our rearing experiments, the low density observed in the field may have been due to developmental delays caused by high temperatures.

AB  - Increasing use of deshelled Jatropha seeds will result in a rising amount of seed shells as processing residues. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the physical and chemical properties of Jatropha seed shell and ashes as well as the development and testing of a robust and functional combustion unit for the thermal use those residual materials.
   Analyses of physical and chemical properties of jatropha seed shell and ash were done according to standard methods and compared to rice husk and pinewood.
   The combustion of Jatropha seed shell for heat generation is well accomplishable without previous processing of seed shell such as pelletizing or briquetting. Thermal power was between 11.1 kW and 36.7 kW corresponding to a feeding rate of Jatropha seed shells between 2.9 kg/h and 9.0 kg/h with furnace efficiency of 87% and 91%.
   Ash melting and slag creation on the grate as well as clogging of the combustion air supply holes, by sintering ash on the grate was not observed. The concentrations of CO in the flue gas was 2.8 +/- 0.8 g/m(3) and therefore lower than threshold value with 4 g/m(3) for CO emission for combustion of wood according to German legal requirements for combustion units up to 50 kW.
   Coarse ashes are suitable for application as fertilizer in agriculture due to their high contents of the major plant nutrients. However, attention has to be paid to the content of heavy metals, which has to be reduced by suitable methods. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper outlines the development of a 2-D axisymmetnic mathematical model to predict the evolution of temperature during the Direct Chill (DC) casting of AZ31 magnesium billets. Model predictions of temperature have been compared to measurements made on an industrial DC casting machine at Timminco Ltd. in Haley, Ontario. These measurements have been used to fine-tune the thermal boundary conditions employed in the mathematical model. The model, which is based on the commercial finite-element code ABAQUS, has been developed as part of a strategic project aimed at improving the DC casting process for light metals through a reduction in casting related defects and increased productivity.

AB  - Background: Evaluating the limits of adaptation to temperature is important given the IPCC-predicted rise in global temperatures. The rate and scope of evolutionary adaptation can be limited by low genetic diversity, gene flow, and costs associated with adaptive change. Freshwater organisms are physically confined to lakes and rivers, and must therefore deal directly with climate variation and change. In this study, we take advantage of a system characterised by low genetic variation, small population size, gene flow and between-trait trade-offs to study how such conditions affect the ability of a freshwater fish to adapt to climate change. We test for genetically-based differences in developmental traits indicating local adaptation, by conducting a common-garden experiment using embryos and larvae from replicate pairs of sympatric grayling demes that spawn and develop in natural cold and warm water, respectively. These demes have common ancestors from a colonization event 22 generations ago. Consequently, we explore if diversification may occur under severely constraining conditions.
   Results: We found evidence for divergence in ontogenetic rates. The divergence pattern followed adaptation predictions as cold-deme individuals displayed higher growth rates and yolk conversion efficiency than warm-deme individuals at the same temperature. The cold-deme embryos had a higher rate of muscle mass development. Most of the growth-and development differences occurred prior to hatch. The divergence was probably not caused by genetic drift as there was a strong degree of parallelism in the divergence pattern and because phenotypic differentiation (Q(ST)) was larger than estimated genetic drift levels (microsatellite F-ST) between demes from different temperature groups. We also document that these particular grayling populations cannot develop successfully at temperatures above 12 degrees C, whereas other European populations can, and that increasing the muscle mass development rate comes at the cost of some skeletal trait development rates.
   Conclusions: This study shows that genetically based phenotypic divergence can prevail even under conditions of low genetic variation and ongoing gene flow. Furthermore, population-specific maximum development temperatures along with musculoskeletal developmental trade-offs may constrain adaptation.

AB  - Global warming may impact biodiversity by disrupting biological interactions, including long-term insectmicrobe mutualistic associations. Symbiont-mediated insect tolerance to high temperatures is an ecologically important trait that significantly influences an insect's life history. Disruption of microbial symbionts that are required by insects would substantially impact their pest status. Diaphorina citri, a worldwide citrus pest, is associated with the mutualistic symbionts Candidatus Carsonella ruddii and Candidatus Profftella armatura. Wolbachia is also associated with D. citri, but its contribution to the host is unknown. Symbiont density is dependent on a range of factors, including the thermosensitivity of the host and/or symbiont to heat stress. Here, we predicted that short-term heat stress of D. citri would disrupt the hostsymbiont phenological synchrony and differentially affect the growth and density of symbionts. We investigated the effects of exposing D. citri eggs to different temperatures for different periods of time on the growth dynamics of symbionts during the nymphal development of D. citri (first instar to fifth instar) by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Symbiont densities were assessed as the number of gene copies, using specific molecular markers: 16S rRNA for Carsonella and Profftella and ftsZ for Wolbachia. Statistical modeling of the copy numbers of symbionts revealed differences in their growth patterns, particularly in the early instars of heat-shocked insects. Wolbachia was the only symbiont to benefit from heat-shock treatment. Although the symbionts responded differently to heat stress, the lack of differences in symbiont densities between treated and control late nymphs suggests the existence of an adaptive genetic process to restore phenological synchrony during the development of immatures in preparation for adult life. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the potential deleterious effects of high temperatures on host-symbiont interactions. Our data also suggest that the effects of host exposure to high temperatures in symbiont growth are highly variable and dependent on the interactions among members of the community of symbionts harbored by a host. Such dependence points to unpredictable consequences for agroecosystems worldwide due to climate change-related effects on the ecological traits of symbiont-dependent insect pests.

AB  - White peach scale (Pseudaulacaspis pentagona) is a polyphagous pest of perennial horticulture in Asia and many other warmtemperate and tropical regions. In China, it is a serious pest of kiwifruit. The optimal time to control P. pentagona field populations is at the first instar stage of the first, spring generation. Three methods for predicting the hatching of eggs of the first generation from field populations were tested on kiwifruit in Sichuan, based upon the accumulation of heat units (day-degrees) above a developmental threshold, calculated as 10.75 degrees C. A method developed for P. pentagona control in tea in Japan gave excellent predictions of 50% hatching in 5 of the 6 years under study (2009-2014). The other two methods also gave acceptable predictions of dates of 50% egg hatching (within 5 days of field observed dates). These models may be used as a basis for forecasting spring insecticide application dates targeting the first instar stage (crawlers and settled 'white caps').

AB  - Species' thermal limits play a key role in determining spatial distributions and understanding their response to changing environments. Manipulation of thermal habitat is a potential avenue of exploration for management of invasive species such as the cold-water rainbow smelt(Osmerus mordax), which has adverse effects on native fish communities in central North American inland lakes. In an effort to test the thermal limits and selectively eradicate rainbow smelt, we experimentally mixed Crystal Lake, Wisconsin, USA, during summer of 2012 and 2013 to warm the hypolimnion and eliminate cold-water habitat. This whole-ecosystem manipulation allowed for field testing of published thermal thresholds reported for rainbow smelt. The rainbow smelt population responded to the thermal manipulation by exhibiting unexpected shifts in behavior, intrapopulation divergence in body condition, and significant population declines. Small individuals of each adult age-class tended to survive the manipulation, and the population persisted despite high mortality rates. Our results indicate a high degree of size-based intrapopulation variation in thermal sensitivity for this species. Our findings also raise questions regarding applicability of lab-and model-derived thermal limits to field scenarios, highlighting a need for further field evaluations of species' thermal limits.

AB  - Tropical ectotherms are thought to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they are thermal specialists, having evolved in aseasonal thermal environments. However, even within the tropics, habitat structure can influence opportunities for behavioral thermoregulation. Open (and edge) habitats likely promote more effective thermoregulation due to the high spatial heterogeneity of the thermal landscape, while forests are thermally homogenous and may constrain opportunities for behavioral buffering of environmental temperatures. Nevertheless, the ways in which behavior and physiology interact at local scales to influence the response to climate change are rarely investigated. We examined the thermal ecology and physiology of two lizard species that occupy distinct environments in the tropics. The brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) lives along forest edges in The Bahamas, whereas the Panamanian slender anole (Anolis apletophallus) lives under the canopy of mature forests in Panama. We combined detailed estimates of environmental variation, thermoregulatory behavior, and physiology to model the vulnerability of each of these species. Our projections suggest that forest-dwelling slender anoles will experience severely reduced locomotor performance, activity time, and energy budgets as the climate warms over the coming century. Conversely, the forest-edge-dwelling brown anoles may use behavioral compensation in the face of warming, maintaining population viability for many decades. Our results indicate that local habitat variation, through its effects on behavior and physiology, is a major determinant of vulnerability to climate change. When attempting to predict the impacts of climate change on a given population, broad-scale characteristics such as latitude may have limited predictive power.

AB  - Climate change and pesticide resistance are two of the most imminent challenges human society is facing today. Knowledge of how the evolution of pesticide resistance may be affected by climate change such as increasing air temperature on the planet is important for agricultural production and ecological sustainability in the future but is lack in scientific literatures reported from empirical research. Here, we used the azoxystrobin-Phytophthora infestans interaction in agricultural systems to investigate the contributions of environmental temperature to the evolution of pesticide resistance and infer the impacts of global warming on pesticide efficacy and future agricultural production and ecological sustainability. We achieved this by comparing azoxystrobin sensitivity of 180 P. infestans isolates sampled from nine geographic locations in China under five temperature schemes ranging from 13 to 25 degrees C. We found that local air temperature contributed greatly to the difference of azoxystrobin tolerance among geographic populations of the pathogen. Both among-population and within-population variations in azoxystrobin tolerance increased as experimental temperatures increased. We also found that isolates with higher azoxystrobin tolerance adapted to a broader thermal niche. These results suggest that global warming may enhance the risk of developing pesticide resistance in plant pathogens and highlight the increased challenges of administering pesticides for effective management of plant diseases to support agricultural production and ecological sustainability under future thermal conditions.

TI  - Placement and reflow of solder balls for FC, BGA, wafer-level-CSP, optoelectronic components and MEMS by using a new solder jetting method
T2  - 2002 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MICROELECTRONICS, PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
CP  - International Symposium on Microelectronics
AB  - Today the requirements for the packaging of optoelectronics and MEMS devices can no longer be met with standard flux-based processes which use a long temperature reflow profile and are implementing a lot of mechanical handling steps and processes. Basically, the packaging of these new devices requires fluxless soldering, no thermal stress by localized heating, low respectively no mechanical contact and damage on sensitive membranes in MEMS or optical components (like lenses, etc.). Some of these applications even require 3D-packaging and selective solder application in 3D-structures, like cavity, vertical assembly, etc. An additional, very challenging requirement is a high flexibility in solder alloys because eutectic SnPb and other lead-based solder alloys are not applicable. Instead AuSn and Indium,based solder alloys are required.
   In order to fulfill the specific needs in these applications, a new laser-based solder jetting technology has been developed. This technology fulfills all the needs of fluxless soldering, local heating and reflow, no mechanical contact and stress during soldering, high solder alloy flexibility and capability of 3D-packaging. Prior to developing the Solder Ball Bumper Jet (SB2-Jet) process, many potential applications have been elaborated using the Solder Ball Bumping (SB2)-technology. The advantage of SB2-Jet is basically the higher throughput which the jet process. With a throughput of 10 balls/s, it fulfills most of the requirements for today's packaging of optoelectronics and MEMS devices in production. A further increase in speed to 20 and 30 balls/s is in progress for the next generation. An additional feature of the SB2-and SB2-Jet-technology is the repair option and repair capability. This permits individual removal and replacement of solder balls and solder contacts and allows to increase the yield and productivity of cost-intensive high end devices.

AB  - Despite the fact that cold weather has been widely documented as a major factor that can elevate the mortality in a subtropical population due to a lack of adaptability, the disastrous impacts from a major cold event in East Asia caused by a super El Nino event in January 2016 have passed largely unreported. In order to minimize the catastrophic risk from such events given ongoing concerns about climate change, as also noted in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR), it is important to evaluate the individual- and community-level shifts in mortality patterns during such cold waves, in order to develop health protocols for surveillance and disaster planning.
   This study evaluated the impacts of the 2016 cold wave on mortality patterns in Hong Kong because this city has been highlighted as a city with severe negative impacts from the disaster by social media. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we found significantly higher daily mortality for up to ten weeks during this cold wave compared to the same calendar days between 2007 and 2015. We also found that the short-term impact of the cold wave was prolonged and fatal, with the potential to increase the mortality across the city for up to five weeks compared to the pre-disaster period. An examination of the individual- and community-level shifts in mortality patterns reveals that the unmarried and economically inactive were most vulnerable during the 2016 cold wave, and respiratory diseases were the greatest medical problems, while age and gender effects as well as cardiovascular diseases did not enhance the fatal effect. The excessive mortality was citywide, and not limited to particular locations or specific characteristics of a community within the city. Based on the results, disaster education as well as social and health services should be provided to all local people for an extended period in order to minimize the fatal and prolonged effects of future cold waves.

AB  - Global climate warming has been exerting impacts on agricultural pests. Pests also take some strategies to adapt to climate change. Understanding such adaptation could benefit more accurate predictions and integrated management of pest. However, adaptation to climate change has not been widely investigated in agricultural pests but has been well documented in model species, Drosophila, and reviewed by Hoffmann before 2003. To provide recent progress and references for agricultural entomologists who interested in thermal biology, here we have reviewed literatures since 2003 about adaptation to temperature changes under climate change. We mainly summarized thermal adaptation of Drosophila (especially to high temperatures) from three aspects, behaviors, plastic responses and micro-evolution and discussed how Drosophila increases their heat tolerance through these three mechanisms. Finally, we summarized the measures of thermotolerance and concluded the main progress in recent decade about the behavioral thermoregulation, mortality risks driven by limited evolutionary and plastic response under climate change, geographic distribution based on basal rather than plastic thermotolerance. We propose future work focus on better understanding adaptation of organisms including agricultural pests to climate change.

AB  - Climate change has emerged as an increasingly important threat to freshwater systems. To cope with rapidly changing thermal regimes, freshwater fishes must either relocate or adjust through genetic adaptation and/or phenotypic plasticity. Short-term responses to elevated water temperature have been well studied in freshwater fishes; however, far less is understood about change induced by long-term exposure. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the effects of temperature on already imperilled species, which may be more sensitive to environmental change.
   This study investigated the effects of rearing temperature on critical thermal maximum (CTmax), agitation temperature (T-ag, temperature at which fish show behavioural signs of thermal stress) and gill size in pugnose shiner, Notropis anogenus, a threatened species in Canada. Juvenile pugnose shiner were reared for 4 months across five different ecologically relevant temperatures. CTmax and T-ag were measured under normoxia and acute exposure to hypoxia to test for oxygen sensitivity of the upper thermal limits in this species.
   CTmax increased with elevated water temperature. T-ag also increased with rearing temperature and occurred, on average, 4.3 degrees C above acclimation temperatures. The CTmax and T-ag were lower when fish were exposed acutely to hypoxia. Interestingly, gill size (e.g. total gill filament length) increased with rearing temperature, which may increase oxygen uptake capacity and support increased metabolic demands of warmer waters.
   Overall, pugnose shiner show plasticity in several traits in response to long-term exposure to elevated water temperature that may facilitate persistence in warmer waters. However, acute hypoxia exposure reduced thermal tolerance, stressing the importance of evaluating interactive effects of multiple stressors.
   Identifying source populations of pugnose shiner with greater thermal tolerance or implementing captive breeding under higher temperature regimes may improve the success of re-introduction efforts in the face of climate change, but the consequences to fitness of increased thermal tolerance should be examined.

AB  - Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a nonpolluting sustainable technology that converts the free energy of mixing of two solutions with different salinity directly into electrical energy. Although the theoretical potential is high, the practical power output obtained is limited yet due to concentration polarization phenomena and spacer shadow effects. In this work we combine theoretical calculations with direct current and alternating current experimental stack characterization methods to quantify the contribution of concentration polarization phenomena, spacer shadow effects and stack resistance in RED under different hydrodynamic conditions in a temperature range from 10 to 40 degrees C to show the practical potential of RED. Concentration polarization phenomena play an important role and their influence can be minimized by optimal stack hydrodynamics. Improved spacer designs and new spacer concepts offer extensive room to reduce the spacer shadow effect and to further increase the practical power output Improvement of hydrodynamics and reduction of the spacer shadow effect directly result in a significant increase in power output of the RED process, and values almost double the values currently obtained can be realized, which brings RED close to economical viability.

AB  - The mechanisms of cold tolerance in insects which are exposed to suboptimal temperatures for survival include accumulation of cryoprotectants and expression of heat shock protein genes (hsps). Spodoptera exigua is a freeze avoidance insect, which can overwinter as third instar larvae in China. Our previous study illustrated that seasonal and diel fluctuating temperatures enhanced its cold hardening. The survival mechanism for this stage, however, is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the survival mechanisms in third instar larvae of S. exigua were correlated with the induction of cryoprotectants and/or expression of hsps. Results showed that trehalose as the main cryoprotectant was accumulated during the cold acclimation (CA), and the level of accumulation fell off sharply when the CA treatment was discontinued (discontinued cold acclimation, DCA). Furthermore, inducible hsp90 was down-regulated in all treatments compared with the control, and hsp70 was up-regulated under conditions ofCAandRCH(rapid cold hardening), which induced 1.23- and 44.00-fold increases compared with the control. Therefore, we considered that both trehalose (as the main cryoprotectant) and hsps (i.e. hsp90 and hsp70) were involved in the regulation of physiological activity of third instar larvae of S. exigua to resist low temperatures during winter. These results are helpful for us to understand the mechanisms underlying this species' ecological adaptability and stress tolerance.

AB  - It is now possible to combine high spectral resolution observations (like AIRS) with moderate spatial resolution (like MODIS) in a single instrument. The ARIES instrument concept provides over 3000 spectral channels in the 0.4-15.4 pm spectral region with spatial resolution of 1.0 km while still scanning +/- 55 degrees. The ARIES has size and mass less than half that of AIRS or MODIS primarily due to the advancements in focal plane assemblies and wide field optical systems developed under the NASA IIP and in US industry. The combined capability will allow more cloud free observations per unit area, and improve the overall cloud-clearing approach applied on AIRS. It will also improve sensitivity to atmospheric water vapor, temperature and trace gases in the boundary layer and facilitate studies of surface and atmospheric interaction for global climate studies. Improvements are expected in regional weather forecasts and hurricane prediction. This paper discusses the primary requirements for ARIES, the expected science and operational benefits and an instrument concept that demonstrates the viability and low risk of the approach.

AB  - Previous studies hailed thermal tolerance and the capacity for organisms to acclimate and adapt as the primary pathways for species survival under climate change. Here we challenge this theory. Over the past decade, more than 365 tropical stenothermal fish species have been documented moving poleward, away from ocean warming hotspots where temperatures 2-3 degrees C above long-term annual means can compromise critical physiological processes. We examined the capacity of a model species - a thermally sensitive coral reef fish, Chromis viridis (Pomacentridae) - to use preference behaviour to regulate its body temperature. Movement could potentially circumvent the physiological stress response associated with elevated temperatures and may be a strategy relied upon before genetic adaptation can be effectuated. Individuals were maintained at one of six temperatures (23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 degrees C) for at least 6weeks. We compared the relative importance of acclimation temperature to changes in upper critical thermal limits, aerobic metabolic scope and thermal preference. While acclimation temperature positively affected the upper critical thermal limit, neither aerobic metabolic scope nor thermal preference exhibited such plasticity. Importantly, when given the choice to stay in a habitat reflecting their acclimation temperatures or relocate, fish acclimated to end-of-century predicted temperatures (i.e. 31 or 33 degrees C) preferentially sought out cooler temperatures, those equivalent to long-term summer averages in their natural habitats (similar to 29 degrees C). This was also the temperature providing the greatest aerobic metabolic scope and body condition across all treatments. Consequently, acclimation can confer plasticity in some performance traits, but may be an unreliable indicator of the ultimate survival and distribution of mobile stenothermal species under global warming. Conversely, thermal preference can arise long before, and remain long after, the harmful effects of elevated ocean temperatures take hold and may be the primary driver of the escalating poleward migration of species.

KW  - NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS
AB  - Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a painful, invasive, and rapidly progressive disease of the intestine primarily affecting premature newborns, with a mortality rate between 15-30% and no reliable methods of prevention. Current diagnostic tests do not always detect early signs of the disease. We used infrared (IR) thermal imaging to assess the abdominal surface temperature of healthy babies and those with NEC. Thermal sequences were obtained of babies taken out of the incubator and the temperature evolution post-thermal stress was monitored. Regression analysis indicates a slower decrease of superficial abdominal temperature in the NEC group, which we attribute to increased heat from inflamed bowel. We also show that differentiation between NEC and healthy babies is possible. Based on features derived from superficial abdominal temperatures, a linear classifier was trained on an optimal subset of features determined through genetic search. Results indicate a correct classification rate greater than 90%, suggesting that IR imaging provides additional information that could help diagnose NEC sooner.

AB  - Coral reefs are rapidly declining because of widespread mass coral bleaching causing extensive coral mortality. Elevated seawater temperatures are the main drivers of coral bleaching, and climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of destructive marine heatwaves. Efforts to enhance coral thermal bleaching tolerance can be targeted at the coral host or at coral-associated microorganisms (e.g., dinoflagellate endosymbionts and bacteria). The literature on experimental evolution of bacteria suggests that it has value as a tool to increase coral climate resilience. We provide a workflow on how to experimentally evolve coral-associated bacteria to confer thermal tolerance to coral hosts and emphasize the value of implementing this approach in coral reef conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - We study optimal subsidies for renewable energy (RE) generation to internalize external benefits from inter-temporal learning-by-doing spillovers, taking into account increasing marginal costs at the industry level due to limited availability of sites suitable for RE. We find that the optimal RE subsidy is differentiated according to productivity and derive a condition on production and spillovers under which less efficient, i.e. more costly, technologies should receive higher support, as common in actual policy-making. We show that such a support of technological diversification is optimal if (i) productive sites are scarce, which limits future utilization of knowledge and if (ii) technologies mature rapidly with little further scope for learning. Prima facie evidence for these elasticities for Germany, Denmark and UK suggests that support for technology diversification is the optimal approach for these countries. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The swiftly changing climate presents a challenge to organismal fitness by creating a mismatch between the current environment and phenotypes adapted to historic conditions. Acclimatory mechanisms may be especially crucial for sessile benthic marine taxa, such as reef-building corals, where climate change factors including ocean acidification and increasing temperature elicit strong negative physiological responses such as bleaching, disease and mortality. Here, within the context of multiple stressors threatening marine organisms, I describe the wealth of metaorganism response mechanisms to rapid ocean change and the ontogenetic shifts in organism interactions with the environment that can generate plasticity. I then highlight the need to consider the interactions of rapid and evolutionary responses in an adaptive (epi)genetic continuum. Building on the definitions of these mechanisms and continuum, I also present how the interplay of the microbiome, epigenetics and parental effects creates additional avenues for rapid acclimatization. To consider under what conditions epigenetic inheritance has a more substantial role, I propose investigation into the offset of timing of gametogenesis leading to different environmental integration times between eggs and sperm and the consequences of this for gamete epigenetic compatibility. Collectively, non-genetic, yet heritable phenotypic plasticity will have significant ecological and evolutionary implications for sessile marine organism persistence under rapid climate change. As such, reef-building corals present ideal and time-sensitive models for further development of our understanding of adaptive feedback loops in a multi-player (epi)genetic continuum.

AB  - Many behaviours have differential fitness consequences across thermal and ecological contexts, indicating that both ecological shifts and warming temperatures induced by climatic change may alter how organisms behave. However, empirical evidence of temperature-driven behavioural selection in natural systems is lacking. We compared behaviours and behavioural syndromes related to activity, exploration, boldness and aggression in populations of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from ambient lakes to the those from artificially warmed, power plant cooling lakes to investigate changes in behaviours associated with warmer environments. Activity, exploration, boldness and aggression of juvenile largemouth bass were assessed in laboratory conditions using a novel environment assay and a risky situation assay. We found that activity and exploratory behaviours were higher and decreased through first year ontogeny in populations from heated lakes, whereas these behaviours were lower and showed no relationship through ontogeny in populations from ambient lakes. We attribute these differences to the changes in food source availability in heated lakes associated with temperature-driven ecological effects. Bold and aggressive behaviours tended to differ between populations, as did correlations between behaviours, but did not differ between ambient and heated lakes. The findings of this work identify that large ecological changes associated with warming environments, such as food availability, may drive changes in some aspects of behavioural expression in largemouth bass but that other aspects of behavioural expression may be driven by lake-specific factors not related to warming.

AB  - This research presents optimum operation strategies for multi-energy systems as combined cooling, heat, and power systems with the approach of electricity supply priority regime. A grid with energy hub structure including electrical, thermal, and cooling hubs is explored. Accordingly, an energy hub structure integrated with storages and renewable resources is designed. The mathematical model of the operation system for the presented triple generation micro-grid is considered for energy flow to the energy grid. Considering the limitations of the storage system and the performance of the equipment as well as electricity and gas line, a dynamic optimum operation model is prepared on the basis of mixed integer linear programming and is solved in general algebraic modeling system optimization software so as to minimize energy supply costs. For the model verification, different scenarios are developed in a residential building for a typical summer day so that the renewable resources and storages are fed into the system gradually. According to the findings, as each element is included in the micro-energy grid, its operational parameters, viz. the cost of electricity, gas, and pollutant emissions, are improved remarkably. Scenario I includes a combined cooling, heat, and power system, Scenario II is supplemented with renewable solar and wind energy, and Scenario III includes electrical, heat, and cold storages in addition to renewable sources and combined cooling, heat, and power system. Results reveal a decrease in total productivity cost by 12.2% in Scenario II versus Scenario I and 10.9% in Scenario III versus Scenario II.

AB  - Biochar production and mixing in soil are seen as the best options for atmospheric carbon sequestration, providing simultaneous benefits to soil and opportunities for distributed energy generation. The proximity of biomass source and biochar dispersal greatly reduces the energy and emissions footprint of the whole process. The viability of the whole biochar process is examined from two boundary points: is there enough biomass around to have significant impact on the atmospheric CO2 levels and is there enough soil area for biochar dispersal. The answers are soundly positive, both for the world as a whole and for Canada, for which a more detailed analysis was done. However, the massive adoption of biochar solution is critically dependent on proper recognition of its carbon sequestration impact its soil improvement potentials. To that extent the International Biochar Initiative, together with national chapters, including recently formed Canadian Biochar Initiative, are actively promoting biochar related research and policy framework. This paper addresses the questions of availability of sources and sites that would benefit from its dispersal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is one of the promising wastestoenergy (WtE) technologies that convert organic wastes to useful gaseous fuel (biogas). In this process methane is produced in the presence of methanogens (bacteria). The survival and activities of methanogens are based on several parameters such as pH, temperature, organic loading rate, types of biodigester. Moreover, these parameters influence the production of biogas in terms of yield and composition. Maintaining an appropriate temperaturefor AD is highly critical and energy intensive. This study reviews the various hybrid technologies assistedbio gas production schemes particularly from renewable energy sources. Also discuss the direct and indirect solar assisted bio-digester impacts and recommendation to improve its performance. In addition, the performance analysis Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and thermal collector assisted bio gas plants; besides their impact on the performance of anaerobic digesters. Since opportunities of solar energy are attractive, the effective utilization of the same is selected for the discussion. Besides, the various constraints that affect the yield and composition of biogas are also evaluated along with the current biogas technologies and the biodigesters. The environmental benefits, challenges and socio-economic factors are also discussed for the successful implementation of various technologies.

AB  - In insects, pre-adult stages of the life cycle are exposed to variation in temperature that may differ from that in adults. However, the genetic basis for adaptation to environmental temperature could be similar between the pre-adult and the adult stages of the life cycle. Here, we tested quantitative trait loci (QTL) for heat-stress survival in larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, with and without a mild-heat-stress pre-treatment. Two sets of recombinant inbred lines derived from lines artificially selected for high and low levels of knockdown resistance to high temperature in young flies were used as the mapping population. There was no apparent increase in heat-shock survival between heat-pretreated and non-pretreated larvae. There was a positive correlation between the two experimental conditions of heat-shock survival (with and without a heat pre-treatment) except for males from one set of lines. Several QTL were identified involving all three major chromosomes. Most QTL for larval thermotolerance overlapped with thermotolerance QTL identified in previous studies for adults, indicating that heat-stress resistance is not genetically independent between life cycle stages because of either linkage or pleiotropy. The sign of the effects of some QTL alleles differed both between the sexes and between life stages.

AB  - Polymorphic diversity, such as elytra patterns of insects, is regarded as an external phenotypic characteristic driven by both genetics and environmental pleiotropy. The multicolored Asian ladybird, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), both an efficient natural enemy of herbivores and an invasive species with a worldwide distribution, shows a multitude of elytral patterns and strong environmental adaptability. Some studies have documented differences of ecological adaptability among H. axyridis morphotypes, but none compared their predatory performance under differing environmental conditions, to further understand the evolutionary significance of elytral pattern diversity. We evaluated predation (number of prey consumed per time unit) on three different herbivores by melanic/succinic and male/female adults of H. axyridis, under different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 degrees C). and photoperiods (4:20, 8:16, 12:12, 16:8, 20:4). We found significant differences in prey consumed by the predator between gender and polymorphic types, including under comparable environment parameters. Furthermore, there were also significant differences in predation when temperature and photoperiod regimes varied. Our results hinted a high plasticity in prey consumption relative to polymorphic type and gender in H. axyridis. These findings could be informative for developing further biological control programs relying on H. axyridis, notably for optimizing the effectiveness of predator releases according to polymorph to be used and environment targeted.

AB  - Anticipatory parental effects (APE's) occur when parents adjust the phenotype of their offspring to match the local environment, so as to increase the fitness of both parents and offspring. APE's, as in the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity more generally, are predicated on the idea that the parental environment is a reliable predictor of the offspring environment. Most studies on APE's fail to explicitly consider environmental predictability so risk searching for APE's under circumstances where they are unlikely to occur. This failure is perhaps one of the major reasons for mixed evidence for APE's in a recent meta-analysis. Here, we highlight some often-overlooked assumptions in studies of APE's and provide a framework for identifying and testing APE's. Our review highlights the importance of measuring environmental predictability, outlines the minimal requirements for experimental designs, explains the important differences between relative and absolute measures of offspring fitness, and highlights some potential issues in assigning components of offspring fitness to parental fitness. Our recommendations should result in more targeted and effective tests of APE's.

AB  - Capacity to cope with warming temperatures is a key determining factor of species' persistence under global climate change. Many successful invasive species have heightened thermal tolerance relative to their native counterparts, which may provide competitive advantages for habitat utilization and resource acquisition under warming scenarios, ultimately contributing to radically altered community composition. Enhanced transcriptional plasticity may be an important factor conferring superior abilities to cope with environmental stress, but the molecular mechanisms driving key differences of organismal traits in invasive versus native species are not well known. Although it is predicted that established invaders will evolve canalized phenotypes well-adapted to new environments, it is not clear whether the same expectations are true for invaders of variable thermal environments or under climate warming scenarios where abilities to cope with fluctuating and increasing temperatures may provide fitness advantages. Here, we compare a highly successful invasive fish and a sympatric endangered native fish living in a dynamic estuarine environment that is projected to warm under climate change. We linked organismal physiological limits with global transcriptional responses at multiple common relative and absolute temperature thresholds and determined that heightened thermal tolerance of invasive Inland Silversides (Menidia beryllina) is associated with transcriptional changes that are greater both in the number of genes and the magnitude of response relative to native Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Modulated genes contributed to the enrichment of biological processes that differed between species and generally increased with temperature. These results are in concordance with the hypothesis that transcriptional plasticity may play a key role in determining population persistence, species interactions, and shaping community assemblages under climate change. Future studies encompassing a wider range of species and taxa are needed to determine whether this is a general pattern found between native and invasive species more broadly.

TI  - Nuclear Fission, Today and Tomorrow: From Renaissance to Technological Breakthrough (Generation IV) Part II
T2  - ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA  - English
AB  - This paper is an overview of the current Euratom FP-7 research and training actions in innovative nuclear fission reactors and fuel cycle technologies, including partitioning and transmutation. It is based on the more than 40 invited lectures that were delivered by research project coordinators and by keynote speakers at the FISA-2009 Conference, organised by the European Commission DG Research/Euratom. The education and training programmes in nuclear fission and radiation protection are also discussed, aiming at continuously increasing the level of nuclear competences across the EU.
   It is necessary to consider the most recent nuclear fission technologies (Generations of Nuclear Power Plants:
   GEN II: safety and reliability of nuclear facilities and energy independence;
   GEN III: continuous improvement of safety and reliability, and increased industrial competitiveness in a growing energy market;
   GEN IV: for increased sustainability, and proliferation resistance.
   The focus in this paper is on the design objectives and research issues associated to Generations IV systems that have been agreed upon internationally. Their benefits are discussed according to a series of ambitious criteria or technology goals established at the international level. One will have to produce not only electricity at lower costs but also heat at very high temperatures, while exploiting a maximum of fissile and fertile matters, and recycling all actinides, under safe and reliable conditions. Scientific viability studies and technological performance tests for each Generation IV system are now being carried out in many laboratories world-wide, in line with the intergovernmental GIF agreement. The ultimate phase of commercial deployment is forseen for 2040.
   In the Conclusion, it is shown to what extent Generation IV can be considered as a beneficial, responsible and sustainable response to the societal and industrial challenges of the future low-carbon economy (at the horizon 2040).

AB  - BACKGROUND. There is a paucity of information on the maintenance of body temperature at birth for low birth weight infants.
   OBJECTIVES. We examined the distribution of temperatures in low birth weight infants on admission to the NICUs in the Neonatal Research Network centers and determined whether admission temperature was associated with antepartum and birth variables and selected morbidities and mortality.
   METHODS. Infants without major congenital anomalies born during 2002 and 2003 with birth weights of 401 to 1499 g who were admitted directly from the delivery room to the NICU were included. Bivariate associations between antepartum/ birth variables and admission temperature and selected morbidities/ mortality and admission temperature were examined, followed by multivariable linear or logistic regressions to detect independent associations.
   RESULTS. There were 5277 study infants and the mean ( +/- SD) birth weight and gestational age were 1036 +/- 286 g and 28 +/- 3 weeks, respectively. The distribution of admission temperatures was 14.3% at < 35 degrees C, 32.6% between 35 and 35.9 degrees C, 42.3% between 36 and 36.9 degrees C, and 10.8% at >= 37 degrees C. The estimate of birth weight on admission temperature with and without intubation was + 0.13 degrees C and + 0.04 degrees C per 100- g increase in birth weight, respectively. The mean admission temperature for each center varied from 1.5 degrees C below to 0.3 degrees C above a reference center. On adjusted analyses, admission temperature was inversely related to mortality ( 28% increase per 1 degrees C decrease) and late- onset sepsis (11% increase per 1 degrees C decrease) but not to intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, or duration of conventional ventilation.
   CONCLUSIONS. Preventing decreases in temperature at birth among low birth weight infants remains a challenge. Associations with intubation and center of birth suggest that assessment of temperature control for infants intubated in the delivery room may be beneficial. Whether the admission temperature is part of the casual path or a marker of mortality needs additional study.

AB  - For organisms with complex life histories, carry-over effects (COEs) can manifest between life stages, when conditions experienced by one stage influence the next, as well as transgenerationally, when the parental environment affects offspring. Here we used multiple global change-associated stressors to examine both forms of COE simultaneously in an intertidal limpet with mixed development (i.e. planktonic larvae hatch from benthic egg masses). Adult Siphonaria australis were subjected to four treatments over four weeks: an ambient control, a treatment featuring elevated water temperature (25 degrees C) and UVB (1.7 W m(-2)), a copper pollution treatment (5.0 mu g L-1), and a treatment incorporating all three stressors. Egg masses laid by these adults were then redistributed among the same four treatments (producing 16 adult-to-egg treatment histories) and stressed until hatching. Finally, hatching larvae were reared under ambient conditions for 24 days. While adult survivorship was unaffected by treatment, embryonic viability in egg masses responded strongly to egg mass treatment, as well as parental stress exposure, therefore displaying trans-generational COEs. These trans-generational COEs interacted with COEs originating in egg masses to produce highly context-dependent hatching sizes and larval growth. This demonstrates that the performance of a given organism at a given time reflects not only conditions experienced during embryonic development, but also those of the parental generation, and suggests that COEs play an important but underestimated role in responses to global change scenarios.

AB  - Sexual selection and conflict can act on genes with important metabolic functions, potentially shaping standing genetic variance in such genes and thus evolutionary potential of populations. Here, using experimental evolution, we show how reproductive competition intensity and thermal environment affect selection on phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6Pgdh)-a metabolic gene involved in sexual selection and conflict in the bulb mite. The S allele of6Pgdhincreases male success in reproductive competition, but is detrimental to S-bearing males' partners. We found that the rate of the S allele spread increased with the proportion of males in the experimental populations, illustrating that harm to females is more easily compensated for males under more intense sexual competition. Furthermore, we found that under equal sex ratio, the S allele spreads faster at higher temperature. While the direction of selection on6Pgdhwas not reversed in any of the conditions we tested, which would be required for environmental heterogeneity to maintain polymorphism at this locus, our study highlights that ecological and sexual selection can jointly affect selection on important metabolic enzymes.

AB  - With the cell therapy industry continuing to grow, the ability to preserve clinical grade cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), whilst retaining cell viability and function remains critical for the generation of off-the-shelf therapies. Cryopreservation of MSCs, using slow freezing, is an established process at lab scale. However, the cytotoxicity of cryoprotectants, like Me2SO, raises questions about the impact of prolonged cell exposure to cryoprotectant at temperatures >0 degrees C during processing of large cell batches for allogenic therapies prior to rapid cooling in a controlled rate freezer or in the clinic prior to administration. Here we show that exposure of human bone marrow derived MSCs to Me2SO for >= 1 h before freezing, or after thawing, degrades membrane integrity, short-term cell attachment efficiency and alters cell immunophenotype. After 2 h's exposure to Me2SO at 37 degrees C post-thaw, membrane integrity dropped to similar to 70% and only similar to 50% of cells retained the ability to adhere to tissue culture plastic. Furthermore, only 70% of the recovered MSCs retained an immunophenotype consistent with the ISCT minimal criteria after exposure. We also saw a similar loss of membrane integrity and attachment efficiency after exposing osteoblast (HOS TE85) cells to Me2SO before, and after, cryopreservation.
   Overall, these results show that freezing medium exposure is a critical determinant of product quality as process scale increases. Defining and reporting cell sensitivity to freezing medium exposure, both before and after cryopreservation, enables a fair judgement of how scalable a particular cryopreservation process can be, and consequently whether the therapy has commercial feasibility.

AB  - Background Heterosis has been exploited for decades in different animals and crops due to it resulting in dramatic increases in yield and adaptability. Hybridization is a classical breeding method that can effectively improve the genetic characteristics of organisms through heterosis. Abalone has become an increasingly economically important aquaculture resource with high commercial value. However, due to changing climate, abalone is now facing serious threats of high temperature in summer. Interspecific hybrid abalone (Haliotis gigantea female x H. discus hannai male, SD) has been cultured at large scale in southern China and has been shown high survival rates under heat stress in summer. Therefore, SD has become a good model material for heterosis research, but the molecular basis of heterosis remains elusive. Results Heterosis in thermal tolerance of SD was verified through Arrhenius break temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance in this study. Then RNA-Sequencing was conducted to obtain gene expression patterns and alternative splicing events at control temperature (20 degrees C) and heat stress temperature (30 degrees C). A total of 356 (317 genes), 476 (435genes), and 876 (726 genes) significantly diverged alternative splicing events were identified in H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (SS), and SD in response to heat stress, respectively. In the heat stress groups, 93.37% (20,512 of 21,969) of the expressed genes showed non-additive expression patterns, and over-dominance expression patterns of genes account for the highest proportion (40.15%). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the overlapping genes among common DEGs and NAGs were significantly enriched in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitophagy, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In addition, we found that among these overlap genes, 39 genes had undergone alternative splicing events in SD. These pathways and genes may play an important role in the thermal resistance of hybrid abalone. Conclusion More alternative splicing events and non-additive expressed genes were detected in hybrid under heat stress and this may contribute to its thermal heterosis. These results might provide clues as to how hybrid abalone has a better physiological regulation ability than its parents under heat stress, to increase our understanding of heterosis in abalone.

AB  - As organisms move into higher latitudes, they may evolve physiological mechanisms to survive in harsher climates. One such mechanism is supercooling, the capacity to survive at subzero temperatures without freezing. While interspecific comparisons reveal greater thermal tolerances at higher latitudes in insects and vertebrates, evidence for intraspecific evolution in supercooling related to latitude is only evident in insects. We measured the supercooling points of lizards from 12 populations reared from hatch in common laboratory conditions to test for evolved differences in supercooling related to winter. Results indicate that winter harshness (depth or length) cannot explain supercooling points regardless of how data are analyzed, which suggests that populations have not evolved greater supercooling capacity. While our results are consistent with the idea that thermal physiology is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, we cannot reject several alternatives including the possibility that lizards are able to behaviorally avoid the extreme temperatures that would select for thermal evolution.

AB  - Scleractinian corals occur in tropical regions near their upper thermal limits and are severely threatened by rising ocean temperatures. However, several recent studies have shown coral populations can harbour genetic variation in thermal tolerance. Here, we have extended these approaches to study heat tolerance of corals in the Persian/Arabian Gulf, where heat-tolerant local populations experience extreme summer temperatures (up to 36 degrees C). To evaluate whether selection has depleted genetic variation in thermal tolerance, estimate potential future adaptive responses and understand the functional basis for these corals' unusual heat tolerance, we conducted controlled crosses in the Gulf coral Platygyra daedalea. Heat tolerance is highly heritable in this population (h(2) = 0.487-0.748), suggesting substantial potential for adaptive responses to selection for elevated temperatures. To identify genetic markers associated with this variation, we conducted genomewide SNP genotyping in parental corals and tested for relationships between paternal genotype and offspring thermal tolerance. Resulting multilocus SNP genotypes explained a large fraction of variation in thermal tolerance in these crosses (69%). To investigate the functional basis of these differences in thermal tolerance, we profiled transcriptional responses in tolerant and susceptible families, revealing substantial sire effects on transcriptional responses to thermal stress. We also studied sequence variation in these expressed sequences, identifying alleles and functional groups of differentially expressed genes associated with thermal tolerance. Our findings demonstrate that corals in this population harbour extensive genetic variation in thermal tolerance, and heat-tolerant phenotypes differ in both gene sequences and transcriptional stress responses from their susceptible counterparts.

AB  - Analysis and results of the high temperature forming of seamless pipe fittings produced at a local factory are presented in this work. The studies were conducted by recording the thermal evolution in different parts of the piece as it was being forged, which was done by placing a series of type K thermocouples within the part and logging the data into a computer driven system. The initial trials put in evidence the need to change the heating practice in order to ensure a greater thermal homogeneity. Metallographic evaluation was carried out on formed pieces to study variations in their microstructure before and after the changes in the heating practice were made. Modification of this practice resulted in improvements in quality, such as the reduction in the variation in microstructure and wall thickness, as well as an increase in productivity, as the pressing speed was augmented.

AB  - Although the impacts of climate change and invasive species are typically studied in isolation, they likely interact to reduce the viability of plant and animal populations. Indeed, invasive species, by definition, have succeeded in areas outside of their native range and may therefore have higher adaptive capacity relative to native species. Nevertheless, the genetic architecture of the thermal niche, which sets a limit to the potential for populations to evolve rapidly under climate change, has never been measured in an invasive species in its introduced range. Here, we estimate the genetic architecture of thermal performance in the harlequin beetle (Harmonia axyridis), a Central Asian species that has invaded four continents. We measured thermal performance curves in more than 400 third-generation offspring from a paternal half-sib breeding experiment and analyzed the genetic variance-covariance matrix. We show that while the critical thermal limits in this species have an additive genetic basis, most components of the thermal performance curve have low heritability. Moreover, we found evidence that genetic correlations may constrain the evolution of beetles under climate change. Our results suggest that some invasive species may have limited evolutionary capacity under climate change, despite their initial success in colonizing novel environments.

AB  - Finding ways to predict and control the survival of bacterial aerosols can contribute to the development of ways to alleviate a number of crucial microbiological problems. Significant damage in the membrane integrity of Escherichia coli during aerosolization and airborne suspension has been revealed which has prompted the question of how the membrane fatty acid composition and fluidity influence the survival of airborne bacteria. Two approaches of using isogenic mutants and different growth temperatures were selected to manipulate the membrane fatty acid composition of E. coli before challenging the bacteria with different relative humidity (RH) levels in an aerosol chamber. Among the mutants (fabR (-) , cfa. fadA (-) ), fabR (-) had the lowest membrane fluidity index (FI) and generally showed a higher survival than the parental strain. Surprisingly, its resistance to airborne stress was so strong that its viability was fully maintained even after airborne suspension at 40% RH, a harsh RH level to bacterial survival. Moreover, E. coli cultured at 20 A degrees C with a higher FI than that at 30 and 37 A degrees C generally had a lower survival after aerosolization and airborne suspension. Unlike FI, individual fatty acid and cyclopropane fatty acid composition did not relate to the bacterial survival. Lipid peroxidation of the membrane was undetected in all the bacteria. Membrane fluidity plays a stronger role in determining the bacteria survival during airborne suspension than during aerosolization. Certain relationships between FI and bacteria survival were identified, which could help predict the transmission of bacteria under different conditions.

AB  - Environmental temperatures and oxygen availability are important for the balance between oxygen supply and demand. Terrestrial organisms are generally perceived to be less limited by access to oxygen than their aquatic counterparts. Nevertheless, even terrestrial environments can be deficient in oxygen, especially for organisms occurring in soil, litter, wood, rotten fruit or at high elevations. While isopods are the best adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle among crustaceans, many species, including woodlice, occupy environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen. To investigate whether mismatches between oxygen supply and demand can result in a loss of performance in a terrestrial organism, we studied the effects of atmospheric oxygen concentration on the thermal performance of the common rough woodlouse (Porcellio scaber). We compared the thermal preference, thermal sensitivity of running speed, and tolerance to extreme temperatures of woodlice exposed to one of two oxygen concentrations (21% - normoxia, 7% - hypoxia). Under hypoxia, P. scaber preferred microhabitats with temperatures that were on average 3 degrees C lower than those preferred under normoxia. The running speed tended to reach its maximum at a lower temperature under hypoxia than under normoxia (25.13 degrees C vs 28.87 degrees C, respectively, although p was equal to 0.09), and normoxic woodlice ran approximately 1.5-fold faster than hypoxic woodlice at the point of maximum speed. Heat tolerance was significantly lower under hypoxia (38.9 degrees C) than under normoxia (40.7 degrees C), but there was no difference in cold tolerance (5.81 degrees C under normoxia and 5.44 degrees C under hypoxia). Overall, our results indicate that environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen may shape the physiological performance of terrestrial ectotherms, likely via their effects on the balance between oxygen supply and demand, which may have fitness consequences for these organisms in nature.

AB  - Bestiolina amoyensis distributes in subtropical inshore waters across the Pacific Ocean, with a relatively long reproductive lifespan and high intrinsic population increase rate compared with other small paracalanid species, which makes it a good candidate to develop culture techniques for hatchery larval rearing. However, the reproductive biology of this subtropical broadcast spawning species is still largely unknown. The present investigation provides the first published data on the embryo development and effects of different light intensities (0, 500, and 1,000 lx), temperatures (16 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 26 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 34 degrees C), and salinities (22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, and 34 psu) on hatching success rates of B. amoyensis. The same batch of eggs were collected from gravid females to observe their embryonic development and incubated under designed light intensities, temperatures, and salinities. Results showed that the whole embryonic development of B. amoyensis lasted, on average, 6 h and 40 min at 26 degrees C, and egg hatching time of B. amoyensis shortened exponentially with the increasing temperature. The highest egg hatching rate (100%) was recorded from the 0-lx treatment, indicating that the dark condition was favorable for the egg incubation of B. amoyensis. The optimum temperature and salinity range for the hatching success of B. amoyensis was 22 degrees C-30 degrees C (above 94%) and 22-34 psu salinity (above 88%), respectively, indicating that B. amoyensis had wide adaptability to temperature and salinity. Light and too low or high temperature leads to abnormal embryonic development and malformed nauplii. The relatively wide adaptability to temperature and salinity and fast embryo development also suggests that B. amoyensis was a good candidate as live feed for hatchery larval rearing.

TI  - GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF HYPOPUS DURATION IN THE STORED-PRODUCT MITE LEPIDOGLYPHUS-DESTRUCTOR
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL & APPLIED ACAROLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - This paper reports a series of experiments over many years on hypopus duration and extends the preceding investigation (1987) on hypopus formation in Lepidoglyphus destructor (Schrank, 1781).  The length of time required for hypopus physiogenesis (diapause development) is genetically programmed but influenced by environmental factors.  This span of time is highly variable, and may extend from one week to more than a year.  Spreading out the potential for hypopus completion over time is adaptive, since a pool of hypopodes with prolonged and staggered dormancies serves to spread the risk of emergence of tritonymphs over extended periods of time; it buffers the population against sudden drought to which all other stages of the life-cycle succumb.
   The additive structure and large variance of the genetic system underlying the length of time required for hypopus physiogenesis allows for the reconstitution of a broad spectrum of genotypes in every generation through the process of meiotic segregation and recombination during sexual reproduction.  It favours stored variability, provides a 'fail-safe device' both for survival as well as development in irregularly fluctuating environments, and facilitates the adaptation of populations to local conditions.  The trait for hypopus physiogenesis varies independently from that of hypopus formation, and is apparently free to adjust, without genetic constraints, towards an adaptive optimum.  The response to selection is fast.
   Low environmental humidities and high temperatures accelerate physiogenesis of the hypopus.  Completion of the hypopus stage and moulting to the tritonymph is triggered by high humidities at moderate temperatures.  If environmental conditions preclude moulting, the hypopus following ending of physiogenesis enters a state of quiescence.
   In contrast the seasonal and largely predictably varying environments, in which essentially anticipatory and season-related token cues like photoperiod regulate the timing of so many arthropod life-cycles, L. destructor copes with sudden and fatal drought, as well as with unheralded and favourable humidities in its ephemeral habitats, mainly by excessive genetic polymorphism in hypopus duration and formation; some genotypes are always instantaneously fit to meet the respective environmental situation.
   The mite faces gradual food deterioration of its patchily distributed microhabitats by a short-term anticipatory and environmentally cued developmental switch mechanism, which lowers the threshold for hypopus induction.
   On top of genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity, any genotype x environment interaction provides for increasing flexibility above that from genetic polymorphism and environmental polyphenism alone.  This extraordinary measure of adaptedness fits L. destructor for life in irregularly fluctuating environments.

AB  - Background Global warming has brought many negative impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, which makes the vulnerability of ecosystems one of the hot issues in current ecological research. Here, we proposed an assessment method based on the IPCC definition of vulnerability. The exposure to future climate was characterized using a moisture index (MI) that integrates the effects of temperature and precipitation. Vegetation stability, defined as the proportion of intact natural vegetation that remains unchanged under changing climate, was used together with vegetation productivity trend to represent the sensitivity and adaptability of ecosystems. Using this method, we evaluated the vulnerability of ecosystems in Southwestern China under two future representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) with MC2 dynamic global vegetation model. Results (1) Future (2017-2100) climate change will leave 7.4% (under RCP 4.5) and 57.4% of (under RCP 8.5) of areas under high or very high vulnerable climate exposure; (2) in terms of vegetation stability, nearly 45% of the study area will show high or very high vulnerability under both RCPs. Beside the impacts of human disturbance on natural vegetation coverage (vegetation intactness), climate change will cause obvious latitudinal movements in vegetation distribution, but the direction of movements under two RCPs were opposite due to the difference in water availability; (3) vegetation productivity in most areas will generally increase and remain a low vulnerability in the future; (4) an assessment based on the above three aspects together indicated that future climate change will generally have an adverse impact on all ecosystems in Southwestern China, with non-vulnerable areas account for only about 3% of the study area under both RCPs. However, compared with RCP 4.5, the areas with mid- and high-vulnerability under RCP 8.5 scenario increased by 13% and 16%, respectively. Conclusion Analyses of future climate exposure and projected vegetation distribution indicate widespread vulnerability of ecosystems in Southwestern China, while vegetation productivity in most areas will show an increasing trend to the end of twenty-first century. Based on new climate indicators and improved vulnerability assessment rules, our method provides an extra option for a more comprehensive evaluation of ecosystem vulnerability, and should be further tested at larger spatial scales in order to provide references for regional, or even global, ecosystem conservation works.

AB  - In the Southern United States, the widely distributed loblolly pine contributes greatly to lumber and pulp production, as well as providing many important ecosystem services. Climate change may affect the productivity and range of loblolly pine. Nevertheless, we have insufficient knowledge of the adaptive potential and the genetics underlying the adaptability of loblolly pine. To address this, we tested the association of 2.8 million whole exome-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with climate and geographic variables, including temperature, precipitation, latitude, longitude, and elevation data. Using an integrative landscape genomics approach by combining multiple environmental association and outlier detection analyses, we identified 611 SNPs associated with 56 climate and geographic variables. Longitude, maximum temperature of the warm months and monthly precipitation associated with most SNPs, indicating their importance and complexity in shaping the genetic variation in loblolly pine. Functions of candidate genes related to terpenoid synthesis, pathogen defense, transcription factors, and abiotic stress response. We provided evidence that environment-associated SNPs also composed the genetic structure of adaptive phenotypic traits including height, diameter, metabolite levels, and gene transcript abundance. Our study promotes understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation in loblolly pine and provides promising tools for selecting genotypes adapted to local environments in a changing climate.

AB  - Induced morphological defenses commonly develop in some loricate rotifers as greatly increased spine development and in many species of the cladoceran genus Daphnia as an alteration in the shape and size of its head, producing helmets, crests, and neck spines. This restructuring of the shape of these animals during development, which reduces their vulnerability to a variety of planktonic predators, involves a series of developmental challenges and potential evolutionary constraints for each specific type of defense. In this review, we examine these challenges and the divergent developmental patterns that evolved in rotifers and Daphnia in response to the particular forms of predation pressure they face in their lake and pond environments. These patterns involve differences in the sensitivity of various developmental stages to predator kairomones, the timing of when the defense is present during postembryonic development, the ability to reverse the induced defense if the predator disappears from the community, and the effect of water temperature on the induction process. The type of developmental pattern associated with each induced defense appears to have been shaped by natural selection to effectively protect the animal, at minimal cost, from the specific kind of predation pressure to which it is commonly subjected.

TI  - PROTECTING OUR WATER COMPACTS: THE LOOMING THREAT OF UNILATERAL CONGRESSIONAL INTERACTION
T2  - WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The United States is entering a period in which the combination of increasing population, rising temperatures, and growing resource scarcity will seriously threaten human survival. In a warmer world, water basins will be highly coveted. This demand will require steadfast attention to water-resource management. Currently, interstate compacts are the primary mechanism for multistate basin management. Increasing scarcity places pressure on Congress to reevaluate and potentially revoke consent from these compacts. The alternative methods for allocating water are unstable at best. This Comment argues that Congress does not have the power unilaterally to revoke consent from an interstate compact. The interstate compact is one of the Founding Fathers' lasting mechanisms designed to protect the people from federal overreaching. Three of the nation's largest freshwater basins and their compacts provide illustrations of the interstate compact's resilience, adaptability, and importance in a changing world. Further, an examination of how the nation chooses to manage its most important resource provides valuable insight in to our future when it is a question of survival, is it "We the People" or "We the Nation"?

AB  - The extremely polymorphic gastropod Potamopyrgus antipodarum is widespread in freshwater habitats throughout New Zealand. This study describes morphological variation of P. antipodarum along two streams in Waikato (North Island, New Zealand), and explores relationships between morphology and selected environmental variables (temperature, conductivity, pH, flow, shade, vegetation). Along each stream, fully grown snails were collected at 11 sites extending from the source of flow to 1 or 1.5 km downstream. In both streams, shells increased in size and in one stream they also became more obese with distance from the source. Of the environmental variables assessed only flow, which increased downstream, was found to have potential influence on shell morphology. Larger snails have a larger foot and thus a larger attachment area and therefore may be able to withstand higher currents, despite having a higher Reynolds number resulting in increased drag on them relative to smaller individuals. Other studies have found that clines of morphological variation in lakes are apparently driven by the differential risk of infection by parasites. This can be excluded for the stream populations in this study, because parasitised individuals were absent at upstream sites, suggesting that similar morphological patterns may have entirely different causes.

AB  - Environmental fluctuations are important for parasite spread and persistence. However, the effects of the spatial and temporal structure of environmental fluctuations on host-parasite dynamics are not well understood. Temporal fluctuations can be random but positively autocorrelated, such that the environment is similar to the recent past (red noise), or random and uncorrelated with the past (white noise). We imposed red or white temporal temperature fluctuations on experimental metapopulations of Paramecium caudatum, experiencing an epidemic of the bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Metapopulations (two subpopulations linked by migration) experienced fluctuations between stressful (5 degrees C) and permissive (23 degrees C) conditions following red or white temporal sequences. Spatial variation in temperature fluctuations was implemented by exposing subpopulations to the same (synchronous temperatures) or different (asynchronous temperatures) temporal sequences. Red noise, compared with white noise, enhanced parasite persistence. Despite this, red noise coupled with asynchronous temperatures allowed infected host populations to maintain sizes equivalent to uninfected populations. It is likely that this occurs because subpopulations in permissive conditions rescue declining subpopulations in stressful conditions. We show how patterns of temporal and spatial environmental fluctuations can impact parasite spread and host population abundance. We conclude that accurate prediction of parasite epidemics may require realistic models of environmental noise.

AB  - Ancient lakes are excellent laboratories for evolutionary research, where species can be studied in the cradle where they originated. In this article, we investigate two endemic ostracod species flocks from the two oldest lakes in the world, Lake Baikal (LB) (ca. 28 myr) and Lake Tanganyika (LT) (ca. 12 myr), with DNA sequence data. Nuclear ITS1 failed to resolve the phylogeny of both flocks. Whilst most phylogenetic relationships of the Tanganyika flock are resolved with mitochondrial COI, the Baikalian tree contains multifurications of up to seven different clades. The Tanganyikan Cyprideis flock shows higher genetic variability, which matches its higher morphological variability. A significant deviation from a constant divergence rate through time indicates that the Cytherissa flock most likely experienced explosive speciation events during its earlier history. Comparative analyses of substitution rates furthermore revealed that they are not clock-wise for COI. Ancestral Cytherissa probably radiated in LB 5-8 myr ago, around the time when the cold, oxygenated abyss was formed in LB. The Tanganyikan Cyprideis flock is almost twice as old as the Baikalian Cytherissa flock, and possibly older than LT itself, ca. 15 myr. The Cyprideis flock has survived drastic lake level changes and resulting salinity crises during its entire history.

AB  - All physiological processes of ectotherms depend on environmental temperature. Thus, adaptation of physiological mechanisms to the thermal environments is important for achieving optimal performance and fitness. The European Common Frog, Rana temporaria, is widely distributed across different thermal habitats. This makes it an exceptional model for studying the adaptations to different thermal conditions. We raised tadpoles from Germany and Croatia at two constant temperature treatments (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C), and under natural temperature fluctuations (in outdoor treatments), and tested how different developmental temperatures affected developmental traits, that is, length of larval development, morphometrics, and body condition, as well as jumping performance of metamorphs. Our results revealed population-specific differences in developmental time, body condition, and jumping performance. Croatian frogs developed faster in all treatments, were heavier, in better body condition, and had longer hind limbs and better jumping abilities than German metamorphs. The populations further differed in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance. While metamorphs from Croatia increased their jumping performance with higher temperatures, German metamorphs reached their performance maximum at lower temperatures. These population-specific differences in common environments indicate local genetic adaptation, with southern populations being better adapted to higher temperatures than those from north of the Alps.

AB  - Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is an exquisite, nutritionally and economically valuable fruit crop of tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Guava fruits are relished world over for fresh consumption, as well as processed into other delicacies like juice, jam and jelly to extend availability throughout the year. Guava outshines other tropical fruits in productivity, hardiness, adaptability, nutritional value, and ensures higher economic returns to growers with minimal inputs. Guava is highly nutritious and a good source of calcium, iron and phosphorus. Vitamin C content of guava fruit is 2-5 times that of citrus fruit. Despite its wide adaptability and high nutritive value, world trade of guava fruit is limited due to its delicate nature, short postharvest life and susceptibility to chilling injury and diseases. Guava, being a highly perishable fruit, undergoes rapid postharvest ripening in a few days under ambient conditions and becomes overripe and mealy within a week. In cold storage, the fruit can maintain quality for up to 15 days at 8-10 degrees C and 85-90% RH. Controlled/modified atmosphere storage methods can extend the shelf life, but, an inappropriate storage atmosphere may result in accumulation of fermentative metabolites resulting in development of severe off-flavors. The use of anti-transpirants, wax coatings, growth retardants, irradiation and different types of storage facilities have been tried to increase the shelf life of harvested fruits with limited success. Recent technologies such as the phospholipase D inhibition technology using hexanal compositions have been observed to enhance shelf life for a month through its multifold actions involving the modulation of ethylene signal transduction pathway and gene expression.

AB  - Accessing the thermo-mechanical response of large deep Hot Dry Rock (HDR) reservoirs during geothermal extraction remains a challenging task that can be comprehended with numerical tools. Of crucial importance to the economic viability of these HDR reservoirs is the knowledge of thermal output evolution, fluid excessive pressure and induced thermal stress, at various steps of the circulation tests. Thermal recovery from a HDR reservoir, viewed as a deformable fractured medium, is investigated with a focus on the assumption of Local Thermal Non-Equilibrium (LTNE). To this end, a fully coupled finite element formulation for a thermo-elastic fractured medium in LTNE is developed (Gelet et al. 2013). Hydraulic diffusion, thermal diffusion, forced convection and deformation are considered in a two-phase framework, the solid phase being made by impermeable solid blocks separated by saturated fractures. Each of the two phases is endowed with its own temperature. The resulting system of equations is used to address a generic HDR reservoir subjected to temperature and pressure gradients. A change of time profile of the outlet fluid temperature is observed as the fracture spacing increases, switching from a single-step pattern to a double-step pattern, a feature which is viewed as characteristic of established LTNE. A dimensionless number is proposed to delineate between Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE) and non-equilibrium. This number embodies local physical properties of the mixture, elements of the geometry of the reservoir and the production flow rate. All the above properties being fixed, the resulting fracture spacing threshold between LTNE and LTE is found to decrease with increasing porosity. The thermally induced effective stress is tensile near the injection well, illustrating the thermal contraction of the rock, while the pressure contribution of the fracture fluid is negligible during the late period.

AB  - Environmental variability is on the rise in different parts of the earth, and the survival of many species depends on how well they cope with these fluctuations. Our current understanding of how organisms adapt to unpredictably fluctuating environments is almost entirely based on studies that investigate fluctuations among different values of a single environmental stressor such as temperature or pH. How would unpredictability affect adaptation when the environment fluctuates between qualitatively very different kinds of stresses? To answer this question, we subjected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli to selection over similar to 260 generations. The populations faced predictable and unpredictable environmental fluctuations across qualitatively different selection environments, namely, salt and acidic pH. We show that predictability of environmental fluctuations does not play a role in determining the extent of adaptation, although the extent of ancestral adaptation to the chosen selection environments is of key importance.

AB  - Electricity problem of most small islands in Indonesia has become a serious problem and need to be immediately resolved. In this present paper, Kangean Islands, Sumenep district of Madura, Indonesia, is one of the most suitable islands for an example. In this island, the existing electricity supply is mainly generated by diesel generators. Even though there are also electricity supplies from the government and private companies, it is very limited capacities just a few families. It is clear that the daily electricity requirements in the Kangean Islands are not adequately met. There is no self-supporting from the local residents to meet their daily energy needs. The community service activity helps to improve the understanding and the self-supporting of the Kangean Island community, especially for the young generation, in the field of electrical energy by utilizing renewable energy sources, especially solar cell system technology. Thus, it is expected that natural resources in Kangean Island can be utilized properly and able to increase the productivity. Finally, in this paper, the light intensity and surface temperature effects on the performance of a monocrystal solar cell are discussed.

AB  - Genetic variation for potentially adaptive traits of the key restoration species Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl) was assessed over the intermountain western United States in relation to source population climate. Common gardens were established at two intermountain west sites with progeny from two maternal parents from each of 130 wild populations. Data were collected over 2years at each site on fifteen plant traits associated with production, phenology, and morphology. Analyses of variance revealed strong population differences for all plant traits (P<0.0001), indicating genetic variation. Both the canonical correlation and linear correlation established associations between source populations and climate variability. Populations from warmer, more arid climates had generally lower dry weight, earlier phenology, and smaller, narrower leaves than those from cooler, moister climates. The first three canonical variates were regressed with climate variables resulting in significant models (P<0.0001) used to map 12 seed zones. Of the 700981km(2) mapped, four seed zones represented 92% of the area in typically semi-arid and arid regions. The association of genetic variation with source climates in the intermountain west suggested climate driven natural selection and evolution. We recommend seed transfer zones and population movement guidelines to enhance adaptation and diversity for large-scale restoration projects.

AB  - Long-term field monitoring data and historical crop data are useful to assess the impacts of climate change and to manage cropping systems. The objectives of this study are to understand the cropping system response to a warming-drying trend in the northern agro-pastural ecotone (NAE) of China and to document how farmers can adapt to the warming-drying trend by changing cropping system structure and adjusting planting date. The results indicate that a significant warming-drying trend existed in the NAE from 1980 to 2009, and this trend significantly decreased crop (spring wheat, naked oat, and potato) yields. Furthermore, the yield decreased by 16.2%-28.4% with a 1 degrees C increase in maximum temperature and decreased by 6.6%-11.8% with a 10% decrease in precipitation. Considering food security, water use efficiency, and water ecological adaptability in the semi-arid NAE, cropping system structure adjustment (e.g., a shift from wheat to potato as the predominant crop) and planting date adaptation (e.g., a delay in crop planting date) can offset the impact of the warming-drying trend in the NAE. Based on the successful offsetting of the impact of the warming-drying trend in the NAE, we conclude that farmers can reduce the negative effects of climate change and minimize the risk of crop failure by adapting their cropping system structure at the farming level.

AB  - Insects have been influential models in research on color variation, its evolutionary drivers and the mechanistic basis of such variation. More recently, several studies have indicated that insect color is responding to rapid climate change. However, it remains challenging to ascertain drivers of color variation among populations and species, and across space and time, as multiple biotic and abiotic factors can interact and mediate color change. Here, we describe some of the challenges and recent advances made in this field. First, we outline the main alternative hypotheses that exist for insect color variation in relation to climatic factors. Second, we review the existing evidence for contemporary adaptive evolution of insect color in response to climate change and then discuss factors that can promote or hinder the evolution of color in response to climate change. Finally, we propose future directions and highlight gaps in this research field. Pigments and structures producing insect color can vary concurrently or independently, and may evolve at different rates, with poorly understood effects on gene frequencies and fitness. Disentangling multiple competing hypotheses explaining insect coloration should be key to assign color variation as an evolutionary response to climate change.

AB  - As a result of global climate change, the frequency and intensity of heat waves have increased significantly. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), extreme temperatures in southwestern Pakistan have exceeded 54 degrees C in successive years. The identification and assessment of heat-health vulnerability (HHV) are important for controlling heat-related diseases and mortality. At present, heat waves have many definitions. To better describe the heat wave mortality risk, we redefine the heat wave by regarding the most frequent temperature (MFT) as the minimum temperature threshold for HHV for the first time. In addition, different indicators that serve as relevant evaluation factors of exposure, sensitivity and adaptability are selected to conduct a kilometre-level HHV assessment. The hesitant analytic hierarchy process (H-AHP) method is used to evaluate each index weight. Finally, we incorporate the weights into the data layers to establish the final HHV assessment model. The vulnerability in the study area is divided into five levels, high, middle-high, medium, middle-low and low, with proportions of 3.06%, 46.55%, 41.85%, 8.53% and 0%, respectively. Health facilities and urbanization were found to provide advantages for vulnerability reduction. Our study improved the resolution to describe the spatial heterogeneity of HHV, which provided a reference for more detailed model construction. It can help local government formulate more targeted control measures to reduce morbidity and mortality during heat waves.

AB  - Solar fuel is one of the ideal energy sources in the future. The synergy of photo and thermal effects leads to a new approach to higher solar fuel production under relatively mild conditions. This paper reviews different approaches for solar fuel production from spectrum-selective photo-thermal synergetic catalysis. The review begins with the meaning of synergetic effects, and the mechanisms of spectrum-selectivity and photo-thermal catalysis. Then, from a technical perspective, a number of experimental or theoretical works are sorted by the chemical reactions and the sacrificial reagents applied. In addition, these works are summarized and tabulated based on the operating conditions, spectrum-selectivity, materials, and productivity. A discussion is finally presented concerning future development of photo-thermal catalytic reactions with spectrum-selectivity.

Investigating optimum reservoir designs is one of the key issues for efficient and sustainable utilization of geothermal resource. With this objective we simulate the hydraulic-thermal coupled subsurface processes related to the provision of geothermal energy. The presented application, including visualization, mesh generation and numerical simulation, is based on open source software. The numerical investigations of the three exploitation concepts take into account all geological layers, major natural fault zones, hydraulic fractures, geothermal wells and related hydraulic-thermal coupled processes. In the current exploitation concept, the fluid flows through the rock matrix between the injection and the production well (matrix dominated). The related numerical model is compared and calibrated to available field data. Then, the model is used to investigate two alternative stimulation concepts. All three concepts were evaluated taking into account the evolution of the production temperature as well as the hydraulic conductivity between production and injection well. As an alternative to the current situation, a fracture dominated system is investigated where the fluid flows through hydraulically induced fractures between injection and production well. Compared to the reference model, a twofold increase in productivity could be observed together with a significantly reduced time before the onset of a thermal breakthrough. The second alternative is a hybrid concept combining both matrix and fracture-dominated flow paths between the production and the injection well. We show that this hybrid approach could significantly increase the reservoir productivity and prolongs the time before the onset of thermal breakthrough. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microwave-induced plasma was used for the generation of plasma-processed air (PPA) and plasma-treated water (PTW). By this way, the plasma was able to functionalize the compressed air and the used water to antimicrobial effective agents. Their fungicidal effects by single and combined application were investigated on Candida albicans strain SC5314. The monoculture of C. albicans was cultivated on specimens with polymeric surface structures (PE-stripes). The additive as well as the synergistic fungicidal potential of PPA and PTW was investigated by different process windows of plasma exposure time (5-50 s) and sample treatment time with PPA/PTW (1-5 min). For a single PTW or PPA treatment, an increase in the reduction factor with the indicated treatment time was observed (maximum reduction factor of 1.1 and 1.6, respectively). In comparison, the combined application of PTW and then PPA resulted in antagonistic, additive and synergistic effects, depending on the combination. An application of the synergistically acting processes of PTW for cleaning and PPA for drying can be an innovative alternative to the sanitary processes currently used in production plants.

AB  - Mechanistic trade-offs between traits under selection can shape and constrain evolutionary adaptation to environmental stressors. However, our knowledge of the quantitative and qualitative overlap in the molecular machinery among stress tolerance traits is highly restricted by the challenges of comparing and interpreting data between separate studies and laboratories, as well as to extrapolating between different levels of biological organization. We investigated the expression of the constitutive proteome (833 proteins) of 35 Drosophila melanogaster replicate populations artificially selected for increased resistance to six different environmental stressors. The evolved proteomes were significantly differentiated from replicated control lines. A targeted analysis of the constitutive proteomes revealed a regime-specific selection response among heat-shock proteins, which provides evidence that selection also adjusts the constitutive expression of these molecular chaperones. Although the selection response in some proteins was regime specific, the results were dominated by evidence for a common stress response. With the exception of high temperature survival, we found no evidence for negative correlations between environmental stress resistance traits, meaning that evolutionary adaptation is not constrained by mechanistic trade-offs in regulation of functional important proteins. Instead, standing genetic variation and genetic trade-offs outside regulatory domains likely constrain the evolutionary responses in natural populations.

AB  - Correlated traits are important from an evolutionary perspective as natural selection acting on one trait may indirectly affect other traits. Further, the response to selection can be constrained or hastened as a result of correlations. Because mating behaviour and body colour can dramatically affect fitness, a correlation between them can have important fitness ramifications. In this work, melanic (black) male mosquitofishes (Gambusia holbrooki) with temperature-sensitive body-colour expression are bred in captivity. Half of the sons of each melanic sire are reared at 19 degreesC (and express a black body colour) and half are reared at 31 degreesC (and express a silver body colour). The two colour morphs are placed in the same social setting and monitored for behavioural differences. Mating behaviour and colour are correlated traits. Mating behaviour differs markedly between the two phenotypes, despite high genetic relatedness. Melanic (black) phenotypes are more aggressive towards females, chasing them and attempting more matings than their silver siblings. Females avoid melanic-male mating attempts more than silver-male mating attempts. When males with temperature-sensitive colour expression are melanic and aggressive, they probably experience a very different selective regime in nature from when they are silver and less aggressive. Under some conditions (e.g. predation), melanic coloration and/or aggression is advantageous compared with silver coloration and/or less aggressive behaviour. However, under different conditions (e.g. high-frequency melanism), melanism and/or aggression appears to be disadvantageous and melanic males have reduced survival and reproduction. Selective advantages to each morph under different conditions may enable the long-term persistence of this temperature-sensitive genotype.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate epigenetic changes in Daphnia magna after a 25-day chronic external gamma irradiation (generation F0 exposed to 6.5 mu Gy.h(-1) or 41.3 mGy.h(-1)) and their potential inheritance by subsequent recovering generations, namely, F2 (exposed as germline cells in F1 embryos) and F3 (the first truly unexposed generation). Effects on survival, growth, and reproduction were observed and DNA was extracted for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in all generations. Results showed effects on reproduction in F0 but no effect in the subsequent generations F1, F2, and F3. In contrast, we observed significant methylation changes at specific CpG positions in every generation independent of dose rate, with a majority of hypomethylation. Some of these changes were shared between dose rates and between generations. Associated gene functions included gene families and genes that were previously shown to play roles during exposure to ionizing radiation. Common methylation changes detected between generations F2 and F3 clearly showed that epigenetic modifications can be transmitted to unexposed generations, most likely through the germline, with potential implications for environmental risk.

AB  - Optimization of thermal processes relies on adequate degradation kinetic models to warrant food safety and quality. The knowledge on thermal inactivation kinetics of antimicrobial peptides is necessary to allow for their adequate use as natural biopreservatives in the food industry. In this work, thermal inactivation of the previously characterized bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) P34 was kinetically investigated within the temperature range of 90-120 degrees C. Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 was used as the indicator microorganism for antimicrobial activity. Applicability of various inactivation models available in the literature was critically evaluated. The first-order model provided the best description of the kinetics of inactivation over the selected temperatures, with k values between 0.059 and 0.010 min(-1). D and k values decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing temperature, indicating a faster inactivation at higher temperatures. Results suggest that BLIS P34 is thermostable, with a z value of 37.74 degrees C and E-a of 72 kJ mol(-1).

AB  - Under conditions of carbon starvation or thermal, osmotic, or oxidative shock, mutants affected in the synthesis or mobilization of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) are known to survive less well. It is still unclear if the synthesis and accumulation of PHB are sufficient to protect bacteria against stress conditions or if the stored PHB has to be mobilized. Here, we demonstrated that mobilization of PHB in Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1 was heat-shock activated at 45 degrees C. In situ proton (H-1) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (i.e., H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance) showed that heat shock increased amounts of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) only in H. seropedicae strains able to synthesize and mobilize PHB. H. seropedicae SmR1 mutants unable to synthesize or mobilize PHB were more susceptible to heat shock and survived less well than the parental strain. When 100 mM 3-hydroxybutyrate was added to the medium, the Delta phaC1 strain (an H. seropedicae mutant unable to synthesize PHB) and the double mutant with deletion of both phaZ1 and phaZ2 (i.e., Delta phaZ1.2) (unable to mobilize PHB) showed partial rescue of heat adaptability (from 0% survival without 3HB to 40% of the initial viable population). Addition of 200 mM 3HB before the imposition of heat shock reduced protein aggregation to 15% in the Delta phaC1 mutant and 12% in the Delta phaZ1.2 mutant. We conclude that H. seropedicae SmR1 is naturally protected by 3HB released by PHB mobilization, while mutants unable to generate large amounts of 3HB under heat shock conditions are less able to cope with heat damage.
   IMPORTANCE Bacteria are subject to abrupt changes in environmental conditions affecting their growth, requiring rapid adaptation. Increasing the concentration of some metabolites can protect bacteria from hostile conditions that lead to protein denaturation and precipitation, as well as damage to plasma membranes. In this work, we demonstrated that under thermal shock, the bacterium Herbaspirillum seropedicae depolymerized its intracellular stock polymer known as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), rapidly increasing the concentration of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and decreasing protein precipitation by thermal denaturation. Mutant H. seropedicae strains unable to produce or depolymerize PHB suffered irreparable damage during thermal shock, resulting in fast death when incubated at 45 degrees C. Our results will contribute to the development of bacteria better adapted to high temperatures found either in natural conditions or in industrial processes. In the case of H. seropedicae and other bacteria that interact beneficially with plants, the understanding of PHB metabolism can be decisive for the development of more-competitive strains and their application as biofertilizers in agriculture.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the possibility of using a stand-alone photovoltaic system (SAPVS) for electricity generation in urban areas in Southern Mexico. In Mexico, an urban area is defined as an area where more than 2500 inhabitants live. Due to constant migration from the countryside to the cities, the number of inhabitants of urban localities has been increasing. Global horizontal irradiation (GHI) data were recorded every 10 min during 2014-2016 in Coatzacoalcos in the state of Veracruz located on 18 degrees 08'09 '' N and 94 degrees 27'48 '' W. In this study, batteries represented 77% of the total cost, 12 PV panels of 310 W could export 5.41 MWh to the grid, and an inverter with an integrated controller and charger was selected, which decreased the initial cost. The city of Coatzacoalcos was chosen because the average annual temperature is 28 degrees, with an average relative humidity of 75% and an average irradiance of 5.3 kWh/m(2)/day. An emission factor 0.505 tCO(2)/MWh of greenhouse gases (GHG) were obtained, based on the power system, the reduction of net annual GHG would be 11 tCO(2) and a financial revenue of 36.951 x 10(3) $/tCO(2) would be obtained. Financial parameters such as a 36.3% Internal Rate Return (IRR) and 3.4 years payback show the financial viability of this investment. SAPVSs in urban areas in Mexico could be a benefit as long as housing has a high consumption of electricity.

AB  - The critical environmental issues of antibiotic resistance and renewable energies supply urge researching materials synthesis and catalyst activity on hydrogen production processes. Aiming to analyse the antibacterial effect of platinum-silver (Ag-Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) and the catalyst effect on NaBH4 hydrolysis that can be used for hydrogen generation technology, in this work, Ag-Pt NPs were prepared using aqueous propolis extract. Various methods were used for the characterization (Uv-vis Spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD)). The antimicrobial activity of Ag-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles was evaluated in vitro by the microdilution method against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Serratia marcescens. The results confirmed the antimicrobial activity of bimetallic NPs Ag-Pt concentrations of (25, 50, and 100 mu g/ml). A concentration of 100 mu g/ml showed low bacterial viability varying between 22.58% and 29.67% for the six tested bacteria. For the catalyst activity on NaBH4 hydrolysis, the results showed high turnover factor (TOF) and low activation energy of 1208.57 h(-1) and 25.61 kJ/mol, respectively, with high hydrogen yield under low temperature. Synthesized Ag-Pt NPs can have great potential for biological and hydrogen storage applications.

AB  - The ability to modify phenotypes in response to heterogeneity of the thermal environment represents an important component of an ectotherm's non-genetic adaptive capacity. Despite considerable attention being dedicated to the study of thermally-induced developmental plasticity, whether or not interspecific interactions shape the plastic response in both a predator and its prey remains unknown. We tested several predictions about the joint influence of predator/prey scents and thermal conditions on the plasticity of preferred body temperatures (T (p)) in both actors of this interaction, using a dragonfly nymphs-newt larvae system. Dragonfly nymphs (Aeshna cyanea) and newt eggs (Ichthyosaura alpestris) were subjected to fluctuating cold and warm thermal regimes (7-12 and 12-22A degrees C, respectively) and the presence/absence of a predator or prey chemical cues. Preferred body temperatures were measured in an aquatic thermal gradient (5-33A degrees C) over a 24-h period. Newt T (p) increased with developmental temperature irrespective of the presence/absence of predator cues. In dragonflies, thermal reaction norms for T (p) were affected by the interaction between temperature and prey cues. Specifically, the presence of newt scents in cold regime lowered dragonfly T (p). We concluded that predator-prey interactions influenced thermally-induced plasticity of T (p) but not in a reciprocal fashion. The occurrence of frequency-dependent thermal plasticity may have broad implications for predator-prey population dynamics, the evolution of thermal biology traits, and the consequences of sustaining climate change within ecological communities.

AB  - This work relates to developing thermal protection for a finite period of exposure to a high temperature environment. This type of transient heat transfer problem starts with a heating period, which is then followed by a cooling period once the high temperature environment disappears. The study is particularly relevant to the thermal protection of flight data recorders from high temperature flame. In this work, transient heat conduction through a three-concentric-layer configuration is numerically studied, which includes a metal housing, a thermal insulation, and a phase change material. The thermal performance is evaluated using the center temperature changing with time. It is found that the center temperature reaches a peak during cooling period rather than heating period. Time taken to reach the peak and the peak value depend on the sizes and properties of the layers. The properties include latent heat of fusion, melting temperature, heat capacities, and thermal conductivities. Parametric study is conducted to analyze and distinguish the influence of these parameters. The study provides general guidance for determining sizes and selecting materials for the thermal design of flight data recorders. Additionally, the study is also useful for other similar applications, for which thermal management and protection over a period of time is needed. In this paper, analysis starts with a baseline configuration composed of specific materials and sizes. Finite changes are applied to sizes, properties of the materials, and the results are compared to understand the roles of the varied parameters in affecting the thermal protection performance.

AB  - Understanding the evolutionary responses of organisms to thermal regimes is of prime importance to better predict their ability to cope with ongoing climate change. Although this question has attracted interest in free-living organisms, whether or not infectious diseases have evolved heterogeneous responses to climate is still an open question. Here, we ran a common garden experiment using the fish ectoparasite Tracheliastes polycolpus, (i) to test whether parasites living in thermally heterogeneous rivers respond differently to an experimental thermal gradient and (ii) to determine the evolutionary processes (natural selection or genetic drift) underlying these responses. We demonstrated that the reaction norms involving the survival rate of the parasite larvae (i.e. the infective stage) across a temperature gradient significantly varied among six parasite populations. Using a Q(st)/F-st approach and phenotype-environment associations, we further showed that the evolution of survival rate partly depended upon temperature regimes experienced in situ, and was mostly underlined by diversifying selection, but also-to some extent-by stabilizing selection and genetic drift. This evolutionary response led to population divergences in thermal tolerance across the landscape, which has implications for predicting the effects of future climate change.

AB  - In some reptiles, gravid females bask more, and/or maintain higher body temperatures than do males or non-gravid females. This phenomenon is usually explained in terms of the female or her offspring benefitting from accelerated embryogenesis and early birth, but the effect of increased basking on gestation period has not been studied, In a laboratory experiment, gestation periods of gravid female skinks (Eulamprus tympanum) decreased with the duration of access to radiant heat. Embryonic development was more rapid in the laboratory than in the field, and there were no apparent adverse effects of this accelerated gestation on females or offspring. Number and mass of offspring, survival rates of embryos, relative clutch mass and female mass before and after parturition were not influenced by the decrease in gestation period caused by increased basking. Females selected similar temperatures in the laboratory and field (32-degrees-C), despite the availability of higher temperatures in the laboratory. Thus, gestation in the laboratory was accelerated by spending longer periods at usual basking temperatures, rather than by selecting higher temperatures. In the field, mean and modal body temperatures of active animals were similar in gravid females, males and non-gravid females, but gravid females appear to bask more of the time, even in cloudy weather when other members of the population do not bask. Hence, an apparent similarity in thermal regimes of gravid and non-gravid animals may mask significant underlying differences in thermoregulatory strategies.

AB  - Coffee culture, one of the main agricultural activities in Brazil, has undergone recent negative impacts due to unfavorable climate conditions, with a subnormal rainy period and increased temperatures during the second half of 2015. The coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari, 1867) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is one of the main insect pests of coffee crops worldwide.The present research aimed to determine the climate zones for coffee berry borer in the state of Sao Paulo, based on its thermal requirements. The results showed that the mean biological development time of H. hampei was affected by temperature, completing its life cycle more rapidly in increased temperatures until the 30 degrees C threshold temperature, and more slowly above this temperature. Development time (egg-adult) was inversely related to temperature in the range between 18 and 32 degrees C.The temperature threshold (T-t) was 13.9 degrees C and the thermal constant (K) was 299 degree-days.These laboratory estimates of thermal requirements and the Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to generate insect life span distribution maps for Sao Paulo. In this state, the coffee berry borer can produce 5.09-10.53 generations annually. Higher pest incidences should coincide with both temperature increases and the availability of coffee fruit for infestation.The data obtained can be used to estimate the monthly and yearly number of generations of this pest, for use in integrated pest management programs.

AB  - The youngest of the giant impact basins on Mars are either weakly magnetized or completely demagnetized, indicating that a global magnetic field was not present at the time those basins formed. Eight basins are sufficiently large that the impact heating associated with their formation could have penetrated below the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Here we investigate the thermal evolution of the martian interior and the fate of the global magnetic field using 3D mantle convection models coupled to a parameterized 1D core thermal evolution model. We find that the survival of the impact-induced temperature anomalies in the upper mantle is strongly controlled by the mantle viscosity. Impact heating from subsequent impacts can accumulate in stiffer mantles faster than it can be advected away, resulting in a thermal blanket that insulates an entire hemisphere. The impact heating in the core will halt dynamo activity, at least temporarily. If the mantle is initially cold, and the core initially superheated, dynamo activity may resume as quickly as a few Myr after each impact. However unless the lower mantle has either a low viscosity or a high thermal conductivity, this restored dynamo will last for only a few hundred Myr after the end of the sequence of impacts. Thus, we find that the longevity of the magnetic field is more strongly controlled by the lower mantle properties and relatively insensitive to the impact induced temperature anomalies in the upper mantle.

AB  - Summer mortality of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is the result of a complex interaction between oysters, their environment and their pathogens. The physiological status of an oyster, especially its reproductive status, is suspected to play a significant role in the outcome of this interaction. As genetic variability exists for susceptibility to summer mortality, resistant (R) and susceptible (S) oyster lines were produced using a divergent selection scheme. The present paper reports a histological study on gonad area, which is representative of reproductive effort, in randomly chosen five R and five S oyster lines. The R lines showed a significantly lower gonad area than the S lines (P<0.001). with an estimated mean difference of 12.5%, whereas, taken together, R and S lines showed a similar distribution of gametogenic stages when sampled. Considering the lines separately, the significant difference in gonad area went up to 24% between R and S lines. The present data confirm and strengthen the negative correlation between reproductive effort and resistance to summer mortality observed in previous studies. Summer mortality of C. gigas in France could, therefore, be partly due to a physiological disorder and metabolic disturbance in oysters associated with their reproductive effort. This does not, however, imply a direct link between the cost of reproduction and mortality because other causal factors, such as pathogenic agents, could be the primary causal factors.

AB  - Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus nitens (GxN) hybrid clones are selected to combine complimentary characteristics of E. nitens and E. grandis. GxN hybrid clones also have the potential to increase growth rates and provide adaptability to a changing climate. A series of three trials planted across a range of high-productivity, mid-altitude sites in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands was established to test the suitability of a suite of GxN hybrid clones. Seven commercially available GxN clones together with two widely planted pure species controls, Eucalyptus dunnii and Eucalyptus smithii, were chosen for this study. The trials were set out in random complete block designs with nine treatments and four replications set out in square plots of 25 trees. The trials were measured for diameter at breast height at 23 months and monitored for snow damage over two winter seasons. Snow was noted at the Baynesfield site and subsequent snow damage assessments were performed. Basal area per hectare was calculated for each plot as a function of diameter at breast height and survival. Significant differences were observed between GxN hybrid clones in both growth and snow tolerance. The top-performing clones significantly outperformed both pure species controls in terms of growth and snow tolerance. Early results indicate that GxN hybrids may be better suited to high-potential, mid-altitude sites exposed to light snow risk than the currently recommended pure species.

AB  - The wider adoption of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology for power generation or cogeneration from renewable or recovered waste-heat in many applications can be facilitated by improved thermodynamic performance, but also reduced investment costs. In this context, it is suggested that the further development of ORC power systems should be guided by combined thermoeconomic assessments that can capture directly the trade-offs between performace and cost with the aim of proposing solutions with high resource-use efficiency and, importantly, improved economic viability. This paper couples, for the first time, the computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) of the ORC working-fluid based on the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT)-gamma Mie equation of state with thermodynamic modelling and optimisation, in addition to heat-exchanger sizing models, component cost correlations and thermoeconomic assessments. The resulting CAMD-ORC framework presents a novel and powerful approach with extended capabilities that allows the thermodynamic optimisation of the ORC system and working fluid to be performed in a single step, thus removing subjective and pre-emptive screening criteria that exist in conventional approaches, while also extending to include cost considerations relating to the resulting optimal systems. Following validation, the proposed framework is used to identify optimal cycles and working fluids over a wide range of conditions characterised by three different heat-source cases with temperatures of 150 degrees C, 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C, corresponding to small- to medium-scale applications. In each case, the optimal combination of ORC system design and working fluid is identified, and the corresponding capital costs are evaluated. It is found that fluids with low specific-investment costs (SIC) are different to those that maximise the power output. The fluids with the lowest SIC are isoheptane, 2-pentene and 2-heptene, with SICs of 5620 pound, 2760 pound and 2070 pound per kW respectively, and corresponding power outputs of 32.9 kW, 136.6 kW and 213.9 kW.

AB  - Sympatric tree species are subject to similar climatic drivers, posing a question as to whether they display comparable adaptive responses. However, no study has explicitly examined local adaptation of co-occurring parasitic and autotrophic plant species to the abiotic environment. Here we test the hypotheses that a generalist parasitic tree would display a weaker signal of selection and that genomic variation would associate with fewer climatic variables (particularly precipitation) but have similar spatial patterns to a sympatric autotrophic tree species. To test these hypotheses, we collected samples from 17 sites across the range of two tree species, the hemiparasiteNuytsia floribunda(n = 264) and sympatric autotrophMelaleuca rhaphiophylla(n = 272). We obtained 5,531 high-quality genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) forM. rhaphiophyllaand 6,727 SNPs forN. floribundausing DArTseq genome scan technology. Population differentiation and environmental association approaches were used to identify signals of selection. Generalized dissimilarly modelling was used to detect climatic and spatial patterns of local adaptation across climatic gradients. Overall, 322 SNPs were identified as putatively adaptive for the autotroph, while only 57 SNPs were identified for the parasitic species. We found genomic variation to associate with different sets of bioclimatic variables for each species, with precipitation relatively less important for the parasite. Spatial patterns of predicted adaptive variability were different and indicate that co-occurring species with disparate life history traits may not respond equally to selective pressures (i.e., temperature and precipitation). Together, these findings provide insight into local adaptation of sympatric parasitic and autotrophic tree species to abiotic environments.

AB  - For nearly a decade, the metazoan-focused research community has explored the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on marine animals, noting that changes in ocean chemistry can impact calcification, metabolism, acid-base regulation, stress response and behavior in organisms that hold high ecological and economic value. Because OA interacts with several key physiological processes in marine organisms, transcriptomics has become a widely-used method to characterize whole organism responses on a molecular level as well as inform mechanisms that explain changes in phenotypes observed in response to OA. In the past decade, there has been a notable rise in studies that examine transcriptomic responses to OA in marine metazoans, and here we attempt to summarize key findings across these studies. We find that organisms vary dramatically in their transcriptomic responses to pH although common patterns are often observed, including shifts in acid-base ion regulation, metabolic processes, calcification and stress response mechanisms. We also see a rise in transcriptomic studies examining organismal response to OA in a multi-stressor context, often reporting synergistic effects of OA and temperature. In addition, there is an increase in studies that use transcriptomics to examine the evolutionary potential of organisms to adapt to OA conditions in the future through population and transgenerational experiments. Overall, the literature reveals complex organismal responses to OA, in which some organisms will face more dramatic consequences than others. This will have wide-reaching impacts on ocean communities and ecosystems as a whole.

AB  - Mountain plant species with wide elevational ranges are expected to be exposed to different selection pressures at low and high elevation. Estimating the extent of genetic population differentiation contributes to our understanding of selective forces shaping phenotypic variation of plants in response to changing climate conditions. Using a common garden experiment, we measured narrow-sense heritability (h (2)) and quantitative trait differentiation (Q (ST)) in several growth-related, reproductive and phenological traits among low and high elevation populations of the semi-dry grassland species Ranunculus bulbosus from the Swiss Alps. Q (ST) values were compared to neutral genetic differentiation (F (ST)) based on AFLP markers and indicated divergent selection in most traits among all populations as well as among low and high elevation populations separately. Furthermore, pairwise Q (ST) and F (ST) estimates were not correlated suggesting that neutral marker differentiation is not a valuable proxy for quantitative trait differentiation. Neutral molecular differentiation increased with geographical distance whereas quantitative genetic differentiation did not follow an isolation by distance pattern. Plant traits did mostly not differ among low and high populations and pairwise Q (ST)-F (ST) comparisons indicated no divergent selection between the two elevations. Differing levels of trait differentiation in low and high elevation populations, however, indicated that different selective forces acted on plants at contrasting elevations suggesting that selection regimes might alter under climate warming.

AB  - Winter hardiness is a major constraint for autumn sown crops in temperate regions, and thus an important breeding goal in the development of new winter wheat varieties. Winter hardiness is though influenced by many environmental factors rendering phenotypic selection under field conditions a difficult task due to irregular occurrence or absence of winter damage in field trials. Controlled frost tolerance tests in growth chamber experiments are, on the other hand, even with few genotypes, often costly and laborious, which makes a genomic breeding strategy for early generation selection an attractive alternative. The aims of this study were thus to compare the merit of marker-assisted selection using the major frost tolerance QTL Fr-A2 with genomic prediction for winter hardiness and frost tolerance, and to assess the potential of combining both measures with a genomic selection index using a high density marker map or a reduced set of pre-selected markers. Cross-validation within two training populations phenotyped for frost tolerance and winter hardiness underpinned the importance of Fr-A2 for frost tolerance especially when upweighting its effect in genomic prediction models, while a combined genomic selection index increased the prediction accuracy for an independent validation population in comparison to training with winter hardiness data alone. The prediction accuracy could moreover be maintained with pre-selected marker sets, which is highly relevant when employing cost reducing fingerprinting techniques such as targeted genotyping-by-sequencing. Genomic selection showed thus large potential to improve or maintain the performance of winter wheat for these difficult, costly, and laborious to phenotype traits.

AB  - Adaptive syndromes and their evolutionary constraints represent a powerful construct for understanding plant distributions. However, it is unclear how the species requirements to face multiple stressors promotes syndrome formation and to which abiotic stressors these syndromes show adaptive value over broad geographic scales. We combined local occurrence data from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) of 219 angiosperm and 85 gymnosperm species living across the conterminous US with phylogenies and trait data to identify tree syndromes, their evolutionary conservatism, and their adaptive value over broad scales. Factor analyses and evolutionary model selection revealed that trees possess functional trait syndromes that are strongly conserved. Major syndromes at the species level differed between angiosperms and gymnosperms. While the two main syndromes in angiosperms were related to cold and drought-waterlogging tolerance, in gymnosperms a trade-off between shade and drought tolerance was the main syndrome followed by a growth-fire resistance syndrome. Additional RLQ and fourth-corner approaches revealed that trait syndromes at the community level were broadly similar to those observed at the species level for angiosperms, although this was less clear for gymnosperms. This suggests that syndrome evolution has played an important role on angiosperm distributions, whereas additional ecological factors explain gymnosperm distributions. Importantly, syndromes show adaptive value, as they were geographically associated with several environmental variables showing structure from continental to local scales, being temperature the main abiotic stressor. Our results indicate that across the conterminous US tree species possess clear syndromes that are subjected to strong evolutionary constraints driving tree species and forest community distribution.

AB  - Environmental fluctuations can select for generalism, which is also hypothesized to increase organisms' ability to invade novel environments. Here, we show that across a range of temperatures, opportunistic bacterial pathogen Serratia marcescens that evolved in fluctuating temperature (daily variation between 24 degrees C and 38 degrees C, mean 31 degrees C) outperforms the strains that evolved in constant temperature (31 degrees C). The growth advantage was also evident in novel environments in the presence of parasitic viruses and predatory protozoans, but less clear in the presence of stressful chemicals. Adaptation to fluctuating temperature also led to reduced virulence in Drosophila melanogaster host, which suggests that generalism can still be costly in terms of reduced fitness in other ecological contexts. While supporting the hypothesis that evolution of generalism is coupled with tolerance to several novel environments, our results also suggest that thermal fluctuations driven by the climate change could affect both species' invasiveness and virulence.

AB  - Withering syndrome disease has experienced worldwide spread in the last decade. This fatal disease for abalone is produced by a rickettsia-like organism (WS-RLO), the bacterium "Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis". To evaluate the potential of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to improve its resistance to infection by WS-RLO, the additive genetic component in the variation of this trait was estimated. For this, the variation in infection intensity with WS-RLOs and WS-RLOv (phage-infected RLOs) was analyzed in 56 families of full-sibs maintained for three years in a host-parasite cohabitation aquaculture system. A WS-RLO prevalence of 65% was observed in the analysed population; and from the total WS-RLO inclusions 60% were hyperparasited with the phage (WS-RLOv). The decrease in the food ingestion rate was the sole negative effect associated with increasing WS-RLO intensity of infection, suggesting that the high level of WS-RLOv load may have diminished the symptoms of WS disease in the analyzed abalones. The estimated heritabilities were moderate to mid, but significant, varying from 0.21 to 0.23 and 0.36 for WS-RLO and WS-RLOv infections, respectively. This suggests that variation in resistance to infection with WS-RLO may respond to selection in the evaluated red abalone population. Estimated response to selection (G) for the level of infection by WS-RLO indicated that if the 10% of red abalone with the lowest infection level is selected as broodstock, a 90% reduction in the intensity of infection in the progeny can be expected, even with the lowest estimation of heritability (h(2) = 0.21). This strong response would be also due to the large phenotypic variance of this trait. Strong positive correlations, both phenotypic and genotypic, were observed between infection intensities with WS-RLO and WS-RLOv, indicating that selection to increase resistance to one of the types of RLOs will affect resistance in the other in the same direction. This is the first study that demonstrates the existence of additive genetic variation for resistance to WS-RLO in abalone. Consequently, it is possible to increase the resistance to WS-RLO in H. rufescens by selective breeding, which can be an economically attractive and environmentally friendly manner to reduce mortalities and growth effects caused by WS in abalone farms.

AB  - Latitudinal clines are considered a powerful means of investigating evolutionary responses to climatic selection in nature. However, most clinal studies of climatic adaptation in Drosophila have involved species that contain cosmopolitan inversion polymorphisms that show clinal patterns themselves, making it difficult to determine whether the traits or inversions are under selection. Further, although climatic selection is unlikely to act on only one life stage in metamorphic organisms, a few studies have examined clinal patterns across life stages. Finally, clinal patterns of heat tolerance may also depend on the assay used. To unravel these potentially confounding effects on clinal patterns of thermal tolerance, we examined adult and larval heat tolerance traits in populations of Drosophila simulans from eastern Australia using static and dynamic (ramping 0.06 similar to degrees C similar to min-1) assays. We also used microsatellites markers to clarify whether demographic factors or selection are responsible for population differentiation along clines. Significant cubic clinal patterns were observed for adult static basal, hardened and dynamic heat knockdown time and static basal heat survival in larvae. In contrast, static, hardened larval heat survival increased linearly with latitude whereas no clinal association was found for larval ramping survival. Significant associations between adult and larval traits and climatic variables, and low population differentiation at microsatellite loci, suggest a role for climatic selection, rather than demographic processes, in generating these clinal patterns. Our results suggest that adaptation to thermal stress may be species and life-stage specific, complicating our efforts to understand the evolutionary responses to selection for increasing thermotolerance.

Theoretical and empirical work suggest that compensatory adaptations to mutations in genes involved in sex determination may play a role in the evolution of these pathways. Here, we directly address this problem using experimental evolution in Caenorhabditis elegans lines fixed for a pair of mutations in two key sex-determining genes that jointly render sex determination temperature-sensitive and cause intersexual (but still weakly to moderately fertile) phenotypes at intermediate temperatures. After 50 generations, evolved lines clearly recovered toward wild-type phenotypes. However, changes in transcript levels of key sex-determining genes in evolved lines cannot explain their partially (or in some cases, nearly completely) rescued phenotypes, implying that wild-type phenotypes can be restored independently of the transcriptional effects of these mutations. Our findings highlight the microevolutionary flexibility of sex determination pathways and suggest that compensatory adaptation to mutations can elicit novel and unpredictable evolutionary trajectories in these pathways, mirroring the phylogenetic diversity, and macroevolutionary dynamics of sex determination mechanisms.

AB  - A critical review of earthworm use in chronic ecotoxicological studies is presented. In laboratory studies, species selection has often been based on commercial availability or on field-collected earthworms. The validity of results employing earthworms of either unknown origin or previous exposures must be questioned. Many studies have relied heavily on methodologies adopted from acute testing where earthworm maintenance was not a priority. A number of studies have been published without reference to such critical factors as earthworm density, food, temperature or soil moisture levels. Earthworm death has been identified as a source of error particularly in reproduction tests where adult number is directly related to cocoon production. This has been partially addressed by growing individuals separately or culturing in pairs for reproduction studies. It is suggested that a further development could be the use of parthenogenetic species allowing reproduction to be assessed on an individual basis. The use of such species would also permit tests on genetically similar cohorts. It is (widely) recognised that there are problems of extrapolation from laboratory to field scale. However, field tests remain uncommon due to difficulties with experimental design and interpretation of results. Use of laboratory-reared earthworm cohorts and mark-release-recapture techniques may allow development of a standard comparative procedure across different sites. It is suggested that wider use of established culture techniques allied to ecological requirements and behaviour of species will increase the consistency and validity of sub-lethal earthworm toxicity tests.

AB  - A cDNA (msaCIG) encoding a cold-inducible Y2K4 dehydrin in alfalfa (Medicago sativa spp. sativa) was shown to share extensive homology with sequences from other species and subspecies of Medicago. Differences were mainly the result of the occurrence of large indels, amino acids substitutions/deletions and sequence duplications. Using a combination of a bulk segregant analysis and RFLP hybridization, we uncovered an msaCIG polymorphism that increases in frequency in response to recurrent selection for superior freezing tolerance. Progenies from crosses between genotypes with (D+) or without (D-) the polymorphic dehydrin significantly differed in their tolerance to subfreezing temperatures. Based on the msaCIG sequence, we looked for intragenic variations that could be associated to the polymorphism detected on Southern blots. Amplifications with primers targeting the 3' half side of msaCIG revealed fragment size variations between pools of genotypes with (+) or without (-) the polymorphism. Three major groups of amplicons of a parts per thousand 370 nt (G1), 330 nt (G2), and 290 nt (G3) were distinguished. The G2 group was more intensively amplified in pools of genotypes with the polymorphic dehydrin and was associated to a superior freezing tolerance phenotype. Sequences analysis revealed that size variation in the 3' half was attributable to the variable occurrence of large indels. Single amino acid substitutions and/or deletions caused major differences in the prediction of the secondary structure of the polypeptides. The identification of dehydrin variants associated to superior freezing tolerance paves the way to the development of functional markers and the fixation of favorable alleles in various genetic backgrounds.

AB  - Under changing climate, temporal and spatial stability (stationarity) of growth responses of trees to weather and climate, which has often been presumed without explicit testing, is crucial for prediction of productivity and sustainability of forests. However, considering evolutionary adaptation of tree populations to wide spatiotemporal ecological gradients, extrapolation of linear responses, which could be observed in limited parts of the gradients (certain locality), can result in biased results. Accordingly, the plasticity of responses of tree-ring width of the eastern Baltic populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) to meteorological conditions across the regional climatic gradient was assessed using a mixed generalized additive model. The linear responses were assessed using a bootstrapped correlation analysis for comparison. The radial growth responses of the eastern Baltic population of Scots pine showed explicit regional gradients according to the local climates, indicating gradual shifts in the effects of winter temperature and summer moisture regime. Accordingly, temperature in late-winter and summer, as well as summer water deficit were identified as the main regional drivers of tree-ring width. Their effects were generally non-linear, indicating explicit spatiotemporal gradients in growth responses in the mid-part of species distribution. This also implied limited efficiency of simple linear models for the assessment of radial growth under moderate conditions. The responses to summer temperature indicated local optima, while the responses to drought index showed threshold values. The responses to winter temperature indicated positive effect of warming on growth. In some stands, specific non-stationary responses though were evident, suggesting that trees have adapted (specialized) to certain local climatic conditions, which are changing and thus explaining temporal shifts in growth responses. Nevertheless, the estimated responses suggested phenotypical adaptability limits of the eastern Baltic populations of Scots pine in a longer term, supporting the necessity of climate-smart management for sustainability of forest in the region in the future.

AB  - Climate changes include concurrent changes in environmental mean, variance and extremes, and it is challenging to understand their respective impact on wild populations, especially when contrasted age-dependent responses to climate occur. We assessed how changes in mean and standard deviation of sea surface temperature (SST), frequency and magnitude of warm SST extreme climatic events (ECE) influenced the stochastic population growth rate log(lambda(s)) and age structure of a black-browed albatross population. For changes in SST around historical levels observed since 1982, changes in standard deviation had a larger (threefold) and negative impact on log(lambda s) compared to changes in mean. By contrast, the mean had a positive impact on log(lambda s). The historical SST mean was lower than the optimal SST value for which log(lambda s) was maximized. Thus, a larger environmental mean increased the occurrence of SST close to this optimum that buffered the negative effect of ECE. This 'climate safety margin' (i.e. difference between optimal and historical climatic conditions) and the specific shape of the population growth rate response to climate for a species determine how ECE affect the population. For a wider range in SST, both the mean and standard deviation had negative impact on log(lambda s), with changes in the mean having a greater effect than the standard deviation. Furthermore, around SST historical levels increases in either mean or standard deviation of the SST distribution led to a younger population, with potentially important conservation implications for black-browed albatrosses.

AB  - The ability to tolerate temperature stress is an important component of adult fitness. In holometabolous insects like Drosophila melanogaster, adult stress resistance can be affected by growth conditions experienced during the larval stages. Although evolution under crowded larval conditions is known to lead to the correlated evolution of many adult traits, its consequences on adult heat stress tolerance have not been investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed the adult heat stress tolerance in populations of D. melanogaster adapted to a stressful larval crowding environment. We used replicate populations of D. melanogaster, selected for adaptation to larval crowding stress (MCUs), for more than 230 generations, and their respective controls (MBs). Larvae from selected and control populations were grown under crowded and uncrowded conditions, and their adult heat shock resistance at two different temperatures was measured. Further, we compared Hsp70 expression in crowded and uncrowded larvae of both populations and also measured the Hsp70 expression after a mild heat treatment in adults of selected and control populations. Our results showed that adaptation to larval crowding leads to the evolution of Hsp70 gene expression in larval stages and improves adult heat stress tolerance ability in males, but not in females.

AB  - Techniques for the development of mathematical models in the area of predictive microbiology have greatly improved recently, allowing better and more accurate descriptions of microbial responses to particular environmental conditions, thus enabling predictions of those responses to be made with greater confidence.  Recognising the potential value of applying these techniques in the food industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) initiated a nationally coordinated five-year programme of research into the growth and survival of microorganisms in foods, with the aim of developing a computerised Predictive Microbiology Database in the UK.  This initiative has resulted in the systematic generation of data, through protocols which ensure consistency of methodology, so that data in the database are truly comparable and compatible, and lead to reliable predictive models.  The approaches taken by scientists involved in this programme are described and the various stages in the development of mathematical models summarized.  It is hoped that this initiative and others being developed in the USA, Australia, Canada and other countries, will encourage a more integrated approach to food safety which will influence all stages of food production and, eventually, result in the development of an International Predictive Microbiology Database.

AB  - We have examined the composition of members of mutator populations of Escherichia coli by employing an extensive set of phenotypic screens that allow us to monitor die function of >700 genes, constituting similar to 15% of the genome. We looked at mismatch repair deficient cells after repeated cycles of sing le colony isolation on rich medium to generate lineages that are forced through severe bottlenecks, and compared the results to those for wild-type strains. The mutator lineages continued to accumulate mutations rapidly with each increasing cycle of colony isolation. By die end of the 40th cycle, after similar to 1000 generations, most of the lineages had reduced colony size, 4% had died out, 55% had auxotrophic requirements (increasing to 80% after 60 cycles), and 70% had defects in at least one sugar or catabolic pathway. In addition, 33% had a defect in cell motility, and 26% were either temperature-sensitive or cold-sensitive lethals. On the other hand, only 3% of die wild-type lineages had detectable mutations of any type after 40 cycles. By the 60th cycle, the typical mutator cell carried 4-5 inactive genes among the 15% of the genome being monitored, indicating that the average cell carried at least 24-30 inactivated genes distributed throughout the genome. Remarkably, 30% of the lineages had lost title ability to utilize xylose as a carbon source. DNA sequencing revealed that most of the Xyl(-) mutants had a frameshift in a run of eight G's (GGGGGGGG) in the xylB gene, either adding or deleting one -G-. Further analysis indicated that rendering E. coli deficient in mismatch repair unmasks hypermutable sites in certain genes or intergenic regions. Growth curves and competition tests on lineages that passed through 90 cycles of single colony isolation slowed that all lineages suffered reduced fitness. We discuss these results in terms of the value of mutators in cellular evolution.

AB  - Ecological specialization in plants occurs primarily through local adaptation to different environments. Local adaptation is widely thought to result in costly fitness trade-offs that result in maladaptation to alternative environments. However, recent studies suggest that such trade-offs are not universal. Further, there is currently a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for fitness trade-offs associated with adaptation. Here, we review the literature on stress responses in plants to identify potential mechanisms underlying local adaptation and ecological specialization. We focus on drought, high and low temperature, flooding, herbivore, and pathogen stresses. We then synthesize our findings with recent advances in the local adaptation and plant molecular biology literature. In the process, we identify mechanisms that could cause fitness trade-offs and outline scenarios where trade-offs are not a necessary consequence of adaptation. Future studies should aim to explicitly integrate molecular mechanisms into studies of local adaptation.

AB  - Background: The intertidal zone of seacoasts, being affected by the superimposed tidal, diurnal and lunar cycles, is temporally the most complex environment on earth. Many marine organisms exhibit lunar rhythms in reproductive behaviour and some show experimental evidence of endogenous control by a circalunar clock, the molecular and genetic basis of which is unexplored. We examined the genetic control of lunar and diurnal rhythmicity in the marine midge Clunio marinus (Chironomidae, Diptera), a species for which the correct timing of adult emergence is critical in natural populations.
   Results: We crossed two strains of Clunio marinus that differ in the timing of the diurnal and lunar rhythms of emergence. The phenotype distribution of the segregating backcross progeny indicates polygenic control of the lunar emergence rhythm. Diurnal timing of emergence is also under genetic control, and is influenced by two unlinked genes with major effects. Furthermore, the lunar and diurnal timing of emergence is correlated in the backcross generation. We show that both the lunar emergence time and its correlation to the diurnal emergence time are adaptive for the species in its natural environment.
   Conclusions: The correlation implies that the unlinked genes affecting lunar timing and the two unlinked genes affecting diurnal timing could be the same, providing an unexpectedly close interaction of the two clocks. Alternatively, the genes could be genetically linked in a two-by-two fashion, suggesting that evolution has shaped the genetic architecture to stabilize adaptive combinations of lunar and diurnal emergence times by tightening linkage. Our results, the first on genetic control of lunar rhythms, offer a new perspective to explore their molecular clockwork.

AB  - The survival of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum under the physiologically distinct environments associated with their development in the cold-blooded invertebrate mosquito vectors and the warm-blooded vertebrate human host requires a genome that caters to adaptability. To this end, a robust stress response system coupled to an efficient protein quality control system are essential features of the parasite. Heat shock proteins constitute the main molecular chaperone system of the cell, accounting for approximately two percent of the malaria genome. Some heat shock proteins of parasites constitute a large part (5%) of the 'exportome' (parasite proteins that are exported to the infected host erythrocyte) that modify the host cell, promoting its cyto-adherence. In light of their importance in protein folding and refolding, and thus the survival of the parasite, heat shock proteins of P. falciparum have been a major subject of study. Emerging evidence points to their role not only being cyto-protection of the parasite, as they are also implicated in regulating parasite virulence. In undertaking their roles, heat shock proteins operate in networks that involve not only partners of parasite origin, but also potentially functionally associate with human proteins to facilitate parasite survival and pathogenicity. This review seeks to highlight these interplays and their roles in parasite pathogenicity. We further discuss the prospects of targeting the parasite heat shock protein network towards the developments of alternative antimalarial chemotherapies.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is causing unprecedented rates of population extirpation and altering the setting of range limits for many species. Significant population declines may occur however before any reduction in range is observed. Determining and modelling the factors driving population size and trends is consequently critical to predict trajectories of change and future extinction risk. We tracked during 12 years 51 populations of a cold-water fish species (brown trout Salmo trutta) living along a temperature gradient at the warmest thermal edge of its range. We developed a carrying capacity model in which maximum population size is limited by physical habitat conditions and regulated through territoriality. We first tested whether population numbers were driven by carrying capacity dynamics and then targeted on establishing (1) the temperature thresholds beyond which population numbers switch from being physical habitat-to temperature-limited; and (2) the rate at which carrying capacity declines with temperature within limiting thermal ranges. Carrying capacity along with emergent density-dependent responses explained up to 76% of spatio-temporal density variability of juveniles and adults but only 50% of young-of-the-year's. By contrast, young-of-the-year trout were highly sensitive to thermal conditions, their performance declining with temperature at a higher rate than older life stages, and disruptions being triggered at lower temperature thresholds. Results suggest that limiting temperature effects were progressively stronger with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. There was however a critical threshold, matching the incipient thermal limit for survival, beyond which realized density was always below potential numbers irrespective of disturbance intensity. We additionally found a lower threshold, matching the thermal limit for feeding, beyond which even unaltered populations declined. We predict that most of our study populations may become extinct by 2100, depicting the gloomy fate of thermally-sensitive species occurring at thermal range margins under limited potential for adaptation and dispersal.

AB  - The catalytic performance (nitrous oxide decomposition, hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with nitrous oxide, and selective reduction of nitric oxide by i-butane) was evaluated for a set of HZSM-5 and sublimed Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, which have been extensively characterized in an earlier contribution (J. Catal. (2003)). Nitrous oxide decomposition rates for the sublimed samples strongly increase after high-temperature calcination and particularly, after high-temperature steaming. Only a small fraction of the total iron content is active in this decomposition. For benzene hydroxylation the initial phenol productivity also increases with increasing severity of treatment. It is concluded that similar catalytic sites are important. Nevertheless, Fe/ZSM-5 and Fe/ZSM-5(HTC) exhibit relatively low phenol selectivities due to significant hydrocarbon combustion. The steamed Fe/ZSM-5, however, produces phenol with high selectivity. The stability of the sublimed samples is relatively low due to the large coke make, attributable to the large number of active sites. Commercial HZSM-5 with an iron content of 0.024 wt% and its steamed counterpart are also active and have a better stability, the latter one having the highest phenol productivity after prolonged reaction times. The beneficial effect of severe activation treatments to sublimed Fe/ZSM-5, where iron is introduced at extraframework positions, is taken as an indication that removal of lattice aluminum is important for the generation of active sites. The different activity order in NO reduction by i-butane suggests that the active sites for this reaction are different from those for nitrous oxide decomposition and selective benzene oxidation.

AB  - With a vast area of marginal land, the Loess Plateau of China is a promising region for large-scale production of second-generation energy crops. However, it remains unknown whether such production is sustainable in the long run, especially under climate change. Using a regional climate change model, PRECIS, we analyzed the impact of climate change on Miscanthus production in the Loess Plateau. Under three emission scenarios, A2, B2, and A1B, both the average yield and total area capable of supporting Miscanthus production would increase continuously in the future period (2011-2099). As a result, the total yield potential in the region would increase by about 20% in this future period from the baseline period (1961-1990). This was explained primarily by predicted increases in temperature and precipitation across the Loess Plateau, which improved the yield of the perennial C4 plants relying exclusively on rainfed production. The areas that are currently too dry or too cold to support Miscanthus production could be turned into energy crop fields, especially along the arid-semiarid transition zone. Thus the Loess Plateau would become increasingly desirable for growing second-generation energy crops in this century, which could in turn contribute to soil improvement and ecological restoration of the region.

AB  - Forest loss in hotspots around the world impacts not only local climate where loss occurs, but also influences climate and vegetation in remote parts of the globe through ecoclimate teleconnections. The magnitude and mechanism of remote impacts likely depends on the location and distribution of forest loss hotspots, but the nature of these dependencies has not been investigated. We use global climate model simulations to estimate the distribution of ecologically-relevant climate changes resulting from forest loss in two hotspot regions: western North America (wNA), which is experiencing accelerated dieoff, and the Amazon basin, which is subject to high rates of deforestation. The remote climatic and ecological net effects of simultaneous forest loss in both regions differed from the combined effects of loss from the two regions simulated separately, as evident in three impacted areas. Eastern South American Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) increased due to changes in seasonal rainfall associated with Amazon forest loss and changes in temperature related to wNA forest loss. Eurasia's GPP declined with wNA forest loss due to cooling temperatures increasing soil ice volume. Southeastern North American productivity increased with simultaneous forest loss, but declined with only wNA forest loss due to changes in VPD. Our results illustrate the need for a new generation of local-to-global scale analyses to identify potential ecoclimate teleconnections, their underlying mechanisms, and most importantly, their synergistic interactions, to predict the responses to increasing forest loss under future land use change and climate change.

AB  - The integration of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes coordinates cellular energy production and is fundamental to life among eukaryotes. Therefore, there is potential for strong selection to shape the interactions between the two genomes. Several studies have now demonstrated that epistatic interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes for fitness can occur both at a "within" and "across" population level. Genotype-by-environment interactions are common for traits that are encoded by nuclear genes, but the effects of environmental heterogeneity on traits that are partly encoded by cytoplasmic genes have received little attention despite the fact that there are reasons to believe that phenotypic effects of cytoplasmic genetic variation may often be environment specific. Consequently, the importance of environmental heterogeneity to the outcomes of cyto-nuclear fitness interactions and to the maintenance of mitochondrial polymorphism is unclear. Here, we assess the influence of temperature on cyto-nuclear effects on egg-to-adult development time in seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus). We employed an "across-population" design, sourcing beetles from five distinct populations and using backcrossing to create orthogonal combinations of distinct introgression lines, fixed for their cytoplasmic and nuclear lineages. We then assayed development times at two different temperatures and found sizeable cyto-nuclear effects in general, as well as temperature- and block-specific cyto-nuclear effects. These results demonstrate that environmental factors such as temperature do exert selection on cytoplasmic genes by favoring specific cyto-nuclear genetic combinations, and are consistent with the suggestion that complex genotype-by-environment interactions may promote the maintenance of polymorphism in mitochondrial genes.

AB  - The effects of heat-shock during pelagic stages on growth and survival of juvenile sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus were investigated to test the possibility to acquire high thermal tolerance individuals after the heat-shock selection. Larvae at the stages of blastula, gastrula, and auricularia were heat-shocked at selected temperatures (21.5, control; 26, 28, and 30A degrees C) for 45 min and returned to 21.5A degrees C for continuous rearing. There was a significant difference in thermal sensitivity among different developmental stages, and thermal tolerance of the larvae was correlated with the expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Juveniles after the heat-shock selection at pelagic stages showed higher induced thermotolerance than those without heat-shock. Therefore, heat-shock application at early pelagic development stages is potentially a useful way to select high-thermotolerance variety of the sea cucumbers.

This paper examines the health impacts of climate change from extreme weather events, temperature changes, rising sea levels and changes in precipitation. These health impacts include heat-related illnesses and deaths, air pollution-related health effects, allergic diseases, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and disasters associated with extreme weather-related health effects such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, fires, heavy precipitation, storms and flooding. Most populations will be impacted by climate change in the next decades, putting peoples' lives and wellbeing at risk. Vulnerable populations across the globe will be impacted disproportionately due to climate change. It is populations that are often least responsible for climate change that experience the greatest adverse impacts, raising important moral issues of equity and fairness. In addition to reviewing the literature on the health impacts of climate change, this paper will examine issues of inequity across vulnerable populations and generations due to climate change, the health co-benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation, and potential options for adaptation to increasingly extreme weather events.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Natural enemies play a fundamental role in the control of invasive insects and may be particularly important in controlling Xylopagous beetle, which are difficult to contain with traditional chemicals as they are usually concealed within wood. Among the natural enemies that have proven effective against these beetles are parasitoid species in the genus Sclerodermus. The present article furthers knowledge of Sclerodermus brevicornis performance, focusing on the survival capability under different thermal conditions and the longer-term influences of these conditions.
   Many species of long-horned beetles are invasive pests causing significant economic damage in agro-forestry systems. They spend the majority of their life-cycle concealed inside natural wood or wooden packaging materials and are largely protected from adverse environmental conditions and pesticide sprays. Biological control via parasitoid natural enemies including members of the bethylid genus Sclerodermus, has proven effective against some long-horned beetles that are invasive in China. In Europe, the biocontrol potential of native Sclerodermus species is being evaluated with a view to developing efficient mass-rearing techniques and then actively deploying them against invasive Asian beetles. Here, we continue evaluations of S. brevicornis by establishing that groups of females that have already reared offspring to emergence are capable of reproducing subsequent hosts and by evaluating the lifetime reproductive capacity of individual females provided with successive hosts. Additionally, we assess the laboratory shelf-life of adult females stored for different times at different temperatures including cold storage, and then assess the post-storage reproductive performance of groups of females provided with a single host. We found that adult female longevity declines with increasing storage temperature and that most aspects of subsequent performance are negatively affected by high temperatures. The adaptability to low temperature storage enhances the suitability of S. brevicornis to mass-rearing programs and thus biocontrol deployment.

AB  - Coral reefs surrounding the islands lying close to the coast are unique to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in that they are frequently exposed to disturbance events including floods caused by cyclonic rainfall, strong winds and occasional periods of prolonged above-average temperatures during summer. In one such group of islands in the southern GBR, the Keppel Island archipelago, climate-driven disturbances frequently result in major coral mortality. Whilst these island reefs have clearly survived such dramatic disturbances in the past, the consequences of extreme mortality events may include the loss of genetic diversity, and hence adaptive potential, and a reduction in fitness due to inbreeding, especially if new recruitment from external sources is limited. Here we examined the level of isolation of the Keppel Island group as well as patterns of gene flow within the Keppel Islands using 10 microsatellite markers in nine populations of the coral, Acropora millepora. Bayesian cluster analysis and assignment tests indicated gene flow is restricted, but not absent, between the outer and inner Keppel Island groups, and that extensive gene flow exists within each of these island groups. Comparison of the Keppel Island data with results from a previous GBR-wide study that included a single Keppel Island population, confirmed that A. millepora in the Keppel Islands is genetically distinct from populations elsewhere on the GBR, with exception of the nearby inshore High Peak Reef just north of the Keppel Islands. We compared patterns of genetic diversity in the Keppel Island populations with those from other GBR populations and found themto be slightly, but significantly lower, consistent with the archipelago being geographically isolated, but there was no evidence for recent bottlenecks or deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium. A high incidence of private alleles in the Keppel Islands, particularly in the outer islands, supports their relative isolation and contributes to the conservation value of the archipelago. The lack of evidence for genetic erosion, in combination with our observation that the North Keppel Island population samples collected in 2002 and 2008, respectively, exhibited a pairwise genetic distance of zero, supports previous published work indicating that, following bleaching, Acropora corals in the Keppel Islands predominantly recover from regrowth of small amounts of remaining live tissue in apparently dead coral colonies. This is likely supplemented by recruitment of larvae from genetically similar, less disturbed populations at nearby reefs, particularly following extreme flood events.

AB  - Parallel flow microchannel heat exchangers have been increasingly applied in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) field due to their characteristics, such as high efficient heat transfer performance, compact form and low cost. Production rationalization of the heat exchanger is required for realization of a competitive, light-weight and easy-to-assemble product. The heat exchanger is usually bent to L-shape so as to decrease the volume of air conditioner. To correspond with design changes for multi-generation use and to achieve good forming quality, a dieless forming technique is developed to offer flexible manufacturing. Using this method, heat exchangers can be formed with variable bending radius conveniently, which can reduce the mold cost and obtain high productivity. Meanwhile, product defects such as fin damage can also be reduced because there is no physical contact against tools in the bending portion. In the present study, the forming principle of dieless bending process is first stated by theoretical analysis. Then to verify the proposed forming mechanism, a NC dieless bending machine is manufactured to implement the bending experiment. Finally, based on the verified FE model, the bending process for the 2-piece heat exchanger has been improved. As a result, the dieless bending process has been successfully developed and can be applied to produce square-shape heat exchanger with variable bending radius.

AB  - We have theoretically studied the statistical properties of adaptive walks (or hill-climbing) on a Mt. Fuji-type fitness landscape in the multi-dimensional sequence space through mathematical analysis and computer simulation. The adaptive walk is characterized by the "mutation distance" d as the step-width of the walker and the "population size" N as the number of randomly generated d-fold point mutants to be screened. In addition to the fitness W, we introduced the following quantities analogous to thermodynamical concepts: "free fitness" G(W) drop W + T x S(W), where T is the "evolutionary temperature" T proportional to rootd/lnN and S(W) is the entropy as a function of W, and the "evolutionary force" X drop d(G(W)/T)/dW, that is caused by the mutation and selection pressure. It is known that a single adaptive walker rapidly climbs on the fitness landscape up to the stationary state where a "mutation-selection-random drift balance" is kept. In our interpretation, the walker tends to the maximal free fitness state, driven by the evolutionary force X. Our major findings are as follows: First, near the stationary point W*, the "climbing rate" J as the expected fitness change per generation is described by J approximate to L x X with L approximate to V/2, where V is the variance of fitness distribution on a local landscape. This simple relationship is analogous to the well-known Einstein relation in Brownian motion. Second, the "biological information gain" (DeltaG/T) through adaptive walk can be described by combining the Shannon's information gain (DeltaS) and the "fitness information gain" (DeltaW/T).

AB  - Thermodynamic analysis was conducted, in detail, to compare the performance of an air conditioning system with and without an air-membrane heat and mass exchanger. The study evaluated the performance of the system considering four promising new refrigerants: R1234yf, R1234ze, R32, and R423A. To evaluate the performance of the system, key performance parameters were used, including, coefficient of performance (COP), exergy destruction rate, second law efficiency, compressor work, irreversibility ratio, fuel depletion ratio, and productivity lack. In addition, the effect of varying the compressor pressure ratio, effectiveness of the membrane, and the relative humidity of fresh air on the performance of the system were evaluated for both configurations. The performance of an air conditioning system significantly improves when an air-membrane heat and mass exchanger is used. The main reason of this improvement is the significant drop in the cooling load and, consequently, the compressor input power. Furthermore, the study showed that COP as a measure of performance is not enough to have an appropriate comparison for the performance and further detailed analysis is needed, such as exergy analysis. Therefore, exergy analysis was also conducted to fully assess the advantages of using a membrane with an air conditioning system. From thermodynamics point of view, the study showed that R1234ze has the best performance while R32 has the lowest performance.

AB  - The main goal of this research was to introgressed the genetic male sterility (GMS) gene ms10 from hot pepper (Capsicum annuum var. annuum) to heat tolerant bell pepper (C. annuum var. grossum) inbreds and to pyramid it with the non-pungent (pun1) gene. The gene positive plant selection was assisted by the SSR marker linked to ms10 gene located on chromosome I and the SCAR marker indicating the non-pungent pun1 gene presence. First, we backcrossed and screened BC1F1 and BC2F1 plants having heterozygous (Ms10ms10) genotype for GMS specific marker AVRDC-PP12. Secondly, the background recovery rate of the recurrent parent phenome (RPP) in both the backcrossed progeny was estimated by measuring the shift in means for fruit traits. Simultaneously, targeted gene positive (Ms10ms10) non-pungent (pun1) heterozygous plant(s) were identified in BC2F1 generation using BF7 and BF 9-SCAR marker. The best gene positive individual plant from each population was backcrossed with their respective recurrent parent and selfed for validation of ms10 gene. Finally, we obtained six gene positive (ms10) GMS lines designated as MSSM-1, MSSM-2, MSSM-3, MSSM-9, MSSM-17, and MSSM-21 from this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that GMS ms10 gene has been successfully transferred from hot pepper to heat tolerant bell pepper through marker-assisted backcross breeding scheme coupled with stringent phenotypic selection. The developed GMS lines will provide great economic value for nonpungent hybrid bell pepper seed production in the near future.

AB  - Host-symbiont interactions may form obligatory or facultative associations that are context dependent. Long-term studies on microbiome composition from wild populations should assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of host-microbe associations. We characterized the temporal and spatial variation in the bacterial microbiome composition in six populations of the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola for 2.5 years, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of whole spiders. Individuals within a nest exhibit highly similar microbiomes, which remain stable over several generations and are not predictably affected by seasonal variation in temperature or humidity. This stability in nest microbiome is likely due to social transmission, whereas drift-like processes during new nest foundations explain variation in host microbiomes between nests. This is supported by the lack of obligate symbionts (i.e. no symbionts are present in all spider individuals). Quantitative PCR analyses showed that the bacterial load of individual spiders is stable in healthy nests but can increase dramatically in perishing nests. These increases are not driven by specific bacterial taxa but likely caused by loss of host immune control under deteriorating conditions. Spider nests show an annual survival rate of approximately 45%, but nest death is not correlated to microbiome composition, and the bacteria found in S. dumicola are not considered to be high virulence pathogens.
   High temporal stability of the social spider microbiome, but nest death is often preceded by a massive increase in bacterial numbers.

AB  - The frequency and duration of heatwaves are increasing because of human activities. To cope with the changes, species with longer generation times may have to rely on plastic responses. The probability that their responses are adaptive is higher if the species have experienced temperature fluctuations also in their evolutionary past. However, experimental studies investigating responses to heatwaves often use exposure times that are significantly shorter than recent heatwaves. We show that this can lead to faulty conclusions and that the duration of higher temperature has to be considered in experimental designs. We recorded the response of threespine stickleback to prolonged duration of higher temperature during the breeding season, using a population that has experienced large fluctuations in temperature in its past and, hence, is expected to endure temperature changes well. We found males to adaptively adjust their reproductive behaviours to short periods of higher temperature, but not to longer periods that extended across two breeding cycles. Males initially increased their reproductive activities-nest building, courtship and parental care-which ensured high reproductive success during the first breeding cycle, but decreased their reproductive activities during the second breeding cycle when exposed to sustained high temperature. This reduced their courtship success and resulted in fewer offspring. Thus, a species expected to cope well with higher temperature suffers fitness reductions when the duration of high temperature is prolonged. The results stress the importance of considering the duration of extreme environmental conditions when investigating the impact that human activities have on species. Responses to short-term exposures cannot be extrapolated to assess responses to longer periods of extreme conditions.

While many species will be exposed to pesticides and warming both in the parental and offspring generations, transgenerational effects of pesticides under warming are still poorly studied, particularly for behaviour. We therefore studied the single and combined effects of exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and warming both within and across generations on antipredator behaviour of larvae of the vector mosquito Culex pipiens, Within each generation pesticide exposure and warming reduced the escape diving time, making the larvae more susceptible to predation. Pesticide exposure of the parents did not affect offspring anti predator behaviour. Yet, parental exposure to warming determined how warming and the pesticide interacted in the offspring generation. When parents were reared at 24 degrees C, warming no longer reduced offspring diving times in the solvent control, suggesting an adaptive transgenerational effect to prepare the offspring to better deal with a higher predation risk under warming. Related to this, the CPF-induced reduction in diving time was stronger at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C, except in the offspring whose parents had been exposed to 24 degrees C. This dependency of the widespread interaction between warming and pesticide exposure on an adaptive transgenerational effect of warming is an important finding at the interface of global change ecology and ecotoxicology.

AB  - With the rapid development of flexible wearable strain sensor systems, electronic textiles with comfort and controllable strain/pressure-sensing capabilities have attracted great interest. However, it is still a great challenge to prepare multifunctional wearable strain/pressure sensor with an ultra-low detection limit through a facile and cost-effective method. Here, conductive carbon nanotubes modified silk nonwoven fabric (CNTs/SNWF) composite was successfully prepared by the surface micro-dissolution and adhesion technology (SD&AT). Micromorphology analysis showed that CNTs were adhered firmly on the surface of silk fiber to form an effective conductive network. The conductive CNTs/SNWF-based strain/pressure sensor can detect a strain as low as 0.05% and an ultralow pressure of 10 Pa, showing an ultrahigh discernibility. Besides, it also exhibited excellent sensing stability and reproductivity under different conditions, making it applicable in the field of real-time human movement monitoring. Moreover, electronic skin was also established based on the conductive CNTs/SNWF to recognize different tactile stimulus. Interestingly, the prepared conductive CNTs/SNWF also displayed great applicability for optical and thermal sensing, endowing it with more functionality for next-generation wearable electronics.

AB  - Fish can be identified as either low responders (LR) or high responders (HR) based on post-stress cortisol levels and whether they exhibit a proactive or reactive stress coping style, respectively. In this study, male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from 17 families reared at 9 degrees C were repeatedly exposed to an acute handling stress over a period of four months, with plasma cortisol levels measured at 1 h post-stress. Fish were identified as either LR or HR if the total Z-score calculated from their cortisol responses fell into the lower or upper quartile ranges, respectively; with intermediate responders (IR) classified as the remainder. Salmon characterized as LR, IR or HR were then subjected to an incremental thermal challenge, where temperature was raised at 0.2 degrees C day(-1) from their acclimation temperature (12 degrees C) to mimic natural sea-cage farming conditions during the summer in Newfoundland. Interestingly, feed intake remained high up to 22 degrees C, while previous studies have shown a decrease in salmon appetite after similar to 16-18 degrees C. After the first three mortalities were recorded at elevated temperature, a subset of LR and HR salmon were exposed to another acute handling stress event at 23.6 degrees C. Basal and post-stress measurements of plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate did not differ between stress response phenotypes at this temperature. In the end, the average incremental thermal maximum (ITMax) of LR and HR fish was not different (25.1 degrees C). In comparison, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax; temperature increased at 2 degrees C h(-1)) of the remaining IR fish that had been held at 12 degrees C was 28.5 degrees C. Collectively, these results: 1) show that this population of Atlantic salmon is very thermally tolerant, and further question the relevance of CTMax in assessing responses to real-world temperature changes; and 2) indicate that characterization of stress phenotype at 9 degrees C is not predictive of their stress response or survival at high temperatures. Therefore, selection of fish based on phenotypic stress response at low temperatures may not be beneficial to incorporate into Atlantic salmon breeding programs, especially if the goal is to improve growth performance and survival at high temperatures in sea-cages.

AB  - Interrupted cutting operations, such as milling, produce fluctuating tool temperatures which directly affect the process outputs. Thus, prediction of cutting tool temperatures enables process planning, selection of materials for tool substrate and coating layers, and tool geometric design for improved productivity in machining operations. Theoretical analysis of temperature is a cost effective way to predict the tool temperatures. Considering the industrial needs, a theoretical model should be fast, easy to implement, and reliable. To that end, a novel hybrid model, which assembles analytical and numerical methods, is proposed in this study. This novel transient thermal model simulates the interrupted cutting with coated cutting tools. The proposed model includes an analytical heat flux calculation at the tool-chip interface considering the sticking-sliding contact behavior. The determined heat flux is, then, used to perform a numerical solution of the transient heat conduction problem in the cutting tool geometry with temperature-dependent thermal properties. The developed model is validated with experimental results found in literature under different cutting conditions. The results show that the model can predict the maximum temperatures generated in a thermal cycle with an accuracy of 2-10%. Thus, the proposed model can be further used to determine the process parameters, properties of coating layers, and tool geometric design.

AB  - We kept 48 gravid short-tailed pit vipers (Gloydius brevicaudus) under four laboratory thermal conditions during gestation and collected 10 females from the field soon before they gave birth to test whether Shine's (1995) maternal manipulation hypothesis applies to temperate reptiles. Females thermoregulated more precisely but did not shift their selected body temperatures during pregnancy, with females at high body temperatures giving birth early in the breeding season. The lowest (22 degrees C) and highest (32 degrees C) temperature treatments increased maternal mortality and resulted in production of offspring with smaller body dimensions. More deformed offspring were produced at 32 degrees C, and more poorly performing offspring were produced at 22 degrees C. In the field, air temperatures lower than 22 degrees C and higher than 32 degrees C accounted for about 9% and 33% of total temperature readings, respectively. However, offspring produced by field-caught females did not differ from those produced by laboratory-kept females with body temperatures optimal for embryonic development in nearly all traits examined. This suggests that in nature, gravid females avoid exposure of their embryos to temperature extremes through thermoregulation. Our study validates the key prediction of the maternal manipulation hypothesis that maternal thermoregulation should enhance fitness-related offspring traits, and demonstrates that viviparity evolves in temperate reptiles because internal development shields offspring from temperature extremes.

AB  - Adaptive laboratory evolution is a powerful tool for microorganism improvement likely to produce enhanced microalgae better tailored to their industrial uses. In this work, 12 wild-type strains of Tisochrysis lutea were co-cultivated under increasing thermal stress for 6 months. Indeed, temperature was oscillating daily between a high and a low temperature, with increasing amplitude along the experiment. The goal was to enhance the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the polar lipids. Samples were taken throughout the evolution experiment and cultivated in standardized conditions to analyze the evolution of the lipid profile. Genomic analysis of the final population shows that two strains survived. The lipid content doubled, impacting all lipid classes. The fatty acid analyses show a decrease in SFAs correlated with an increase in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), while changes in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs) vary between both photobioreactors. Hence, the proportion of C18-MUFAs (18:1 n-9) and most C18-PUFAs (18:2 n-6, 18:3 n-3, and 18:4 n-3) increased, suggesting their potential role in adjusting membrane fluidity to temperature shifts. Of particular interest, DHA in polar lipids tripled in the final population while the growth rate was not affected.Key points center dot Adaptive laboratory evolution on a mix of 12 T. lutea strains led to survival of 2 center dot Thermal stress impacted cell size, total lipid cell content, and all lipid classes center dot DHA cell content partitioned to polar lipids tripled throughout the experiment

AB  - We present a set of evolutionary tracks of large-metallicity low-mass stars, covering the advanced evolutionary phases from the zero-age horizontal branch to the final white dwarf cooling phase, at the onset of crystallization.  These star models are intended to be representative of the hot component of the stellar population of elliptical galaxies and are suitable for population synthesis purposes.  Physical parameters of the evolved stars have been selected to search for models leaving the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase before the onset of the thermal pulses (TP) and evolving to the blue side of the H-R diagram according to an evolutionary scheme earlier defined as post-early AGB (P-EAGB) evolution (Brocato et al.).  Star models have been first evolved at constant mass.  A selected sample of more massive models, which in absence of mass loss have been found to enter the TP-AGB, has been successively evolved adopting a moderately large rate of mass loss at the red side of the H-R diagram.  As a consequence of mass loss, these models skip the thermal pulsing phase and evolve following a post-EAGB evolutionary path.  We find that the maximum UV flux that post-AGB models can provide is not enough to account for the ultraviolet emission (UV) of the most UV-emitting elliptical galaxies, whereas models following the P-EAGB evolutionary behavior produce much more UV flux.  Among the star models evolving off the early AGB, before the onset of thermal pulses, those maximizing the production of the UV flux give enough UV light to explain even the most UV upturned branches observed in the spectra of the most metal-rich elliptical galaxy.  This is because in post-EAGB models the excursion toward the blue side of the H-R diagram is supported by the additional energy source provided by the He-burning shell.  However, the fact that just the strongest UV emitters of the P-EAGB progeny appear able to produce the needed amount of flux to explain the most UV-emitting elliptical galaxies, and that a fine tuning of the stellar parameters is required to produce such an evolutionary behavior, which occurs for a restricted value of these parameters, suggests that it is likely that not only P-EAGB stars are at work in nature to produce the UV light of these galaxies.

AB  - The drastic decline in coral coverage has stimulated an interest in reef restoration, and various iterations of coral nurseries have been used to augment restoration strategies. Here we examine the growth of two species of Hawaiian Montipora that were maintained in mesocosms under either ambient or warmed annual bleaching conditions for two consecutive years prior to outplanting to determine whether preconditioning aided coral restoration efforts. Using coral trees to create a nearby ocean nursery, we examined whether: (1) previous ex situ mesocosm growth would mirror in situ coral tree nursery growth; and (2) thermal ex situ stress-hardening would predict future success during natural warming events in situ for corals moved from tanks to trees. For Montipora capitata, we found that variation in growth was explained primarily by genotype; growth rates in the mesocosms were similar to those in situ, irrespective of preconditioning. Variation in M. flabellata growth, however, was explained by both genotype and culture method such that an individual M. flabellata colony that grew well in the tanks did not necessarily perform as well on the coral trees. For both species, previous exposure to elevated temperatures in the mesocosms provided no benefit to either growth or survival during a warming event in the coral tree nursery compared to those grown in ambient temperatures. Overall, M. capitata performed better in the tree nursery with higher net growth, lower mortality, and was subject to less predation than M. flabellata. Our results show little benefit of the additional cost and time of stress-hardening these corals prior to outplanting because it is unlikely to aid resilience to future warming events. These results also suggest that selecting corals for restoration based on long-term genotype growth performance may be more effective for optimal outcomes but should be weighed against other factors, such as coral morphology, in situ nursery method, location, and other characteristics.

AB  - In cold climates most aquatic habitats are frozen for many months. Nevertheless, even in such regions the conditions in different types of habitat, in different parts of one habitat, and from one year to the next can vary considerably; some water bodies even allow winter growth. Winter cold and ice provide challenges for aquatic insects, but so do high spring flows, short, cool summers, and unpredictable conditions. General adaptations to cope with these constraints, depending on species and habitat, include the use of widely available foods, increased food range, prolonged development (including development lasting more than one year per generation), programmed life cycles with diapause and other responses to environmental cues (often enforcing strict univoltinism), and staggered development. Winter conditions may be anticipated not only by diapause and related responses but also by movement for the winter to terrestrial habitats, to less severe aquatic habitats, or to different parts of the same habitat, and by construction of shelters. Winter itself is met by various types of cold hardiness, including tolerance of freezing in at least some species, especially chironomid midges, and supercooling even when surrounded by ice in others. Special cocoons provide protection in some species. A few species move during winter or resist anoxia beneath ice. Spring challenges of high flows and ice scour may be withstood or avoided by wintering in less severe habitats, penetrating the substrate, or delaying activity until after peak flow. However, where possible species emerge early in the spring to compensate for the shortness of the summer season, a trait enhanced (at least in some lentic habitats) by choosing overwintering sites that warm up first in spring. Relatively low summer temperatures are offset by development at low temperatures, by selection of warm habitats and microhabitats, and in adults by thermoregulation and modified mating activity. Notwithstanding the many abiotic constraints in cold climates, aquatic communities are relatively diverse, though dominated by taxa that combine traits such as cold adaptation with use of the habitats and foods that are most widely available and most favourable. Consequently, except in the most severe habitats, food chains and community structure are complex even at high latitudes and elevations, including many links between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Despite the complex involvement of aquatic insects in these cold-climate ecosystems, we know relatively little about the physiological and biochemical basis of their cold hardiness and its relationship to habitat conditions, especially compared with information about terrestrial species from the same regions.

AB  - Background Insect pest control programs often use periods of insecticide treatment with intermittent breaks, to prevent fixing of mutations conferring insecticide resistance. Such mutations are typically costly in an insecticide-free environment, and their frequency is determined by the balance between insecticide treatment and cost of resistance. Ace, a key gene in neuronal signaling, is a prominent target of many insecticides and across several species, three amino acid replacements (I161V, G265A, and F330Y) provide resistance against several insecticides. Because temperature disturbs neuronal signaling homeostasis, we reasoned that the cost of insecticide resistance could be modulated by ambient temperature. Results Experimental evolution of a natural Drosophila simulans population at hot and cold temperature regimes uncovered a surprisingly strong effect of ambient temperature. In the cold temperature regime, the resistance mutations were strongly counter selected (s = - 0.055), but in a hot environment, the fitness costs of resistance mutations were reduced by almost 50% (s = - 0.031). We attribute this unexpected observation to the advantage of the reduced enzymatic activity of resistance mutations in hot environments. Conclusion We show that fitness costs of insecticide resistance genes are temperature-dependent and suggest that the duration of insecticide-free periods need to be adjusted for different climatic regions to reflect these costs. We suggest that such environment-dependent fitness effects may be more common than previously assumed and pose a major challenge for modeling climate change.

AB  - Accelerating CO2 emissions have driven physico-chemical changes in the world's oceans, such as ocean acidification and warming. How marine organisms adjust or succumb to such environmental changes may be determined by their ability to balance energy intake against expenditure (i.e. energy budget) as energy supports physiological functions, including those with adaptive value. Here, we examined whether energy budget is a driver of physiological adaptability of marine calci hers to the near-future ocean acidification and warming; i.e. how physiological energetics (respiration rate, feeding rate, energy assimilation and energy budget) relates to adjustments in shell growth and shell properties of a calcifying gastropod (Austrocochlea concamerata). We found that ocean warming boosted the energy budget of gastropods due to increased feeding rate, resulting in faster shell growth and greater shell strength (i.e. more mechanically resilient). When combined with ocean acidification, however, the gastropods had a substantial decrease in energy budget due to reduced feeding rate and energy assimilation, leading to the reduction in shell growth and shell strength. By linking energy budget to the adjustability of shell building, we revealed that energy availability can be critical to determine the physiological adaptability of marine calcifiers to the changing oceanic climate.

AB  - As the number of space debris (also called meteoroid/orbital debris-M/OD) increases in recent years, the hypervelocity-impact (HVI) events of M/OD on spacecrafts have become one of the most main risks threatening human activity in space. For the automatical M/OD risk assessment, some effective nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are critical to realizing the evaluation of the HVI damages. In this paper, a novel HVI damage evaluation method based on the active infrared thermal wave image detection technology with multi-objective feature extraction optimization (MO-FEO) is proposed to achieve the quantitative evaluation of M/OD HVI damages. For the precise selection of representative temperature point in thermal infrared image data, the proposed MO-FEO method has the advantage not only of considering the difference among temperature points in different thermal temperature categories but also considering the correlation among temperature points of each thermal temperature category. The multi-objective feature extraction problem decomposed by Tchebycheff aggregation is used to seek the representative temperature points through an evolution process brought the selection pressure and fitness value. In addition to the MO-FEO frame, the variable step search and classification of temperature points are also implemented in the HVI damage evaluation strategy to improve efficiency. Some experimental results of infrared detection for the real M/OD HVI test articles are proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - All tea plants in India rely on the national grid for their electrical needs and diesel for their thermal energy and transportation, which are encountering high costs, high emissions, and issues of accessibility. In this paper, hybrid renewable systems based on both standalone and grid-connected technologies have been modeled using HOMER Pro software for supplying power to a tea manufacturing plant in a typical rural area in India, namely, Gudalur village (Nilgiris), geographically located at 11 degrees 30.2 ' N and 76 degrees 29.5 ' E, which is presently run by the state grid to meet their energy requirements. The different configurations comprised of Solar PV, biomass, hydro, electrolyzer, boiler, thermal load controller to utilize excess electricity, and waste heat recovery options, and lead-acid batteries were designed to meet 650 kWh/day of electricity for processing units, 101 kWh/day of electricity for general applications, 4,450 kWh/day of thermal energy, and 86.35 kg/day of hydrogen energy. To determine the most feasible system design among various scenarios, several criteria such as NPC, COE, LCOH, and CO2 emission of the system have been investigated. In the case of off-grid hybrid systems, results show the highest NPC of $7.01 M with an LCOE of $1.06/kWh is obtained for the diesel generator/boiler/reformer/TLC system. It is reduced to $1.75 M with an LCOE of -$.420/kWh for the PV/biomass-CHP/hydro/TLC scenario. In a grid-connected system, the maximum NPC of $6.20 M with an LCOE of $0.835/kWh is obtained for a diesel generator/boiler system, and it is reduced to -$10.5 M with an LCOE of -$.240/kWh for the PV/biomass-CHP/hydro/TLC scenario. Additionally, in the off-grid systems, the PV/biomass-CHP/hydro/TLC system has LCOH of $4.27/kg, which is economical with the highest renewable fraction of 93%. The PV/biomass-CHP/hydro/TLC hybrid system has the lowest LCOH of -$64.5/kg with a maximum renewable fraction of 96% in on-grid systems. The findings show that recovering excess electricity and waste heat would increase renewable fraction, decrease the energy cost and emissions from the system, and emphasize the importance of TLC and CHP in HRES. According to the simulation results, the grid-connected system is more cost-effective than a stand-alone system due to the revenue obtained from selling renewable power to the grid.

AB  - Simple Summary Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) is a widespread and economically important insect pest, infesting various fruits and vegetables. Due to the instability of climate change in early spring and autumn, extreme cold and hot temperatures were developed in a short period of time. Exposure to sudden short-term high or low temperatures may affect the reproduction, development, and physiological changes of B. dorsalis. In this study, we determined the effects of short-term temperature treatments on the growth, development, fecundity, and trehalose metabolism of B. dorsalis. The results showed that development and reproduction of the flies were negatively affected when temperature was below 10 degrees C; or more than 31 degrees C, even causing permanent sterility at extreme temperatures. The changes of glucose, glycogen, trehalose, and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase level had a correlation with the population dynamics of the fruit flies. Our present study can provide a scientific basis for population monitoring, prediction, and comprehensive prevention of the fruit fly. An understanding of physiological damage and population development caused by uncomfortable temperature plays an important role in pest control. In order to clarify the adaptability of different temperatures and physiological response mechanism of B. dorsalis, we focused on the adaptation ability of this pest to environmental stress from physiological and ecological viewpoints. In this study, we explored the relationship between population parameters and glucose, glycogen, trehalose, and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase responses to high and low temperatures. Compared with the control group, temperature stress delayed the development duration of all stages, and the survival rates and longevity decreased gradually as temperature decreased to 0 degrees C and increased to 36 degrees C. Furthermore, with low temperature decrease from 10 degrees C to 0 degrees C, the average fecundity per female increased at 10 degrees C but decreased later. Reproduction of the species was negatively affected during high-temperature stresses, reaching the lowest value at 36 degrees C. In addition to significantly affecting biological characteristics, temperature stress influenced physiological changes of B. dorsalis in cold and heat tolerance. When temperature deviated significantly from the norm, the levels of substances associated with temperature resistance were altered: glucose, trehalose, and TPS levels increased, but glycogen levels decreased. These results suggest that temperature stresses exert a detrimental effect on the populations' survival, but the metabolism of trehalose and glycogen may enhance the pest's temperature resistance.

AB  - Survival of a potentially lethal high temperature stress is a genetically variable thermal adaptation trait in many organisms. Organisms cope with heat stress by basal or induced thermoresistance. Here, we tested quantitative trait loci (QTL) for heat stress survival (HSS) in Drosophila melanogaster, with and without a cyclic heat-hardening pre-treatment, for flies that were reared at low (LD) or high (HD) density. Mapping populations were two panels of recombinant inbred lines (RIL), which were previously constructed from heat stress-selected stocks: RIL-D48 and RIL-SH2, derived from backcrosses to stocks of low and high heat resistance, respectively. HSS increased with heat hardening in both LD and HD flies. In addition, HSS increased consistently with density in non-hardened flies. There was a significant interaction between heat hardening and density effects in RIL-D48. Several QTL were significant for both density and hardening treatments. Many QTL overlapped with thermotolerance QTL identified for other traits in previous studies based on LD cultures only. However, three new QTL were found in HD only (cytological ranges: 12E-16F6; 30A3-34C2; 49C-50C). Previously found thermotolerance QTL were also significant for flies from HD cultures.

AB  - Genetic differences among populations of Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) are hypothesized to be evolutionary responses to intense, size-selective winter mortality at high latitudes. Three experiments were conducted to test features of winter mortality. In the first experiment, we varied size and whether food was provided or withheld; temperatures were permitted to follow ambient (New York) wintertime fluctuations. Mortality and depletion of energy reserves were more rapid in the units receiving no food. Small fish died before larger fish in these units, but not in the units receiving food. Energy depletion of fish in the no-food treatment resembled that of fish in the wild. In the second experiment, we varied size and population of origin, representing high-latitude (Nova Scotia), midlatitude (New York), and low-latitude (South Carolina) populations. These fish were provided food and showed minimal depletion of energy reserves, but mortality rates were high when water temperatures were low. Mortality did not vary with size in New York and South Carolina fish, but was highest in intermediate-size fish from Nova Scotia. There was a pronounced population difference in survival rate (Nova Scotia > New York > South Carolina). In the third experiment, food was withheld and extreme low temperatures were moderated. Energy depletion was rapid and small fish died before large fish. We conclude that populations in seasonal environments are likely to be subject to size-selective winter mortality when energy reserves are depleted and that juvenile growth rates have evolved in response to this selection pressure. In addition, high-latitude populations have evolved greater tolerance to other winter stresses associated with low temperatures.

AB  - A minute pirate bug, Amphiareus constrictus (Stal) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), the biology of which has been less studied, was successfully reared in the laboratory for more than 20 generations. Studies were conducted to understand its biology, life table parameters, and predatory potential. Besides the adult, the egg and all five nymphal instars are described with live images, which can serve as additional characters for identification. The biological parameters were studied at different temperatures. Rearing temperatures of 25 and 30 degrees C were found to be suitable for hatching and nymphal survival to adult stage (88.5 and 75%, respectively). Life table parameters like net reproductive rate (R-0), precise intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), finite rate of increase () and hypothetical F-2 females were higher at 25 degrees C. A nymph could consume a total of 32.8 +/- 1.8 Corcyra cephalonica Stainton eggs. Male and female adult consumed a total of 179.0 +/- 15.6 and 388.5 +/- 58.6 C. cephalonica eggs, respectively. The data generated through studies on biology, fertility, and predatory potential led to the standardization of a simple production protocol for A. constrictus utilizing the eggs of the rice moth C. cephalonica. Predatory potential studies on Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) indicated that a nymph could consume 154.8 eggs during nymphal duration. Male and female adults could consume 1280.5 and 1435 eggs, respectively. The mass-reared A. constrictus can be field evaluated against the tomato pinworm TT absoluta and the brown plant hopper Nilaparvata lugens Stal.

AB  - Selective Laser Melting technology (SLM) is a thermal process, and control of thermal effects is of great importance since enhanced productivity of modern SLM equipment can be achieved by increased laser power. To provide acceptable physical resolution of image recording, the TEM00 lasers are applied, for example fiber lasers which power reaches today several kW. However, the Gaussian intensity distribution of single-mode powerful lasers brings some problems in SLM: inhomogeneous intensity in focused spot results in non-uniform temperature profile and subsequent irregularities of melting process, unwished evaporation or sparking; another issue relates to optics - dynamic gradient heating of optical components and subsequent induce of waist shift and wave aberrations resulting in variation of size and intensity distribution of focused spot in working plane. The thermally induced effects are especially important for protective windows which are inevitably contaminated by fine powder inducing higher heating. Solution suggested to provide uniform temperature in working spot is beam shaping optics made from high purity fused silica and creating optimum for uniform melting flat-top or doughnut profiles. To stabilize the size and intensity of working spot it is suggested to apply athermalized protective windows from optical material self-compensating geometrical and refractive thermal effects. Detailed measurements of beam properties and measurements of real manufactured parts confirmed correctness of suggested approach, its possibility to stabilize drastically the SLM process. The paper presents description of optics applied; measurements of process parameters and analysis of properties of manufactured parts are presented as well.

AB  - Tradeoffs have played a prominent role in the development of theories describing the evolution of reaction norms. Different classes of tradeoffs are known to constrain the evolution of phenotypes, but current theories incorporate only a subset of these tradeoffs. Consequently, these theories cannot account for some of the variation in reaction norms that has been observed within and among species. Empirical studies of thermal reaction norms for physiological and life historical traits have shown that different proximate mechanisms can produce similar reaction norms. As a consequence, certain tradeoffs can be circumvented when the fitness costs imposed by these tradeoffs are severe. We argue that a unified theory that includes all classes of tradeoffs would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive the evolution of reaction norms.

AB  - We developed a holographic memory drive for next-generation optical memory. In this study, we present the key technology for achieving a highspeed transfer rate for reproduction, that is, a high-speed control technique for the reference beam angle. In reproduction in a holographic memory drive, there is the issue that the optimum reference beam angle during reproduction varies owing to distortion of the medium. The distortion is caused by, for example, temperature variation, beam irradiation, and moisture absorption. Therefore, a reference-beam-angle control technique to position the reference beam at the optimum angle is crucial. We developed a new optical system that generates an angle-error-signal to detect the optimum reference beam angle. To achieve the high-speed control technique using the new optical system, we developed a new control technique called adaptive final-state control (AFSC) that adds a second control input to the first one derived from conventional final-state control (FSC) at the time of angle-error-signal detection. We established an actual experimental system employing AFSC to achieve moving control between each page (Page Seek) within 300 mu s. In sequential multiple Page Seeks, we were able to realize positioning to the optimum angles of the reference beam that maximize the diffracted beam intensity. We expect that applying the new control technique to the holographic memory drive will enable a giga-bit/s-class transfer rate. (C) 2016 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB  - Abrupt environmental changes are of particular interest to understand how species can quickly evolve at the boundary of their current niche. In particular the sliding niche model, wherein a niche shifts globally toward the new condition, has been used in understanding and modeling this process. Here, we investigate the dynamics of relative fitness change in four evolutionary replicates of Escherichia coli populations exposed to an extreme pH shift. We analyzed these changes at generations 500, 1000, and 2000 to determine whether niche global deformations fully capture the temporal dynamics of niche evolution. Strikingly, this analysis reveals that fitness variations can indeed be attributed to simple and global deformation of an underlying simple niche template. Analysis from two experimental replicates displays a transient increase in niche width, consistent with recent theory considering plasticity evolution in the context of an abrupt environmental change. We term this scenario the sidestep niche model.

AB  - Initiated by a severe outbreak of the beech splendour beetle (Agrilus viridis L.) in Hungary and the increasing importance of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) for managed forests in Central Europe, we studied the phenology of A. viridis. From 2010 to 2012 we investigated swarming, activity density and development time of A. viridis in eight mature beech stands located in prominent beech growing areas of Bavaria (southern Germany) (Fig. 1). Swarming set on in the second half of May and lasted until begin (2011, 2012) and end (2010) of September, respectively (Fig. 3A). Heat sum calculated as DDT-max15 (sum of daily maximum crown temperature minus 15 degrees C) synchronized the flight activity of the beetles very well (Fig. 3B) and significantly better than the Julian date (Fig. 4). The relative low number of trapped beetles (384 in three years) indicated a latent population density during the study period. Swarming beetles correlated significantly with mean maximum temperatures in the beech crowns (Fig. 5). In latency, the beetles showed only an unremarkable dispersal activity and seemed to remain for more than one generation in an individual beech crown, when they initially achieved to colonize some branches. The dieback of infested branches enhances the temperature within the crown and thus, the thermophilic beetle itself improves the habitat for further generations. Oviposition on trap trees peaked 3 to 4 weeks after felling (Tab. 1). The number of egg clusters deposited on trap trees ranged from 28 to 159 per tree (mean 81). The percentage of egg clusters with entrance holes of 1st instar larvae was 52,7%. Based on these clusters the mean number of eggs per cluster was 5.32. In the field, mean development time ranged between 352 and 403 days (Tab. 2). Thus, A. viridis must be expected to occur in overlapping generations with one and two-year development.

AB  - In two independent experiments, we compared: (1) water depth selection (and accompanying temperature selection) by male and female Daphnia magna under different kinds of environmental stress, including the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria, the risk of predation from fish, and the presence of toxic compounds; and (2) sex-dependent production of heat shock proteins (HSP60, 70, and 90) in response to a sudden change in temperature. Male D. magna selected deep water strata, which offer a relatively stable environment, and thereby avoided the threat of predation and the presence of toxic compounds in surface waters. Correlated with this behavior, males reduce their molecular defenses against stress, such as the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs), and do not maintain the physiological machinery that triggers an increase in HSP levels in response to stress. In contrast, female D. magna actively select habitats that offer optimal conditions for growth and production of offspring. Consequently, females are exposed to variable environmental conditions that may be associated with increased stress. To permit survival in these different habitats, D. magna females require molecular mechanisms to protect their cells from rapid changes in stress levels. Thus, they maintain high constitutive levels of the heat shock proteins from HSP 60, 70, and 90 families, and they have the potential to further enhance the production of the majority of these proteins under stress conditions. The results of this study indicate that the separate habitats selected by male and female D. magna result in different patterns of HSP production, leading us to hypothesize that that male and female Daphnia magna adopt different strategies to maximize the fitness of the species.

AB  - Temperature influences the ecology and evolution of insects and their symbionts by impacting each partner independently and their interactions, considering the holobiont as a primary unit of selection. There are sound data about the responses of these partnerships to constant temperatures and sporadic thermal stress (mostly heat shock). However, the current understanding of the thermal ecology of insect-microbe holobionts remains patchy because the complex thermal fluctuations (at different spatial and temporal scales) experienced by these organisms in nature have often been overlooked experimentally. This may drastically constrain our ability to predict the fate of mutualistic interactions under climate change, which will alter both mean temperatures and thermal variability. Here, we tackle down these issues by focusing on the effects of temperature fluctuations on the evolutionary ecology of insect-microbe holobionts. We propose potentially worth-investigating research avenues to (i) evaluate the relevance of theoretical concepts used to predict the biological impacts of temperature fluctuations when applied to holobionts; (ii) acknowledge the plastic (behavioural thermoregulation, physiological acclimation) and genetic responses (evolution) expressed by holobionts in fluctuating thermal environments; and (iii) explore the potential impacts of previously unconsidered patterns of temperature fluctuations on the outcomes and the dynamic of these insect-microbe associations.

AB  - Maintaining an adaptive seasonality, with life cycle events occurring at appropriate times of year and in synchrony with ephemeral resources, is a basic ecological requisite. For poikilothermic organisms, phenology is largely determined through adaptive evolution with the prevailing climate, and in particular, annual temperature cycles. In addition to the direct effect of temperature, most temperate region insects have physiological mechanisms (e.g., diapause) that help to maintain an adaptive seasonality. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), however, exhibits no obvious manifestations of diapause. This has led to the ecologically important question: How is an appropriate seasonality maintained in the mountain pine beetle without the synchronizing influence of diapause? In answer to this basic question, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of oviposition dates and temperatures of one year to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for the mountain pine beetle, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. This leads to the obvious observation that temperatures (weather) can be too cold for the mountain pine beetle to thrive, as well as the less obvious implication that it can also be too warm.
   These results are placed in an ecological and management context by relating adaptive seasonality to outbreak potential. The relationship between outbreak potential and temperature is further considered in view of climate change (i.e., global warming). We briefly note the potential for global warming to intensify outbreak characteristics in the current range of mountain pine beetle, as well as promote invasion into new habitats, such as the high elevation pines and northern range expansion into Canadian jack pine.

AB  - Modern selection approaches are expected to bring about the cumulative and permanent improvement of animal performance and profitability of animal production. Breeding values of traits along with trait economic values (EVs) are utilised for economic selection purposes with many species all over the world. Currently, some challenges related to trait EVs in animal breeding should be considered. First, the selection response based on the higher accuracy of genomic selection may be reduced due to improper weighting of the trait breeding values of selection candidates. A comprehensive approach applied in bioeconomic models allows suitable trait EV calculations. Further challenges comprise the new breeding objectives associated with climate change, environmental mitigation and animal adaptability. The estimation of EVs for traits influencing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been mostly based on including the value of CO2 emission equivalent in the trait EVs, on calculating EVs for feed efficiency traits and on methane yield as a direct trait of GHG emission. Genetic improvement of production, functional, feed efficiency and methane traits through the application of multi-trait selection indices was found to be crucial for mitigation of emissions and farm profitability. Defining the non-market values of traits connected with climate protection could be a useful solution for including these traits in an economic breeding objective. While GHG emissions mostly change the costs per unit of production, animal adaptability in its complexity influences animal performance. Clear definitions of disease, fertility, mortality and other breeding objective traits allow the proper calculation of trait EVs, and an accurate estimation of trait genetic parameters could lead to sufficient economic selection response. This complex approach could be beneficial for more effective utilisation of inputs and overall economic and environmental sustainability of animal production.

The morph-specific JH titer cycle appeared to be primarily driven by a morph-specific diel cycle in the rate of JH biosynthesis. In the present study, cycles of the JH titer and rate of JH biosynthesis in the LW(f) morph persisted in the laboratory under constant darkness with an approximate 24 h periodicity. The JH titer cycle also shifted in concert with a shift in the onset of the scotophase, was temperature compensated in constant darkness, and became arrhythmic under constant light. These results provide strong support for the circadian basis of the morph-specific diel rhythm of the JH titer and JH biosynthetic rate. Persistence of the JH titer cycle under constant darkness in multiple LW-selected and SW-selected stocks also provides support for the genetic basis of the morph-associated circadian rhythm. The morph-specific JH titer cycle was observed in these stocks raised in the field, in both males and females, in each of 3 years studied. The onset of the cycle in the LW(f) morph, a few hours before sunset, correlated well with the onset of the cycle, a few hours before lights-off, in the laboratory. The morph-specific JH titer cycle is a general feature of G.firmus, under a variety of environmental conditions, and is not an artifact of specific laboratory conditions or specific genetic stocks. It is a powerful experimental model to investigate the mechanisms underlying endocrine circadian rhythms, their evolution, and their impact on life history evolution. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urbanisation can affect mating opportunities and thereby alter inter- and intra-sexual selection pressures on sexual traits. Biotic and abiotic urban conditions can influence an individual's success in pre- and post-copulatory mating, for example through impacts on mate attraction and mate preference, fertilisation success, resource competition or rival interactions. Divergent sexual selection pressures can lead to differences in behavioural, physiological, morphological or life-history traits between urban and non-urban populations, ultimately driving adaptation and speciation. Most studies on urban sexual selection and mating interactions report differences between urban and non-urban populations or correlations between sexual traits and factors associated with increased urbanisation, such as pollution, food availability and risk of predation and parasitism. Here we review the literature on sexual selection and sexual traits in relation to urbanisation or urban-associated conditions. We provide an extensive list of abiotic and biotic factors that can influence processes involved in mating interactions, such as signal production and transmission, mate choice and mating opportunities. We discuss all relevant data through the lens of two, non-mutually exclusive theories on sexual selection, namely indicator and sensory models. Where possible, we indicate whether these models provide the same or different predictions regarding urban-adapted sexual signals and describe different experimental designs that can be useful for the different models as well as to investigate the drivers of sexual selection. We argue that we lack a good understanding of: (i) the factors driving urban sexual selection; (ii) whether reported changes in traits result in adaptive benefits; and (iii) whether these changes reflect a short-term ecological, or long-term evolutionary response. We highlight that urbanisation provides a unique opportunity to study the process and outcomes of sexual selection, but that this requires a highly integrative approach combining experimental and observational work.

AB  - Viviparity, the bearing of live young, has evolved well over 100 times among squamate reptiles. This reproductive strategy is hypothesized to allow maternal control of the foetus' thermal environment and thereby to increase the fitness of the parents and offspring. Two hypotheses have been posited to explain this phenomenon: (i) the cold-climate hypothesis (CCH), which advocates low temperatures as the primary selective force; and (ii) the maternal manipulation hypothesis (MMH), which advocates temperature variability as the primary selective force. Here, we investigate whether climatic and geographic variables associated with the CCH vs. the MMH best explain the current geographical distributions of viviparity in lizards while incorporating recent advances in comparative methods, squamate phylogenetics and geospatial analysis. To do this, we compared nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic models predicting viviparity based on point-of-capture data from 20994 museum specimens representing 215 lizard species in conjunction with spatially explicit bioclimatic and geographic (elevation and latitude) data layers. The database we analysed emphasized Nearctic lizards from three species-rich genera (Phrynosoma, Plestiodon and Sceloporus); however, we additionally analysed a less substantial, but worldwide sample of species to verify the universality of our Nearctic results. We found that maximum temperature of the warmest month (and, less commonly, elevation and maximum temperature of the driest quarter) was frequently the best predictor of viviparity and showed an association consistent with the CCH. Our results strongly favour the CCH over the MMH in explaining lizard reproductive mode evolution.

AB  - Hydraulic stimulation experiments were conducted in a re-used Rotliegend well situated in the eastern part of the North German Basin. The well is used as an "in-situ geothermal laboratory" and as a reference location for several ongoing research projects. The aim of the projects and experiments is to develop technologies that will put primary low-productive aquifer structures into use for geothermal power generation. The frac operations in 2002 were designed to enhance the inflow performance by connecting the well to productive reservoir zones. Two consecutive zones within the Rotliegend sandstones were selected. Here core measurements show the most promising petrophysical reservoir properties with respect to a productivity increase. The stimulation treatments were performed as hydraulic proppant fracturing operations. Proppants were used to support the fractures and to guarantee a long-term fracture aperture. The treatment intervals are located in the open-hole section of the well at depths between 4080 m and 4190 m and at temperatures of about 140degreesC. The technical demands were therefore unprecedented in these challenging conditions. An open-hole-packer at the top and a sand plug at the bottom of each interval were used as hydraulic barriers. Applying this configuration the intervals were fracture-treated by injecting about 11 tonnes of proppant (high-strength ceramic grains) and over 200 m(3) of frac fluid (highly viscous gel) into the formation. The fracture treatments were conducted by means of two successive operations in each interval: first, a diagnostic treatment (datafrac), followed by the main treatment (mainfrac) with the proppant stages. The frac operations were successful. Propped fractures were created in both intervals and the inflow behaviour of the reservoir was decisively enhanced. The effective pressures applied for fracture initiation and propagation were only slightly above the in-situ pore pressures. The stimulation ratio predicted by modelling, however, could not be achieved. There were a number of reasons for this mismatch. Probably chemical and mechanical processes during closure led to a reduced fracture conductivity. The insights gained from the experiments are important for future fracture treatment projects on this site and in comparable locations. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of CNR.

AB  - Energy and environmental sustainability is a major global trend for the 21st century. Thermal discomfort and poor air quality in office buildings can result in loss of productivity, absenteeism and medical problems. The most frequently identified causes are related to inadequate ventilation and contaminants from indoor sources. Task ambient air conditioning aims to provide each occupant with personalized clean air direct to the breathing zone. A typical modern office is selected to study the thermal comfort and indoor air quality of the working environment. The temperature distribution, draught rating, volume concentration of the contaminants and ventilation efficiencies for the contaminants are calculated. For fresh air is directly to sent to breathing zone of the occupants by the task air outlet, the temperature, the CO2 concentration and benzene concentration around the occupants are lower than that of the other zones. And ventilation efficiencies for both the CO2 and benzene around occupants are also higher. These show the effectiveness of the task ambient air conditioning system in forming energy-saving, comfort and clean environment.

AB  - The ability of intertidal organisms to maintain their performance via molecular and physiological adjustments under low tide, seasonal fluctuations and extreme events ultimately determines population viability. Analyzing this capacity in the wild is extremely relevant since intertidal communities are under increased climate variability owing to global changes. We addressed the seasonal proteome signatures of a key intertidal species, the shrimp Palaemon elegans, in a natural setting. Shrimps were collected during spring and summer seasons at low tides and were euthanized in situ. Environmental variability was also assessed using hand-held devices and data loggers. Muscle samples were taken for 2D gel electrophoresis and protein identification through mass spectrometry. Proteome data revealed that 55 proteins (10.6% of the proteome) significantly changed between spring and summer collected shrimps, 24 of which were identified. These proteins were mostly involved in cytoskeleton remodelling, energy metabolism and transcription regulation. Overall, shrimps modulate gene expression leading to metabolic and structural adjustments related to seasonal differences in the wild (i.e. abiotic variation and possibly intrinsic cycles of reproduction and growth). This potentially promotes performance and fitness as suggested by the higher condition index in summer-collected shrimps. However, inter-individual variation (% coefficient of variation) in protein levels was quite low (min-max ranges were 0.6-8.3% in spring and 1.2-4.8% in summer), possibly suggesting reduced genetic diversity or physiological canalization. Protein plasticity is relevant to cope with present and upcoming environmental variation related to anthropogenic forcing (e.g. global change, pollution) but low inter-individual variation may limit evolutionary potential of shrimp populations.

AB  - Egg diapause in the Nara (temperate, 34-degrees-40'N) strain of Dianemobius nigrofasciatus of the D. fascipes species-complex is programmed by the parental photoperiod and expressed as delayed hatching at a high temperature (25-degrees-C). However, very few delayed eggs occur at this or higher temperatures in the Bali (tropical, 8-degrees-30'S) and Ishigaki (subtropical, 24-degrees-20'N) strains of D.fascipes, though the subtropical strain shows a clearer incidence of diapause at 20-degrees-C. The results of crossing between the Nara and Bali or Ishigaki strains indicate no simple dominant-recessive relations among alleles determining the incidence and intensity of diapause. Multiple regression analysis of Fl, F2 and backcross eggs on mother and father for the incidence and intensity of diapause indicates additive effects of parental genes. A partial maternal effect was observed on the incidence, but not the intensity, of diapause. By artificial selection through several generations, lines with different diapause levels have been established from the subtropical strain, some of which are comparable to the temperate species in the intensity of egg diapause. A tropical strain of D.fascipes (Chiang Mai, 18-degrees-30'N) showed an increased incidence and degree of hatching delay at a low temperature, suggesting the incipient form of a temperature-dependent diapause. This might be the origin of egg diapause. Hatching delay was observed also in other tropical populations, and assumed to be preserved because of a bet-hedging benefit in the unpredictably fluctuating tropical environment.

AB  - Global climatewarming results in an increase in mean temperatures and in the frequency of extreme climatic events (ECEs), which could both strongly impact ecosystems and populations. Most studies assessing the impact of global warming on ecosystems have focused on warming trends while neglecting ECEs. In particular, the effects of multiple ECEs on fitness, and their consequences for selection, are still missing. Here we explored the effects of daily extreme rainfalls, as well as the occurrence of extremely hot and cold days, on clutch size and laying date in a wild blue tit population (Cyanistes caeruleus) monitored over 25 years. During the nestling phase (8-15 days old), the number of fledglings in a brood was negatively correlated with extremely hot days. The presence of extremely hot days between days 8 and 15 was also associated with an increase in the strength of selection acting on laying date, independently of mean temperature trends during the same period: when 10% of broods in the population experienced this type of ECE, selection for earlier breeding increased by 39%. Our results represent a unique quantification of the impact of multiple ECEs on the fitness landscape and emphasize their role as climatic drivers of selection.

AB  - Diatoms contribute roughly 20% of global primary production, but the factors determining their ability to adapt to global warming are unknown. Here we quantify the capacity for adaptation to warming in the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We find that evolutionary rescue under severe (32 degrees C) warming is slow, but adaptation to more realistic scenarios where temperature increases are moderate (26 degrees C) or fluctuate between benign and severe conditions is rapid and linked to phenotypic changes in metabolic traits and elemental composition. Whole-genome re-sequencing identifies genetic divergence among populations selected in the different warming regimes and between the evolved and ancestral lineages. Consistent with the phenotypic changes, the most rapidly evolving genes are associated with transcriptional regulation, cellular responses to oxidative stress and redox homeostasis. These results demonstrate that the evolution of thermal tolerance in marine diatoms can be rapid, particularly in fluctuating environments, and is underpinned by major genomic and phenotypic change.

AB  - In recent years, hybrid systems have been proved to be revolutionary concepts for meeting the deficit in electrical energy with better overall system's reliability. The proposed system includes the combination of solar, wind, MHD (magneto-hydrodynamics) and fuel cell, to exploit the advantage of each, and reduce the dependency on any one source, and explores a new perspective for using renewable sources as a hybrid system. MHD generator is proposed as a substitute for the conventional thermal power plant. In the proposed hybrid system, both MHD and Modified PEMFC (Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell), also known as Proton Battery, are used. Both are static and totally sustainable energy sources. Moreover, the use of a proton battery offers an added advantage that it can work in a reversible mode. In the electrolyzer mode, the hydronium ions will be absorbed in the porous carbon electrode. In the fuel cell mode, the stored hydronium ions combine with free electrons and oxygen to give pure water as a by-product. The fuel cell is an environment-friendly alternative to the traditional energy storage system and also acts as an energy source for the MHD generator. In this manuscript, an attempt has been made to check the feasibility of the proposed system through a case study. The economic assessment and impact on the environment of the system is also investigated using HOMER Pro software. Simulink results are presented to justify the technical viability of the hybrid proposed model.

AB  - Tree biomass may be utilised to produce heat, electricity, and biofuels. Despite the fact that the technology for turning woody biomass into energy has existed in many cases for decades, bioenergy generation from woody biomass has not been extensively embraced since the cost of woody biomass energy is not viable with old fossil fuels. However, current predictions of future energy usage, as well as proposed renewable energy and climate change laws, imply that forest and farm biomass energy will be used more in the next decades. Biomass, which accounts for roughly 11% of the world's major energy supply, is mostly made up of organic matter, with a lesser proportion of inorganic compounds comprising a range of intricately linked phases or minerals of various origins. Over 55 percent of the 4 billion m(3) of wood utilised yearly in developing countries is immediately utilised as a source of forest products or carbon to satisfy the daily energy requirements to be used for warming and culinary. The proximal and ultimate analyses are commonly used to characterise a fuel's composition. Concerns about the environmental effect of fossil-fuel-based energy generation are rising. In this context, replacing fossil fuel-based energy with bio-energy might be a viable option. The attraction to forest biomass as an energy source stems from some of its characteristics, such as its global availability and homogeneity, as well as its CO2 emissions neutrality. However, there are concerns associated with its usage, the most of which are connected to the long-term viability of forest systems and their products. Due to huge uncertainty regarding future agricultural productivity improvements and land availability for biomass plants, bioenergy's potential for cli-mate change mitigation remains unknown. Bioenergy potentials, global food costs, and water shortages are all expected to be affected by large-scale growth of dedicated biomass. As a result, coordinated energy, land use, and water management strategies are required. Because biomass contains all of the components found in fossil fuels, albeit in various proportions, current and emerging technologies can help us move toward a future based on renewable, sustainable, and low-carbon economies.

AB  - Inspired by the biological RNA, a RNA genetic algorithm with adaptive crossover probability (acRNA-GA) is proposed to estimate parameters of the heavy oil thermal cracking three-lumped model. In acRNA-GA, each individual is represented by nucleotide bases. The crossover operators including competitive permutation operator, translocation operators and inversion operator based on RNA molecular operations are designed to improve the diversity of the population and overcome the premature convergence of GA. An adaptive crossover probability in term of the fitness value is employed to further enhance the global searching ability and the convergence speed. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by four typical benchmark functions. Finally, acRNA-GA is implemented on parameter estimation of the heavy oil thermal cracking three-lumped model. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has better performance than that of SGA.

AB  - Cerastoderma glaucum Bruguiere has a wide geographical distribution in Europe, from the Mediterranean to the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. This cockle is found mainly in coastal embayments and lagoons on muddy, soft bottom. The different reproductive behavior of cockles is related to latitude. In Lesina Lagoon, cockles initiate gametogenesis several times per year; this has been confirmed in laboratory tests where cockles are provided ample Tahitian Isochrysis aff. galbana (clone T-ISO). In the laboratory, cockle biomass (density 400-800 g/m(2)) releases viable gametes all year in a relatively wide range of temperatures (9-24 degrees C). During 12 months of repeated spawning, cockles released a mean of 68,100 eggs/cockle, with an average of 1.13 spawning per week. Because of its high genetic variability, which accounts for its adaptability and ease of spreading in environments with striking changes of physical and chemical aquatic conditions, cockles may have an excellent potential for mariculture application. In addition cockles may play an important ecological role in reducing the particulate organic load of eutrophic lagoons and embayments with a wide range type of salinity and thermal characteristics.

AB  - Functional trait variation within and across populations can strongly influence population, community, and ecosystem processes, but the relative contributions of genetic vs. environmental factors to this variation are often not clear, potentially complicating conservation and restoration efforts. For example, local adaptation, a particular type of genetic by environmental (G*E) interaction in which the fitness of a population in its own habitat is greater than in other habitats, is often invoked in management practices, even in the absence of supporting evidence. Despite increasing attention to the potential for G*E interactions, few studies have tested multiple populations and environments simultaneously, limiting our understanding of the spatial consistency in patterns of adaptive genetic variation. In addition, few studies explicitly differentiate adaptation in response to predation from other biological and environmental factors. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment of first-generation eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) juveniles from six populations across three field sites spanning 1000 km in the southeastern Atlantic Bight in both the presence and absence of predation to test for G*E variation in this economically valuable and ecologically important species. We documented significant G*E variation in survival and growth, yet there was no evidence for local adaptation. Condition varied across oyster cohorts: Offspring of northern populations had better condition than offspring from the center of our region. Oyster populations in the southeastern Atlantic Bight differ in juvenile survival, growth, and condition, yet offspring from local broodstock do not have higher survival or growth than those from farther away. In the absence of population-specific performance information, oyster restoration and aquaculture may benefit from incorporating multiple populations into their practices.

AB  - Crassostrea gigas is a commercially important species which is the mostly widely cultured in the world. However, most of the oyster broodstock in China remains unselected. Through a 7-generation of selection on the shell color and growth traits of adult oysters, an excellent strain of C. gigas with black shell coloration and mantle has been developed. In order to facilitate the industrialized breeding, it is necessary to explore the growth performance of the black shell strain in larval stage and find out the optimal conditions for larval development. In this study, the accumulated growth rate and survival rate of the black shell strain and wild population of C. gigas larvae were measured respectively, and a central composite design as well as a response surface method was used to investigate the combined effect of temperature, salinity, and rearing density on the growth of both the two populations. No significant differences were found in survival rate between the two populations, and two model equations for the growth of the two populations were established. The optimizations of accumulated growth rate for two populations were explored. When the temperature, salinity, and rearing density was 25.14 degrees C, 30.28 psu, and 1.00 ind. ml(-1), respectively, the accumulated growth rate for the black shell strain maximized 15.40 mu m day(-1). With a combination of temperature of 25.06 degrees C, salinity of 29.27 psu and rearing density of 1.00 ind. ml(-1), the maximum value of accumulated growth rate for wild population was 13.20 mu m day(-1). Furthermore, the larval growth rates were compared between the black shell strain and wild population, and the larvae of the black shell strain significantly grew faster than those of wild population when temperature, salinity and rearing density in a suitable range.

AB  - Rapidly increasing energy and electricity demands, global concerns over the climate changes and strong dependence on foreign fossil fuels supplies are powerfully influencing greater use of nuclear power. In order to establish the viability of next-generation reactor concepts to meet tomorrow's needs for clean and reliable energy production the fundamental research and development issues need to be addressed for the Generation-IV nuclear-energy systems. Generation-IV reactor concepts are being developed to use more advanced materials, coolants and higher burn-ups fuels, while keeping a nuclear reactor safe and reliable. One of the six Generation-IV concepts which will utilize thermal neutron spectrum is a Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR).
   This reactor concept uses a graphite-moderated core with a once-through uranium fuel cycle, using high temperature helium as the coolant. Because helium is naturally inert and single-phase, the helium-cooled reactor can operate at much higher temperatures, leading to higher efficiency. Current VHTR concepts will use fuels such as uranium dioxide, uranium carbide, or uranium oxycarbide. Since some of these fuels are new in nuclear industry and due to their unknown properties and behaviour within VHTR conditions it is very important to address these issues by investigate their characteristics within conditions close to those in VHTRs. This research can be performed in a research reactor with in-pile helium loop designed and constructed in Research Centre Rez, Ltd.
   The purpose of the High Temperature Helium Loop (HTHL) is to simulate technical and chemical conditions of VHTR's coolant. The loop is intended to serve an as experimental device for fatigue and creep tests of construction metallic materials for gas-cooled reactors and it should be also employed for research in field of gaseous coolant chemistry. The loop will serve also for tests of nuclear graphite, dosing and Helium purification systems. Because the VHTR is a new reactor concept, major technical uncertainties remain relative to helium-cooled advanced reactor systems. This paper summarizes the concept of the HTHL in the Research Centre Rez Ltd., its design, utilization and future plans for experimental setup.

AB  - The populations of Humboldtiana durattgoensis have experienced a drastic reduction in the effective population size; in addition, the species is threatened by anthropogenic activities. For the aforementioned, landscape genetics will serve as a tool to define the potential evolutionarily significant units (ESU) for this species. To complete our objective, we evaluated the effect of cover vegetation and climate on the functional connectivity of the species from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the present as well as the effect of climate on shell shape. Partial Mantel tests, distance-based redundance analysis and a Bayesian framework were used to evaluate connectivity. On the other hand, geometric morphometrics, phylogenetic principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were used for the analysis of shell shape. Our results suggest that the suitable areas have been decreasing since the LGM; also, vegetation cover rather than climate has influenced the genetic connectivity among land snail populations, although temperature had a high influence on shell shape in this species. In conclusion, vegetation cover was the main factor that determined the functional connectivity for the land snail; however, local selective pressures led to different phenotypes in shell shape that allowed us to postulate that each one of the previously defined genetic groups must be considered as a different ESU.

AB  - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has emerged as the leading option for global natural gas trade. Imported LNG must be regasified at the receiving terminal. The practice of using seawater as the heat source for regasification is a sheer waste of the available cold energy in LNG. In this study, power generation from LNG cold energy is investigated to reverse this wastage. We have developed a superstructure for this power generation process (PGP) that includes direct expansion of LNG and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with simultaneous selection of the working fluid components and their compositions. Using a simulation-based optimization paradigm, the economic viability of the PGP is investigated by maximizing its net present value (NPV). Our results show that although a PGP with both direct expansion and ORC has a higher exergy efficiency, its NPV is nearly 64% lower than that of a PGP with ORC only. We present case studies for various combinations of process parameters and found that LNG regasification pressure has the maximum impact on NPV of the PGP followed by LNG feed temperature and composition. The maximum-NPV PGP uses only ORC and produces a net power of about 0.5-12.9 kW/t(LNG) after satisfying the power demand of the LNG regasification process. The NPV is about $6.87-2.45 million; thus, power generation by recovering cold energy in an LNG regasification terminal is economically viable. We also present a robust process design strategy to handle uncertainties in LNG composition.

AB  - Many tropical ectotherms are considered vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change because they have evolved to become thermal specialists. Indeed, several recent studies have suggested that even small increases in mean operative temperature may lead to a reduction in activity and the subsequent extinction of populations. Within the tropics, lizards are considered particularly vulnerable due to the potential for climate change to directly impact physiology and alter community interactions. However, models usually focus on the effects of mean operative temperature at the expense of other climate variables that may also affect lizard physiology. We used daily variation in operative temperature, humidity and wind speed to examine how changes in climate influence activity in two species of lizards from the island of Cayo Menor, Honduras. Anolis lemurinus is a forest species, whereas A.allisoni is an open-habitat species. We conducted daily surveys for active lizards in habitat typical to each species, while simultaneously measuring operative thermal environments with physical models. The effects of the thermal environment were considered in the context of the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance for each species and compared with the effects of the hydric (humidity) and convective (wind) environments. When all surveys were combined into a single analysis, the activity of the forest species Anolis lemurinus was positively correlated with wind speed, the spatial heterogeneity of operative temperature, and the mismatch between mean operative temperature and the optimal temperature for sprint performance. Mean operative temperature did significantly affect Anolis lemurinus activity, but only when it was above their thermal optimum. Activity of the open-habitat species A.allisoni was negatively correlated with wind speed, but was not related to any other climate variable. Whereas the mismatch between mean operative temperature and the thermal optimum for performance predicted the activity level of the forest species in ways partially consistent with its use in models for the response of lizards to climate change, the effects of the abiotic environment were habitat dependent. Our results suggest that successfully predicting the biological impacts of climate change will require holistic models that account for more than changes in mean temperature alone.

AB  - Across heterogeneous landscapes, populations may have adaptive differences in gene regulation that adjust their physiologies to match local environments. Such differences could have origins in acclimation or in genetically fixed variation between habitats. Here we use common-garden experiments to evaluate differences in gene expression between populations of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, spanning 1700 km and average temperature differences of 5 degrees C to 8 degrees C. Across expression profiles from 18,883 genes after 3 years of common conditions, we find highly correlated expression patterns (Pearson's r = 0.992) among most genes. However, 66 genes were differentially expressed, including many ribosomal protein and biomineralization genes, which had higher expression in urchins originally from the southern population. Gene function analyses revealed slight but pervasive expression differences in genes related to ribosomal function, metabolism, transport, bone development, and response to stimuli. In accord with gene expression patterns, a post-hoc spine regrowth experiment revealed that urchins of southern origin regrew spines at a faster rate than northern urchins. These results suggest that there may be genetically controlled, potentially adaptive differences in gene regulation across habitats and that gene expression differences may be under strong enough selection to overcome high, dispersal-mediated gene flow in this marine species.

AB  - The capacity of populations to respond adaptively to environmental change is essential for their persistence. Isolated populations often harbour reduced genetic variation, which is predicted to decrease adaptive potential, and can be detrimental under the current scenarios of global change. In this study, we examined climatic adaptation in larval life history traits in the pool frog Rana lessonae along a latitudinal gradient across the northern distribution area of the species, paying special attention to the isolated and genetically impoverished fringe populations in central Sweden. Larvae from eight populations within three geographic areas (Poland, Latvia and Sweden) were reared under three temperatures (19, 22 and 26 degrees C) in a common garden laboratory experiment. We found clear evidence for latitudinal adaptation in R. lessonae populations, larvae from higher latitudes growing and developing faster than low-latitude ones. Larvae from the Swedish populations were able to compensate for the effects of cooler temperatures and a shorter growth season with genetically higher growth and development rates (i.e. countergradient variation) in the two higher temperature treatments, but there was no difference among the populations at the lowest temperature treatment, which is likely to be close to the temperature limiting growth in R. lessonae. Our results demonstrate that isolated and genetically impoverished populations can be locally adapted, and identify the Swedish fringe populations as a significant conservation unit adapted to the northern environmental conditions.

AB  - Discerning the adaptive significance of migratory strategies poses significant challenges, not the least of which is measuring migratory capability in natural populations. We take advantage of a visible migratory dimorphism to study variation in migratory capability in the stream-dwelling water strider, Aquarius remigis. Theory predicts loss of migratory capability in this species because streams have been viewed as stable and persistent habitats. As expected, A. remigis lack wings throughout most of North America. However, Californian populations are noted for unexpectedly high frequencies of winged, migratory morphs. To deduce the adaptive significance of this anomalous regional variation, we compare proportion winged among 37 Californian populations. We discover a strong, positive correlation with altitude, but no correlations with latitude, rainfall or stream size. A common garden experiment reveals that both proportion winged and its reaction norm to temperature differ genetically among populations, and a half-sibling experiment demonstrates that wing morph has high heritability, moderate genetic correlations across environments and a significant genotype by environment interaction. These results support the hypothesis that proportion winged and its reaction norm to temperature have diverged genetically in California. We conclude that high migratory capability is an evolutionary adaptation to the unusual harshness and instability of Californian stream habitats, and particularly to the high elevational gradients and extreme seasonal variation characteristic of montane streams.

AB  - AimMesoscale ocean eddies (closed circular currents typically 100-300 km in diameter) are ubiquitous features of the world's oceans. They form partially isolated environments with distinct physical and chemical conditions capable of supporting and transporting whole plankton communities. The productivity and biodiversity of these communities is ultimately dependent on an eddy's ability to retain planktonic organisms. Our aim was to estimate eddy retention time-scales across a range of oceanic environments and larval behaviours, with implications for both distributions and future changes in plankton communities.
   LocationThe Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.
   MethodsA particle-tracking model was forced using ocean currents from a number of validated hydrodynamic models covering environments ranging from shelf seas to the open ocean and equatorial to high-latitude waters. Eddies were seeded with large numbers of particles and their rate of loss from the eddy was used to estimate retention times. The influences of common plankton swimming behaviours were explicitly captured in the model.
   ResultsEddy retention times of modelled plankton ranged from 5 to 67 days, with a median of 19 days. Retention times were not correlated with latitude or eddy size. However, plankton residing near the surface of eddies rotating cyclonically (anticlockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) had significantly shorter retention times than those residing in the same eddy at depth, and vice versa for eddies rotating anticyclonically.
   Main conclusionsWe show that ocean eddies have the potential to retain and support planktonic (and even nektonic) communities over many generations and are likely to enhance larval survival for many invertebrate and fish species. Differences in retention with depth suggest that cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies will support differing plankton communities. If their relative geographical distributions change with global climate, then the relative proportions of diatom-based and dinoflagellate-based communities may also change, with potential implications for higher trophic animals.

AB  - Patterns of genetic structure in highly mobile marine vertebrates may be accompanied by phenotypic variation. Most studies in marine turtles focused on population genetic structure have been performed at rookeries. We studied whether genetic and morphological variation of the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is consistent geographically, focusing on foraging grounds. An association between population genetic structure and body shape variation at broad (inter-lineage) and fine (foraging grounds) scales was predicted and analysed using mitochondrial DNA and geometric morphometrics. Although genetic and phenotypic differentiation patterns were congruent between lineages, no fine-scale association was found, suggesting adaptive divergence. Connectivity among Pacific foraging grounds found here suggests that temperatures of ocean surface currents may influence the genetic structure of C. mydas on a broad scale. Our results suggest that vicariance, dispersal, life-history traits and ecological conditions operating in foraging grounds have shaped the intraspecific morphology and genetic diversity of this species. Considering a range of geographic and temporal scales is useful when management strategies are required for cosmopolitan species. Integrating morphological and genetic tools at different spatial scales, conservation management is proposed based on protection of neutral and adaptive diversity. This approach opens new questions and challenges, especially regarding conservation genetics in cosmopolitan species.

AB  - Chronic changes in climate conditions may select for acclimation responses in terrestrial animals living in fluctuating environments, and beneficial acclimation responses may be key to the resilience of these species to global changes. Despite evidence that climate warming induces changes in water availability, acclimation responses to water restriction are understudied compared with thermal acclimation. In addition, acclimation responses may involve different modes, paces, and trade-offs between physiological and behavioral traits. Here, we tested the dynamical acclimation responses of a dry-skinned terrestrial ectotherm to chronic water restriction. Yearling common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) were exposed to sublethal water restriction during 2 mo of the summer season in laboratory conditions, then released in outdoor conditions for 10 additional months. Candidate behavioral (exploration, basking, and thermal preferences) and physiological (metabolism at rest and standard water loss rate) traits potentially involved in the acclimation response were measured repeatedly during and after water restriction. We observed a sequential acclimation response in water-restricted animals (yearlings spent less time basking during the first weeks of water deprivation) that was followed by delayed sex-specific physiological consequences of the water restriction during the following months (thermal depression in males and lower standard evaporative water loss rates in females). Despite short-term negative effects of water restriction on body growth, annual growth, survival, and reproduction were not significantly different between water-restricted and control yearlings. This demonstrates that beneficial acclimation responses to water restriction involve both short-term flexible behavioral responses and delayed changes in thermal and water biology traits.

AB  - There are three Northeast Pacific Rivers still supporting spawning populations of green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris, but all have been modified hydrologically and thermally by dam construction. Age 1- to 3-year-old green sturgeon, progeny of artificially spawned, wild-caught Klamath River adults, were used to assess the effects of temperature and carbon dioxide on critical hematological parameters related to evolutionary adaptations of this species to its physical environment. In vitro measurement of the effect of temperature and carbon dioxide on blood-oxygen affinity and equilibrium curve shape yielded the following data for the respective temperature treatments (11, 15, 19, and 24 degrees C): half-saturation values (P-50's, kPa, a measure of affinity) 1.26, 1.44, 1.63, 1.69 for low-PCO2 treatments and 2.08, 2.41, 2.74, 2.94 for high-PCO2 treatments; Bohr factors -0.322, -0.327, -0.366, -0.536; and non-bicarbonate buffer values (slykes) -6, -3, -5, -8. Temperature sensitivities (Delta H, kJ mol O-2(-1)) between these respective temperatures were -34.20, -15.24, -6.74 for low-PCO2 treatments and -20.05, -27.00, and -11.55 for the high-PCO2 treatments. These data suggest that juvenile green sturgeon may tolerate moderate environmental hypoxia, moderate aerobic activity, low to moderate hypercapnia, and moderate temperature changes in their environments.

AB  - Open pollinated progeny from eight maternal trees from three European populations of Ulmus laevis Pall. (European white elm) were cultivated in a growth chamber for one growth period in either a well watered or a drought stress treatment. Traits important for adaptation such as growth rate, time of budset and final dry weight were measured. Two leaves were removed from each plant for analysis of leaf morphology, as described by moment invariants and elliptic Fourier coefficients. We used univariate and multivariate analyses of variance to calculate genetic parameters in order to answer the questions: i) How much genetic variation is present in populations and families of U. laevis? ii) What is the effect of the water regime on the expression of genetic variation? Treatment effects and genotype rank changes were relatively small, but the strongly significant population and family differentiation across and within treatments for most adaptive traits and for some of the leaf shape components suggest that there is substantial additive genetic variation within these populations of U. laevis which could serve as a genetic basis for adaptation to future changes in water availability. Furthermore, the amounts of genetic variation for adaptive traits and leaf morphology were of similar magnitude within both watering regimes, i.e. there was no straightforward relationship between the water treatments and the expression of genetic variation.

AB  - Members of the genus Ebolavirus cause fulminating outbreaks of disease in human and non-human primate populations with a mortality rate up to 90%. To facilitate rapid detection of these pathogens in clinical and environmental samples, robust reagents capable of providing sensitive and specific detection are required. In this work recombinant antibody libraries were generated from murine (single chain variable domain fragment; scFv) and nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum (IgNAR V) hosts immunised with Zaire ebolavirus. This provides the first recorded IgNAR V response against a particulate antigen in the nurse shark. Both murine scFv and shark IgNAR V libraries were panned by phage display technology to identify useful antibodies for the generation of immunological detection reagents. Two murine scFv were shown to have specificity to the Zaire ebolavirus viral matrix protein VP40. Two isolated IgNAR V were shown to bind to the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and to capture viable Zaire ebolavirus with a high degree of sensitivity. Assays developed with IgNAR V cross-reacted to Reston ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus. Despite this broad reactivity, neither of IgNAR V showed reactivity to Cote divoire ebolavirus. IgNAR V was substantially more resistant to irreversible thermal denaturation than murine scFv and monoclonal IgG in a comparative test. The demonstrable robustness of the IgNAR V domains may offer enhanced utility as immunological detection reagents in fieldable biosensor applications for use in tropical or subtropical countries where outbreaks of Ebolavirus haemorrhagic fever occur.

AB  - The cellular stress response (CSR) is critical for enabling organisms to cope with thermal damage to proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. It is a graded response whose properties vary with the degree of cellular damage. Molecular damage has positive, as well as negative, function-perturbing effects. Positive effects include crucial regulatory interactions that orchestrate involvement of the different components of the CSR. Thermally unfolded proteins signal for rapid initiation of transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), central elements of the heat shock response (HSR). Thermal disruption of messenger RNA (mRNA) secondary structures in untranslated regions leads to the culling of the mRNA pool: thermally labile mRNAs for housekeeping proteins are degraded by exonucleases; heat-resistant mRNAs for stress proteins like HSPs then can monopolize the translational apparatus. Thus, proteins and RNA function as "cellular thermometers," and evolved differences in their thermal stabilities enable rapid initiation of the CSR whenever cell temperature rises significantly above the normal thermal range of a species. Covalent DNA damage, which may result from increased production of reactive oxygen species, is temperature-dependent; its extent may determine cellular survival. High levels of stress that exceed capacities for molecular repair can lead to proteolysis, inhibition of cell division, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Onset of these processes may occur later in the stress period, after initiation of the HSR, to allow HSPs opportunity to restore protein homeostasis. Delay of these energy costly processes may also result from shortfalls in availability of adenosine triphosphate and reducing power during times of peak stress.

AB  - Design of efficient blanching treatment requires knowledge of critical factors such as enzyme inactivation kinetic parameters which is unique to each vegetable. Thermal inactivation of peroxidase in mint leaves was kinetically investigated at the temperature range of 70100 degrees C. Applicability of various enzyme inactivation models available in the literature was critically evaluated. The Weibull distribution model provided a good description of the kinetics of inactivation of peroxidase in mint leaves over the selected temperatures. The temperature dependence of parameters and distribution curve characteristics were determined. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thermal tolerance and its plasticity are important for understanding ectotherm responses to climate change. However, it is unclear whether plasticity is traded-off at the expense of basal thermal tolerance and whether plasticity is subject to phylogenetic constraints. Here, we investigated associations between basal thermal tolerance and acute plasticity thereof in laboratory-reared adult males of eighteen Drosophila species at low and high temperatures. We determined the high and low temperatures where 90% of flies are killed (ULT90 and LLT90, respectively) and also the magnitude of plasticity of acute thermal pretreatments (i.e. rapid cold-and heat-hardening) using a standardized, species-specific approach for the induction of hardening responses. Regression analyses of survival variation were conducted in ordinary and phylogenetically informed approaches. Low-temperature pretreatments significantly improved LLT90 in all species tested except for D. pseudoobscura, D. mojavensis and D. borealis. High-temperature pretreatment only significantly increased ULT90 in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. LLT90 was negatively correlated with low-temperature plasticity even after phylogeny was accounted for. No correlations were found between ULT90 and LLT90 or between ULT90 and rapid heat-hardening (RHH) in ordinary regression approaches. However, after phylogenetic adjustment, there was a positive correlation between ULT90 and RHH. These results suggest a trade-off between basal low-temperature tolerance and acute low-temperature plasticity, but at high temperatures, increased basal tolerance was accompanied by increased plasticity. Furthermore, high-and low-temperature tolerances and their plasticity are clearly decoupled. These results are of broad significance to understanding how organisms respond to changes in habitat temperature and the degree to which they can adjust thermal sensitivity.

AB  - A concept postulating that aging is a specific biological function that promotes the progressive evolution of sexually reproducing species is reviewed, Death caused by aging clears the population of ancestors and frees space for progeny carrying new useful traits. Like any other important function, aging is mediated by several molecular mechanisms working simultaneously. At least three such mechanisms have been postulated thus far: 1) telomere shortening due to suppression of telomerase at early stages of embryogenesis; 2) age-related activation of a mechanism that induces the synthesis of heat shock proteins in response to denaturing stimuli; and 3) incomplete suppression of generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). None of these phenomena call kill the organism, but only weaken it, which becomes crucial under extreme conditions, This mechanism of age-induced death can be compensated for (within certain time limits) by several positive traits that greatly increase the evolutionary potential of species capable of performing this function. Similarly to apoptosis (programmed cell death), the programmed death of the body can be called "phenoptosis". Aging presumably belongs to the category of "soft" (extended in time and allowing a certain degree of compensation) phenoptosis, in contrast to "acute" phenoptosis; the death of salmon females immediately after spawning is a good example of the latter.

AB  - Although studies increasingly disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary responses to environmental change, few test for transgenerational plasticity in this context. Here, we evaluate whether phenotypic divergence of acorn ants in response to urbanization is driven by transgenerational plasticity rather than evolution. F2 generation worker ants (offspring of laboratory-born queens) exhibited similar divergence among urban and rural populations as field-born worker ants, suggesting that evolutionary divergence rather than transgenerational plasticity was primarily responsible for shifts toward higher heat tolerance and diminished cold tolerance in urban acorn ants. Hybrid offspring from matings between urban and rural populations also indicated that evolutionary divergence was likely the primary mechanism underlying population differences in thermal tolerance. Specifically, thermal tolerance traits were not inherited either maternally or paternally in the hybrid pairings as would be expected for strong parental or grandparental effects mediated through a single sex. Urban-rural hybrid offspring provided further insight into the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation. Heat tolerance of hybrids more resembled the urban-urban pure type, whereas cold tolerance of hybrids more resembled the rural-rural pure type. As a consequence, thermal tolerance traits in this system appear to be influenced by dominance rather than being purely additive traits, and heat and cold tolerance might be determined by separate genes. Though transgenerational plasticity does not appear to explain divergence of acorn ant thermal tolerance, its role in divergence of other traits and across other urbanization gradients merits further study.

AB  - The environmental degradation caused by the increased use of fossil fuels in the energy sector, call for an urgent switch to alternative energy sources which can assure sustainability, energy security and reliability. So far, solutions based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have been proved reliable in providing energy even in autonomous networks, if they combine different sources (e.g. solar and wind) or combined with conventional energy generators. Among the promising solutions to the energy problem is the geothermal energy which consists of stored energy in the earth in the form of water or steam at high pressure and temperature. The countries which are most likely to possess a high geothermal potential are those located in seismic zones close to destructive and constructive plate margins. Greece is among the countries that, due to location, possesses a remarkable geothermal potential of medium and high enthalpy fields. The interest in exploiting geothermal energy in Greece for electricity generation is mainly focused on non-interconnected islands, where energy is produced from oil-based generators with high energy cost, mainly during the summer months which is a period of rapid increase in energy demand. In this respect, the present study investigates, through an economic evaluation, the optimum sizing of a hybrid solution, which includes a geothermal power plant and a solar field of concentrated collectors able to cover the energy needs of an isolated island. The combination of solar and geothermal energy source aims to maintain the long-term productivity of the geothermal field by reducing its degradation ratio. The thermal energy, generated by the solar installation, increases the temperature of the geothermal brine before injected it back into the well and therefore reduces its energy degradation. In this study, different cases of solar field sizes are evaluated in order to achieve the optimum combination of the geothermal power plant and the concentrated solar array. According to the results, the proposed installation can guarantee energy autonomy with increased economic efficiency and competitive energy production cost, compared to the current prices in small isolated Aegean Sea islands.

AB  - Drosophila falleni belongs to the quinaria species group, whose species vary considerably in patterns of wing and abdominal pigmentation. Drosophila falleni itself exhibits substantial variation among wild flies in abdominal spotting patterns. A selection experiment revealed that natural populations of D. falleni harbor high levels of genetic variation for spot number; in 10 generations of selection modal spot number within populations declined from 18 (the modal number in wild-caught females) to as low as zero. Rearing flies at different temperatures shows that some of the variation among wild flies is likely to reflect variation in the environmental conditions under which they developed. Fitness assays did not reveal any cost of reduced spot number with respect to development time, adult survival, or female fecundity. However, spotless flies were almost twice as susceptible to infection by the nematode parasite Howardula aoronymphium. Thus, selection exerted by nematode parasites may influence pigmentation patterns and other. genetically correlated traits in natural populations D. falleni.

AB  - Host cell proteins (HCPs) constitute a major group Of impurities for biologic drugs produced using cell culture technology. HCPs are required to be closely monitored and adequately removed in the downstream process. However, HCPs are a complex mixture of proteins with significantly diverse molecular and immunological properties. An overall understanding of the composition of HCPs and changes in their molecular properties upon changes in upstream and harvest process conditions can greatly facilitate downstream process design. This article describes the use of a comparative proteomic profiling method viz. two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) to examine HCP composition in the harvest stream of CHO cell culture. The effect of upstream process parameters such as cell culture media, bioreactor control strategy, feeding strategy, and cell Culture duration/cell viability on HCP profile was examined using this technique. Among all the parameters studied, cell viability generated the most significant changes on the HCP profile. 2D-DIGE was also used to compare the HCP differences between monoclonal antibody producing and null cell cultures. The HCP species in production cell culture was found to be well represented in null Cell Culture, which confirms the suitability of using the null cell culture for immunoassay reagent generation. 2D-DIGE is complimentary to the commonly used HCP immunoassay. It provides a direct comparison of the changes in HCP composition under different conditions and can reveal properties (pI, MW) of individual species, whereas the immunoassay sensitively quantifies total HCP amount in a given sample.

AB  - .We revisit the problem of the production of light atomic nuclei in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. While their production systematics is well produced by hadro-chemical freezeout at temperatures near the QCD pseudo-critical temperature, their small binding energies of a few MeV per nucleon suggest that they cannot survive as bound states under these conditions. Here, we adopt the concept of effective chemical potentials in the hadronic evolution from chemical to thermal freezeout (at typically T fo similar or equal to 100 MeV), which, despite frequent elastic rescatterings in hadronic matter, conserves the effective numbers of particles which are stable under strong interactions, most notably pions, kaons and nucleons. It turns out that the large chemical potentials that build up for antibaryons result in thermal abundances of light nuclei and antinuclei, formed at thermal freezeout, which essentially agree with the ones evaluated at chemical freezeout. Together with their transverse-momentum spectra, which also indicate a kinetic freezeout near T fo , this provides a natural explanation for their production systematics without postulating their survival at high temperatures.

AB  - The diversity of habitats generated by the Andes uplift resulted a mosaic of heterogeneous environments in South America for species to evolve a variety of ecological and physiological specializations. Species in the lizard family Liolaemidae occupy a myriad of habitats in the Andes. Here, we analyze the tempo and mode of evolution in the thermal biology of liolaemids. We assessed whether there is evidence of local adaptation (lability) or conservatism (stasis) in thermal traits. We tested the hypothesis that abiotic factors (e.g., geography, climate) rather than intrinsic factors (egg-laying [oviparous] or live-bearing [viviparous], substrate affinity) explain variation in field active body temperature (T-b), preferred temperature (T-p), hours of restriction of activity, and potential hours of activity. Although most traits exhibited high phylogenetic signal, we found variation in thermal biology was shaped by geography, climate, and ecological diversity. Ancestral character reconstruction showed shifts in T-b tracked environmental change in the past similar to 20,000 years. Thermal preference is 3 degrees C higher than T-b, yet exhibited a lower rate of evolution than T-b and air temperature. Viviparous Liolaemus have lower T(b)s than oviparous species, whereas T-p is high for both modes of reproduction, a key difference that results in a thermal buffer for viviparous species to cope with global warming. The rapid increase in environmental temperatures expected in the next 50-80 years in combination with anthropogenic loss of habitats are projected to cause extirpations and extinctions in oviparous species.

AB  - Increasing surface air temperature is a fundamental characteristic of a warming world. Rising temperatures have potential impacts on human health through heat stress. One heat stress metric is the wet-bulb globe temperature, which takes into consideration the effects of radiation, humidity, and wind speed. It also has broad health and environmental implications. This study presents wet-bulb globe temperatures calculated from the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis and combines it with health guidelines to assess heat stress variability and the potential for reduction in labor hours over the past decade on both the continental and urban scale. Compared to 2010-2014, there was a general increase in heat stress during the period from 2015 to 2019 throughout the northern hemisphere, with the largest warming found in tropical regions, especially in the northern part of the Indian Peninsula. On the urban scale, our results suggest that heat stress might have led to a reduction in labor hours by up to similar to 20% in some Asian cities subject to work-rest regulations. Extremes in heat stress can be explained by changes in radiation and circulation. The resultant threat is highest in developing countries in tropical areas where workers often have limited legal protection and healthcare. The effect of heat stress exposure is therefore a collective challenge with environmental, economic, and social implications.

AB  - Global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance have significantly degraded biodiversity in coral reef ecosystems. The genetic potential and adaptability of corals are key factors used to predict the fate of global coral reefs under climate change. In this study, we used eight microsatellite loci to study the patterns of reproduction, genetic diversity, and genetic structure of 302 Porites lutea samples across 13 degrees latitudes in the South China Sea (8.8644 degrees N-22.6117 degrees N). The results indicated that P. lutea reproduces largely via sexual reproduction on scales of 5 m and greater and has abundant gene diversity. Additionally, the tropical populations harbored high genetic diversity (based on alleles, effective number of alleles, gene diversity, and heterozygosity). In contrast, genetic diversity was lower in subtropical coral populations. Genetic variation values and pairwise F-ST revealed that tropical and subtropical populations had significantly different genetic structures. Finally, the Mantel tests showed that the genetic differentiation and genetic variation of P. lutea were strongly correlated with sea surface temperature and slightly correlated with geographical distance. These results indicated that tropical P. lutea populations have high genetic potential and adaptability because of their sexual reproduction and genetic diversity, giving them a greater capacity to cope with climate change. Subtropical coral populations showed lower genetic diversity and, thus, relatively poor genetic resilience in response to low average sea surface temperature and human activities. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the protection and restoration of coral reefs.

AB  - Amine-based carbon dioxide capture is the most mature technology for reducing flue gas CO2 emissions. It has been postulated and observed during commercialisation of this technology that significant quantities of waste amines are produced. Further industrial implementation of this technology requires adequate disposal or valorisation options for this waste. This review presents an analysis of seven biological and chemical technologies for waste amine amelioration or valorisation. Of these, the biological treatments are identified as being more mature for industrial application with the capacity for marketable product generation. Slow speed is the main drawback of the biological processes but this does not hinder their commercial viability. Using waste amine for NOx reduction in power stations is a secondary option, where it seems probable that the amount of waste amine generated in the CO2 capture plant is sufficient to fulfil the DeNOx requirements of the flue gas. This route, however, requires investigation into the impact of waste amine impurities on the power station and the CO2 capture plant operations.

AB  - The rapid increase of world energy demand over the past decades has led to an extensive exploitation of the planet's natural resources. Given that the population growth will continue for the next decades, there is an urgent need for a switch to Renewable Energy Sources (RES). One of the promising solutions to the energy problem is the geothermal energy which consists of stored energy in the earth in the form of water or steam at high pressure and temperature. Countries located in seismic zones possess a high geothermal potential due to their position at destructive and constructive plate margins. Greece is one of the countries with a remarkable potential in geothermal energy of medium and high enthalpy fields. Interest in the exploitation of geothermal fields for electricity generation is mainly focused on non-interconnected Greek islands, where energy is produced from oil-based generators with high energy cost and low-quality electricity, mainly during the summer months which is a period of high energy demand. In this respect, the present study investigates the possibility of combining a geothermal power plant with a concentrated solar array to provide energy to an autonomous island grid. Since the productivity of geothermal fields is gradually decreasing over the years, the combination of solar with geothermal energy source aims to the extension of the productive lifetime of the field, achieved by reheating the geothermal fluid during reinjection to the injection well. The thermal energy, generated by concentrated solar collectors, increases the temperature of the geothermal brine and reduces the energy degradation of the field. In this study, the energy efficiency of different reheat values are studied in order to achieve the combination of a geothermal power plant and a concentrated solar field that can meet specific targets for lifetime energy production. According to the results, the proposed installation can merely contribute to the energy autonomy of the island grid during periods of low demand and provide energy security in periods of high energy consumption.

AB  - Temperature influences ectotherm fitness by affecting physiological performance. Terrestrial reptiles behaviourally regulate their body temperature by selecting particular microhabitats or activity periods. In temperate climates, thermal constraints make precise thermoregulation costly. Theoretical models of thermoregulation predict that species in cool environments should exhibit lower optimal temperature for performance and lower thermal preferences to minimize thermoregulatory costs. Empirical data in support of this prediction remain equivocal because several species maintain high and constant body temperatures, even in cool environments. We studied two largely sympatric colubrid snakes, Hierophis viridiflavus and Zamenis longissimus that share numerous morphological and ecological similarities, but differ markedly in thermal preference. Our objective was to quantify their thermoregulatory strategies in the field to determine how thermal preferences translate in habitat use and performance gain. The thermophilic species, H. viridiflavus, selected open microhabitats, whereas Z. longissimus, which prefers cooler temperatures, used a greater diversity of microhabitats. The two species differed markedly in their exposure levels. Hierophis viridiflavus was constrained to shuttle between sun and shade to maintain preferred body temperatures rendering it very exposed, while covered microhabitats were usually thermally compatible with the requirements of Z. longissimus. High exposure was apparently counterbalanced by higher locomotor performances in H. viridiflavus. The divergence in thermal ecology between Z. longissimus and H. viridiflavus likely reflects different trade-offs between energy gain and predator avoidance.

AB  - A major way that organisms can adapt to changing environmental conditions is by evolving increased or decreased phenotypic plasticity. In the face of current global warming, more attention is being paid to the role of plasticity in maintaining fitness as abiotic conditions change over time. However, given that temporal data can be challenging to acquire, a major question is whether evolution in plasticity across space can predict adaptive plasticity across time. In growth chambers simulating two thermal regimes, we generated transcriptome data for western North American scarlet monkeyflowers (Mimulus cardinalis) collected from different latitudes and years (2010 and 2017) to test hypotheses about how plasticity in gene expression is responding to increases in temperature, and if this pattern is consistent across time and space. Supporting the genetic compensation hypothesis, individuals whose progenitors were collected from the warmer-origin northern 2017 descendant cohort showed lower thermal plasticity in gene expression than their cooler-origin northern 2010 ancestors. This was largely due to a change in response at the warmer (40 degrees C) rather than cooler (20 degrees C) treatment. A similar pattern of reduced plasticity, largely due to a change in response at 40 degrees C, was also found for the cooler-origin northern versus the warmer-origin southern population from 2017. Our results demonstrate that reduced phenotypic plasticity can evolve with warming and that spatial and temporal changes in plasticity predict one another.

AB  - Alaska village survival is threatened by the high cost of imported fuels for heating, electricity generation, and vehicles. During Winter 2007-8, the price per gallon of heating oil and diesel generation fuel exceeded $8 in many villages. Many villagers were forced to move to Anchorage or Fairbanks. Although indigenous renewable energy (RE) resources may be adequate to supply a community's total annual energy needs, the innate intermittent and seasonal output of the renewables - except geothermal, where available, which may be considered "baseload" - requires large-scale, low-cost energy storage to provide an annually-firm energy supply. Anhydrous ammonia, NH3, is the most attractive, carbon-free fuel for this purpose at Alaska village scale, because of its 17.8% mass hydrogen content and its high energy density as a low-pressure liquid, suitable for storage in inexpensive mild steel tanks. NH3 may be synthesized directly from renewable-source electricity, water, and atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) via solid state ammonia synthesis (SSAS), a new process to be pioneered in Alaska.

AB  - The behavioral and physiological thermoregulation of three Atacama desert-dwelling Liolaemus lizards was studied and compared with previous data on Liolaemus from other ecosystems. The thermoregulatory mechanisms of the desert-dwelling species differed from those of the others, a consequence of differences in the habitat structure of the species. Desert species have higher critical thermal minima and, contrary to expectations, lower selected body temperatures than Liolaemus from Mediterranean environments. Results of the rate,, of thermal time constants suggest mechanisms to cope with the fast decrease of environmental temperature that occurs in the desert during the mid-afternoons. Finally, the manner in which selection of low body temperatures may allow survival in desert conditions is discussed. Keywords: thermal time constants, operative temperature, physiological and behavioral thermoregulation.

AB  - Enterobacter sakazakii infections often involve debilitated neonates Consuming contaminated I the possibility that expressed human breast milk can become contaminated with E. sakazakii in the hospital or home setting and through the use Of contaminated breast milk fortifiers. In addition, although breast milk has been shown to have some antimicrobial effects, this has not been extensively researched in regards to E. sakazakii. Thus, we examined the Survival and growth of 9 strains of E. sakazakii in breast milk, human breast milk with fortifiers and powdered infant formula at 10, 23 and 37 degrees C. The average generation times for clinical, food and environmental isolates in breast milk were 0.94 +/- 0.04, 0.75 +/- 0.04 and 0.84 +/- 0.04 h at 23 degrees C; and 0.51 +/- 0.03, 0.33 +/- 0.03 and 0.42 +/- 0.03 h at 37 degrees C, respectively. E. sakazakii was able to Survive up to 12 days in breast milk with fortifiers at 10 degrees C. However, its average generation times among replicates and isolate sources ranged from 11.97 +/- 3.82 to 27.08 +/- 4.54 h in breast milk at 10 degrees C. Interestingly, average generation times in breast milk with fortifiers at 23 degrees C (0.83 +/- 0.05, 0.93 +/- 0.06 and 0.96 +/- 0.06 h) and 37 degrees C (0.41 +/- 0.04, 0.51 +/- 0.05 and 0.54 +/- 0.05 h) were longer than in powdered infant formula and breast inilk at the same temperatures, indicating that human breast milk fortifiers may have an inhibitory effect on the growth of E. sakazakii. However, the intrinsically ascribed antimicrobial properties of breast inilk do not appear to inhibit the growth of this foodborne pathogen in-vitro. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite intensive research, there is no clear empirical evidence to explain the evolution and persistence of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles. A recent hypothesis presented by Reinhold proposes that natal homing could lead directly to the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination. According to his hypothesis, daughters are produced in rare high-quality sites (associated with higher survival rates) to which they return and use to nest, thus deriving higher fitness than sons for whom the quality of the natal patch does not affect their reproductive output if they survive to maturity. We performed an initial empirical evaluation of several assumptions and predictions of this hypothesis as applied to painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), using data from five consecutive nesting seasons, on a major nesting beach. Females were somewhat philopatric to microgeographic sites and to vegetation cover types within the nesting beach, consistent with one of the assumptions of Reinhold's hypothesis. The variables we examined that influence hatchling fitness (predation, hatching success and sex ratio) were not stable at microgeographic nesting sites or at vegetation cover types. Predation was repeatable within females, whereas hatching success and sex ratio were not. Contrary to Reinhold's hypothesis, females did not nest more frequently in open sites (which tend to produce more females) than in patches with more vegetation (which tend to produce more males). Furthermore, preferred nest sites (as measured by nest density) did not produce predominantly females. However, nests with higher hatching success tended to produce slightly more females (although the magnitude of this effect was very small). Therefore, Reinhold's hypothesis is not applicable to C. picta at the level studied - that is, within a nesting beach over a 5 year period - because most of the essential conditions were not met by our data.

AB  - The reaction of N((4) S) radical with NO2 molecule has been studied theoretically using density functional theory and ab initio quantum chemistry method. Both singlet and triplet electronic state [N2O2] potential energy surfaces (PESs) are calculated at the G3B3 level of theory. Also, the highly cost-expensive coupled-cluster theory including single and double excitations and perturbative inclusion of triple excitations CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ single-point energy calculation is performed on the basis of the geometries obtained at the Becke's three parameter Lee-Yang-Parr B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) level. On the singlet PES of the title reaction, it is shown that the most feasible pathway should be as follows. The atomic radical N attacking the NO bond of the NO2 molecule first to form the adduct 1 N(NO)O, followed by one of the NO bond broken to give intermediate 2 ONNO, and then to the major products P1 (2NO). On the triplet PES of the title reaction, it is shown that the most favorable pathway should be the atomic radical N attacking the N-atom of NO2 firstly to form the adduct 7 NN(OO), followed by one of the NO bonds breaking to give intermediate 8 NNOO, and then leading to the major products P2 (O-2 + N-2). As efficient routes to the reduction of NO2 to form N-2 and O-2 are sought, both kinetic and thermodynamic considerations support the viability of this channel. All the involved transition states for generation of (2NO), (O-3 + N2O), and (O-2 + N-2) lie much lower than the reactants. Thus, the novel reaction N + NO2 can proceed effectively even at low temperatures and it is expected to play a role in both combustion and interstellar processes. The other reaction pathways are less competitive due to thermodynamical or kinetic factors. On the basis of the analysis of the kinetics of all path-ways through which the reactions proceed, we expect that the competitive power of reaction pathways may vary with experimental conditions for the title reaction. The calculated reaction heats of formation are in good agreement with that obtained experimentally.

AB  - Energy efficiencies above eta = 12% have been observed for the non thermal dissociation of pure carbon dioxide (i.e. in the absence of carrier gas) at atmospheric pressure in arrays of microchannel plasmas. Microplasma 'chips' similar to those developed for the plasmachemical production of ozone from O-2 or air (Kim et al 2017 Eur. Phys. J. Spec. Top. 226 2923) generate spatially uniform, abnormal glow plasmas in >= 1 atm. of CO2 and consume 1-8 W of average power when driven by sinusoidal or bipolar pulsed voltage waveforms (pulse repetition frequency of 15-20 kHz). Fabricated in nanoporous alumina, the microchannels are 250 mu m in width. 150 mu m in depth, and 3 an in length, and the array on each chip typically comprises 12 channels. Intense emission from microplasma arrays, recorded over the similar to 335-700 nm spectral interval when E/N approximate to 100 Td, is dominated by CO2+ ((A) over tilde (2)Pi -> (X) over tilde (2)Pi) fluorescence which indicates that both CO2+ and electronically-excited CO (e.g. CO*) are generated primarily by multistep electron impact processes. Dissociative recombination of the CO2+ ((X) over tilde) ground state species appears to also be a contributing factor in CO* production. Owing to the modest power consumption and active volume of a single chip, the CO generation efficiency for a single array is 45 g kWh(-1) for a CO2 flow rate of 70 sccm and the dissociation efficiency is 4.3%. The connection of four chips in tandem in a commercial module increases the CO2 dissociation efficiency to 20% and similar to 11% for flow rates of 70 sccm and 200 sccm, respectively. Data acquired with multiple chips confirms the scalability of the CO2 dissociation process, and suggests the economic viability of the commercial production of CO for the synthesis of formic acid, methanol, and syngas.

AB  - The abiotic conditions of the desert habitat fluctuate in a circadian rhythm of hot days and cold nights. Species living in desert habitats evolved many adaptations to increase their chances of survival. However, abiotic conditions in xerothermic habitats of a temperate climate are much different. Diurnal fluctuations are not as strong, but animals have to cope with seasonal changes and hibernate during the winter, which may potentially influence their adaptations to critical temperature conditions. We attempted to assess heat resistance adaptations using the example of a widely distributed xerothermic ant Formica cinerea. Using Real-Time PCR, we measured the expression of three heat shock protein genes (Hsp60, Hsp75, Hsp90) and assessed the adaptations of F. cinerea to enable foraging in risk prone conditions. The analysis of gene expression using the Generalized Linear Model surprisingly indicated that there was no significant effect of temperature when comparing workers from the control (23 degrees C) with workers foraging on the surface of hot sand (47-54 degrees C). As a next step we tried to estimate the threshold of a thermal resistance with the use of thermal chambers. Expression of all Hsps genes increase compare to the control group, expression of Hsp60 and Hsp90 continued up to 45 degrees C.

AB  - In this paper, machine learning techniques in conjunction with passive EEG (electroencephalogram) measurement were explored to classify occupants' real-time thermal comfort states, which have the potential in the future for energy saving through adopting time varying set points when real-time changes in thermal comfort can require less energy input. The performances of different machine learning techniques were compared, and the method to select linear continuous features for class interpolation was also explored. For the full-set features, the performances of different classifiers were satisfactory, with classification rates all above 90%. The LDA classifier had the best performance. The second best was the NB classifier, and the relatively worst was the KNN classifier. The linear continuous EEG features were selected by interpolation and can be found for all human subjects. Higher selection threshold led to less selected features but higher average performance of these features. In general, the EEG based machine learning methods can classify occupants' real-time thermal comfort states, and could potentially lead to more building energy saving through comfort-driven time varying set points.

AB  - Ectotherms use behaviour to buffer effects of temperature on growth, development and survival. While behavioural thermoregulation is widely reported, localized adaptation of thermal preference is poorly documented. Larval amphibians live in wetlands ranging from entirely open to heavily shaded by vegetation. We hypothesized that populations undergo localized selection leading to countergradient patterns of thermal preference behaviour. Specifically, we predicted that wood frog (Rana sylvatica) larvae from closed canopy ponds would be more strongly temperature selective and would prefer higher temperatures than conspecifics from populations found in open canopy ponds. In a study of six breeding ponds in north-eastern Connecticut, USA, these predictions were upheld. The countergradient, microgeographical variation in thermal preference documented here implies that wood frog populations may have diverged rapidly in the face of contrasting selection pressures. Rapid, behaviourally mediated responses to changing thermal environments have important implications for understanding population responses to climate change.

AB  - For biogas production, different renewable feedstocks, e.g., feces, manure, silage, industrial by-products, and municipal waste, can be used. Biogas production from various renewable feedstocks has positive socioeconomic and environmental impact. In Europe, biogas is mainly used for generating heat and electricity. It consists of methane (55-70% by volume), carbon dioxide (30-45% by volume), and small amounts of other compounds. In some cases, biogas is upgraded to pure biomethane and utilized as vehicle fuel, instead of fossil fuels, thus reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Biomethane can also serve as a platform chemical in chemical and biochemical synthesis to produce value-added products. The additional positive effects of anaerobic digestion of animal manure and slurries are organic waste degradation, reducing odors, and pathogens. Digestate, obtained as a by-product of anaerobic digestion, is rich in nutrients and therefore is applied as fertilizer in agriculture. Biogas production in Croatia is mainly based on manure and by-products from agriculture, food industry, and slaughterhouses. The obtained biogas is mostly used for electricity and heat generation. Potential for large-scale biogas production in Croatia is still insufficiently used, although various renewable feedstocks are available. More rational and focused management of lignocellulosic residues, animal excrements, food processing by-products, and biodegradable fraction of municipal waste could contribute to the development of Croatian biogas sector. Biogas production in Croatia can be affected by the changes of animal breeding capacity due to the struggle to cope with the European Union (EU) standards and prices. Concerning large unused agricultural areas, great potential lies in their rational exploitation for fast-growing biomass, e.g., for energy crops or perennial grasses. This review will discuss the potential of biogas in the industrial and farming sector, current state of biogas production, and various key drivers and barriers influencing biogas production in Croatia.

AB  - A web-based design evaluation program is developed for the elevated temperature design (ETD) analysis according to the RCC-MRx for Generation IV and fusion reactor systems. The program, named 'HITEP_RCC-MRx,' is composed of two modules: 'HITEP_RCC-DBA,' which computerizes the design-by-analysis (DBA) for class 1 components according to RB-3200 procedures, and 'HITEP_RCC-PIPE,' which computerizes the design-by-rule (DBR) analysis for class 1 piping according to RB-3600 procedures. Each module performs three major design evaluations on load-controlled stress, inelastic strain and creep-fatigue damage in a reliable and efficient way. The program is verified with a number of components and piping systems in sodium test facilities subjected to high temperature loading for the DBA module and the DBR module, respectively. Since HITEP_RCC-MRx is programmed with web-based language, it can operate on a smartphone as well as on a personal computer once it is connected to an internet or WIFI. Comparisons of the ETD codes of RCC-MRx and ASME Section III Subsection NH are made in terms of the programmability and reproduction of the evaluation results. A new creep model proposed for Grade 91 steel is incorporated in the program for comparison of creep behaviors between the creep models of RCC-MRx and the new Garofalo creep model for Grade 91 steel. Comparisons for verification between the evaluation results from HITEP_RCC-MRx and direct calculations using Excel confirm that the HITEP_RCC-MRx performs ETD evaluations in an efficient and reliable way.

AB  - Critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) decrease with elevation, with greater change in CTmin, and the risk to suffer heat and cold stress increasing at the gradient ends. A central prediction is that populations will adapt to the prevailing climatic conditions. Yet, reliable support for such expectation is scant because of the complexity of integrating phenotypic, molecular divergence and organism exposure. We examined intraspecific variation of CTmax and CTmin, neutral variation for 11 microsatellite loci, and micro- and macro-temperatures in larvae from 11 populations of the Galician common frog (Rana parvipalmata) across an elevational gradient, to assess (1) the existence of local adaptation through a P-ST-F-ST comparison, (2) the acclimation scope in both thermal limits, and (3) the vulnerability to suffer acute heat and cold thermal stress, measured at both macro- and microclimatic scales. Our study revealed significant microgeographic variation in CTmax and CTmin, and unexpected elevation gradients in pond temperatures. However, variation in CTmax and CTmin could not be attributed to selection because critical thermal limits were not correlated to elevation or temperatures. Differences in breeding phenology among populations resulted in exposure to higher and more variable temperatures at mid and high elevations. Accordingly, mid- and high-elevation populations had higher CTmax and CTmin plasticities than lowland populations, but not more extreme CTmax and CTmin. Thus, our results support the prediction that plasticity and phenological shifts may hinder local adaptation, promoting thermal niche conservatism. This may simply be a consequence of a coupled variation of reproductive timing with elevation (the "elevation-time axis" for temperature variation). Mid and high mountain populations of R. parvipalmata are more vulnerable to heat and cool impacts than lowland populations during the aquatic phase. All of this contradicts some of the existing predictions on adaptive thermal clines and vulnerability to climate change in elevational gradients.

AB  - Present data and our application of logic do not permit confident rejection of the null hypothesis: Interannual variation in recruitment of marine fishes (typified by certain flatfishes) is independent of ecophysiological factors. Our inability to reject this hypothesis reflects not its likely validity but rather a lack of conceptual structure and appropriate data for realistic evaluation of alternative hypotheses. Therefore, in this paper, we set aside as presently intractable the problem of understanding in any generalizable way the specific effects of environment on interannual variation in marine fish recruitment. Instead, we return to a conceptual scheme first proposed almost 50 years ago by F.E.J. Fry for considering effects of environmental factors on the physiology of fishes. We first extend this scheme to population-level responses, including recruitment, and then even further, to community/ecosystem-level responses. Fry supposed that all of environment can be resolved into five classes of physiological effects-controlling (which set the pace of metabolism), limiting (which constrain maximum metabolism), lethal (which completely interdict metabolism), masking (which increase obligatory metabolic work), and directive (which release and unload metabolism by guiding enviroregulatory responses). We suggest that corresponding effects can be recognized at the levels both of population and community/ecosystem. The key analogy is that environment operates on individuals through metabolism, on populations through recruitment, and on communities/ecosystems through abiotic and biotic diversification. In the context of marine-fish populations, we propose that scope for population increase is the difference between maximum and maintenance recruitment to the spawning stock. Maintenance recruitment is the product of critical spawner density and spawner mortality rate; this product varies with environment as the resultant of controlling effects on the metabolism of individuals, and is increased by loading due to masking factors-e.g, predation-that increase one or both multiplicands. Maximum recruitment is limited by deficiencies of resources, primarily food, but also, potentially, by low spawner density. Population-level lethal factors cause extinction, by reducing population scope to sub-zero values for a time exceeding the generation interval. Directive factors distribute the population in space and time, influencing not only habitat use and zoogeographic range, but also providing context for genetic adaptation and speciation. Exploration of this conceptual scheme from the perspective of flatfish life-history strategies and population dynamics, leads to several testable ecophysiological hypotheses about recruitment.

AB  - (MO)CVD have proven to be the most preferred technology for the fabrications of layers and structures of complex material systems. Since more than 2 decades; this technology is employed as key technology for the development, research and manufacturing of compound semiconductors for optical and high speed electrical devices like HB-LEDs, Laser, HBTs, HEMT etc. The main reason is that the flexibility and productivity with this deposition technology is unrivaled today. Similarly, low manufacturing costs for blue and green high brightness LEDs using the high temperatures process (up to 1200degreesC) for Nitrides are achieved with the introduction of an MOCVD technology with a capacity of up to 24 x 2". But the technological limit of the MOCVD technology in terms of temperature, capacity and application is still not reached today. As example, MOCVD is today used for the large scale deposition technology for SiC materials on 7 x 2" wafers at 1600degreesC. But tools for 4" will be required soon. Also MOCVD is expected to be the technology of choice in the Silicon industry for the next generation of devices like memories using highK dielectrics and ferroelectrics: And why not for the deposition of organic materials for electrical and optical device application?

AB  - This paper introduces a novel hybrid and interactive solar system to generate electricity and produce desalinated water. The system consists of a Stirling engine driven by concentrated solar radiation and cooled by saline water. Also, the system consists of an evacuated evaporator chamber to evaporate the saline water and thermoelectric cooler, driven by Stirling engine, to condensate the distilled water. The novelty of the system is in its positive interactivity since each component and product enhances the performance and productivity of others. The rejected heat from both the cold side of Stirling engine and the hot side of the TEC modules is used to heat the saline water before entering the evaporator. Also, the cold side of the TEC modules is used to enhance the condensation and hence the desalination rate. The importance of the second enhancement technique relays in the fact that many applications do not suffer from the absence of hot evaporative heating sources but suffer from the absence of condensation cool surfaces. A steady-state mathematical model has been proposed and validated by being compared with published data. The results show that at an optimized design point (solar radiation of 700 W/m2, wind speed of 5 m/s, swept volume of 210 cm(3), dish diameter of 2.68 m, etc.), the overall efficiency of the system was 65.8% with a net output power of 506 W and desalinated water of 28 kg/day. Including the TEC system has enhanced the condensation rate from 2.93 kg/day to 34.14 kg/day and the efficiency from 22.84% to 54.87%. Also, the two preheating effects (rejected heat from Stirling engine and from TEC modules) enhance the desalination rate from 2.93 kg/day to 11.74 kg/day and efficiency from 22.84% to 34.53%. Combining both enhancement techniques increase the desalination rate from 2.93 kg/day to 40.96 kg/day and efficiency from 22.84% to 64.44%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Conventional practices of synthesis, manufacturing, and processing have led to severe adverse consequences for living beings and the environment.
   Objectives: Although medications cannot be replaced, the methods of synthesizing, manufacturing, and processing them can be changed and/or replaced. This paper explains the significance of green chemistry practices in the pharmaceutical industry. It emphasizes that we must replace conventional drug synthesis, processing, and manufacturing techniques with greener ones that are cost-effective, sustainable, environment-friendly, and profitable.
   Discussion: This paper comprises five sections. Section 1 is an introduction to green chemistry and its correlation with the pharmaceutical industry. Section 2 discusses the metrics necessary to measure the greenness of a process. Section 3 is about solvents used in the pharmaceutical industry, hazards, safety status, and environmental effects, including the ozone depletion potential. Section 4 explains catalytic amidation reactions because amides are one of the most commonly occurring functional groups with pharmacological activity. Section 5 discusses successful cases of converting conventional synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients and/or their intermediates to greener, sustainable alternatives.
   Conclusion: A balance is necessary between profits, processes, consumers, and the environment to ensure the survival of all stakeholders and decrease the environmental burden of pharmaceuticals. Incentives such as green chemistry awards should be endorsed and encouraged, in addition to making green chemistry part of tertiary education. In addition, changes to rules and regulations for drug approval in the context of green chemistry principles are necessary in order to preserve our planet for future generations.

AB  - Whilst adaptation and phenotypic plasticity might buffer species against habitat degradation associated with global climate change, few studies making such claims also possess the necessary and sufficient data to support them. Doing so requires demonstration of heritable variation in traits affecting fitness under new environmental conditions. We address this issue using an emerging aquatic system to study adaptation to climate change, the crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi), a freshwater species from a region of eastern Australia projected to be affected by marked temperature increases. Captive born M.duboulayi of known pedigree were used to assess the long-term effects of contemporary and 2070-projected summer temperatures on the expression of genes previously identified in a climate change transcriptomics (RNA-Seq) experiment. Nearly all genes responded to increasing temperature. Significant additive genetic variance explained a moderate proportion of transcriptional variation for all genes. Most genes also showed broad-sense genetic variation in transcriptional plasticity. Additionally, molecular pathways of candidate genes co-occur with genes inferred to be under climate-mediated selection in wild M.duboulayi populations. Together, these results indicate the presence of existing variation in important physiological traits, and the potential for adaptive responses to a changing thermal environment.

AB  - Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major disturbance agent in pine (Pinus Linnaeus; Pinaceae) ecosystems of western North America. Adaptation to local climates has resulted in primarily univoltine generation time across a thermally diverse latitudinal gradient. We hypothesised that voltinism patterns have been shaped by selection for slower developmental rates in southern populations inhabiting warmer climates. To investigate traits responsible for latitudinal differences we measured lifestage-specific development of southern mountain pine beetle eggs, larvae, and pupae across a range of temperatures. Developmental rate curves were fit using maximum posterior likelihood estimation with a Bayesian prior to improve fit stability. When compared to previously published data for a northern population, optimal development of southern individuals occurred at higher temperatures, with higher development thresholds, as compared with northern individuals. Observed developmental rates of the southern and northern populations were similar across studied lifestages at 20 degrees C, and southern lifestages were generally faster at temperature extremes (10 degrees C, 27 degrees C). At 25 degrees C southern fourth instars were significantly slower than northern fourth instars. Our results suggest that evolved traits in the fourth instar and remaining unstudied lifestage, teneral (i.e., preemergent) adult, likely influence latitudinal differences in mountain pine beetle generation time.

AB  - The thermal inactivation of selected microbes was studied using the low temperature long time (LTLT), high temperature short time (HTST) and 'pot' pasteurization methods. Survivors were enumerated after heating for up to 40 min for the LTLT and HTST pasteurization methods and after heating for up to 30 min for the 'pot' pasteurization method. With the exception of the Bacillus cereus strain, the selected microbes did not survive the LTLT and HTST pasteurization methods. The results from the 'pot' pasteurizer showed that B. cereus, Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli strains survived the pasteurization conditions applied, showing that the 'pot' pasteurizer does not pasteurize effectively.

AB  - Solar thermal collectors represent a widespread type of system to convert solar energy, The economic viability of applications of solar energy may be improved by increasing the quantity of usable energy delivered per unit area of collector, This is achieved by the use of selective black coatings which have a high degree of solar absorption, maintaining high energy input to the solar system, while simultaneously suppressing the emission of thermal infrared radiation. A new electrolyte has been developed for the deposition of black nickel-cobalt selective absorber coatings useful in solar collectors for photothermal conversion of solar energy. The influence of electrolyte composition and operating parameters on the properties of black nickel-cobalt coatings are reported.

AB  - Impoundment of the Snake River, Washington, has resulted in high water temperatures and late seaward migration of juvenile fall chinook salmon during summer months. To determine if juvenile fall chinook salmon are exposed to temperatures higher than the upper incipient lethal, we tagged groups of fish with temperature-sensing radio tags and tracked them in Little Goose Reservoir on the Snake River during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Spatial and temporal patterns of the reservoir's thermal environment were described using a bathythermograph. Little Goose Reservoir was generally homothermic, and temperatures selected by fish were typically not significantly different from mean water temperatures. No areas of thermal refugia existed in Little Goose Reservoir. Thermal exposure was most influenced by fish residence time in the reservoir within each year and by temperature differences between years. Current augmentation of Snake River summer flows with cold-water releases from Dworshak Dam in Idaho reduces the thermal exposure of juvenile fall chinook salmon by lowering water temperatures up to 4degreesC and may therefore increase their survival. Continued flow augmentation using water from Dworshak Reservoir may be the only mechanism to meet the temperature standard for the lower Snake River.

AB  - Background: An increasing number of ecological processes have been incorporated into Earth system models. However, model evaluations usually lag behind the fast development of models, leading to a pervasive simulation uncertainty in key ecological processes, especially the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle. Traceability analysis provides a theoretical basis for tracking and quantifying the structural uncertainty of simulated C storage in models. Thus, a new tool of model evaluation based on the traceability analysis is urgently needed to efficiently diagnose the sources of inter-model variations on the terrestrial C cycle in Earth system models.
   Methods: A new cloud-based model evaluation platform, i.e., the online traceability analysis system for model evaluation (TraceME v1.0), was established. The TraceME was applied to analyze the uncertainties of seven models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6).
   Results: The TraceME can effectively diagnose the key sources of different land C dynamics among CMIIP6 models. For example, the analyses based on TraceME showed that the estimation of global land C storage varied about 2.4 folds across the seven CMIP6 models. Among all models, IPSL-CM6A-LR simulated the lowest land C storage, which mainly resulted from its shortest baseline C residence time. Over the historical period of 1850-2014, gross primary productivity and baseline C residence time were the major uncertainty contributors to the inter-model variation in ecosystem C storage in most land grid cells.
   Conclusion: TraceME can facilitate model evaluation by identifying sources of model uncertainty and provides a new tool for the next generation of model evaluation.

AB  - Tetraploid of Crassostrea gigas was first reported in the 1990s, but its biological characteristics are seldomly known. To understand the adaptation of tetraploid larvae to salinity and temperature, the effects of salinity treatments (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 psu) and temperature treatments (18, 23 and 28 & DEG;C) on the growth and survival of tetraploid and diploid larvae were comparatively studied. In salinity treatments, the accumulative survival rate (ASR) and relative growth rate (RGR) of tetraploid larvae were generally lower than that of diploid larvae (P < 0.05). The maximum ASR and RGR of tetraploid larvae occurred at 30 psu, with the values of 41.09% and 152.91%, respectively. At day 16, the maximum difference in ASR between diploid and tetraploid larvae was 36.41% at 20 psu, and the maximum difference in RGR of diploid and tetraploid larvae was 62.36% at 10 psu. The ASR and RGR of tetraploid larvae were lower than that of diploid larvae under temperature treatments (P < 0.05). The maximum ASR and RGR of tetraploid larvae occurred at 28 & DEG;C, with the values of 19.67% and 235.40%, respectively. The ASR of both diploid and tetraploid larvae decreased sharply in the first four days. The RGR of larvae at 18 & DEG;C was much lower than that at 23 & DEG;C and 28 & DEG;C (P < 0.05). Hence, a salinity range of 25-30 psu and a temperature range of 23-28 & DEG;C are suitable culture conditions for tetraploid larvae. These results indicate that the natural environment conditions can meet the temperature and salinity requirements for the survival and growth of tetraploid larvae. However, tetraploid larvae are less adaptable to temperature and salinity than diploid larvae. The environmental adaptability of tetraploid needs further improvement.

AB  - Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss is a cold-water aquaculture species, and a thermally selected strain has been developed by multigenerational high-temperature breeding in Japan. We examined the expression of heat-shock proteins as candidates responsible for thermotolerance in rainbow trout using F2 offspring from F1 hybrids produced between thermally selected and normal strains. From F2 offspring, two groups were selected for western blot analysis, namely, low- and high-thermotolerance groups (times to loss of equilibrium were < 30 and a parts per thousand yen60 min, respectively). We demonstrated that the expression levels of Hsp70, Hsp60, and Hsp40 in tail fin tissues were significantly higher in the individuals with high thermotolerance than in those with low thermotolerance under non-heat-shock conditions. In particular, Hsp70 was expressed only in the individuals with high thermotolerance. These results suggest that Hsp70 is a major protein responsible for conferring thermotolerance in rainbow trout.

AB  - In this paper, we report the thermal adaptation of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, characterized as changes in growth parameters. Six clones derived from a single colony of P. pseudoalcaligenes were cultured in two different temperature regimes for 10 months, with three clones forming the control group, cultured at a constant temperature, and another three clones forming the high-temperature (FIT) group, cultured at increasing temperature (from 41 to 47degreesC). Three growth parameters were measured: the lag time (lambda), which is the period between the time of transfer to a new medium and the time when the cell replication starts; the maximum growth rate (mu(m)); and the maximum yield (A). These three parameters are major components of bacterial fitness. The Gompertz and logistic models were used to estimate these three parameters. The two models gave almost identical estimates, but the Gompertz model had R-2 values consistently larger than the logistic model. The HT clones had significantly shorter lambda, but higher mu(m) and A than the control clones when both were grown at the originally stressful temperature of 45degreesC, suggesting significant thermal adaptation. Interestingly, the HT clones grew equally well as the control clones at 35degreesC, i.e. improved performance at 45degreesC was not associated with a reduced performance at 35degreesC.

AB  - Today, plate tectonics is the dominant tectonic style on Earth, but in a hotter Earth tectonics may have looked different due to the presence of more melting and associated compositional buoyancy as well as the presence of a weaker mantle and lithosphere. Here we review the geodynamic constraints on plate tectonics and proposed alternatives throughout Earth's history. Observations suggest a 100-300 degrees C mantle potential temperature decrease since the Archean. The use of this range by theoretical studies, parameterized convection studies, and numerical simulations puts a number of constraints on the viability of the different tectonic styles. The ability to sufficiently cool early Earth with its high radiogenic heat production forms one of the major constraints on the success of any type of tectonics. The viability of plate tectonics is mainly limited by the availability of sufficient driving forces and lithospheric strength. Proposed alternative mechanisms include local or global magma oceans, diapirism, independent dynamics of crust and underlying mantle, and large-scale mantle overturns. Transformation of basaltic crust into dense eclogite is an important driving mechanism, regardless of the governing tectonic style.

AB  - Heavy heat shock treatment (HHS:  37-degrees-C for 2 h, then 4-degrees-C for 1 h, and in this way three times in succession) of males from the isogenic Drosophila line was shown to induce mass transpositions of MGE Dm412 among descendants and multiple ones in separate individuals.  The probabilities of transpositions in control sample and after HHS are equal, correspondingly, to < 3,3.  .10(-4) and 7,2 . 10(-2) transpositions per site, per spermium, per generation.  The <<hot sites>> of transpositions were discovered.  Multisite patterns of the sample (<<HSI haplotypes>>) were shown to be random combinations of independent single-site transpositions.  The <<hot>> HSI haplotypes (66A, 43B-49CD and 43B-49CD-56A-56E) as well as the <<cold>> ones were found.  Real multiplicity of <<hot>> and <<cold>> HSI haplotypes among descendants of separate males is substantially higher (l congruent-to 5 and more) than the expected ones (l = 1).  The hypothesis was formulated which explains this fact and some others by the influence of HSI haplotypes of the spermia fertility, and possibly, on acceleration of generative cells' mitoses.  This results in selective 10-fold increase in such HSI haplotypes portion among male generative cell population.  Minimal probabilities of emergence of separate HSI haplotypes were estimated as 3 .  10(-2) events per chromosome, per genome, per fly generation - for "hot" HSI haplotypes and 3 . 10(-3) for <<cold>> ones.  The chromosomal HSI haplotypes were supposed to arise as single independent events after HHS.  Thus, the phenomenon of transpositions by HHS could be estimated as statistically significant and real.

AB  - The objective of this work is to examine and compare the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of 40MW photovoltaic (PV) power plant and 40MW parabolic trough (PT) power plant to be installed in two different cities, namely Nicosia and Famagusta in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Long term solar radiation and sunshine data for Nicosia and Famagusta are considered and analysed to assess the distribution of solar radiation, sunshine duration, and air temperature. In addition, these two different technologies with same rated power of 40MW will be compared with the performance of the proposed Solar Power Plant at Bari, Italy. The project viability analysis is performed using System Advisor Model (SAM) through Annual Energy Production and economic parameters for both cities. It is found that for the two cities; Nicosia and Famagusta, considered through this study, the PT plants produce more energy than PV plant. It is also observed that installation of the PT system near an existing steam turbine power plant will make the investment more feasible if the steam produced by the PT system is used to run the steam turbine power plant. The high temperatures that are used to produce steam for the turbines in the PT plant system can be supplemented with a secondary plant based on natural gas or other biofuels and can be used as backup. Although the initial investment of PT plant is higher, it has higher economic return and occupies smaller area compared to PV plant of the same capacity.

AB  - Sublethal plant defences, resulting in impaired growth of insect herbivores, may increase the impact of natural enemies upon those herbivores. This study examined whether such effects could be reproduced by chemically altering host growth rates. Fresh residues of piperonyl butoxide (a compound which slows growth in nymphs of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)) showed relatively little toxicity to adults and larvae of the parasitoid Eretmocerus mundus (Mercet), and once residues were 48 h old, they caused no discernible Lethal or behavioral effects on adult wasps. Piperonyl butoxide had lethal effects on whitefly nymphs, but immature parasitoids continued to develop successfully in those hosts that survived. The hypothesis that slowing the growth rate of hosts might lead to increased parasitism by E. mundus was tested on large host populations in controlled temperature cabinets over two generations. On host populations of comparable size, highly significant increases in parasitism (7-8%, P < 0.0001) were observed. This work provides unique evidence that host growth rates can be artificially manipulated to confer advantage to parasitoids, The implications for biological control strategies and an understanding of plant allelochemical effects are discussed, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Single-stranded (ss)RNA viruses are thought to evolve rapidly due to an inherently high mutation rate. However, it remains unclear how ssRNA viruses adapt to novel environments and/or how many and what types of substitutions are needed to facilitate this evolution. In this study, we followed the adaptation of the ssRNA bacteriophage Q beta using thermally adaptedEscherichia colias a host, which can efficiently grow at temperatures between 37.2 and 45.3 degrees C. This made it possible to evaluate Q beta adaptation to the highest known temperature that supports growth, 45.3 degrees C. We found that Q beta was capable of replication at this temperature; within 114 days (similar to 1260 generations), we detected more than 34 novel point mutations in the genome of the thermally adapted Q beta population, representing 0.8% of the total Q beta genome. In addition, we returned the 45.3 degrees C-adapted Q beta populations to 37.2 degrees C and passaged them for 8 days (similar to 124 generations). We found that the reverse-adapted Q beta population showed little to no decrease in fitness. These results indicate that Q beta can evolve in response to increasing temperatures in a short period of time with the accumulation of point mutations.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that structural variants represent an overlooked aspect of genetic variation with consequential evolutionary roles. Among those, copy number variants (CNVs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (TEs), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations. Those mechanisms suppose that CNVs could be used to infer neutral and/or adaptive population genetic structure, whose study has been restricted to microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA and Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in the past and more recently the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Taking advantage of recent developments allowing CNV analysis from RAD-seq data, we investigated how variation in fitness-related traits, local environmental conditions and demographic history are associated with CNVs, and how subsequent copy number variation drives population genetic structure in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We collected 1538 DNA samples from 35 sampling sites in the north Atlantic Ocean and identified 6620 putative CNVs. We found associations between CNVs and the gonadosomatic index, suggesting that six duplicated regions could affect female fitness by modulating oocyte production. We also detected 105 CNV candidates associated with water temperature, among which 20% corresponded to genomic regions located within the sequence of protein-coding genes, suggesting local adaptation to cold water by means of gene sequence amplification. We also identified 175 CNVs associated with the divergence of three previously defined parapatric glacial lineages, of which 24% were located within protein-coding genes, making those loci potential candidates for reproductive isolation. Lastly, our analyses unveiled a hierarchical, complex CNV population structure determined by temperature and local geography, which was in stark contrast to that inferred based on SNPs in a previous study. Our findings underline the complementarity of those two types of genomic variation in population genomics studies.

AB  - Detecting local adaptation and its spatial scale is one of the most important questions of evolutionary biology. However, recognition of the effect of local selection can be challenging when there is considerable environmental variation across the distance at the whole species range. We analyzed patterns of local adaptation in emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, at two spatial scales, small (inter-population distance less than one km) and large (inter-population distance more than 50 km) using several approaches. Plants originating from four distinct habitats at two geographic scales (cold edge, arid edge and two topographically dissimilar core locations) were reciprocally transplanted and their success over time was measured as 1) lifetime fitness in a year of planting, and 2) population growth four years after planting. In addition, we analyzed molecular (SSR) and quantitative trait variation and calculated the Q(ST)/F-ST ratio. No home advantage was detected at the small spatial scale. At the large spatial scale, home advantage was detected for the core population and the cold edge population in the year of introduction via measuring life-time plant performance. However, superior performance of the arid edge population in its own environment was evident only after several generations via measuring experimental population growth rate through genotyping with SSRs allowing counting the number of plants and seeds per introduced genotype per site. These results highlight the importance of multi-generation surveys of population growth rate in local adaptation testing. Despite predominant self-fertilization of T. dicoccoides and the associated high degree of structuring of genetic variation, the results of the Q(ST) - F-ST comparison were in general agreement with the pattern of local adaptation at the two spatial scales detected by reciprocal transplanting.

AB  - The effect of temperature on the developmental period and oviposition of the Tea Rust Mite, Acaphylla theavagrans Kadono, was examined by rearing the mite on tea (Camellia sinensis). The developmental periods from egg to egg on mature tea leaves were 22.4, 16.5, 11.4, 9.3 and 7.7 days at 15 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C, respectively. The developmental zero and total effective temperature for one generation were estimated to be 9.1 degrees C and 137.2 day-degrees, respectively. Oviposition was observed at all tested temperature, and the number of eggs per female increased with increasing temperature. Adult longevity and pre-ovipositional period were shortened with increasing temperature. The fecundity zero, which was estimated by regression analysis on the average number of eggs per oviposited female per day at five different temperature was 8.7 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of natural increase was higher at higher temperatures, and the values were 0.037 and 0.181 at 15 degrees C and 27 degrees C, respectively.

AB  - Our ability to predict ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change requires an understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and range limits. The warming trend over the past half-century has generated numerous opportunities to develop much-needed case studies of these links. Species that are only limited by climatic factors are likely to shift range quickly during periods of warming. Such species directly impact recipient communities and indicate trends that will become more widespread. Because minimum temperature (T-min) is rising at twice the rate of maximum temperature, species with this range-limiting factor may be especially responsive to global warming. In this study, I test the hypothesis that rising T-min has directly affected the range of a skipper butterfly. Atalopedes campestris has moved northward rapidly this century, recently colonizing eastern Washington where January T-min has risen 3degreesC in 50 years. The results show that:
   1. A. campestris' range lies completely within the -4degreesC January average minimum isotherm, and that recently colonized areas were below this threshold earlier this century.
   2. In acute cold stress experiments, -4 to -7degreesC proved to be a critical thermal limit: median supercooling point was -6.3degreesC, and minimum lethal temperature (LT50 with 12-h exposure) was -5.7degreesC.
   3. In chronic cold stress experiments, survivorship declined sharply in diurnally fluctuating thermal regimes typical of the current range edge. High mortality occurred under constant 0degreesC conditions as well as in fluctuating regimes, implying that thermal insulation from snow would not protect A. campestris.
   4. There was no evidence of evolution in cold tolerance at the range margin, despite strong selection. Thus, winter warming was apparently a prerequisite for the range expansion. Characteristics of this species that seem to be associated with its rapid response are that it is an opportunistic species, it is not habitat or dispersal limited, and it is constrained by T-min.

AB  - Drought shapes the distribution and survival of trees even in tropical wet forests, and the wood and leaf trait spectra are used to understand drought adaptations. However, trait variation may result from ontogenetic adjustment or be related to tree size and not reflect evolutionary adaptations. Intraspecific variation in adaptations to drought can be an important factor in a species' distribution and response to climate change, but excluding potentially confounding factors and proving adaptive evolution are challenging. Provenance trials can identify hereditary variability. We analysed wood and leaf traits in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) tree clones from 15 locations in the Amazon basin that were planted in northern Thailand, controlled for tree size, tested for genetic relatedness and the phylogenetic signal in traits and compared trait variations with the climate at the location of origin. Correlations between traits and tree size were low. Intraspecific trait variation was similar to relationships in published among-species comparisons, and correlations among wood traits and correlations among leaf traits were stronger than between wood and leaf traits. Genotype explained 30%-70% of the trait variation, and traits differed in how much of this variation was controlled by location or the relatedness among clones. There was no correlation with mean temperature or total annual rainfall. However, rainfall in the driest quarter (19-199 mm) was strongly related to leaf mass per area, carbon isotopic composition and area-based nitrogen content (r(2) = 0.54-0.70) and weaker to wood traits (vessel density and vessel lumen fraction). Trees from locations with a stronger dry season also had higher growth rates in Thailand. All traits correlating with climate showed a significant phylogenetic signal. We found no evidence of increased drought tolerance, but the trait spectrum and higher growth in trees from drier locations suggest that deciduous rubber trees have adapted via drought avoidance rather than tolerance.

AB  - Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in Drosophila species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen Drosophila species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in D. leontia, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11 degrees 45'- 31 degrees 19'N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (similar to 1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in D. leontia. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (similar to 4-9 h; P<0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=K-SR-C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in D. leontia.

AB  - The ability of coldwater species and populations to respond to temperature increases associated with climate change will depend on the existing adaptive potential within and among populations. Brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis is a valued coldwater species that has been widely stocked across its native range as well as extensively introduced in western North America. We investigated the thermal tolerance of the three primary brook trout hatchery strains used in Ontario (Dickson Lake, Lake Nipigon, and Hill's Lake strains) and the thermal tolerance of a brook trout subspecies, Aurora trout S. fontinalis timagamiensis; all strains were reared in a common hatchery environment. In addition to comparing the strains' responses to acute thermal stress, we also examined variability in temperature tolerance among families within several of these strains. Evidence for significant differences in temperature tolerance was observed both within and among the strains, with Aurora trout showing the least capacity to cope with higher temperatures. The results of this study suggest that thermal performance of brook trout populations will be under substantial selective pressure as water temperatures increase and that strains with existing tolerances for warmer conditions will be better equipped to handle these anticipated changes.

AB  - Background: Enterocin-P of Enterococcus faecium P13 (EntP) is of great interest as a food preservative and medicine due to its non-toxicity and broad antimicrobial spectrum at various pH, as well as its excellent thermal stability. However, recombinant production of EntP is still in laboratory because of low productivity and complex purification process.
   Objectives: In this study, we aimed to develop efficient methods for high-level expression and convenient purification of the recombinant EntP.
   Materials and Methods: An artificially synthesized gene (entP) of 132 bp encoding mature enterocin P of E. faecium P13 was cloned in plasmid pTWIN1 under the control of an inducible T7lac promoter for expression of fusion protein EntP-Mxe GyrA mini-intein-chitin binding domain (CBD) (abbreviated by EntP-Int-CBD) in E. coli. Recombinant EntP was released from the fusion protein by DTT digestion and cleaned by distilled water and checked for anti-bacterial activity.
   Results: The fusion protein was highly expressed in insoluble form in E. coli at 37 degrees C with 0.05 mM IPTG induction. The insoluble fusion protein EntP-Int-CBD was easily prepared by cell sonication and centrifugation to remove soluble contaminants. The repeat washing steps with Triton X-100 were applied to reduce contaminants. After DTT-induced self-digestion in urea 4 M, the EntP released from the fusion protein was insoluble in water and easier to be separated from soluble Int-CBD by centrifugation. The recombinant peptide was soluble in 20% 2-propanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and exhibited strong anti-Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus activities.
   Conclusions: This study is the first report providing a simple, quick and straight forward procedure for heterologous production of functional and pure Enterocin P without using any chromatography columns in the purification process.

AB  - Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) eggs were activated by UV-irradiated diploid sperm of allotetraploid hybrids derived from red crucian carp (a (TM) Euro) x common carp (a (TM),) and then duplicated by cold shock in 4-6A degrees C water for 10-12 min. Different cold shock initiation times resulted in two types of diploid gynogenetic grass carp: meiotic gynogenetic (meiG) and mitotic gynogenetic (mitG). Over a 5-year period, a total of 17,170 meiG and 1,080 mitG fry were produced and 6,862 meiG and 372 mitG grass carp survived. The gynogenetic fish were confirmed by morphological characteristics, chromosome examination, and microsatellite DNA analysis. The morphological traits of the gynogenetic grass carp were similar to those of wild diploid grass carp. Normal gynogenetic fish were identified as diploid with 48 chromosomes by chromosomal metaphases examination, while nonviable abnormal embryos were detected as haploid with 24 chromosomes. Microsatellite DNA analysis indicated that after one generation of gynogenesis, the genetic purity of meiG and mitG grass carp was significantly increased over that of wild grass carp. In addition, both meiG and mitG grass carp groups were 100% female, and 88% of these showed normal ovary development. Thus, the sex determination mechanism in female grass carp was homogamety. The ability to establish pure all-female groups of meiG and mitG grass carp should be a valuable contribution to both fish genetics and grass carp breeding.

AB  - The environment is rarely constant and organisms are exposed to spatial and temporal variation that will impact life-histories. It is important to understand how such variation affects the adaptation of organisms to their local environment. We compare the adaptation of populations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum exposed to constant (23 degrees C or 35 degrees C) and temporally variable temperature environments (random daily fluctuations between 23 degrees C or 35 degrees C). Consistent with theory, our experiment shows the evolution of specialists when evolution proceeds in constant environments and generalists when the environment is temporally variable. In addition, we demonstrate costs for specialists of being locally adapted through reduced fitness in novel environments. Conversely, we do not find any costs for generalists, as all populations from variable environments had equal or superior performance to specialists in their own environment. The lack of a cost for generalists is emphasised by the presence of a super generalist that has the highest performance at both assay temperatures.

AB  - The humidification-dehumidification desalination system is known as an appealing process for small and medium scales, and high-salinity water desalination. These systems consist of humidifier and dehumidifier as the main components, energy sources for heating and electrical energy generation, accessories used for the fluid transfer or efficiency improvement, and measurement/control devices. Different system designs are reported and categorized based on enhancement in productivity, energy consumption and effective parameters such as gained output ratio, specific electrical energy consumption and production cost. According to input energy types and used components, these systems react differently, and the performance parameters change. This literature reviews past/current status and future ideas about humidification-dehumidification systems to pave the way for the researchers to improve this technology. All technologies that improve the humidification-dehumidification system performance via using efficient constitutes, renewable energy, heat recovery via multi-effect and multi-stage processes, accelerating the humidification and dehumidification processes by pressure variation or using heat pump as well as exergy and cost analyses are clarified. It is concluded that despite improving humidification-dehumidification system as a promising process for decentralized small-scale freshwater production applications, it requires further development to improve the system performance based on gained output ratio and economy.

AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSP) are essential molecular chaperones that play important roles in the stress stimulation of insects. Bemisia tabaci, a phloem feeder and invasive species, can cause extensive crop damage through direct feeding and transmission of plant viruses. Here we employed comprehensive genomics approaches to identity HSP superfamily members in the Middle East Asia Minor 1 whitefly genome. In total, we identified 26 Hsp genes, including three Hsp90, 17 Hsp70, one Hsp60 and five sHSP (small heat shock protein) genes. The HSP gene superfamily of whitefly is expanded compared with the other five insects surveyed here. The gene structures among the same families are relatively conserved. Meanwhile, the motif compositions and secondary structures of BtHsp proteins were predicted. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression patterns of BtHsp gene superfamily were diverse across different tissues of whiteflies. Most Hsp genes were induced or repressed by thermal stress (40 degrees C) and cold treatment (4 degrees C) in whitefly. Silencing the expression of BtHsp70-6 significantly decreased the survival rate of whitefly under 45 degrees C. All the results showed the Hsps conferred thermo-tolerance or cold-tolerance to whiteflies that protect them from being affected by detrimental temperature conditions. Our observations highlighted the molecular evolutionary properties and the response mechanism to temperature assaults of Hsp genes in whitefly.

AB  - The traditional batch production of blocked polyisocyanates, key components in the preparation of self-cross-linking resins, has significant drawbacks associated with the exothermic character of the reaction and the high viscosity of some of the materials involved. We have developed a continuous flow strategy for the generation of a methyl ethyl ketoxime-blocked polyisocyanate. The neat oxime and the viscous polyisocyanate were pumped and mixed in continuous flow using a Kenics static mixer. The homogeneous mixture obtained was fully converted to the target blocked polyisocyanate in a residence time unit downstream of the mixer. Real-time reaction monitoring, via in-line Fourier-transform infrared analysis at the reactor outlet, has been implemented, enabling fast optimization of the reaction conditions and providing a sensitive and reliable method to control product quality. The process has been intensified in flow by stepwise increase of the temperature of the residence time unit. Full conversion after only 15 s of overall residence time has been achieved at 155 degrees C, providing a productivity of ca. 1 kg per hour for a reactor of only 4.5 mL volume. The ecological impacts of a conceptualized upscaled flow process compared to the industrial batch procedure have been evaluated by a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) according to the ISO 14040/44 LCA framework. The LCA results illustrate the capabilities of continuous processing to enable more sustainable production of blocked polyisocyanates.

AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is an invasive pest species, first detected in Italy in 2012. Only 2 years after this first detection, increasing damage was reported in fruit orchards in the Emilia Romagna region, the first invaded area, which is one of the most important regions for the Italian and European fruit production. In the present study, life table parameters of H. halys populations were investigated in Italy under typical temperate/Mediterranean climate conditions representative of southern Europe. Our findings indicate that in Italy H. halys has two generations/year and very high reproductive rates for both generations (R-0 = 24.04 and 5.44 for the overwintering and summer generation, respectively). The huge growth rates explain why in 2015 a massive outbreak of H. halys was observed in Italy, and these rates confirm that the pest is a threat for agricultural production in southern Europe. The parameters obtained in this study are essential for the development and optimization of sustainable management strategies.

AB  - Bio-compatible and eco-friendly flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators with transparency are emerging energy devices for next-generation energy application. A novel high performance natural, biodegradable and flexible eggshell membrane - polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) based piezoelectric nanogenerator has been developed using a low-temperature solution and spin coating route. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman patterns exhibited all characteristic signature peaks of the eggshell membrane and PVDF film. Piezoelectric pristine PVDF, eggshell membrane and eggshell membrane-PVDF layered structure based nanogenerators are fabricated using the flexible ITO coated PET substrate and spin coating technique. The fabricated device of eggshell membrane-PVDF layer exhibited better performance with very high output voltage and current of 15 V and 150 nA as compared to 2 V and 20 nA electric output generation from pristine PVDF film based device under same compressive strain, without electric poling. Dielectric properties of piezoelectric PVDF film and eggshell membrane-PVDF were also measured to analyze the working mechanism of the nanogenerator. Hybrid eggshell membrane-PVDF structure shows very high dielectric constant (260) as compared to pristine PVDF (22). A very high output voltage with an average value of 65 V was also obtained from electrical poled hybrid nanogenerator under force of about 10 kgf. Such high piezoelectric output voltage and current from biodegradable eggshell membrane-PVDF based flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator was attributed to dramatic increase in interfacial polarization, capacitance and improved piezoelectric properties of PVDF and triple helical structure created polarization induced electrical dipole moment in the eggshell membrane lattice. The results not only provide a new way to utilize the solid waste for generating green energy from mechanical vibration but also an agent to increase the performance of the PVDF based nanogenerator for powering next generation self-powered implantable medical devices with reduced e-waste elements.

AB  - The elm leaf beetle (ELB) causes severe damage to California's elms. The goal was to develop a management system based on long-term population monitoring for decision making, and environmentally sound control methods. English and Siberian elms with ELB populations in 25 locations from the northeast to the central coast of California were sampled from 1985 to 1990. Population monitoring has indicated that each ELB generation (two to three per season) varies unpredictably in its potential for causing foliage damage. Each generation needs to be sampled and decisions made for control measures most suitable for that generation. From the data base, we have developed a sampling system in which heat accumulation above 11-degrees-C at ELB sites, measured in degree-days, indicates when to sample and, if necessary, when to treat. Sampling elm branch terminals for the presence of ELB eggs during the limited time when egg laying is near its peak provides a cost-effective means of predicting foliage damage, and thus of deciding whether control actions are necessary. Two control options compatible with ELB natural enemies have been tested: trunk banding with Carbaryl and Bacillus thuringiensis foliar sprays. A number of strains of the egg parasitoid Tetrastichus gallerucae have been released and at least one strain has survived over winter. When the number of these parasitoids has increased sufficiently, either through same season releases or from overwintering survival, they have exerted substantial control.

AB  - This paper applies city-specific mortality relationships for extremely hot and cold temperatures for 33 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States to develop mortality projections for historical and potential future climates. These projections, which cover roughly 100 million of 310 million U.S. residents in 2010, highlight a potential change in health risks from uncontrolled climate change and the potential benefits of a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policy. Our analysis reveals that projected mortality from extremely hot and cold days combined increases significantly over the 21st century because of the overwhelming increase in extremely hot days. We also find that the evaluated GHG mitigation policy could substantially reduce this risk. These results become more pronounced when accounting for projected population changes. These results challenge arguments that there could be a mortality benefit attributable to changes in extreme temperatures from future warming. This finding of a net increase in mortality also holds in an analog city sensitivity analysis that incorporates a strong adaptation assumption. While our results do not address all sources of uncertainty, their scale and scope highlight one component of the potential health risks of unmitigated climate change impacts on extreme temperatures and draw attention to the need to continue to refine analytical tools and methods for this type of analysis.

AB  - Embryonic development and morphological characteristics of Japanese devil stinger Inimicus japonicus during early life stage were investigated. Larvae were hatched out 50 h after fertilization at temperature 21 degrees C. Total length of the newly hatched larva was 4.03 mm, the mouth of the larva opened at 3 days after hatching (DAH), and the yolk sac of the larva disappeared at 5 DAH. After hatching, the pectoral fin first developed, then the tail fin, dorsal fin, anal fin and pelvic fin continuously developed, and all fins formed completely at 15 DAH. The metamorphosis was complete at 25 DAH, and the body color and habit of the metamorphosed individuals were different from the larvae. At 30 DAH, the morphology and habit of the juveniles were the same to adults. In order to determine the suitable salinity for larviculture of I. japonicus, salinity tolerance at different early developmental stages was compared in terms of the survival activity index (SAI) and mean survival time (MST). The results indicated that salinity tolerance varied with development stages. The optimum salinity range for newly hatched larvae was 10-25 parts per thousand. Larvae showed low tolerance to low salinity (5 parts per thousand) before the mouth opened, and the suitable salinities for the larvae with open mouth, yolk-sac larvae, post yolk-sac larvae were 10-15 parts per thousand. The flexion larvae showed a wider salinity tolerance with range of 5-20 parts per thousand. After metamorphosis, the juveniles showed a preferable adaptability of salinities of 15-20 parts per thousand. The SAI and MST of individuals at various stages under different salinity conditions were positively correlated.

AB  - Selfish genetic elements that distort the sex ratio are common in arthropods. Theory predicts they will invade and spread to fixation if they are vertically transmitted with perfect fidelity, potentially leading to host extinction. For inherited microorganisms that distort the sex ratio., inefficient vertical transmission or incomplete sex ratio distorting ability is required for host persistence. However, the relative roles of genetic and environmental factors in permitting the survival of male hosts and preventing parasite transmission are poorly understood. We examined the causes of transmission infidelity and male survival for a male-killing Wolbachia strain in Drosophila bifasciata. Under standard laboratory conditions (18 degreesC), in its standard genetic background. males are produced very rarely, and no case of reversion has been observed in 20 generations of laboratory rearing. To investigate the role of host genetic factors, Wolbachia was crossed into 27 different inbred lines of D. bifasciata, but in no case was reversion observed at preferred environmental temperatures. The role of elevated temperature in inducing inefficient transmission was examined. Whilst vertical transmission was perfect over three generations of maintenance at 23.5 degrees. transmission infidelity was observed at 25 degrees. We conclude that there is no evidence for the presence of either fixed or polymorphic host genes that repress transmission at standard environmental temperatures. However, severe temperature treatment does make vertical transmission imperfect. We suggest that the case of Wolbachia in D. bifasciata is one that is naturally balanced. the population being maintained polymorphic without the evolution of host resistance genes.

AB  - We describe the design, construction, and pilot operation of a Mars simulation facility comprised of a cryogenic environmental chamber, an atmospheric gas analyzer, and a xenon/mercury discharge source for UV generation. The Mars Environmental Simulation Chamber (MESCH) consists of a double-walled cylindrical chamber. The double wall provides a cooling mantle through which liquid N-2 can be circulated. A load-lock system that consists of a small pressure-exchange chamber, which can be evacuated, allows for the exchange of samples without changing the chamber environment. Fitted within the MESCH is a carousel, which holds up to 10 steel sample tubes. Rotation of the carousel is controlled by an external motor. Each sample in the carousel can be placed at any desired position. Environmental data, such as temperature, pressure, and UV exposure time, are computer logged and used in automated feedback mechanisms, enabling a wide variety of experiments that include time series. Tests of the simulation facility have successfully demonstrated its ability to produce temperature cycles and maintain low temperature ( down to -140 degrees C), low atmospheric pressure (5-10 mbar), and a gas composition like that of Mars during long-term experiments.

AB  - Trees provide ecosystem services that counter negative effects of urban habitats on human and environmental health. Unfortunately, herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant on urban than rural trees, reducing tree growth, survival, and ecosystem services. Previous research where vegetation complexity was reduced has attributed elevated urban pest abundance to decreased regulation by natural enemies. However, reducing vegetation complexity, particularly the density of overstory trees, also makes cities hotter than natural habitats. We ask how urban habitat characteristics influence an abiotic factor, temperature, and a biotic factor, natural enemy abundance, in regulating the abundance of an urban forest pest, the gloomy scale, (Melanaspis tenebricosa). We used a map of surface temperature to select red maple trees (Acer rubrum) at warmer and cooler sites in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. We quantified habitat complexity by measuring impervious surface cover, local vegetation structural complexity, and landscape scale vegetation cover around each tree. Using path analysis, we determined that impervious surface (the most important habitat variable) increased scale insect abundance by increasing tree canopy temperature, rather than by reducing natural enemy abundance or percent parasitism. As a mechanism for this response, we found that increasing temperature significantly increases scale insect fecundity and contributes to greater population increase. Specifically, adult female M. tenebricosa egg sets increased by approximately 14 eggs for every 1 degrees C increase in temperature. Climate change models predict that the global climate will increase by 2-3 degrees C in the next 50-100 years, which we found would increase scale insect abundance by three orders of magnitude. This result supports predictions that urban and natural forests will face greater herbivory in the future, and suggests that a primary cause could be direct, positive effects of wauning on herbivore fitness rather than altered trophic interactions.

AB  - The massive die-off of the long-spined sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, a significant reef grazer, in the mid 1980s was followed by phase shifts from coral dominated to macroalgae dominated reefs in the Caribbean. While Diadema populations have recovered in some reefs with concomitant increases in coral cover, the additional threat of increasing temperatures due to global climate change has not been investigated in adult sea urchins. In this study, I measured acute thermal tolerance of Diadema antillarum and that of a sympatric sea urchin not associated with coral cover, Echinometra lucunter, over winter, spring, and summer, thus exposing them to substantial natural thermal variation. Animals were taken from the wild and placed in laboratory tanks in room temperature water (similar to 22 degrees C) that was then heated at 0.16-0.3 degrees C min(-1) and the righting behavior of individual sea urchins was recorded. I measured both the temperature at which the animal could no longer right itself (T-LoR) and the righting time at temperatures below the T-LoR. In all seasons, Diadema antillarum exhibited a higher mean T-LoR than Echinometra lucunter. The mean T-LoR of each species increased with increasing environmental temperature revealing that both species acclimatize to seasonal changes in temperatures. The righting times of Diadema antillarum were much shorter than those of Echinometra lucunter. The longer relative spine length of Diadema compared to that of Echinometra may contribute to their shorter righting times, but does not explain their higher T-LoR. The thermal safety margin (the difference between the mean collection temperature and the mean TLoR) was between 3.07-3.66 degrees C for Echinometra and 3.79-5.67 degrees C for Diadema. While these thermal safety margins exceed present day temperatures, they are modest compared to those of temperate marine invertebrates. If sea temperatures increase more rapidly than can be accommodated by the sea urchins (either by genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, or both), this will have important consequences for the structure of coral reefs.

AB  - Commercial fishing is an important socio-economic activity in coastal regions of the UK and Ireland. Oceanatmospheric changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions are likely to affect future fish and shellfish production, and lead to increasing challenges in ensuring long-term sustainable fisheries management. The paper reviews existing knowledge and understanding of the exposure of marine ecosystems to ocean-atmospheric changes, the consequences of these changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, and the adaptability of the UK and Irish fisheries sector. Ocean warming is resulting in shifts in the distribution of exploited species and is affecting the productivity of fish stocks and underlying marine ecosystems. In addition, some studies suggest that ocean acidification may have large potential impacts on fisheries resources, in particular shell-forming invertebrates. These changes may lead to loss of productivity, but also the opening of new fishing opportunities, depending on the interactions between climate impacts, fishing grounds and fleet types. They will also affect fishing regulations, the price of fish products and operating costs, which in turn will affect the economic performance of the UK and Irish fleets. Key knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the implications of climate and ocean chemistry changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, particularly on the social and economic responses of the fishing sectors to climate change. However, these gaps should not delay climate change mitigation and adaptation policy actions, particularly those measures that clearly have other co-benefits.

AB  - Effects of temperature on egg, larval and pupal developmental times of the leek moth were examined at five constant temperatures ranging from 12 to 20 degreesC. Using this data, a linear degree-day model for the leek moth was developed. The model gave the threshold temperature of T-h = 6 degreesC, and 630 degree-days were required above the threshold temperature, to complete the development of the leek moth. To validate the model in the field, flight activity during the summers of 1998 and 1999 was studied using pheromone traps. If the summer is warm the leek moth can have two generations per year in Sweden, but the probability of completing two generations within leek plantations is very limited. The likelihood of the leek moth becoming a pest is highly dependent on access to alternative host plants for the first generation of leek moths.

AB  - Experimental evolution of bacterial populations in the laboratory has led to identification of several themes, including parallel evolution of populations adapting to carbon starvation, heat stress, and pH stress. However, most of these experiments study growth in defined and/or constant environments. We hypothesized that while there would likely continue to be parallelism in more complex and changing environments, there would also be more variation in what types of mutations would benefit the cells. In order to test our hypothesis, we serially passaged Escherichia coli in a complex medium (Luria-Bertani broth) throughout the five phases of bacterial growth. This passaging scheme allowed cells to experience a wide variety of stresses, including nutrient limitation, oxidative stress, and pH variation, and therefore allowed them to adapt to several conditions. After every similar to 30 generations of growth, for a total of similar to 300 generations, we compared both the growth phenotypes and genotypes of aged populations to the parent population. After as few as 30 generations, populations exhibit changes in growth phenotype and accumulate potentially adaptive mutations. There were many genes with mutant alleles in different populations, indicating potential parallel evolution. We examined 8 of these alleles by constructing the point mutations in the parental genetic background and competed those cells with the parent population; five of these alleles were found to be adaptive. The variety and swiftness of adaptive mutations arising in the populations indicate that the cells are adapting to a complex set of stresses, while the parallel nature of several of the mutations indicates that this behavior may be generalized to bacterial evolution.
   IMPORTANCE With a growing body of work directed toward understanding the mechanisms of evolution using experimental systems, it is crucial to decipher what effects the experimental setup has on the outcome. If the goal of experimental laboratory evolution is to elucidate underlying evolutionary mechanisms and trends, these must be demonstrated in a variety of systems and environments. Here, we perform experimental evolution in a complex medium allowing the cells to transition through all five phases of growth, including death phase and long-term stationary phase. We show that the swiftness of selection and the specific targets of adaptive evolution are different in this system compared to others. We also observe parallel evolution where different mutations in the same genes are under positive natural selection. Together, these data show that while some outcomes of microbial evolution experiments may be generalizable, many outcomes will be environment or system specific.

AB  - Animal migrations track predictable seasonal patterns of resource availability and suitable thermal habitat. As climate change alters this 'energy landscape', some migratory species may struggle to adapt. We examined how climate variability influences movements, thermal habitat selection and energy intake by juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) during seasonal foraging migrations in the California Current. We tracked 242 tuna across 15 years (2002-2016) with high-resolution archival tags, estimating their daily energy intake via abdominal warming associated with digestion (the 'heat increment of feeding'). The poleward extent of foraging migrations was flexible in response to climate variability, allowing tuna to track poleward displacements of thermal habitat where their standard metabolic rates were minimized. During a marine heatwave that saw temperature anomalies of up to +2.5 degrees C in the California Current, spatially explicit energy intake by tuna was approximately 15% lower than average. However, by shifting their mean seasonal migration approximately 900 km poleward, tuna remained in waters within their optimal temperature range and increased their energy intake. Our findings illustrate how tradeoffs between physiology and prey availability structure migration in a highly mobile vertebrate, and suggest that flexible migration strategies can buffer animals against energetic costs associated with climate variability and change.

AB  - The rapidly expanding fields of bioelectronics, and biological interfaces with electronic sensors and stimulators, are placing an increasing demand on candidate materials to serve as robust surfaces that are both biocompatible, stable and electroconductive. Amongst conductive polymers, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a promising material in biomedical research due to its appropriate stability and high conductivity, however its intrinsic solubility requires a crosslinking process that can limit its conductivity and biocompatibility. Poly(ethylene glycol) is known to be a suitably anti-immunogenic moiety and its derivatives have been widely used for biomedical applications. In this study we investigate the application of poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether (PEGDE) as an effective crosslinker and conductive filler for PEDOT:PSS. From our interpretation of XPS analysis we hypothesise that the crosslinking reaction is occurring via the epoxy ring of PEGDE interacting with the sulfonic groups of excel PSS chains, which reaches a saturation at 3 w/v% PEGDE concentration. PEGDE crosslinked films did not disperse in aqueous environments, had enhanced electrical conductivity and imparted a significant degree of hydrophilicity to PEDOT:PSS films. This hydrophilicity and the presence of biocompatible PEGDE led to good cell viability and a significantly increased degree of cell spreading on PEDOT:PSS films. In comparison to widely reported chemical crosslinking via glycidoxy propyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS), this original crosslinking yields a highly hydrophilic 2D film substrate with increased electroconductive and biocompatibility properties, resulting in a next-generation formulation for bioengineering applications.

AB  - Theoretical approaches to crystallisation process development were tested on a pharmaceutical development compound and resulted in a well-behaved crystallisation. The crystallisation type was selected from thermal data. Yield and productivity were fixed from the solubility curve. Solution eutectic data were used to set the specification of enantiomeric purity for the input material. Agitation and cooling parameters were established using scale-down laboratory trials. Heat transfer was the rate-limiting step for crystal growth. In-tine technology was beneficial in the laboratory but not necessary on scale-up.

CP  - International Water Resources Engineering Conference
AB  - Dramatic declines in winter-run chinook salmon populations has resulted in their listing as a protected species, in 1989, under the Federal and California State Endangered Species Acts. One of several factors limiting salmon populations is egg and fry mortality associated with elevated water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River. Since 1987, water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River have been managed to protect endangered salmon species by releasing deeper, colder water from Shasta Lake using the low-level outlet works. However, these releases bypassed the power plant so hydroelectric generation was greatly reduced. For example, bypass releases from 1987 through 1996 have an estimated combined cost of $63 million in replacement power costs. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), passed in 1992, elevated fish and wildlife protection and restoration to equal importance with the original project objectives of flood control, irrigation, navigation, and power production. As part of the CVPIA, Reclamation was ordered to construct and operate a temperature control device (TCD) at Shasta Dam which would control release water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River to minimize Salmon mortality. The TCD was designed to selectively withdraw water from Shasta Lake over a wide range of levels to meet water temperature targets in the upper Sacramento River. Shasta TCD operations will improve the control of river temperature, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen which will significantly improve the spawning and rearing success of the winter, fall, and spring chinook salmon runs. During the first summer of operation, the Shasta TCD allowed project operators to meet water quality standards while continuing to fulfill contractual obligations for water delivery and power generation. This paper will summarize the TCD's selective withdrawal performance during its first year of operation.

AB  - The question of species survival and evolution in heterogeneous environments has long been a subject for study. Indeed, it is often difficult to identify the molecular basis of adaptation to contrasted environments, and nongenetic effects increase the difficulty to disentangle fixed effects, such as genetic adaptation, from variable effects, such as individual phenotypic plasticity, in adaptation. Nevertheless, this question is also of great importance for understanding the evolution of species in a context of climate change. The red coral (Corallium rubrum) lives in the Mediterranean Sea, where at depths ranging from 5 to 600m, it meets very contrasted thermal conditions. The shallowest populations of this species suffered from mortality events linked with thermal anomalies that have highlighted thermotolerance differences between individuals. We provide here a new transcriptomic resource, as well as candidate markers for the study of local adaptation. We sequenced the transcriptome of six individuals from 5m and six individuals from 40m depth at the same site of the Marseilles bay, after a period of common garden acclimatization. We found differential expression maintained between the two depths even after common garden acclimatization, and we analysed the polymorphism pattern of these samples. We highlighted contigs potentially implicated in the response to thermal stress, which could be good candidates for the study of thermal adaptation for the red coral. Some of these genes are also involved in the response to thermal stress in other corals. Our method enables the identification of candidate loci of local adaptation useful for other nonmodel organisms.

AB  - The presence of shale oil in the Cretaceous Hengtongshan Formation in the Tonghua Basin, drilled by the well TD-01, has been discussed in this geological investigation for the first time. To evaluate the high-quality source rocks of Cretaceous continental shale oil, the distribution characteristics and the evolution of the ancient environment, samples of shale were systematically analyzed in terms of sedimentary facies, organic geochemistry, and organic carbon isotopic composition. The results demonstrate that a TOC value of 1.5% represents the lower-limit TOC value of the high-quality source rocks. Source rocks have an aggregate thickness of 211 m and contain abundant organic matter, with TOC values of 2.69% on average and a maximum value over 5.44%. The original hydrocarbon-generative potential value (S-1+S-2) is between 0.18 mg/g and 6.13 mg/g, and the R-o is between 0.97% and 1.40%. The thermal maturation of the source rocks is relatively mature to highly mature. The C-13 value range is between -34.75 parts per thousand and -26.53 parts per thousand. The ratio of saturated hydrocarbons to aromatic hydrocarbons is 1.55 to 5.24, with an average of 2.85, which is greater than 1.6. The organic types are mainly type II1, followed by type I. The organic carbon source was C-3 plants and hydrophytes. The paleoclimate of the Hengtongshan Formation can be characterized as hot and dry to humid, and these conditions were conducive to the development of high-quality source rocks. A favorable paleoenvironment and abundant organic carbon sources provide a solid hydrocarbon generation base for the formation and accumulation of oil and gas in the shale of the Tonghua Basin.

AB  - The tectonic modes operating at any given time in the Earth are intimately related to the thermal evolution, since tectonics is driven by heat removal from the Earth's interior. Conversely, the viability of a proposed tectonic mode depends on its ability to remove heat from the interior as well as on its inferred consistency with geological evidence. On this basis it seems that plate tectonics may have been dominant only in the later part of Earth history, and that proposed earlier modes involving only a subcrustal thermal boundary layer may never have been dominant unless the effects of the basalt-eclogite transition or of latent heat removal were able to enhance their heat transport efficiency. More generally, the tectonic mode driven by the cool thermal boundary layer at the top of the mantle may have depended very sensitively on the effects of composition and latent heat on density.
   Calculations indicate that plumes could Nave operated through most of Earth history at about the present level of activity, unless heat conduction from the core into the mantle has been inhibited in later times, in which case they would have been hotter and more active in earlier times. Plumes could not have substituted for plate tectonics because plumes and plates are driven by different thermal boundary layers that operate largely independently.

AB  - A critical requirement for both next generation conventional and nuclear plants is the development of simplified inelastic design and fitness for purposes procedures that give a reasonably accurate prediction of the complex multi-axial time dependent stress strain behavior. The accumulation of this inelastic strain in the form of coupled creep-fatigue damage over time is one of the principal damage mechanisms which will eventually lead to crack initiation in critical high temperature equipment. Two main procedures that address creep-fatigue loading are generally used, either a time fraction or a ductility exhaustion approach. It is generally accepted that these methods enable conservative predictions within a factor of 2 to 3 and hence are reliable methods for code based design and fitness for purpose type assessments. However, for complex cycles, this may not be the case, for example prior relaxation cycles are found to accelerate the creep rupture of the material with the result that a significant reduction in creep life can be observed. An investigation was undertaken into the influence of prior relaxation on resultant failure using a typical low alloy ferritic power station steel. Both time based and strain based methods were used to predict the damage caused by the stress relaxation cycles followed by operation at steady state. The predictions found that while ductility exhaustion methodologies based on mean properties where adequate in predicting the failure life, time fraction methods were found to be extremely non-conservative for mean properties and only lower bound solutions provided an estimate of remaining creep life. The Monkman-Grant approach resulted in predictions that erred on the conservative side. The results have implications for both current and future conventional and nuclear power stations as it may be difficult for time based approaches to accurately account for complex cycling, shakedown conditions or stress relaxation at welds.

AB  - There is a growing consensus on the influences of heat waves and increased temperature as among the most threatening climate change phenomena to human mortality. In addition, the effect of heat waves is exacerbated significantly in cities as a result of urban heat islands effect. Such intensification of heat waves combined by potentially prolonged periods of extreme temperature will pose huge risks on human mortality in the built environment. Over the past decade, a number of metrics in literature have been developed to assess human thermal risks and their response to extreme climate conditions. However, most of these metrics take into account socioeconomic factors, housing characteristics and climatic risks without looking at the spatial characteristics across the city. Yet, the combination of these factors on an urban resolution haven't been largely explored yet, specifically for vulnerable population with low access to adaptation resources and minimum potentials for ventilation. The paper presents the framework of an urban vulnerability index based on identifying parameters that correlate with thermal discomfort on urban block level and building level. The study analyzes a historical residential neighborhood in Cairo, Egypt to examine the applicability of the proposed index in understanding levels of vulnerability under extreme temperatures.

AB  - Solar radiation is a major source of heat for open-cup passerine nestlings, and a key variable influencing parental nest site selection. Although temperature, like food, is critical for nestling growth and survival, the use of thermal and insolation gradients when describing passerine nestling orientation and movement within the open-cup nest has not been explored. Our study used the Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) as a model system to directly test the hypothesis that passerine nestlings mitigate thermal extremes behaviourally. Pairs of nestlings were tested in shaded (homogeneous) and exposed (heterogeneous) nests. movements within nests were tracked and nest temperatures recorded. Our results show that nestlings are able to detect and respond to nanoclimate heterogeneity, and can mitigate short-term radiant heat loads through shade-seeking. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial population heterogeneity contributes to differences in stress response between individual cells in a population, and can lead to the selection of genetically stable variants with increased stress resistance. We previously provided evidence that the multiple-stress resistant Listeria monocytogenes LO28 variant 15, carries a point mutation in the rpsU gene, resulting in an arginine-proline substitution in ribosomal protein RpsU (RpsU17Arg-Pro). Here, we investigated the trade-off between general stress sigma factor SigB-mediated stress resistance and fitness in variant 15 using experimental evolution. By selecting for higher fitness in two parallel evolving cultures, we identified two evolved variants: 15EV1 and 15EV2. Whole genome sequencing and SNP analysis showed that both parallel lines mutated in the same codon in rpsU as the original mutation resulting in RpsU17Pro-His (15EV1) and RpsU17Pro-Thr (15EV2). Using a combined phenotyping and proteomics approach, we assessed the resistance of the evolved variants to both heat and acid stress, and found that in both lines reversion to WT-like fitness also resulted in WT-like stress sensitivity. Proteome analysis of L. monocytogenes LO28 WT, variant 15, 15EV1, and 15EV2 revealed high level expression of SigB regulon members only in variant 15, whereas protein profiles of both evolved variants were highly similar to that of the LO28 WT. Experiments with constructed RpsU17Arg-Pro mutants in L. monocytogenes LO28 and EGDe, and RpsU17Arg-His and RpsU17Arg-Thr in LO28, confirmed that single amino acid substitutions in RpsU enable switching between multiple-stress resistant and high fitness states in L. monocytogenes.

AB  - Dock Village terrain is, as its name implies, a region that contains settlements reminiscent of docks, in terms of their elongated shape, their outward upward tilt, and their location in the center of low, wide valleys. Dock village terrain features deep, fertile soil suitable for farming. Taihu Lake contains a number of classic examples of dock villages. Dock villages are relatively independent and hidden, characteristics that not only play a role in security and defense, but also, more importantly, are associated with enhanced climate adaptability, a relative lack of cold weather, and equable levels of heat and humidity. The dock village reflects the wisdom and distillation of traditional Chinese ecological practices and is highly valued as a research topic. Based on microclimate theory and ENVI-met software, four microclimate indices, namely, air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and relative humidity, were simulated and analyzed in this study. The correlation between spatial characteristics and microclimate was studied from four perspectives: plane space, cross-section space, vertical section space, and linear development space. This research summarizes the historical context and evolution of the dock village spatial form in the construction of contemporary human settlements. It also provides scientific suggestions for the protection and sustainable development of ancient villages.

AB  - Aim Phylogeographical breaks' often occur at biogeographical province boundaries, suggesting common causative factors. Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on the US Atlantic coast, separates water masses of sharply differing temperature and divides the Virginian and Carolinian provinces, but has not often been detected as a phylogeographical break. We studied the black sea bass, Centropristis striata (Linnaeus, 1758), a species with philopatric adults but long-lived planktonic larvae. An earlier study of only two Atlantic populations, and lower-resolution mitochondrial RFLP markers, showed strong separation between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, but not across Cape Hatteras. Location Over 300 adults were collected from populations from the Gulf of Mexico, the US south Atlantic (North Carolina south of Cape Hatteras, the east coast of Florida, and South Carolina), and the US mid-Atlantic (North Carolina north of Cape Hatteras, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey and Massachusetts). Methods We sequenced the mitochondrial control region, analysed DNA sequence and haplotype frequency differentiation and haplotype networks, and performed coalescent analyses of population sizes and migration rates. Results Sequences formed three clusters - Gulf of Mexico, south Atlantic and mid-Atlantic - the Atlantic clusters being divided at Cape Hatteras. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 31% of sequence variation was between populations on opposite sides of Cape Hatteras, while only 5% was between populations on the same side, yet migrate analysis detected asymmetric migration across the Cape, greater from north to south than in the opposite direction. A transitional population with roughly equal frequencies of south and mid-Atlantic haplotypes occupied a narrow stretch between Cape Hatteras and the Virginia border. Main conclusions Strong barriers to gene flow exist between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, and across Cape Hatteras. Adult migratory and spawning behaviours that separate mid-Atlantic and south Atlantic populations, limited larval exchange, and selection imposed by thermal gradients are each potentially responsible. In addition, these data indicate that fishery stocks of black sea bass north and south of Cape Hatteras are genetically distinct, supporting their separate management.

AB  - Timing of plant life cycle events (phenology) and annual plant productivity represent key interactions between the climate system and the biosphere, with implications and feedbacks for climate and ecosystem functions. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system is a dominant source of interannual climate variability in the western United States, with important effects on temperature, precipitation, and drought. In this study, we examine the connection between ENSO and terrestrial vegetation dynamics using MOD17 annual net primary productivity (NPP) and land surface phenology derived from MODIS and AVHRR vegetation indices. Three phenology metrics-start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LOS)-were estimated separately for El Nino and La Nina years by fitting difference logistic functions to split-sample time series of the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (for the period 2000-2011) and AVHRR-derived 3rd generation GIMMS NDVI (NDVI3g) for two temporal periods (2000-2011 and 1982-2011). El Nino events were associated with a significantly earlier SOS than La Nina events in most regions of the western U.S. ENSO-related differences in timing of the end of growing season were generally smaller and more heterogeneous. ENSO impacts on total length of the growing season tended to be spatially heterogeneous but mostly positive in El Nino years. Relative to La Nina events, El Nino events were generally associated with significantly higher NPP in each ecoregion (with mean differences ranging from 2 to 45 gC m(-2) year(-1)). The correlation between total annual production and the Southern Oscillation Index was highest in mid- to late-winter prior to the growing season, suggesting some predictive power in advance of the growing season. These results suggest that future intensification of the ENSO system could have serious consequences for terrestrial ecosystems in the western U.S., especially in regions where ENSO already has a strong impact on interannual climate variability and vegetation dynamics.

AB  - Accurate prediction of phenological development in maize (Zea mays L.) is fundamental to determining crop adaptation and yield potential. A number of thermal functions are used in crop models, but their relative precision in predicting maize development has not been quantified. The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the precision of eight thermal functions, (ii) to assess the effects of source data on the ability to differentiate among thermal functions, and (iii) to attribute the precision of thermal functions to their response across various temperature ranges. Data sets used in this study represent >1000 distinct maize hybrids, >50 geographic locations, and multiple planting dates and years. Thermal functions and calendar days were evaluated and grouped based on their temperature response and derivation as empirical linear, empirical nonlinear, and process-based functions. Precision in predicting phase durations from planting to anthesis or silking and from silking to physiological maturity was evaluated. Large data sets enabled increased differentiation of thermal functions, even when smaller data sets contained orthogonal, multi-location and -year data. At the highest level of differentiation, precision of thermal functions was in the order calendar days < empirical linear < process based < empirical nonlinear. Precision was associated with relatively low temperature sensitivity across the 10 to 26 degrees C range. In contrast to other thermal functions, process-based functions were derived using supra-optimal temperatures, and consequently, they may better represent the developmental response of maize to supra-optimal temperatures. Supra-optimal temperatures could be more prevalent under future climate-change scenarios, but data sets in this study contained few data in that range.

AB  - 1. The current controversy over the possible commercial-scale cultivation of genetically modified crops in Europe presents enormous challenges for the science of ecology. In little more than a decade, ecology has come to occupy centre stage in a very heated public debate.
   2. In outlining the challenge to ecology I discuss some of the key elements in the GM debate, and trace the growing importance of ecological questions within the regulatory and advisory system in the UK. The need to understand, and predict, some of the potential wider environmental impact of genetically modified (GM) crops has both driven changes in the regulations and led directly to farm-scale evaluation of herbicide-tolerant crops.
   3. Several examples illustrate how ecological science is being used, and abused, in the public debate and in the provision of advice to regulators. In particular short-term or laboratory studies identifying possible hazards or impacts often receive widespread media attention but the thorough ecological field-based studies which either evaluate exposure to a hazard or assess fitness over several generations are rarely carried out, or, in the classic case of the impact of Bt maize on the Monarch butterfly, pass almost unnoticed.
   4. It is increasingly important that trained ecologists become involved in the public debate. The challenge of dealing with the problems of variability, complexity and uncertainty, and of developing the necessary predictive tools for risk assessment, bring with it a huge responsibility, not only to be clear about the limitations of our science, but to recognise and acknowledge the boundary between science and informed opinion.

AB  - Disinfection processes aim at reducing the number of viable cells through the generation of damages in different cellular structures and molecules. Since disinfection involves unspecific mechanisms, some microbial populations may be selected due to resilience to treatment and/or to high post-treatment fitness. In this study, the bacterial community composition of secondarily treated urban wastewater and of surface water collected in the intake area of a drinking water treatment plant was compared before and 3-days after disinfection with ultraviolet radiation, ozonation or photocatalytic ozonation. The aim was to assess the dynamics of the bacterial communities during regrowth after disinfection.
   In all the freshly collected samples, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla (40-50% and 20-30% of the reads, respectively). Surface water differed from wastewater mainly in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (17% and <5% of the reads, respectively). After 3-days storage at light and room temperature, disinfected samples presented a shift of Gammaproteobacteria (from 8 to 10% to 33-65% of the reads) and Betaproteobacteria (from 14 to 20% to 31-37% of the reads), irrespective of the type of water and disinfection process used. Genera such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter or Rheinheimera presented a selective advantage after water disinfection. These variations were not observed in the non-disinfected controls. Given the ubiquity and genome plasticity of these bacteria, the results obtained suggest that disinfection processes may have implications on the microbiological quality of the disinfected water.

AB  - Micro-cogeneration (mCHP) is a promising solution for the generation of heat and electricity in households, it contributes to reducing carbon dioxide emissions in countries where the production of electricity is mainly based on fossil fuels. Its dissemination in Poland faces barriers in the form of high purchase prices in relation to electricity productivity. In this work 1% of the household population in Poland was analyzed using the Monte Carlo method. It was found that for mCHP to become economically profitable for a group of at least 10,000 households, its price should fall from around 18,000 euros (711.5 euros/kW(th)and 18,000 euros/kW(e)) to 4800 euros (189.7 euros/kW(th)and 4800 euros/kW(e)) and for 100,000 households to 4100 euros (162.1 euros/kW(th)and 4100 euros/kW(e)). These calculations were made for fixed gas and electricity prices. The analysis also included cases of various changes in gas and energy prices. Faster growth of electricity prices than gas prices reduce the profitability barrier. In addition, a building located in Lesser Poland region was analyzed, with an above average demand for electricity and heat. Gas micro-cogeneration becomes profitable for this household at a price of 3700 euros (146.2 euros/kW(th)and 3700 euros/kW(e)) at fixed gas and electricity prices.

AB  - Mitochondria are playing key roles in setting the thermal limits of fish, but how these organelles participate in selection mechanisms during extreme thermal events associated with climate warming in natural populations is unclear. Here, we investigated the thermal effects on mitochondrial metabolism, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial gene expression in cardiac tissues of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) collected from an artificially heated ecosystem, the "Biotest enclosure", and an adjacent reference area in the Baltic sea with normal temperatures (similar to 23 degrees C and similar to 16 degrees C, respectively, at the time of capture in summer). Fish were sampled one month after a heat wave that caused the Biotest temperatures to peak at similar to 31.5 degrees C, causing significant mortality. When assayed at 23 degrees C, Biotest perch maintained high mitochondrial capacities, while reference perch displayed depressed mitochondrial functions relative to measurements at 16 degrees C. Moreover, mitochondrial gene expression of nd4 (mitochondrial subunit of complex I) was higher in Biotest fish, likely explaining the increased respiration rates observed in this population. Nonetheless, cardiac tissue from Biotest perch displayed higher levels of oxidative damage, which may have resulted from their chronically warm habitat, as well as the extreme temperatures encountered during the preceding summer heat wave. We conclude that eurythermal fish such as perch are able to adjust and maintain mitochondrial capacities of highly aerobic organs such as the heart when exposed to a warming environment as predicted with climate change. However, this might come at the expense of exacerbated oxidative stress, potentially threatening performance in nature.

AB  - Extreme high-speed laser material deposition (EHLA) can be utilized for mass customization owing to its enhanced process speed and productivity. Although EHLA has multiple similarities with additive manufacturing techniques such as conventional laser metal deposition (LMD), the variation in the process speed causes different phase transformations and residual stress distributions. Therefore, a combined heat source model is proposed to evaluate the performance of structures repaired by EHLA and optimize process strategies. The model considers the unique energy input associated with the densification process compared with that of the conventionally used Gaussian heat source model. The parameters within the model were calibrated based on the residual stress distribution and molten pool morphology. The evolution of temperature and residual stress was investigated under various process conditions such as scanning speed and power input using the model. The consistency between the simulation and experimental results verified the viability of the model for determining EHLA parameters and improving the performance of repaired parts.

AB  - Unraveling adaptive genetic variation represents, in addition to the estimate of population demographic parameters, a cornerstone for the management of aquatic natural living resources, which, in turn, represent the raw material for breeding programs. The turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a marine flatfish of high commercial value living on the European continental shelf. While wild populations are declining, aquaculture is flourishing in southern Europe. We evaluated the genetic structure of turbot throughout its natural distribution range (672 individuals; 20 populations) by analyzing allele frequency data from 755 single nucleotide polymorphism discovered and genotyped by double-digest RAD sequencing. The species was structured into four main regions: Baltic Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Adriatic Sea, and Black Sea, with subtle differentiation apparent at the distribution margins of the Atlantic region. Genetic diversity and effective population size estimates were highest in the Atlantic populations, the area of greatest occurrence, while turbot from other regions showed lower levels, reflecting geographical isolation and reduced abundance. Divergent selection was detected within and between the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea regions, and also when comparing these two regions with the Black Sea. Evidence of parallel evolution was detected between the two low salinity regions, the Baltic and Black seas. Correlation between genetic and environmental variation indicated that temperature and salinity were probably the main environmental drivers of selection. Mining around the four genomic regions consistently inferred to be under selection identified candidate genes related to osmoregulation, growth, and resistance to diseases. The new insights are useful for the management of turbot fisheries and aquaculture by providing the baseline for evaluating the consequences of turbot releases from restocking and farming.

AB  - The on-board partial dehydrogenation of gasoline to generate hydrogen of sufficient purity to feed a fuel cell directly requires catalysts producing high purity hydrogen at high rate, while also preserving the defining density and boiling point properties of gasoline to allow its recycle to the fuel tank. Here, hydrogen of purity >98% is produced by the catalytic partial dehydrogenation of gasoline SP95E10 (containing 10% ethanol) with a productivity of 2300 NL.h(-1).kgcat(-1) using a Pt-Sn-In/alumina catalyst prepared by templating and incipient wetness impregnation. The hydrogen is used to feed a high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The difference in performance between the fuel cell fed with pure hydrogen and with hydrogen generated from gasoline reaches only 13 mV at 200 mA cm(-2) at 160 degrees C, and the loss is completely recovered when the anode gas stream is reverted to pure hydrogen. Such reversible performance loss is attributable to the presence of carbon monoxide that is formed from oxygenated hydrocarbons during the partial dehydrogenation reaction. The depleted gasoline retains its physical properties and presents significantly lower sulfur content, opening prospects for power generation on-board a vehicle with a fuel cell using hydrogen produced on demand from its primary fuel.

AB  - Lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) maintains the high biodiversity and ecosystem functions in the river-floodplain system. We investigated the changes in the taxonomic and functional composition of fish assemblages in the lateral connection channel between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake, China, during the dry and wet seasons and which factors drive the changes. The results indicated more lake-residence species and fewer river-lake species in the channel during the wet season than the dry season, leading to significant seasonal differences in taxonomic compositions and trait patterns. Water temperature, water level and fish migration influenced fish assemblage structures in the channel. Water-level fluctuations that limited food sources and suitable habitats promoted the migration of riverine and lake-residence fish during both seasons. Water temperature and level also significantly influenced species-specific migration. Water temperature influenced the spawning migration of river-lake fish during the wet season. Based on these results, we found temporal species-specific migration dynamics in fish assemblages in the lateral channel that were related to species' life-history traits. Therefore, we inferred that the temporal-spatial interaction of the fish community in the river-floodplain system is essentially derived from the evolutionary adaption to the monsoon climate. This process is well studied and predictable, and can be beneficial for managing the river-floodplain systems. The invasion risk of the exotic species, including fish and macroinvertebrates, should be assessed before implementing LHC restoration.

AB  - Aim Climate and habitat management are two key drivers for patterns of biodiversity, but little is known about relative importance, interactions and nonlinear effects of climate and management on species richness and trait variation of plants. Location Alps (Germany). Methods We studied patterns of species richness and pollination types in 34 alpine grasslands along an altitudinal climatic gradient comparing grazed, mown and non-managed grasslands. Two vegetation assessments were conducted in 2009 on ten 4-m2 plots per study site and per survey. Results In total, 484 vascular plant species were recorded. Species richness peaked at intermediate temperatures and was highest in grazed grasslands compared with mown and non-managed grasslands. No significant interaction between management effects and climate was found. Species richness of insect-pollinated plants peaked at lower temperatures (higher altitudes) than species richness of wind-pollinated plant species. The proportion of wind-pollinated plants decreased with decreasing temperature, but the vegetation cover of wind-pollinated plants increased with decreasing temperature. Main conclusions Our results indicate that managing alpine grasslands by extensive grazing maintains high plant diversity over the full subalpine gradient. Rising temperatures with climate change and an upward shift of the diversity peak of plants might result not only in reduced overall diversity because of reduced grassland area at higher altitudes but also in changed species composition and adaptive potential of pollination types.

AB  - We conducted laboratory experiments with kaluga, Huso dauricus, and Amur sturgeon, Acipenser schrenckii, to develop a conceptual model of early behavior. We daily observed embryos (first life phase after hatching) and larvae (period initiating exogenous feeding) to day-30 (late larvae) for preference of bright habitat and cover, swimming distance above the bottom, up- and downstream movement, and diel activity. Day-0 embryos of both species strongly preferred bright, open habitat and initiated a strong, downstream migration that lasted 4 days (3 day peak) for kaluga and 3 days (2 day peak) for Amur sturgeon. Kaluga migrants swam far above the bottom (150 cm) on only 1 day and moved day and night; Amur sturgeon migrants swam far above the bottom (median 130 cm) during 3 days and were more nocturnal than kaluga. Post-migrant embryos of both species moved day and night, but Amur sturgeon used dark, cover habitat and swam closer to the bottom than kaluga. The larva period of both species began on day 7 (cumulative temperature degree-days, 192.0 for kaluga and 171.5 for Amur sturgeon). Larvae of both species preferred open habitat. Kaluga larvae strongly preferred bright habitat, initially swam far above the bottom (median 50-105 cm), and migrated downstream at night during days 10-16 (7-day migration). Amur sturgeon larvae strongly avoided illumination, had a mixed response to white substrate, swam 20-30 cm above the bottom during most days, and during days 12-34 (most of the larva period) moved downstream mostly at night (23-day migration). The embryo-larva migration style of the two species likely shows convergence of non-related species for a common style in response to environmental selection in the Amur River. The embryo-larva migration style of Amur sturgeon is unique among Acipenser yet studied.

AB  - The viscoelastic surfactants (VES)-based acid diverters are frequently used to divert acid flow from high-permeability layers into low-permeability for enhanced overall productivity of the treated well. In general, an optimum VES-based system possesses advantages of decrease in absorption loss, damage of reservoir, and improved adaptability of active agents to high salinity. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new zwitterionic gemini surfactants (1-3) and previously known amidosulfobutaine (C(18)AMP3SB) has been accomplished for the investigation of diverting acid performance. The synthesis of these surfactants was achieved by the amidation of the acid chlorides of commercially available fatty acids with 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine followed by subsequent reactions with appropriate sultone or ethyl 4-bromobutanoate. The synthesized surfactants were well characterized by spectroscopic methods including IR and NMR spectroscopy. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results suggested that surfactants (1-3) and C(18)AMP3SB possess excellent thermal stability, with no appreciable loss of mass up to 300 degrees C. The viscosity measurements of the neat surfactants (1-3) and C(18)AMP3SB were performed under various temperatures, in the presence of different concentration of calcium chloride salt with the aid shear viscosimetry. The analysis revealed that the viscosity of neat C(18)AMP3SB increases with increase in concentration of CaCl2. With 10% CaCl2 solution, the viscosity was increased from 7.5 to 33.55 cPs, whereas in 20% CaCl2 the viscosity reached to 102 cPs with rise in temperature from ambient to 90 degrees C. Moreover, the viscosity of neat surfactants (1-3) did not exhibit any appreciable viscosity change under the experimental conditions. However, the mixture of surfactants (1-3) each in combination with C(18)AMP3SB (1:1) displayed significant upsurge in the viscosity, up to more than 10 folds.

AB  - Fish diversification into sympatric ecomorph pairs demonstrates a striking parallelism across a number of taxa in numerous lakes. However, there is a dearth of information on environmental conditions, which may orchestrate divergence processes across generations. Here we explore whether the environmental factors affecting food and reproductive niche distinctions could trigger the divergence of the lacustrine-riverine fish species into two morphs based on kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka of the Lake Kronotskoe. We reveal drastic differences in temperature on the tributary reproduction sites affecting the early ontogeny timing and disrupting the time of lakeward migration of the morphs. The juveniles of the benthivorous morph run into the lake in spring during the food abundance peak on the slope, while the planktivorous kokanee migrates to the lake in the summer when the pelagic zone abounds with zooplankton. The dynamics of this food niches is determined by water temperature dynamics and may be stable for long periods of time, thus making each morph adapting to similar condition throughout generations. We suggest that the pelagic-benthic divergence could be explained by the factors, which are extrinsic for fish, making our results applicable for numerous cases of this microevolutionary pathway all over the Holarctic.

AB  - Patterns of phenotypic change across environmental gradients (e.g., latitude, altitude) have long captivated the interest of evolutionary ecologists. The pattern and magnitude of phenotypic change is determined by the covariance between genetic and environmental influences across a gradient. Cogradient variation (CoGV) occurs when covariance is positive: that is, genetic and environmental influences on phenotypic expression are aligned and their joint influence accentuates the change in mean trait value across the gradient. Conversely, countergradient variation (CnGV) occurs when covariance is negative: that is genetic and environmental influences on phenotypes oppose one another, thereby diminishing the change in mean trait expression across the gradient. CnGV has so far been found in at least 60 species, with most examples coming from fishes, amphibians, and insects across latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. Traits that display CnGV most often involve metabolic compensation, that is, the elevation of various physiological rates processes (development, growth, feeding, metabolism, activity) to counteract the dampening effect of reduced temperature, growing season length, or food supply. Far fewer examples of CoGV have been identified (11 species), and these most often involve morphological characters. Increased knowledge of spatial covariance patterns has furthered our understanding of Bergmann size clines, phenotypic plasticity, species range limits, tradeoffs; in juvenile growth rate, and the design of conservation strategies for wild species. Moreover, temporal CnGV explains some cases of an apparent lack of phenotypic response to directional selection and provides a framework for predicting evolutionary responses to climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the effects of high temperature on pest insects is important in predicting their population dynamics. Aphis gossypii (Glover) and Acyrthosiphon gossypii (Mordviiko) are the two most destructive aphids on cotton in Xinjiang Province, China. This study examined the effect of different temperatures (29 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) on the adult survival rate, fecundity, and feeding behavior of Ap. gossypii and Ac. gossypii. Our results showed that the adverse effects of high temperatures (32 degrees C, 35 degrees C) on aphid adult survival and fecundity were greater for Ac. gossypii than Ap. gossypii. Feeding data showed that Ac. gossypii spent more time feeding on xylem than phloem under all temperature treatments, which contrasted with Ap. gossypii. The time of phloem ingestion by Ap. gossypii at 32 degrees C was significantly higher than at 29 degrees C, while for Ac. gossypii, this value significantly decreased when temperature increased. These feeding patterns indicate that Ac. gossypii obtains less nutrition from phloem in support of its development and fecundity. Data generated in this study will serve as the basis for predicting the effect of increased temperature on these two cotton aphids. Aphid performance is sensitive to temperature changes. Previous studies found that Acyrthosiphon gossypii (Mordviiko) was more sensitive to high temperature than Aphis gossypii (Glover). However, the effects of high temperatures on the survival, fecundity, and feeding behavior of these two aphid adults are not clear. This study examined the effect of different temperatures (29 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) on the adult survival rate, fecundity, and feeding behavior of these two aphid species. Our results showed that the adverse effects of high temperatures (32 degrees C and 35 degrees C) on aphid adult survival and fecundity were greater for Ac. gossypii than Ap. gossypii. The electrical penetration graph (EPG) data showed that Ac. gossypii spent more time feeding on xylem than phloem under all temperature treatments, which contrasted with Ap. gossypii. The time of phloem ingestion by Ap. gossypii at 32 degrees C was significantly higher than at 29 degrees C, while for Ac. gossypii, this value significantly decreased when temperature increased. These feeding patterns indicate that Ac. gossypii obtains less nutrition from phloem in support of its development and fecundity. Data generated in this study will serve as the basis for predicting the effects of increased temperature on these two cotton aphids.

AB  - Rapid environmental change is altering the selective pressures experienced by marine species. While adaptation to local environmental conditions depends on a balance between dispersal and natural selection across the seascape, the spatial scale of adaptation and the relative importance of mechanisms maintaining adaptation in the ocean are not well understood. Here, using population assignment tests, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), and genome scans with double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data, we evaluated population structure and locus-environment associations in a commercially important species, summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), along the U.S. east coast. Based on 1,137 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 232 individuals spanning nearly 1,900 km, we found no indication of population structure across Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (F-ST=0.0014) or of isolation by distance along the coast using individual relatedness. ABC estimated the probability of dispersal across the biogeographic break at Cape Hatteras to be high (95% credible interval: 7%-50% migration). However, we found 15 loci whose allele frequencies were associated with at least one of four environmental variables. Of those, 11 were correlated with bottom temperature. For summer flounder, our results suggest continued fisheries management as a single population and identify likely response mechanisms to climate change. Broadly speaking, our findings suggest that spatial balancing selection can manifest in adaptive divergence on regional scales in marine fish despite high dispersal, and that these conditions likely result in the widespread distribution of adaptive alleles and a high potential for future genetic adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Selection will result in observable changes in traits only if it acts consistently in space and time, but few estimates of selection in natural populations have been temporally replicated. Here we estimate viability selection on nestling growth rates for 13 cohorts ( 1989-2001) of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) from a natural population located in southwestern Yukon, Canada. Directional selection on nestling growth rates varied in magnitude and direction from one cohort to the next. The magnitude of directional selection was relatively weak in most years (median beta' = 0.24). but there were episodes of very strong viability selection (beta' > 0.5) in some cohorts. We found no evidence of significant stabilizing or disruptive selection on this trait. Examination of viability selection episodes over shorter time periods suggested that the strength of selection on juveniles in this population was positively related to the time scale over which selection was measured. Viability selection from birth to emergence from the natal nest (50 days of age) and from emergence to successful recruitment (100 days of age) were positively correlated, but were both independent of selection on nestling growth rates from recruitment to potential breeding age (one year). The strength of directional selection on growth rates prior to recruitment was negatively correlated with spring temperature whereas selection from recruitment to breeding was positively correlated with the abundance of spruce cones produced in the previous fall. Episodes of strong directional selection from birth to breeding age appear to be due to potentially rare combinations of environmental conditions. As a result, predicting the occurrence of very strong episodes of selection will be extremely difficult, but predicting the microevolutionary responses to observed selection on individual cohorts remains feasible.

AB  - The objective of this study is to perform a techno-economic analysis on a typical wood pellet and wood residue boiler for generation of heat to an average-sized greenhouse in British Columbia. The variables analyzed included greenhouse size and structure, boiler efficiency, fuel types, and source of carbon dioxide (CO2) for crop fertilization. The net present value (NPV) show that installing a wood pellet or a wood residue boiler to provide 40% of the annual heat demand is more economical than using a natural gas boiler to provide all the heat at a discount rate of 10%. For an assumed lifespan of 25 years, a wood pellet boiler system could generate NPV of C$259,311 without electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and C$74,695 with ESP, respectively. While, installing a wood residue boiler with or without an ESP could provide NPV of C$919,922 or C$1,104,538, respectively. Using a wood biomass boiler could also eliminate over 3000 tonne CO2 equivalents of greenhouse gases annually. Wood biomass combustion generates more particulate matters than natural gas combustion. However, an advanced emission control system could significantly reduce particulate matters emission from wood biomass combustion which would bring the particulate emission to a relatively similar level as for natural gas.

AB  - Year-round continuous reproduction in tropical regions is an established paradigm in marine ecology. In this study, we tested this paradigm using the ghost shrimp Callichirus seilacheri from the tropical eastern Pacific as a model species. We also examined size-frequency distribution, sex ratio, and recruitment cycle to contribute to the biological knowledge of this species. To this end, a total of 456 individuals of C. seilacheri were collected during 12 months of sampling. Population structure was symmetrical for both sexes, and the overall sex ratio did not differ from evenness. Males outnumbered females in smaller size classes, though, revealing a potential sex-dependent mortality in small individuals. The breeding pattern followed the well-marked seasonal regime of the region, with ovigerous females registered during the rainy season. While natural variation in the seawater temperature had no influence on reproduction of this species, changes in water salinity possibly triggered the appearance of egg-bearing females in the population. Recruitment occurred throughout the year but was more intense during the dry season, following the appearance of ovigerous females. The adaptability of the life cycle of C. seilacheri to the seasonal climate provides further evidence that reproduction in tropical species is not always continuous.

AB  - A one-dimensional thermal conduction model simulates the repetitive intrusion of basalt sills into the deeper parts of the crust. The model assumes geothermal gradients of 10-30degreesC km(-1), and intrusion depths at 20 and 30 km. A range of intrusion rates from 50 m of intruded basalt every 1000, 10 000 and 100 000 years cover a range of geodynamic situations. There is an initial incubation period in which the basalt intrusions solidify. Generation of silicic melts initiates when the solidus temperatures of either the basalt magma or surrounding crust is reached. At an intrusion rate of 50 m per 10 000 years incubation periods in the range 10(5)-10(6) years are estimated, consistent with geochronological and stratigraphic data on many volcanic systems where there is commonly an evolution from mafic to silicic volcanism. Melt generation involves simultaneous cooling and crystallization of intruding basalt and partial melting of both new basaltic crust and pre-existing old crust. The proportion of these components depends on the fertility of the crust, in particular the abundance of hydrous minerals, and the temperature and water content of the basalt magma. For a wet (2% H2O) and cool (1100degreesC) basalt, melt generation can be dominated by residual liquids from basalt crystallization. For a dry (0.3% H2O) and hot (1300degreesC) basalt emplaced into fertile crustal rocks, such as pelite, melt generation can be dominated by partial melting of old crust. Melt proportions and temperature vary greatly across such a deep crustal intrusion zone, resulting in geochemical diversity in magmas. Segregated melts, if mixed together during ascent or in a high-level magma chamber, will be geochemical hybrids with mantle and crustal components. Intrusion rates of 50 m per 100 000 years or less are too low for large-scale melt generation in the crust. Periods of magmatic intrusion create reverse geothermal gradients and thermal anomalies in the crust which will take several million years to decay. Such anomalous zones are predisposed to remelt if a subsequent magmatic episode initiates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sonoporation would be linked to cavitation, which generally appears to be a non reproducible and unstationary phenomenon. In order to obtain an acceptable trade-off between cell mortality and transfection, a regulated cavitation generator based on an acoustical cavitation measurement was developed and tested.
   The medium to be sonicated is placed in a sample tray. This tray is immersed in in degassed water and positioned above the face of a flat ultrasonic transducer (frequency: 445 kHz; intensity range: 0.08-1.09 W/cm(2)). This technical configuration was admitted to be conducive to standing-wave generation through reflection at the air/medium interface in the well thus enhancing the cavitation phenomenon. Laterally to the transducer, a homemade hydrophone was oriented to receive the acoustical signal from the bubbles. From this spectral signal recorded at intervals of 5 ms, a cavitation index was calculated as the mean of the cavitation spectrum integration in a logarithmic scale, and the excitation power is automatically corrected. The device generates stable and reproducible cavitation level for a wide range of cavitation setpoint from stable cavitation condition up to full-developed inertial cavitation. For the ultrasound intensity range used, the time delay of the response is lower than 200 ms.
   The cavitation regulation device was evaluated in terms of chemical bubble collapse effect. Hydroxyl radical production was measured on terephthalic acid solutions. In open loop, the results present a great variability whatever the excitation power. On the contrary the closed loop allows a great reproducibility. This device was implemented for study of sonodynamic effect. The regulation provides more reproducible results independent of cell medium and experimental conditions (temperature, pressure).
   Other applications of this regulated cavitation device concern internalization of different particles (Quantum Dot) molecules (SiRNA) or plastnids (GFP, DsRed) into different types of cells (AT2, RL, LLC...). Preliminary results are presented.

AB  - This paper presents modified artificial fish swarm algorithm (MAFSA) for automated design and optimization of self-organizing fuzzy logic controller (SOFLC). MAFSA has main improvement in the information of global best AF which is added to the behaviours of AF. It is proposed a novel method of adaptive step and visual based on food concentration. These improvements not only increase the capability of global searching, but also have considerable advantages like high convergence speed, flexibility and high accuracy. Then on the basis of MAFSA, SOFLC is designed and optimized by seven parameters, including three correlation factors of membership functions, one modifying factor of fuzzy logic rules, two quantitative factors and one scaling factor. The fitness function as optimized objective is defined by comprehensive performance index of the controller. Finally, simulation in temperature control of dyeing machine is implemented by using the above proposed method. Moreover, the simulation results show that MAFSA based SOFLC can avoid premature effectively and possesses strong adaptability and high control precision.

CP  - ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference
AB  - Machining of space age materials like Ti-6A1-4V is associated with thermally activated wear mechanisms which lead to rapid tool failure and increased machine downtime. The high strength and low thermal conductivity of Ti-6A1-4V can reduce tool-life significantly at high cutting speeds adding drastically to the per-unit cost. A new concept, Micro Quantity Internal Cooling (MQUIC (TM)) has been developed to extend the tool-life and/or enable higher cutting speeds while machining Ti-6A1-4V. The concept involves introducing flow (coolant) in a micro-duct placed inside the tool and close to the cutting edge, thus bringing the cooling source close to the heat source (chip-contact area). In this research, experiments have been conducted to compare the performance (wear rates) of cutting tools using the MQUIC (TM) concept with those run under dry or flood conditions. Further, two levels of feed and cutting speed are selected for the experiments so as to be able to investigate the combined effect of parameters on tool performance. Physical testing employing coolant consumption of less than 5% of typical flood coolant rates proves the viability of the concept by demonstrating wear rates of 1/3 to 1/2 those of flood cooling. The testing also proves the application of the MQUIC (TM) concept to enable higher cutting speeds than the current industry standard for machining Ti-6A1-4V. This paper presents the experimental setup, methodology and results obtained while testing the feasibility of the concept.

AB  - The intensity and frequency of drought have increased considerably during the last decades in southeastern Europe, and projected scenarios suggest that southern and central Europe will be affected by more drought events by the end of the 21st century. In this context, assessing the intraspecific genetic variation of forest tree species and identifying populations expected to be best adapted to future climate conditions is essential for increasing forest productivity and adaptability. Using a tree-ring database from 60 populations of 38-year-old silver fir (Abies alba) in five trial sites established across Romania, we studied the variation of growth and wood characteristics, provenance-specific response to drought, and climate-growth relationships during the period 1997-2018. The drought response of provenances was determined by four drought parameters: resistance, recovery, resilience, and relative resilience. Based on the standardized precipitation index, ten years with extreme and severe drought were identified for all trial sites. Considerable differences in radial growth, wood characteristics, and drought response parameters among silver fir provenances have been found. The provenances' ranking by resistance, recovery, and resilience revealed that a number of provenances from Bulgaria, Italy, Romania, and Czech Republic placed in the top ranks in almost all sites. Additionally, there are provenances that combine high productivity and drought tolerance. The correlations between drought parameters and wood characters are positive, the most significant correlations being obtained between radial growth and resilience. Correlations between drought parameters and wood density were non-significant, indicating that wood density cannot be used as indicator of drought sensitivity. The negative correlations between radial growth and temperature during the growing season and the positive correlations with precipitation suggest that warming and water deficit could have a negative impact on silver fir growth in climatic marginal sites. Silvicultural practices and adaptive management should rely on selection and planting of forest reproductive material with high drought resilience in current and future reforestation programs.

AB  - Variation in 19 traits possibly relevant for thermal adaptation was studied in 11 populations of Drosophila buzzatii collected in southeast Australia. Using stepwise multiple regression, the variation was compared to variation in geographic coordinates and to a set of climatic variables estimated for each collection site. For 13 of the traits, a significant part of the variation was explained by climatic variables and/or geographic coordinates, suggesting directional selection for adaptation to the environment in the majority of traits studied. In 10 of the traits, both geographic coordinates and climatic variables explained significant proportions of the variation, with R-2 ranging from 0.075 to 0.58. Although larvae, pupae and adults of D. buzzatii share a common habitat, the measured traits were not correlated across life stages and gender. Also, there seemed to be special conditions in marginal populations near species borders, giving rise to nonlinear relations with latitude. Climate apparently does influence the adaptive evolution of the traits studied, but they also are affected by other factors that vary with latitude, longitude and distance to coast. These results highlight the complex challenges imposed by the environment on the adaptive process.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions for traits related to organismal fitness. However, the genetic architecture of the interaction is usually unknown because these studies used genotypes that differ from one another by many unknown mutations. These mutations were also present as standing variation in populations and hence had been subject to prior selection. Based on such studies, it is therefore impossible to say what fraction of new, random mutations contributes to GxE interactions. In this study, we measured the fitness in four environments of 26 genotypes of Escherichia coli, each containing a single random insertion mutation. Fitness was measured relative to their common progenitor, which had evolved on glucose at 37 degreesC for the preceding 10,000 generations. The four assay environments differed in limiting resource and temperature (glucose, 28 degreesC; maltose, 28 degreesC; glucose, 37 degreesC; and maltose, 37 degreesC). A highly significant interaction between mutation and resource was found. In contrast, there was no interaction involving temperature. The resource interaction reflected much higher among mutation variation for fitness in maltose than in glucose. At least 11 mutations (42%) contributed to this GxE interaction through their differential fitness effects across resources. Beneficial mutations are generally thought to be rare but, surprisingly, at least three mutations (12%) significantly improved fitness in maltose, a resource novel to the progenitor. More generally, our findings demonstrate that GxE interactions can be quite common, even for genotypes that differ by only one mutation and in environments differing by only a single factor.

AB  - We used a lethal thermal method to estimate the upper thermal tolerances of 11 native and 7 normative fish species found throughout southern Arizona. Fish were acclimated to 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. For all species tested, an increase in acclimation temperature resulted in a higher thermal tolerance value. Among the species acclimated to 25 degrees C, desert pupfish Cyprinodon macularius, western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, and Gila topminnow Poeciflopsis occidentalis were most tolerant to high temperature. Speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus, spikedace Meda fulgida, and loach minnow R. cobitis were least tolerant. Many native species demonstrated a limited ability to extend their upper temperature tolerances via acclimation. Our data suggest that several native species may be sensitive to increasing annual and large daily temperature fluctuations in Arizona's streams and rivers, Although southwestern native fishes were previously believed to be tolerant to high temperature due to their evolution in desert environments, this study suggests that many of these fishes are less tolerant than previously thought. In addition, many fishes introduced from the eastern United States had higher temperature tolerances than some of the native desert species tested. Increases in stream temperatures in Arizona could reduce the habitat available for native fishes and therefore may favor those normative species with higher thermal tolerances.

AB  - Ongoing climate crisis increase people's outdoor thermal stress, discouraging outside activities and intensifying indoor consumptions. Amelioration of urban microclimates is necessary to safeguard citizens from thermal strokes without energy-intensive strategies, ensuring future cities' sustainable development. More than 200 calculation methods can be adopted with the purpose to design thermally comfortable public spaces, but existing literature lacks selection criteria to justifiably choose the appropriate ones. As resolution, the Metamatrix of Thermal Comfort has been developed. It's a graphical methodology, addressed to academicians and practitioners, that allows to rapidly comprehend and compare the specificities of 65 renowned thermal comfort indices and thermo-physiological models, explaining their mutual interactions. To promote practicality in thermal comfort studies, relying on calculation tools, an Operational version, including only 22 indices and models integrated in computer programs, is presented. A qualitative evaluation by approximately 30 criteria, such as climatic and physical factors, meteorological conditions, solar exposure and type of environment, allows to select thermal comfort calculation methods compatible to specific needs. To find appropriate computational tools, the Metamatrix of Software can be consulted. An application example is provided, proving the suitability of this graphical methodology as a powerful asset to apply outdoor thermal comfort-driven design to urban planning.

AB  - The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions by oceans has started decreasing pH and carbonate ion concentrations of seawater, a process called ocean acidification (OA). Occurring over centuries and many generations, evolutionary adaptation and epigenetic transfer will change species responses to OA over time. Trans-generational responses, via genetic selection or trans-generational phenotypic plasticity, differ depending on species and exposure time as well as differences between individuals such as gender. Males and females differ in reproductive investment and egg producing females may have less energy available for OA stress responses. By crossing eggs and sperm from the calcareous tubeworm Hydroides elegans (Haswell, 1883) raised in ambient (8.1) and low (7.8) pH environments, we observed that paternal and maternal low pH experience had opposite and additive effects on offspring. For example, when compared to offspring with both parents from ambient pH, growth rates of offspring of fathers or mothers raised in low pH were higher or lower respectively, but there was no difference when both parents were from low pH. Gender differences may result in different selection pressures for each gender. This may result in overestimates of species tolerance and missed opportunities of potentially insightful comparisons between individuals of the same species.

AB  - Adaptation to environmental conditions within the native range of exotic species can condition the invasion success of these species outside their range. The striking success of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, to invade temperate regions has been attributed to the winter survival of diapause eggs in cold environments. In this study, we evaluate genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) and wing morphometric variation among three biogeographical regions of the native range of A. albopictus. Reconstructed demographic histories of populations show an initial expansion in Southeast Asia and suggest that marine regression during late Pleistocene and climate warming after the last glacial period favored expansion of populations in southern and northern regions, respectively. Searching for genomic signatures of selection, we identified significantly differentiated SNPs among which several are located in or within 20 kb distance from candidate genes for cold adaptation. These genes involve cellular and metabolic processes and several of them have been shown to be differentially expressed under diapausing conditions. The three biogeographical regions also differ for wing size and shape, and wing size increases with latitude supporting Bergmann's rule. Adaptive genetic and morphometric variation observed along the climatic gradient of A. albopictus native range suggests that colonization of northern latitudes promoted adaptation to cold environments prior to its worldwide invasion.

AB  - A novel class of organic phosphates were synthesized and applied in iron catalyst as additive for 1,2-syndiotactic polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in combination with aluminum alkyls (Ali-Bu3 or AlEt3) in hexane at industrial favorable 50-100 degrees C. Remarkable enhanced polymer productivity (up to 486 kg (polymer)/mol(Fe)h) and excellent 1,2-syndiotactic regularity have been achieved at 50-100 degrees C in all examing cases. All the polymers obtained under various polymerization conditions possess prevailingly 1,2 inserted homo-sequences up to 94.7% 1,2-selectivity in syndiotactic arrangements (up to 94.4%, denoted by rrrr) with melting point ranging from 170 to 182 degrees C. The current in-situ generated catalyst systems feature high productivity, selectivity, robustness (e.g. high thermal stability, good tolerance to poisons and environmentally friendly hexane as solution polymerization medium) and single-site behaviour. These all extend the practical usefulness of these versatile phosphates assisted catalyst, and they are promising candidates to act as ancillary additive for industrial applicable 1,2-syndiotactic polymerization of 1,3-butadiene.

AB  - Welding copper and its alloys is usually difficult to achieve by conventional fusion welding processes because of high thermal diffusivity of copper, which is at least 10 times higher than most steel alloys. In order to reduce the increased temperature loss, it would be advantageous to use a process that is carried out at lower temperatures. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid state joining process that relies on frictional heating and plastic deformation and was explored as a feasible welding process. In order to achieve an increased productivity this process is assisted by another one, TIG (tungsten inert gas), which generates and adds heat to the process. The aim of this paper is to determine the progress direction of the process parameter values in order to maintain the productivity of the hybrid process and also to increase the values of the mechanical properties. Are analysed the evolution of the temperature, of the plunging force, of the microhardness and of the tensile strength in order to evaluate the changes generated by the application of the hybrid process. Then changes to the process parameter values of the hybrid process based on the evaluation of the previously mentioned properties are suggested in order to improve its mechanical properties.

AB  - The present work provides a thorough literature review of the main high temperature sensible and latent materials suitable for a multilayered thermal energy storage system to be integrated into innovative concentrated solar power applications. Furthermore, a thermodynamic comparative analysis of six different multilayered packed-bed thermal energy storage configurations, including three selected high-temperature metallic phase change materials (Al-12.2Si, Al-20Si, and Cu-Si27-Mg17) is presented. For each multilayered storage configuration, the overall impact of the phase change material layer thickness on the performance has been analyzed. As expected, the major improvements are enabled by the addition of a high-temperature phase change material at the top of the multi-layered thermal energy storage. Indeed, the discharge phase duration could be extended for 2 hours, while the energy output increases by about 5%. Furthermore, the addition of a lower melting temperature phase change material layer below the topping high temperature one grants a further slight energy output enhancement. However, this seems to be not valuable enough when considering the increased level of complexity and costs induced by such a storage unit design. The study confirms that a larger amount of phase change materials leads to a lower discharge efficiency due to a wider temperature difference between the heat transfer fluid and the storing media during phase change. The performed study reveals that the Cu-17Mg-27Si/rock multilayered thermal energy storage is worth continuing exploring, especially in terms of experimental tests to assess possible corrosion issues and different encapsulation and coating solutions that might considerably affect the lifetime of the system. Techno-economic analyses should be also performed to assess the economic viability of the integration of multilayered TES systems in innovative concentrated solar power plant layouts.

AB  - As a result of the evolution of the thermal regulation in Europe, buildings are better isolated and more airtight, thereby reducing their heating needs. Efficient systems from the energetic point of view, using preferably renewable sources, must cover the new distribution of needs. Indeed, domestic hot water (DHW) becomes a more important load than space heating in residential buildings. In this context, solar thermal systems are appropriate for supplying a significant part of the heat demand in energy efficient housing. Thus, this paper focuses on an innovative solar thermal system producing DHW and preheating the ventilation air. A co-simulation between Dymola (Modelica language) and EnergyPlus forecasts the energy performance of the system in a low-energy individual house for different French cities. The results show an improved collector efficiency as well as a higher solar productivity in comparison to a classical solar domestic hot water system. Although energy savings are achieved for the majority of the studied climates with the studied system, a different control strategy may be interesting in order to improve the distribution of the collected solar energy. To this end, a parametric analysis provides some clues for increasing the energy performance of the innovative system when modifying the design and control parameters.

AB  - Management of regulated rivers for yellow-legged frogs (Rana boylii) and salmonids exemplifies potential conflicts among species adapted to different parts of the natural flow and temperature regimes. Yellow-legged frogs oviposit in rivers in spring and depend on declining flows and warming temperatures for egg and tadpole survival and growth, whereas salmonid management can include high spring flows and low-temperature reservoir releases. We built a model of how flow and temperature affect frog breeding success. Its mechanisms include adults selecting oviposition sites to balance risks of egg dewatering by decreasing flow versus scouring by high flow, temperature effects on development, habitat selection by tadpoles, and mortality via dewatering and scouring. In simulations of a regulated river managed primarily for salmonids, below-natural temperatures delayed tadpole metamorphosis into froglets, which can reduce overwinter survival. However, mitigating this impact via higher temperatures was predicted to cause adults to oviposit before spring flow releases for salmonids, which then scoured the egg masses. The relative timing of frog oviposition and high flow releases appears critical in determining conflicts between salmonid and frog management.

AB  - The novel bipolar electrodialysis flow battery (BEDFB) concept is an acid-base type of energy storage solution that uses safe and abundant electrolytes and that has the potential of providing long-duration storage at low cost. To date, the potential environmental impacts of the BEDFB have not been investigated. Here, we report the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) and an integrated sustainability analysis for a 1 MW/ 6 MWh BEDFB system having a 20-year lifetime. The manufacturing phase (cradle-to-gate) and the full life cycle (cradle-to grave) were analyzed per 1 MWh (functional unit) of installed storage capacity using five LCA categories. For the use phase part of the LCA, the BEDFB was assumed to provide energy storage to support wind and PV generation within the national Mexican electricity grid. In addition, the cumulative energy demand (CED), the energy returned on investment (EROI) and three sustainability dimensions (feasibility, viability, desirability) were evaluated. Finally, we calculated the losses posed by the renewables that are currently (2019) deployed in the Mexican grid to assess the potential of energy storage deployment within the Mexican context. For the manufacturing phase, the BEDFB technology exhibited a terrestrial ecotoxicity value of 16.3 kg1.4DCB/MWh and a global warming impact of 9.1 kgCO(2)e/MWh, which are significantly lower values than reported for the state-of-the-art all-vanadium flow battery technology. PV generation in combination with the BEDFB demonstrated the best environmental profile, followed by generation through wind and the average Mexican grid conditions. We found that 304 BEDFB?s would suffice to mitigate the energy losses represented by renewable deployments in Mexico today. The main result from the sustainability analysis is that, on the supply side, the BEDFB technology requires minimal fossil energy and chemicals during the upstream processes of the manufacturing phase.

AB  - There are a number of shortcomings for currently-available technologies for ammonia production, such as carbon dioxide emissions and water consumption. We simulate a novel model for ammonia production from hydrogen sulfide through membrane technologies. The proposed production process decreases the need for external water and reduces the physical footprint of the plant. The required hydrogen comes from the separation of hydrogen sulfide by electrochemical membrane separation, while the required nitrogen is obtained from separating oxygen from air through an ion transport membrane. 10% of the hydrogen from the electrochemical membrane separation along with the separated oxygen from the ion transport membrane is sent to the solid oxide fuel cell for heat and power generation. This production process operates with a minimal number of processing units and in physical, kinetic, and thermal conditions in which a separation factor of similar to 99.99% can be attained.

AB  - Ocean warming, fueled by climate change, is the primary cause of coral bleaching events which are predicted to increase in frequency. Bleaching is generally damaging to coral reproduction, can be exacerbated by concomitant stressors like ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and can have lasting impacts to successful reproduction and potential adaptation. We compared morphological and physiological reproductive metrics (e.g., sperm motility, mitochondria) membrane integrity, egg volume, gametes per bundle, and fertilization and settlement success) of two Hawaiian Montipora corals after consecutive bleaching events in 2014 and 2015. Between the species, sperm motility and mitochondria! membrane potential had the most disparate results. Percent sperm motility in M. capitata, which declined to- 40% during bleaching from a normal range of 70-90%, was still less than 50% motile in 2017 and 2018 and had not fully recovered in 2019 (63% motile). By contrast, percent sperm motility in Montipora spp. was 86% and 74% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. This reduction in motility was correlated with damage to mitochondria in M. capitata but not Montipora spp. A major difference between these species is the physiological foundation of their UVR protection, and we hypothesize that UVR protective mechanisms inherent in Montipora spp. mitigate this reproductive damage.

AB  - The temperature-dependent development of the European larch bark beetle, Ips cembrae, was studied under long-day conditions L:D 16:8 at three temperature regimes, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, using the sandwich plate method. By observing the individual developmental progress, we calculated the developmental times and lower developmental thresholds of one entire generation and various ontogenetic stages. The mean developmental time of one generation was about 120, 64 and 37days at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. The egg stage comprised about 9% of the total development or about 16% of the pre-imaginal development. The larval stages took about 39% of the entire and about 66% of the pre-imaginal development. The pupal stage needed about 11% of the total or about 18% of the pre-imaginal development. The lower developmental threshold for one generation was 11.2 degrees C. The egg stage had the highest lower developmental threshold of 12.0 degrees C, the pupa the lowest of 9.8 degrees C and the total larval stages showed a value of 11.2 degrees C. The thermal requirements for I.cembrae have never been studied in detail before. The results will be a valuable contribution for monitoring and risk assessment models to estimate the beetle's phenology and its potential impacts on forest ecosystems under changing climate conditions.

AB  - Despite the success achieved in the comprehensive study of probiotic cultures, today there are a number of problems associated with the low viability of lactic acid bacteria during their processing and long-term storage in probiotics. Our work aimed to select the optimal technological regime and cryoprotectant to preserve the viability of lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus spp. during their lyophilization. According to the results of the conducted researches, it is established that for freeze-drying of probiotic cultures Lactobacillus spp. in the facility LZ-45.27 (Frigera, Czech Republic) the most optimal is the mode which provides a rise of temperature within 45 hours from minus 70.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C to plus 26.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C with a speed of 2.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C/hour. It is effective to use protective media for lactobacilli, which consist of: skim milk (90%) and sucrose (10%); skim milk (90%) and lactose (10%); skim milk (90%), glucose (2.5%), sucrose (2.5%), lactose (5.0%) (P <= 0.05). Freeze-drying of lactic acid bacteria under optimal conditions and the addition of cryoprotectants will avoid the problems associated with a significant reduction in the number of microbial cells. The results of research can be used for long-term storage of cultures of lactobacilli by their lyophilization.

AB  - In several species of short-lived Australian agamid lizards, an individual's sex is determined by the nest temperatures encountered during incubation. The adaptive significance of such systems remains unclear. Here, we explore the hypothesis that (1) the optimal timing of hatching differs between the sexes, and thus (2) temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) enhances maternal and offspring fitness by generating seasonal shifts in offspring sex ratios. Our model predicts that TSD can indeed enhance maternal fitness returns in short-lived lizards if (1) male-male competition is intense, thus reducing mating success of newly-matured males (but not females), and (2) the nesting season is prolonged, such that seasonal effects become significant. Available data on the distribution of TSD in Australian agamid lizards broadly support these predictions. Because both the level of male-male competition and the length of nesting season can vary at small spatial and temporal scales, selective forces on sex-determining mechanisms also should vary. Hence, our model predicts extensive small-scale (intraspecific) variation in sex-determining systems within agamid lizards, as well as among species.

AB  - The response patterns of N and P in plant leaves are one of the tools for investigating the ability of plants to cope with current environmental conditions and predicting their future viability. Endangered species are more sensitive to environmental changes, lack of nutrients such as NP will adversely affect the survival of species. 119 Acer catalpifolium are the only ones left in the world were studied and were divided into different growth stages (small, adult and old trees) to study the environmental response of leaves to NP. Results showed that: the NP stoichiometric characteristics of Acer catalpifolium leaves were lower in small stage, with the growth of plants, the NP content increased. There was a significant correlation between the soil nutrient and leaf NP stoichiometry in all growth stages, and with the increase of soil N: P, the leaf N: P changed from N limitation to N and P limitation, showing a poor adaptability to soil environmental changes. Under the influence of environmental conditions, the adaptation strategy of leaf NP at different growth stages were different. With the return of nutrients, the leaf N: P at adult and old stages increased with litter thickness. Small and old stages showed poor adaptation with environmental changes. These results indicate that leaf NP differed significantly among different life stages and that these differences can accounted for part of the causes of endangerment of Acer catalpifolium.

AB  - The threat from pests and pathogens to native and commercially planted forest trees is unprecedented and expected to increase under climate change. The degree to which forests respond to threats from pathogens depends on their adaptive capacity, which is determined largely by genetically controlled variation in susceptibility of the individual trees within them and the heritability and evolvability of this trait. The most significant current threat to the economically and ecologically important species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is dothistroma needle blight (DNB), caused by the foliar pathogen Dothistroma septosporum. A progeny-population trial of 4-year-old Scots pine trees, comprising six populations from native Caledonian pinewoods each with three to five families in seven blocks, was artificially inoculated using a single isolate of D. septosporum. Susceptibility to D. septosporum, assessed as the percentage of non-green needles, was measured regularly over a period of 61 days following inoculation, during which plants were maintained in conditions ideal for DNB development (warm; high humidity; high leaf wetness). There were significant differences in susceptibility to D. septosporum among families indicating that variation in this trait is heritable, with high estimates of narrow-sense heritability (0.38-0.75) and evolvability (genetic coefficient of variation, 23.47). It is concluded that native Scots pine populations contain sufficient genetic diversity to evolve lower susceptibility to D. septosporum through natural selection in response to increased prevalence of this pathogen.

AB  - Knowledge of the larval-age distribution in the field is important for prediction purpose and timing of insecticide applications for insect pest management. This studies acts by calculating the average of thermal units in degree-days (dd's). The average of thermal units required for completion of generation is 544.98, 640.63 and 599.66 degrees-days (degrees C) as calculated from air temperatures derived from thermograph and satellite images, and soil temperatures from satellite images, respectively, considering 9.89 degrees C as a developmental threshold. These were higher than the estimated value of dd's based on laboratory data (524.27 degrees-days (degrees C)). There was a difference between degree days obtained from air temperatures derived from satellite images and thermograph by 59.2 dd's, this value represented only about 2.85 days. In order to improve the predictability, a factor was estimated between them which is 0.81, 0.96 and 0.87 in case of thermograph, soil and air temperature that derived from satellite images so the predicted stages was highly improved. Egg hatching was estimated to be 80% complete by approximate to 80.45 dd's. At 174.85 DD, mostly all larvae in the field experiment were from the first to third instars. The presence of more mature larvae (fourth to sixth instars) was not noticed until 197.59 dd's. These data indicate that, the best timing for control application against Spodoptera littoralis would be at 174.85-197.59 dd's.
   The results are important for quick prediction purposes, control timing and also as valuable tools used in an integrated control program for managing S. littoralis in Egypt.

AB  - During the last decade, strong negative rainfall anomalies resulting from increased sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic have caused extensive droughts in rainforests of western Amazonia, exerting persistent effects on the forest canopy. In contrast, there have been no significant impacts on rainforests of West and Central Africa during the same period, despite large-scale droughts and rainfall anomalies during the same period. Using a combination of rainfall observations from meteorological stations from the Climate Research Unit (CRU; 1950-2009) and satellite observations of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; 1998-2010), we show that West and Central Africa experienced strong negative water deficit (WD) anomalies over the last decade, particularly in 2005, 2006 and 2007. These anomalies were a continuation of an increasing drying trend in the region that started in the 1970s. We monitored the response of forests to extreme rainfall anomalies of the past decade by analysing the microwave scatterometer data from QuickSCAT (1999-2009) sensitive to variations in canopy water content and structure. Unlike in Amazonia, we found no significant impacts of extreme WD events on forests of Central Africa, suggesting potential adaptability of these forests to short-term severe droughts. Only forests near the savanna boundary in West Africa and in fragmented landscapes of the northern Congo Basin responded to extreme droughts with widespread canopy disturbance that lasted only during the period of WD. Time-series analyses of CRU and TRMM data show most regions in Central and West Africa experience seasonal or decadal extreme WDs (less than 2600 mm). We hypothesize that the long-term historical extreme WDs with gradual drying trends in the 1970s have increased the adaptability of humid tropical forests in Africa to droughts.

AB  - Both Spathius agrili Yang and Spathius galinae Belokobylskij and Strazanac are host-specific parasitic wasps introduced for biological control of emerald ash borer in North America. Spathius agrili is native to northeastern China and S. galinae comes from a more northern, colder climate in the Russian Far East. Their origin may lead to differing abilities to adapt to climate and their host in North America. We conducted both field and laboratory experiments to determine the timing of early season emergence and synchronization of each parasitoid species to their host in the United States, and if manipulating prerelease conditions could affect emergence time. A cold acclimatization treatment prior to parasitoid emergence was assessed and compared with untreated control group reared with standard rearing protocols. Stands of naturally emerald ash borer-infested ash were sampled at two locations in Virginia throughout the experiment to determine when the parasitoid-susceptible life stage (third to fourth instar) occurred. Untreated S. galinae emerged approximately 2 wk earlier than any other cohort, whereas cold acclimatized S. galinae emerged later than any other cohort. Emergence time of S. agrili was unaffected by cold acclimatization. Cold acclimatization treatment did not affect the parasitism rate of either species, nor did it have multigenerational effects. Emergence time of the subsequent generation of S. agrili was delayed by cold acclimatization treatment, whereas S. galinae experienced no multigenerational effects. At Virginia field sites, susceptible EAB larvae were present during the emergence time of all four groups of parasitoids. Untreated S. galinae had the least overlap with any susceptible EAB larvae.

AB  - Animal physiology, ecology and evolution are affected by temperature and it is expected that community structure will be strongly influenced by global warming. This is particularly relevant in the tropics, where organisms are already living close to their upper temperature limits and hence are highly vulnerable to rising temperature. Here we present data on upper temperature limits of 34 tropical marine ectotherm species from seven phyla living in intertidal and subtidal habitats. Short term thermal tolerances and vertical distributions were correlated, i.e., upper shore animals have higher thermal tolerance than lower shore and subtidal animals; however, animals, despite their respective tidal height, were susceptible to the same temperature in the long term. When temperatures were raised by 1 degrees C hour(-1), the upper lethal temperature range of intertidal ectotherms was 41-52 degrees C, but this range was narrower and reduced to 37-41 degrees C in subtidal animals. The rate of temperature change, however, affected intertidal and subtidal animals differently. In chronic heating experiments when temperature was raised weekly or monthly instead of every hour, upper temperature limits of subtidal species decreased from 40 degrees C to 35.4 degrees C, while the decrease was more than 10 degrees C in high shore organisms. Hence in the long term, activity and survival of tropical marine organisms could be compromised just 2-3 degrees C above present seawater temperatures. Differences between animals from environments that experience different levels of temperature variability suggest that the physiological mechanisms underlying thermal sensitivity may vary at different rates of warming.

AB  - In recent years development of Indian railways took place rapidly, but still there are many issues related in the way of growth. The biggest issue is the creation of world's biggest open toilet. In every coach there is an open toilet system through which feces and urine of human is discharged directly on the tracks, which results corrosion of track components. Another issue of food waste on platforms and through the train canteens, which is another big headache for Indian railways. Several models of green toilets have been proposed for the purpose of improvement in the environment and hygiene like development of Controlled discharge toilet system (CDTS) built by DRDO based on train speed, development of Zero discharge toilets (ZDTS) by Research Designs and standards organization Lucknow and IIT Kanpur. These systems are tried by railway but rejected. These systems are not suitable for trains because of its infrastructure complexity, expensiveness and large number of people will use them. Therefore there is a requirement of proper sanitation in the Indian railways. In this paper a model is proposed which produces energy and fertilizers from toilet waste and food waste which can be used for thermal generation, electric generation, cooking, agriculture and some other purposes.

AB  - Prevailing modes of the manufacture of modern energy-harvesting systems and other electronics based on silicon fail to meet the requirements of the steps involved in low-cost fabrication. Rapid and low-cost roll-to-roll manufacture - the future of commercialization for flexible and printed electronics - requires flexible and lowcost substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate and, more recently, green materials such as nano-paper. The temperature at every single fabrication stage is crucial with such materials and cannot exceed a certain threshold, generally 150 degrees C or less. Low-temperature plasma, therefore can provide an excellent way forward for future manufacturing methods.
   This contribution presents a proprietary, large-area plasma of extremely high-volume power density, up to 100 W/cm(3), capable of generating diffuse, homogeneous and cold plasma (<70 degrees C) in the open air, as well as in technical-grade gases including nitrogen, argon, methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and pure water vapour. Although the temperature of the plasma is very low, the population of energetic states is sufficient to induce physical/chemical changes on the surfaces of a range of nanostructured materials and semiconductors, such as graphene oxide, titanium dioxide, perovskites, and others, resulting in various changes to crystallinity, optoelectronic, and wettability properties depending on the gas employed for plasma generation. The low temperature of the plasma and rapid treatment times, in the order of 1-10s, enables the integration of plasma processing into roll-to-roll manufacture, a significant step forward in commercial viability within the emerging field of flexible and printed electronics. This study provides an example of rapid (<1 min) low-temperature plasma processing of indium-tin-oxide electrodes as a replacement for time-consuming chemical treatment before deposition of PEDOT:PSS in a p-i-n perovskite solar cell.

AB  - One-dimensional pseudo-homogenous dynamic reactor model, incorporating detailed Fischer-Tropsch kinetics, was applied in a theoretical analysis of forced periodic operations. A milli-scale fixed-bed reactor was analyzed, using design and operation parameters, obtained previously in a steady-state optimization. Dynamic optimization and NLP methods were utilized to obtain optimal values of amplitude(s), frequency and phase shift(s) of sine-wave variation of inputs, around the corresponding optimal steady-state values, which maximize the productivity of C5+ hydrocarbons. Inlet variables that were modulated are: coolant temperature, reactants molar ratio, mass flow rate and pressure. In addition to the single input forcing, simultaneous modulations of multiple inputs were also considered, with combinations of the listed inlet variables. Among the single input cases, periodic variation of the coolant temperature resulted in the highest relative improvement of C5+, productivity by 30%. Multiple inputs forcing showed additional potential for improvement, resulting in relative c(5+) productivity increase of 52% for synchronized modulation of the coolant temperature, reactants molar ratio and mass flow rate. However, the increase in C5+ productivity is accompanied with relative increase in methane selectivity of 22-33% (relative to the steady-state value). The results suggest that, in the case of multiple input variations with high amplitudes, modulation of the inlet reactants molar ratio mainly contributes to the increase of CO conversion (e.g. reaction rate), the coolant temperature forcing slightly increases selectivity towards the desirable higher hydrocarbons (C5+), while the variation of the inlet mass flow rate enables better reaction temperature control and prevents a thermal runway.

AB  - This paper focuses on the potential use of ammonia as a carbon-free fuel, and covers recent advances in the development of ammonia combustion technology and its underlying chemistry. Fulfilling the COP21 Paris Agreement requires the de-carbonization of energy generation, through utilization of carbon-neutral and overall carbon-free fuels produced from renewable sources. Hydrogen is one of such fuels, which is a potential energy carrier for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. However, its shipment for long distances and storage for long times present challenges. Ammonia on the other hand, comprises 17.8% of hydrogen by mass and can be produced from renewable hydrogen and nitrogen separated from air. Further more, thermal properties of ammonia are similar to those of propane in terms of boiling temperature and condensation pressure, making it attractive as a hydrogen and energy carrier. Ammonia has been produced and utilized for the past 100 years as a fertilizer, chemical raw material, and refrigerant. Ammonia can be used as a fuel but there are several challenges in ammonia combustion, such as low flammability, high NOx emission, and low radiation intensity. Overcoming these challenges requires further research into ammonia flame dynamics and chemistry. This paper discusses recent successful applications of ammonia fuel, in gas turbines, co-fired with pulverize coal, and in industrial furnaces. These applications have been implemented under the Japanese 'Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP): Energy Carriers'. In addition, fundamental aspects of ammonia combustion are discussed including characteristics of laminar premixed flames, counterflow twin-flames, and turbulent premixed flames stabilized by a nozzle burner at high pressure. Furthermore, this paper discusses details of the chemistry of ammonia combustion related to NOx production, processes for reducing NOx, and validation of several ammonia oxidation kinetics models. Finally, LES results for a gas-turbine-like swirl-burner are presented, for the purpose of developing low-NOx single-fuelled ammonia gas turbine combustors. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In many parts of the world, renewable energy is being considered as an alternative to supply electricity to communities in developing regions. However, even though various technologies are becoming available, there are several socio-environmental constraints that impinge on the viability of ocean energy conversion projects in isolated communities. By assessing environmental restrictions and socioeconomic attributes where electric power may be produced from the ocean can be useful in prioritizing the locations (especially those isolated) where this alternative is more viable. This paper examines socio-economic and environmental factors that may affect the introduction of ocean energy harvesting in areas currently without electricity. Our findings reveal that: a) in the coastal area of the state of Michoacan, southwest Mexico (at < 20 km from the coast and <100 m.a.s.l.), 153 human settlements with over 4,000 inhabitants lack electric power; 16 of these settlements are indigenous; b) economic activities are mostly fisheries and ecotourism; yet, marginalizaion is very high in the area; c) there are four protected areas with nesting sites for several marine turtle species (greater black, hawksbill, leatherback, and green); the "Deep Pacific Sea" natural protected area harbors great biodiversity; and d) electric power may be produced from ocean energy, especially waves, currents and thermal gradients. The infrastructure for grid connection and technical and logistical support is limited, and the topography near the coast is complex. However, our results indicate that the coastal region of Michoacan, has promising sources of ocean energy, especially for isolated settlements with limited, or no, electricity supply. The results show that waves and thermal gradients are viable options for energy generation in the area studied. Considering socioeconomic conditions and environmental restrictions, our observations suggest that, in particular, ocean energy projects might be successfully implemented in two locations on the coast of Michoacan, Future on-site studies into the environmental impact, the percepction and acceptance of society towards the new technologies and economic costs are necessary before implementing these new technologies.

AB  - Anthropogenic CO(2)emissions are projected to lower the pH of the ocean 0.3 units by 2100. Previous studies suggested thatProchlorococcusandSynechococcus, the numerically dominant phytoplankton in the oceans, have different responses to elevated CO(2)that may result in a dramatic shift in their relative abundances in future oceans. Here we showed that the exponential growth rates of these two genera respond to future CO(2)conditions in a manner similar to other cyanobacteria, butProchlorococcusstrains had significantly lower realized growth rates under elevated CO(2)regimes due to poor survival after exposure to fresh culture media. Despite this, aSynechococcusstrain was unable to outcompete aProchlorococcusstrain in co-culture at elevated CO2. Under these conditions,Prochlorococcus' poor response to elevated CO(2)disappeared, andProchlorococcus'relative fitness showed negative frequency dependence, with both competitors having significant fitness advantages when initially rare. These experiments suggested that the two strains should be able to coexist indefinitely in co-culture despite sharing nearly identical nutritional requirements. We speculate that negative frequency dependence exists due to reductive Black Queen evolution that has resulted in a passively mutualistic relationship analogous to that connectingProchlorococcuswith the 'helper' heterotrophic microbes in its environment.

AB  - While survivorship curves typically exhibit smooth declines over time, step -patterned curves can occur with multiple stressors within a life stage. To explore this process, we examined the effects of heat (24 degrees C) and food restriction on juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) in challenge experiments. We observed step -patterned survivorship curves determined by mortality and loss of equilibrium (LOE) endpoints. To examine the cause of heterogeneity in the stress responses from early to late mortality and LOE, we measured indices of energetic reserves. The step transition in the survivorship curves, the peak mortality rates, and start of when individuals reached a critical energetic threshold (14% dry mass; 4.0 kJ.g(-1) energy) all occurred at around days 10-15 of the challenge. The coherence in these temporal patterns suggest heterogeneity in the cohort stress responses, in which an early subgroup died from heat stress and a late subgroup died from starvation. Thus, their endpoint sensitivities resulted in step -patterned survivorship curves. We discuss the implications of the study for understanding effects of multiple stressors on population heterogeneity and note the possible significance of stress response selection under climate change in which heat stress and food limitations occur in concert.

AB  - Ranges of preferred and avoidance temperatures in Cyclops strenuus Fischer, 1851 were determined based on the results of its experimental testing in the thermal gradient device. It is established that the process of temperature selection occurs with an overshoot. It is noted that copepods started to select the final preferred temperatures on the 8th day (temperatures above 26 degrees C were avoided; the avoidance of low temperatures was not recorded). The average value of the critical thermal maximum for the season was determined. It is found that optimal, pessimal, and tolerant temperatures can be calculated on the scale of the species tolerance according to values of preferred and avoidance temperatures as well as according to values of the temperature range of regulation of the critical thermal maximum.

AB  - Induction Heating (IH) method is gaining traction in the field of Additive Manufacturing (AM) as it is a low cost, clean, safe, and precise energy source. Wire as a feedstock material is highly efficient as compared to the powder form in terms of material utilization and economic viability. Thus, the combination of IH and wire feedstock delivery to additive manufacture a part has been explored on an in-house developed novel AM setup. The processing of aluminum wire (Al-5356) in semi-solid form from the extruder, heated using IH method has been performed. The approach adopted in this paper is to perform an in situ infrared imaging to analyze the evolution of thermal field during the extruder heating and metal deposition process. An effective thermal cartography has been undertaken to acquire temperature history of filament, extruder, and deposition process. The temperature profile plot is utilized to understand the temperature distribution and average temperature in the heating, extrusion, and layering process during layer fabrication. The presented work facilitates a priori anticipation to utilize IH as a potential energy source for the metal AM systems.

TI  - Experimental simulation of a martensitic stainless steel coating subjected to thermal fatigue
T2  - REVUE DE METALLURGIE-CAHIERS D INFORMATIONS TECHNIQUES
LA  - French
AB  - Studies of thermal fatigue damage have been an area of ever-growing interest in the industries such as aerospace, nuclear, metallurgy and other industries where metallic structures have been subjected to thermomechanical loadings. Thermal fatigue effects will only be evident, if the thermal cycled structure size is big enough. In this work, we have studied continuous cast cylinders which are components submitted to thermal cycles. The repetition of temperature cycles induces many fractures on material surfaces and could induce cylinder failure. In order to attempt to solve this important technological problem by protecting the surface, a coating was deposited on the cylinder by a semi-transferred plasma are technique; this method provides a coating which is not too diluted into the support.
   In the present work, a martensitic stainless steel was deposited on a cylindrical low alloyed steel substrate, simulating a true cylinder; the specimen used in this study has dimensions of a 1/5 of those of a real cylinder. It was high frequency heated with a pancake type inductor and cooled with a compressed air system on its outer surface and an axial flow cooling water inside; the specimen was rotated at a speed of 1.1 R.P.M. An experimental temperature map was established using two infrared pyrometers for temperature surface measurements and Thermocouples for infernal temperature measurements; these were inserted into the cylinder. The objective of this tridimensional simulation is to obtain the best reproduction of thermal loading of the casting cylinder, When the thermal stabilized cycle is reached (after 15 cycles), twenty temperature measurements were carried out in order to construct the experimental thermal map of the stabilized cycle,
   Furthermore, different experimental maps were constructed from the initial state to the stabilized cycle. The temperature range was established to correspond to typical industrial values, and moreover, the experimental thermal maps will be used to a future numerical simulation of the thermomechanical behaviour of the cylinder. The highest measured temperature was 500 degrees C close to the inductor; the lowest temperatures were measured near the axis at 40 degrees C and also at the end of a generating line at 180 degrees C. Furthermore, residual stresses and deformations were measured in the coating depth before the thermal fatigue experiment and at different periods of the test. These measurements were performed using X Ray and neutron diffraction, before and after thermal fatigue cycles.
   Experiments performed on cylindrical specimens are difficult and expensive; thermal fatigue tests serve only for the verification of the coating toughness and for the construction of thermal maps. The study of the microstructural evolution of the coating was conducted with the help of other smaller specimens, which were submitted to thermal shocks;some microhardness measurements were carried out to estimate hardness variations of the coating. These specimens are small coated cylinders; their thermal cycles were identical with thermal fatigue cycles. Moreover, the temperature evolution of the specimens was adjusted in order to correspond to the thermal evolution of the thermal fatigue coating cylinder. However, only a numerical simulation of these thermal shock experiments will allow to evidence the balance between this simplify test and the thermal fatigue test.
   After 150 fatigue thermal cycles, no cracks were observed on the surface of the cylinder. After 100 additional cycles, with a new higher temperature of 700 degrees C, no damage was evident on the surface. Residual stresses decrease quickly with thermal cycles; decreases in hardness were also correlated with lower yield points.
   Several isothermal mechanical tests were performed on the coating material (low cycle fatigue and relaxation) and on the support to determine their thermomechanical behaviour in the temperature range 20-700 degrees C. The parameters were identified by means of a systematic numerical procedure (a computer program of simulation and identification). The microstructural evolution, during mechanical tests, was examined and related to the evolution of internal variables of the viscoplastic model. It was found that, at every temperature, the material showed cyclic softening behaviour. Moreover at 450 degrees C, a high stress level was correlated with the evolution of the material microstructure and the increase of the kinematic variables of the model. The viscoplastic model chosen in this study permits a good description of, not only the macroscopic mechanical results, but also of the microstructural evolutions of the material,
   An anisothermal constitutive model could be introduced into a numerical procedure; the latter, with the aid of a finite element method, should permit the calculation of the thermomechanical effects of thermal fatigue on structures such as cylinders. It should also permit a comparison between the two tests of thermal fatigue and thermal shocks.

AB  - Water temperature is expected to rise on coral reefs due to global warming. Here, we have examined if increased temperature reduces the hypoxia tolerance of coral reef fish (measured as critical [O-2]), and if temperature acclimation in adults can change the resting rate of O-2 consumption and critical [O-2]. Two common species from Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) were tested, Doederlein's cardinalfish (Ostorhinchus doederleini) and lemon damselfish (Pomacentrus moluccensis). In both species, a 3 degrees C rise in water temperature caused increased oxygen consumption and reduced hypoxia tolerance, changes that were not reduced by acclimation to the higher temperature for 7 to 22 days. Critical [O-2] increased by 71% in the cardinalfish and by 23% in the damselfish at 32 degrees C compared to 29 degrees C. The higher oxygen needs are likely to reduce the aerobic scope, which could negatively affect the capacity for feeding, growth and reproduction. The reduced hypoxia tolerance may force the fishes out of their nocturnal shelters in the coral matrix, exposing them to predation. The consequences for population and species survival could be severe unless developmental phenotypic plasticity within generations or genetic adaptation between generations could produce individuals that are more tolerant to a warmer future.

AB  - 1. In warm climates many insects exhibit discrete generations, in the absence of obvious factors that could synchronize their age structure. It has been hypothesized that parasitoid wasps might be responsible for these oscillations in the host age structure, known as generation cycles.
   2. We examine the role of the parasitoid Anagrus delicatus in the dynamics of the salt-marsh planthopper Prokelisia marginata. In particular, we evaluate the hypothesis that Anagrus contributes to the formation of generation cycles in the hopper, in the subtropical climate of Florida.
   3. Two kinds of evidence are presented. First, we construct continuous-time models of the system that incorporate what is known about Anagrus foraging behaviour, the life cycles of host and parasitoid, and their movements. We then examine the behaviour of these models to determine if Anagrus has the potential to induce generation cycles. We also show how spatial variation in the risk of parasitism can generate 'pseudo-interference' in our continuous-time framework. Secondly, we examine the temporal pattern of host and parasitoid abundance, and parasitism rates in the field. If Anagrus were contributing to the formation of generation cycles, we would expect to see a characteristic pattern of abundance and mortality from parasitism.
   4. Both our modelling and empirical results suggest that Anagrus contributes to generation cycles in Prokelisia. Anagrus has the theoretical prerequisites for generation cycles to occur and in the field generates a cyclic pattern of parasitism that would help induce generation cycles in the planthopper.
   5. The existence of an adult host stage that is invulnerable to parasitism strongly influences the stability of our models. Without this stage Anagrus cannot fully stabilize the system, even if the risk of parasitism varies greatly from patch to patch.

AB  - Background: Genetic maps characterizing the inheritance patterns of traits and markers have been developed for a wide range of species and used to study questions in biomedicine, agriculture, ecology and evolutionary biology. The status of rainbow trout genetic maps has progressed significantly over the last decade due to interest in this species in aquaculture and sport fisheries, and as a model research organism for studies related to carcinogenesis, toxicology, comparative immunology, disease ecology, physiology and nutrition. We constructed a second generation genetic map for rainbow trout using microsatellite markers to facilitate the identification of quantitative trait loci for traits affecting aquaculture production efficiency and the extraction of comparative information from the genome sequences of model fish species.
   Results: A genetic map ordering 1124 microsatellite loci spanning a sex-averaged distance of 2927.10 cM (Kosambi) and having 2.6 cM resolution was constructed by genotyping 10 parents and 150 offspring from the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture ( NCCCWA) reference family mapping panel. Microsatellite markers, representing pairs of loci resulting from an evolutionarily recent whole genome duplication event, identified 180 duplicated regions within the rainbow trout genome. Microsatellites associated with genes through expressed sequence tags or bacterial artificial chromosomes produced comparative assignments with tetraodon, zebrafish, fugu, and medaka resulting in assignments of homology for 199 loci.
   Conclusion: The second generation NCCCWA genetic map provides an increased microsatellite marker density and quantifies differences in recombination rate between the sexes in outbred populations. It has the potential to integrate with cytogenetic and other physical maps, identifying paralogous regions of the rainbow trout genome arising from the evolutionarily recent genome duplication event, and anchoring a comparative map with the zebrafish, medaka, tetraodon, and fugu genomes. This resource will facilitate the identification of genes affecting traits of interest through fine mapping and positional cloning of candidate genes.

AB  - The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Materials Division, has teamed with Navy and industry partners to demonstrate to a high level of confidence the viability of an automated resin transfer molding (RTM) process using automation together with a novel supervisory control and data acquisition system. One objective of the program for NAVAIR was to evaluate novel resin systems for use in RTM processes. This focus of this paper is the thermal characterization of the selected SI-ZG-5A epoxy resin, formulated by A.T.A.R.D. Laboratories. This analysis consists of a comprehensive program of resin characterization and cure modeling. Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC), theology measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to determine the cure kinetics, glass transitions, processing temperature and volatility during cure. The manufacturer's recommended cure cycle was first evaluated to establish a baseline glass transition temperature (T-g), enthalpy of cure, and gel point for the SI-ZG-5A epoxy resin system. Once this analysis was complete, variations of the cure cycle were investigated in order to determine if the cure cycle could be modified. Cure kinetics were also determined using dynamic scanning calorimetry and the variable heating rate method. Finally, a study investigating the effect of mix ratio variations was begun, and preliminary results and cure models developed. In conclusion, the SI-ZG-5A resin system has been found to be a robust RTM resin, forgiving of a wide range of process variations.

AB  - The European brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, is a highly valued commercial species in Europe. These shrimp fisheries are characterized by strong seasonal variations in average landings. Attempts to 'catch and hold' wild adults in land-based rearing systems have been proven to be very difficult, due to inadequate feed, slow growth and high mortality. In this study, we have optimized design and operation procedures of a small-scale static larval rearing system for the culture of C. crangon larvae. Focus was on optimizing larval survival via water temperature, feed selection, feeding regime and density. This is the first report that shows that C. crangon larvae can be reared at high densities of 300 larvae L-1 with high survival of 73.5 (+/- 5.4)% under laboratory conditions. In these systems, larvae can be fed exclusively Artemia nauplii according to a feeding regime which is adjusted based on major moulting events. Addition of microalgae may further increase survival by 10%. The information gathered during this research can be applied to further optimize larval development in either flow-through or recirculation systems.

AB  - Habitat selection behavior is affected by complex interplays between competing requirements. Here we combine field observations with laboratory experiments to examine how thermal benefits and predator avoidance influences habitat selection by different color morphs of the pygmy grasshopper Tetrix undulata. The composition of substrate types and surface temperatures in areas selected by free-ranging individuals did not reflect relative availability, and varied among morphs and sexes. Surface temperatures of selected habitats deviated less from the range of preferred body temperatures than would result from a random utilization of surface temperatures, suggesting that grasshoppers selected habitats with thermal properties which were suitable for maintaining preferred body temperatures. The thermal property of habitats occupied by different color morphs suggests that darker morphs (which absorb more solar radiation) selected cooler habitats to avoid overheating. Dissimilarities in substrate use among color morphs in the field and laboratory emphasize a role also of predator avoidance by background matching for habitat choice. The degree of habitat selectivity was lowest in the striped morph, supporting the notion that a disruptive color pattern may constitute a solution to the trade-off between relative crypsis in different visual backgrounds. Finally, individuals modified their habitat use when subjected to elevated risk of predation, showing that habitat choice is governed by conflicting priorities. Collectively, our findings suggest that, as a result of direct and indirect effects of coloration on performance, alternative color morphs use different solutions to the trade-off between competing requirements. Our results also lend support to the notion that relative fitness of alternative color morphs and sexes may be dependent on microhabitat selection, as predicted by the theory of multiple niche polymorphisms.

AB  - Sky island scorpions shelter under rocks and other surface debris, but, as with other scorpions, it is unclear whether these species select retreat sites randomly. Furthermore, little is known about the thermal preferences of scorpions, and no research has been done to identify whether reproductive condition might influence retreat site selection. The objectives were to (1) identify physical or thermal characteristics for retreat sites occupied by two sky island scorpions (Vaejovis cashi Graham 2007 and V. electrum Hughes 2011) and those not occupied; (2) determine whether retreat site selection differs between the two study species; and (3) identify whether thermal selection differs between species and between gravid and non-gravid females of the same species. Within each scorpion's habitat, maximum dimensions of rocks along a transect line were measured and compared to occupied rocks to determine whether retreat site selection occurred randomly. Temperature loggers were placed under a subset of occupied and unoccupied rocks for 48 hours to compare the thermal characteristics of these rocks. Thermal gradient trials were conducted before parturition and after dispersal of young in order to identify whether gravidity influences thermal preference. Vaejovis cashi and V. electrum both selected larger retreat sites that had more stable thermal profiles. Neither species appeared to have thermal preferences influenced by reproductive condition. However, while thermal selection did not differ among non-gravid individuals, gravid V. electrum selected warmer temperatures than its gravid congener. Sky island scorpions appear to select large retreat sites to maintain thermal stability, although biotic factors (e.g., competition) could also be involved in this choice. Future studies should focus on identifying the various biotic or abiotic factors that could influence retreat site selection in scorpions, as well as determining whether reproductive condition affects thermal selection in other arachnids.

AB  - New design techniques have been developed to optimize continuous casting (CC) refractory components. The overall objective is to increase CC productivity as well as steel quality by using optimized refractory from tundish-to-mold. These techniques allow the prediction of steel and refractory chemical interactions and, thus, steel chemistry evolution as well as build up and corrosion occurrence. Specific fluido-dynamic models (CFD) have also been developed to better take into account the physical parameters at the steel/refractory interface and to optimize steel flow control. The CFD model can be coupled with refractory chemical interactions to simulate steel chemical evolution. These two different approaches result in shape and material modifications. They are completed by dedicated thermal stress analysis in order to improve thermal shock resistance. The mechanical FEA evaluations take into account specific mechanical behavior of refractory components as well as high temperature evolution of their properties.

AB  - Recoding viral genomes by numerous synonymous but suboptimal substitutions provides live attenuated vaccine candidates. These vaccine candidates should have a low risk of deattenuation because of the many changes involved. However, their genetic stability under selective pressure is largely unknown. We evaluated phenotypic reversion of deoptimized human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidates in the context of strong selective pressure. Codon pair deoptimized (CPD) versions of RSV were attenuated and temperature-sensitive. During serial passage at progressively increasing temperature, a CPD RSV containing 2,692 synonymous mutations in 9 of 11 ORFs did not lose temperature sensitivity, remained genetically stable, and was restricted at temperatures of 34 degrees C/35 degrees C and above. However, a CPD RSV containing 1,378 synonymous mutations solely in the polymerase L ORF quickly lost substantial attenuation. Comprehensive sequence analysis of virus populations identified many different potentially deattenuating mutations in the L ORF as well as, surprisingly, many appearing in other ORFs. Phenotypic analysis revealed that either of two competing mutations in the virus transcription antitermination factor M2-1, outside of the CPD area, substantially reversed defective transcription of the CPD L gene and substantially restored virus fitness in vitro and in case of one of these twomutations, also in vivo. Paradoxically, the introduction into Min L of one mutation each in the M2-1, N, P, and L proteins resulted in a virus with increased attenuation in vivo but increased immunogenicity. Thus, in addition to providing insights on the adaptability of genome-scale deoptimized RNA viruses, stability studies can yield improved synthetic RNA virus vaccine candidates.

AB  - For insects, temperature is a major environmental variable that can influence an individual's behavioral activities and fitness. Drosophila melanogaster is a cosmopolitan species that has had great success in adapting to and colonizing diverse thermal niches. This adaptation and colonization has resulted in complex patterns of genetic variation in thermotolerance phenotypes in nature. Although extensive work has been conducted documenting patterns of genetic variation, substantially less is known about the genomic regions or genes that underlie this ecologically and evolutionarily important genetic variation. To begin to understand and identify the genes controlling thermotolerance phenotypes, we have used a mapping population of recombinant inbred (RI) lines to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect variation in both heat- and cold-stress resistance. The mapping population was derived from a cross between two lines of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R and 2b) that were not selected for thermotolerance phenotypes, but exhibit significant genetic divergence for both phenotypes. Using a design in which each RI line was backcrossed to both parental lines, we mapped seven QTL affecting thermotolerance on the second and third chromosomes. Three of the QTL influence cold-stress resistance and four affect heat- stress resistance. Most of the QTL were trait or sex specific, suggesting that overlapping but generally unique genetic architectures underlie resistance to low- and high-temperature extremes. Each QTL explained between 5 and 14% of the genetic variance among lines, and degrees of dominance ranged from completely additive to partial dominance. Potential thermotolerance candidate loci contained within our QTL regions are identified and discussed.

AB  - Armadillidium vulgare is one of the most widely distributed species of Oniscidea. In all strains, seasonal reproduction is synchronized by photoperiodic variations: long days promote the onset of reproduction and prolong the breeding period. There is intraspecific variability in reproduction particularly in relation to latitude. Females originating from high latitudes breed later than those from low latitudes. Under photoperiod of Poitiers (46-degrees-40' N), the lag time is increased by two days per degree of latitude. The ability to remain in reproduction, after a first brood, is also related to the latitudinal origin of the strain: it is higher in the southern strains than in the northern ones. Modifications of temperature and photoperiodic regimes appear the most efficient method to evaluate the reproductive capacity of the females according to whether they stay in reproduction or not, when climatic conditions change.
   Moreover, in A. vulgare, the onset of reproduction is facilitated by the presence of males and there is also geographical variability of the male induced stimulation: the higher the latitude, the lower the male stimulating effect.
   Thus the selection has favoured, in the southern strains, both males and females with the highest capacity to reproduce early in the year and to maintain in reproduction for a long period.
   The role of thermoperiod is to strengthen the inhibiting effect of short days in the strains submitted to climates with a significant thermal day-night variation.
   Reproduction characteristics of each strain persist in females born and reared in the laboratory for several generations and therefore have a genetic basis: a genetic system involving maternal sex linked genes and autosomal genes with additive effects probably controls induction and maintenance of reproduction.

AB  - We describe an emerging framework for understanding variation, selection and evolution of phenotypic traits that are mathematical functions. We use one specific empirical example - thermal performance curves (TPCs) for growth rates of caterpillars - to demonstrate how models for function-valued traits are natural extensions of more familiar, multivariate models for correlated, quantitative traits. We emphasize three main points. First, because function-valued traits are continuous functions, there are important constraints on their patterns of variation that are not captured by multivariate models. Phenotypic and genetic variation in function-valued traits can be quantified in terms of variance-covariance functions and their associated eigenfunctions: we illustrate how these are estimated as well as their biological interpretations for TPCs. Second, selection on a function-valued trait is itself a function, defined in terms of selection gradient functions. For TPCs, the selection gradient describes how the relationship between an organism's performance and its fitness varies as a function of its temperature. We show how the form of the selection gradient function for TPCs relates to the frequency distribution of environmental states (caterpillar temperatures) during selection. Third, we can predict evolutionary responses of function-valued traits in terms of the genetic variance-covariance and the selection gradient functions. We illustrate how non-linear evolutionary responses of TPCs may occur even when the mean phenotype and the selection gradient are themselves linear functions of temperature. Finally, we discuss some of the methodological and empirical challenges for future studies of the evolution of function-valued traits.

AB  - We maintained adult many-lined sun skinks (Mabuya multifasciata; 12 females and 12 males) collected from Hainan (southern China) in September 2006 in two outdoor enclosures to examine the effect of feeding condition on selected body temperature (T-sel). Skinks shifted their thermal preferences when fasted. Temporal variation in T-sel was not found within each sex x feeding condition combination, and neither in fed nor in fasted skinks did the mean values for T-sel differ between sexes. Body temperatures selected by fed skinks fell within the range from 30.2 to 33.9 degrees C, and those selected by fasted skinks within the range from 25.1 to 31.8 degrees C. Body temperatures (31.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) selected by fed skinks were on average 4.0 degrees C higher than those (27.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C) selected by fasted skinks. Fasted skinks had no difficulty in attaining higher body temperatures, but they voluntarily shift their thermal preferences downwards to save energy. This finding suggests an adaptive mechanism adopted by many-lined sun skinks to enhance their fitness during the periods when food availability is low.

AB  - Farmed adult Greenshell (TM) mussels were exposed to a range of conditions immediately after harvest to evaluate the effects on emersion survival and the implications for live transport. Two experiments were performed, coinciding with the mussel harvest season during summer and winter 2017. In the summer experiment, a wide range of conditions were tested to identify alternatives to be evaluated in more detail during the winter experiment. The postharvest experimental conditions selected included transient re-immersion at different temperatures, cold and heat-shock, tidal simulation, and packing with ice. These treatments aimed to either reduce postharvest stress and/or give the mussels a potentially beneficial physiological and behavioural advantage to help them cope with emersion. The mussels responses in terms of gaping and survival differed between summer and winter, and among and within treatments. Sub-ambient temperature seawater exposure after harvest tended to improve the survival time of the mussels in both seasons, the effect being dependent on both temperature and duration of the exposure. Some of the differences observed could be explained by the conditions (in the wild and in the laboratory) to which the mussels were exposed before emersion and the different capability that each mussel has to cope with stress. However, the exact mechanisms driving these changes are not fully understood and require further investigation. This study, nevertheless, indicates that emersion survival (i.e. live mussel shelf-life) could be extended by re-immersion after harvest combined with a sub-lethal cold-shock followed by immersed recovery before transportation. If the commercial shelf-life of live product can be significantly extended, the implications for food quality and safety will also need to be evaluated. A similar approach could be applied in other shellfish such as other species of mussels as well as oysters or clams to improve shelf-life, considering their physiological capabilities and behaviour and how those are affected by environmental conditions in different seasons or regions.

AB  - The object of this study is the investigation of polygeneration plants utilizing solar energy in order to produce power products on the scale of a few MW. Parabolic trough collectors are used in order to exploit solar irradiation and to provide the generated heat to the polygeneration/trigeneration cycle in a high-temperature range (500-570 degrees C). The plants under consideration additionally consist of a storage tank, a Brayton cycle with s-CO2, a LiBr-H2O absorption chiller and also the installation of a suitable thermodynamic organic Rankine cycle (ORC) cycle is examined in order to utilize waste heat for further power generation. The systems are first investigated for operation under steady-state conditions and then for dynamic conditions on an annual basis. Based on the final annual results of the plants, the plant in which ORC was not used shows annual electrical, exergy and energy efficiencies equal to 18.33%, 23.37% and 54.91% respectively, while the plant in which ORC was used similarly shows 19.05%, 23.63% and 49.00%. According to economic analysis, the payback period was found at 6.37 years without ORC and 6.51 years with ORC. Taking into account the operational and techno-economic results of the plants it can be concluded that the plants produce satisfactory energy products ensuring also the economic viability of the investment.

AB  - Due to high environmental concerns and ever-increasing fossil fuel costs, generation of clean energy and its optimal management considering the demand side responses are very essential to upsurge the productivity and reliability of the distribution grids. Hence, a kind of distributed microgrid identified as multi-energy generation grid (MEGG) has been proposed in this paper. The anticipated MEGG integrated with renewable energy resources, fuel cells (FCs), an alternative grid-supporting generator (AGSG) connected with boiler, micro-turbine (MT), and thermal system, wastes burning power plant (WBPP), and energy storage system (ESS) that investigate the optimal resource management in a grid under various operational conditions to minimize the emissions and operational costs. The problem is supervised by agents-based technique considering the generation capabilities and demand side responses. The three-layered technique is presented for the distributed optimal resource management based on multi-agent systems (MAS) framework, where different agents operate and perform tasks autonomously. An optimal energy management scheduling strategy is accomplished considering actions that guarantee the maximum use of generated renewable energy, eradicate the excess use of WBPP and FC, minimize AGSG operational time, and full-load demands satisfaction during the entire day. Similarly, coordination between the MEGG and central power grid has also been accomplished for the purpose to exchange power. For validation, three scenarios have been presented which shows that the combined utilization of distributed energy resources can profusely generate electricity having less emissions, recover the generation costs in peak hours, and enhance the reliability of the entire grid.

AB  - Grate firing is one of the main competing technologies in biomass combustion for steam and electricity generation. Ash generated in the furnace during combustion process would greatly reduce the boiler thermal performance and may lead to unscheduled shutdown. The focus of this study is to optimize the combustion characteristics of the mixture of palm kernel shell (PKS) and selected additives (Al2O3, MgO and CaO) to develop a fuel mixture of low ash yield and higher heating value (HHV). D-Optimal Design under Cross Methodology of Design Expert (6.08) was employed to mix the components alongside various particle sizes. The mixed samples were ashed in a muffle furnace (848K) to a constant weight and their HHV were determined using Ballistic Bomb Calorimeter. Combustion test based on optimized PKS additive mixture was conducted with a 5kW grate furnace from which the effects of varying the ratio of primary to secondary air flow rate on temperatures and flue gas compositions from the furnace were measured. The ash obtained after combustion process was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the purpose of identifying the mineral phase compounds that are present in PKS and PKS-additive ash. The optimum composition obtained for the process was 2.5, 0.0, 5.0, 92.5% and 5.50mm for additives (Al2O3, MgO, CaO), PKS and particle size, respectively. The composition resulted in lowest ash yield (0.56%) and HHV (20.64kJ/g). The coefficient of determination (R-2) (0.7951 and 0.7344) and least-square errors (0.19 and 0.024) of the prediction model indicated a close fitness to the experiment results obtained for ash yield and HHV. Primary to secondary air ratio of (40:60) recorded maximum temperature (1058K), minimum level of CO (285ppm) and 6% oxygen. XRD results showed excellent interaction between PKS and additives. The appearance of potassium-alumino silicate (KAlSiO4) in the PKS-additive ash prevented the release of potassium chloride which has the ability to increase ash deposition and corrosion.

AB  - Physiological trait variation underlies health, responses to global climate change, and ecological performance. Yet, most physiological traits are complex, and we have little understanding of the genes and genomic architectures that define their variation. To provide insight into the genetic architecture of physiological processes, we related physiological traits to heart and brain mRNA expression using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis. mRNA expression was used to explain variation in six physiological traits (whole animal metabolism (WAM), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and four substrate specific cardiac metabolic rates (CaM)) under 12 degrees C and 28 degrees C acclimation conditions. Notably, the physiological trait variations among the three geographically close (within 15 km) and genetically similar F. heteroclitus populations are similar to those found among 77 aquatic species spanning 15-20 degrees of latitude (similar to 2,000 km). These large physiological trait variations among genetically similar individuals provide a powerful approach to determine the relationship between mRNA expression and heritable fitness related traits unconfounded by interspecific differences. Expression patterns explained up to 82% of metabolic trait variation and were enriched for multiple signaling pathways known to impact metabolic and thermal tolerance (e.g., AMPK, PPAR, mTOR, FoxO, and MAPK) but also contained several unexpected pathways (e.g., apoptosis, cellular senescence), suggesting that physiological trait variation is affected by many diverse genes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate species and provenances of Eucalyptus spp., selecting those with high survival and productive potential under the conditions of the Santa Catarina Plateau. The test is located in the municipality of Rio Negrinho, northern Santa Catarina state. The stand was established in December 1999 with thirteen species of the genus Eucalyptus, originating from seeds of different origins. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design with three replications and linear plots. The variables evaluated were survival (%), height (m), diameter at breast height (cm), volume (m 3 ) and bifurcation of the individuals. Potential species in relation to quantitative characteristics were E. smithii, E. dunnii, E. benthamii, E. badjensis and E. dorrigoensis. For the qualitative variables E. badjensis, E. macarthurii, E. benthamii and E. dorrigoensis presented the best results. It was possible to verify the wide variability of the characteristics evaluated between provenances, highlighting the importance of choosing adapted genetic materials with superior quantitative characteristics. The study shows that other Eucalyptus species, besides those usually planted in the region, have a potential for commercial stands, tolerating low temperatures, frost occurrence and good productivity.

AB  - Mold infections in almonds are a safety issue during post-harvest, storage and consumption, leading to health problems for consumers and causing economic losses. The aim of this study was to isolate mold from infected almond kernels and identify it by whole genome sequence (WGS). Then, the more heat resistant mold was selected and the thermal inactivation kinetics of this mold influenced by temperature and water activity (a(w)) was developed. Hot air-assisted radio frequency (RF) heating was used to validate pasteurization efficacy based on the thermal inactivation kinetics of this target mold. The results showed that the two types of molds were Penicillium and Aspergillus identified by WGS. The selected Aspergillus had higher heat resistance than the Penicillium in the almond kernels. Inactivation data for the target Aspergillus fitted the Weibull model better than the first-order kinetic model. The population changes of the target Aspergillus under the given conditions could be predicted from Mafart's modified Bigelow model. The RF treatment was effectively used for inactivating Aspergillus in almond kernels based on Mafart's modified Bigelow model and the cumulative lethal time model.

AB  - The infective juvenile is a free-living stage of entomopathogenic nematodes (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae) that serves three main functions: dispersal, host finding, and survival under environmental conditions detrimental to other life stages. Here, we summarize the research on the physiology, genetics, and molecular biology of chemoreception, thermobiosis, and anhydrobiosis in the infective juveniles. Chemoreception studies in Heterorhabditis bacteriophora indicate that the adoption of the parasitic mode of life is associated with a reduced sensitivity to volatile by-products of bacterial metabolism and an increased sensitivity towards long-chain alcohols and other insect-specific volatiles. Thermobiosis and anhydrobiosis studies reveal that entomopathogenic nematode infective juveniles use a global stress tolerance response that may be triggered during acclimation to a novel temperature or desiccation regime. Once this global stress response is induced, the nematodes acquire resistance to a multitude of factors including cold, heat, desiccation, ultraviolet radiation, and pH. Physiological mechanisms manifested by entomopathogenic nematode infective juveniles during survival under cold or warm conditions include the alteration in the proportion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, alterations in the activity of metabolic enzymes, synthesis of novel isozymes, sugars, and polyols including trehalose and glucose, and heat-shock proteins. It is apparent that thermal niche breadths of entomopathogenic nematodes are conserved, but they can be altered through genetic selection at constant temperatures. Infective juveniles can undergo anhydrobiosis within and outside the host cadaver. The physiological mechanisms to undergo anhydrobiosis include the synthesis of polyols, sugars such as trehalose, alterations in the fatty acid composition, and the synthesis of several low molecular weight proteins. With the significant progress made in unraveling the steps involved in olfactory signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans, homology-based approaches are now being used to isolate chemosensory genes in H. bacteriophora. Using a variety of cloning techniques and subtractive hybridization, several genes involved in chemoreception, heat tolerance, and anhydrobiosis of entomopathogenic nematodes have been isolated. These discoveries together with the availability of new molecular and genomic tools serve as a solid platform for the improvement of biological control potential of entomopathogenic nematodes.

AB  - Bacteria have evolved diverse mechanisms to survive environments with antibiotics. Temperature is both a key factor that affects the survival of bacteria in the presence of antibiotics and an environmental trait that is drastically increasing due to climate change. Therefore, it is timely and important to understand links between temperature changes and selection of antibiotic resistance. This review examines these links by synthesizing results from laboratories, hospitals, and environmental studies. First, we describe the transient physiological responses to temperature that alter cellular behavior and lead to antibiotic tolerance and persistence. Second, we focus on the link between thermal stress and the evolution and maintenance of antibiotic resistance mutations. Finally, we explore how local and global changes in temperature are associated with increases in antibiotic resistance and its spread. We suggest that a multidisciplinary, multiscale approach is critical to fully understand how temperature changes are contributing to the antibiotic crisis.

AB  - Changes in climate are affecting the distribution and status of species on a global scale, through alteration of factors including their phenology, growth and ecological interactions. These alterations are often most apparent at species range edges, where changes to conditions previously limiting the species distribution can result in range shifts. In this paper, we review the rapid recent increase in our understanding of the factors limiting the distribution of a species to explore how the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors is likely to significantly alter its range edge behaviour beyond our current predictive capacity. We focus on Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L), one of the most abundant tree species on the globe. Glacial refugia and colonisation routes after last glacial maximum have strongly influenced the genetic diversity and local adaptation of this species. Over recent decades, increased reproduction and growth has been detected at the northern limit of P. sylvestris as a response to increased temperature, whereas at its southern limit, increased drought stress has resulted in decreased growth, low recruitment, and in some cases a massive mortality of this species. In addition, direct climatic effects on the species are acting together with indirect effects due to altered biotic interactions including outbreaks of insects, pathogens, and parasites, and increased herbivory linked to declining ecosystem productivity. However, whilst predictive studies forecast a gradual decline of the species at the southern range limit and expansion at higher latitudes, models do not commonly include biotic factors, which can significantly modify the response of the species to climatic changes. We conclude by discussing the early detection of imperilled areas and how their natural resistance and resilience to ongoing climatic changes might be increased. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main gas-to-liquids (GTL) interest now is in Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis of hydrocarbons. While synthesis gas (syngas) for GTL can be produced from any carbon-based feedstock (hydrocarbons, coal, petroleum coke, biomass), the lowest cost routes to syngas so far are based on natural gas. Thus, the focus for GTL has been largely on associated gas, so-called stranded or remotely located gas reserves, and larger gas reserves that are not currently being economically exploited. The principal technologies for producing syngas from natural gas are: catalytic steam methane reforming (SMR), two-step reforming, autothermal reforming (ATR), partial oxidation (POX), and heat exchange reforming. The distinguishing characteristics of these technologies and their commercial uses are discussed in this paper. Ongoing R&D efforts to develop lower-cost syngas generation technologies are also briefly discussed.
   Relevant commercial experience with large-scale syngas generation for GTL is also discussed. As a frame of reference, in terms of syngas flow rates, a 20,000 b/day F-T plant would be comparable to three 2500 mt/day methanol plants. Single-train methanol plants are now producing more than 2500 t/day-and plants approaching 3000 mt/day have been announced. The projected relative economies of scale of the various syngas production technologies indicate that two-step reforming and ultimately, ATR, should be the technologies of choice for large-scale GTL plants. Nevertheless, for a 20,000 b/day F-T liquids plant, capital charges still dominate the manufacturing costs. Syngas production (oxygen plant and reforming) comprises half of the total capital cost of this size GTL plant. While air-blown reforming eliminates the expensive oxygen plant, air-blown reforming is unlikely to be competitive with, or offer the flexibility of, oxygen-blown reforming. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed.
   The proposed and future GTL facilities should be substantially less costly than their very expensive predecessors-as the result of improvements in FT catalyst and reactor design, the most significant of which have been pioneered by Sasol. In the absence of a breakthrough technology, economy of scale will be the only significant mechanism by which GTL can achieve greater economic viability. However, even with such further cost reductions, the economic viability of GTL plants will remain confined to special situations until crude price levels rise substantially. In the long term, if a ceramic membrane reactor (combining air separation and partial oxidation) can be developed that enables the 20% reduction in GTL investment costs that the R&D effort is targeting, GTL could become economically viable at crude prices below US$20/b.

AB  - In this study, airborne MS2 bacteriophages were exposed for subsecond time intervals to atmospheric-pressure cold plasma (APCP) produced using different power levels (20, 24, and 28 W) and gas carriers (ambient air, Ar-O-2 [ 2%, vol/ vol], and He-O-2 [ 2%, vol/ vol]). In addition, waterborne MS2 viruses were directly subjected to the APCP treatment for up to 3 min. MS2 viruses with and without the APCP exposure were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR), and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Viral inactivation was shown to exhibit linear relationships with the APCP generation power and exposure time (R-2 > 0.95 for all energy levels tested) up to 95% inactivation (1.3-log reduction) after a subsecond airborne exposure at 28 W; about the same inactivation level was achieved for waterborne viruses with an exposure time of less than 1 min. A larger amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as atomic oxygen, in APCP was detected for a higher generation power with Ar-O-2 and He-O-2 gas carriers. SEM images, SDS-PAGE, and agarose gel analysis of exposed waterborne viruses showed various levels of damage to both surface proteins and their related RNA genes after the APCP exposure, thus leading to the loss of their viability and infectivity.

AB  - Polymer/ceramic composite emerges as a novel material system for application as integral capacitors for the next generation of microelectronic industry where the discrete passive components such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors are likely to be replaced by the embedded components. In this study, epoxy based nanocomposites are selected due to their low-cost and low temperature processing advantages in comparison to the traditional polymers used in the microelectronic industry today. Other potential advantages of epoxy materials could be their aqueous based fabrication process and availability in the form of dry films for direct lamination onto substrates. This paper reports dielectric properties of epoxy nanocomposites made from three commercially available resin composites (i) a solvent based photodefinable epoxy, (ii) an aqueous based photodefinable epoxy, and (iii) a non-photodefinable epoxy. Possible avenues for achieving higher capacitance density in polymer/ceramic composites for future needs have been discussed. Deposition of polymer/ceramic thin films on a 300 mm x 300 mm PWB and glass substrates has been demonstrated using a state-of-the-art meniscus coater. The end goal of this study is to develop a defect-free manufacturable process for depositing and patterning particulate epoxy composite capacitors on large area PWB substrates. It is believed that the large area process will reduce the overall manufacturing costs and increase process yield, thus facilitate the economic viability of the integral passive technology.

AB  - In this paper, performances of some zeotropic mixtures in Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) have been assessed and evaluated for potential of utilizing the low-temperature and -caloric geothermal water. The options of single power generation and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production through the common series and parallel configurations have been considered. The possible optimization of these applications when using the mixtures opposite pure fluids is the main objective and has been largely discussed. To reach this, the maximal power output level has been mainly focused as evaluation factor for variety of the heat source temperatures (up to 120) and heat consumer parameters. The results showed that in case of stand-alone ORC the mixtures: R438A, R422A and R22M are more efficient than the pure fluids advised and can enhance the power productivity and geothermal water utilization at the sources' temperatures 80, 100 and 120 degrees C, respectively. R407A and R22D also offer attractive outputs at source temperatures of 80 degrees C and 100 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, compared to R601a in the series CHP option using R22M in the parallel CHP circuit at heat source temperature 120 degrees C is more feasible and enables considerable promotions for a wide field of conditions. Similarly, R422A at source temperature 100 degrees C is also energetically favorable, but only at conditions matching the low till moderate heat loads or high supply temperatures. Finally, R22M and R422A are always much better than the pure R227ea in the parallel ORC-CHP system within this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Virtually all aspects of insect biology are affected by body temperature, and many taxa have evolved sophisticated temperature-control mechanisms. All insects, however, begin life as eggs and lack the ability to thermoregulate. Eggs laid on leaves experience a thermal environment, and thus a body temperature, that is strongly influenced by the leaves themselves. Because plants can maintain leaf temperatures that differ from ambient, e. g. by evapotranspiration, plant hosts may protect eggs from extreme ambient temperatures. We examined the degree to which leaves buffer ambient thermal variation and whether that buffering benefits leaf-associated insect eggs. In particular, we: (1) measured temperature variation at oviposition sites in the field, (2) manipulated temperatures in the laboratory to determine the effect of different thermal conditions on embryo development time and survival, and (3) tested embryonic metabolic rates over increasing temperatures. Our results show that Datura wrightii leaves buffer Manduca sexta eggs from fatally high ambient temperatures in the southwestern USA. Moreover, small differences in temperature profiles among leaves can cause large variation in egg metabolic rate and development time. Specifically, large leaves were hotter than small leaves during the day, reaching temperatures that are stressfully high for eggs. This study provides the first mechanistic demonstration of how this type of leaf-constructed thermal refuge interacts with egg physiology.

AB  - Global climate change (GCC) can negatively affect freshwater ecosystems. However, the degree to which freshwater populations can acclimate to long-term warming and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We used the cooling water discharge (CWD) area of a power plant as a model for long-term warming. Survival and molecular stress responses (expression of molecular chaperones, antioxidants, bioenergetic and protein synthesis biomarkers) to experimental warming (20-41 degrees C, + 1.5 degrees C per day) were assessed in invasive clams Corbicula fluminea from two pristine populations and a CWD population. CWD clams had considerably higher (by similar to 8-12 degrees C) lethal temperature thresholds than clams from the pristine areas. High thermal tolerance of CWD clams was associated with overexpression of heat shock proteins HSP70, HSP90 and HSP60 and activation of protein synthesis at 38 degrees C. Heat shock response was prioritized over the oxidative stress response resulting in accumulation of oxidative lesions and ubiquitinated proteins during heat stress in CWD clams. Future studies should determine whether the increase in thermal tolerance in CWD clams are due to genetic adaptation and/or phenotypic plasticity. Overall, our findings indicate that C. fluminea has potential to survive and increase its invasive range during warming such as expected during GCC.

AB  - Deployment of fossil fuels to quench the energy demand of the world's rising population results in elevated levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially CO2, which in turn is responsible for undesirable climate change. This necessitates a shift toward cleaner energy resources such as hydrogen. Enhanced hydrogen production via steam reforming of diverse fuels (methane, biomass, organic wastes, etc.) with in-situ CO2-sorption seems to be a promising alternative. Leading-edge, innovative and eco-friendly pathways coupled with high process efficiencies are needed for the development and growth of this technology. This review article evaluates the fundamental concepts such as criteria for CO2 uptake, mechanisms, thermodynamics and kinetics of the water gas shift reaction along with different modeling methods for sorption enhanced processes. Moreover, research works carried out worldwide at lab-scale coupled with process development and demonstration units are discussed as a means to encourage this pathway for H-2 generation. Furthermore, light is shed on techno-economics as an approach to improve the viability and sustainability of the proposed technology. This paper analyzes different dimensions of the CO2-sorption enhanced process to promote it as a potentially carbon-neutral and ecofriendly pathway for hydrogen production.

AB  - A full-scale biodrying installation was treating 150 kton (wet weight) of dewatered waste activated sludge per year. The waste was treated at thermophilic conditions (65-75 degrees C) in a 2-step forced aeration process reducing the total wet sludge weight by 73%. The final product had a high caloric value (7700-10,400 (kJ/kg)), allowing a combustion for energy generation in external facilities. The resulting product met the European microbial and heavy metal quality standards needed for an application as organic fertilizer. The facility used <0.5 MW of electricity and recovered 9.3 MW from biologically produced heat, which was internally used for the heating of office buildings. Produced ammonia, originating from the microbial conversion of organic matter, was recovered from the ventilated air in an acid gas scrubber as an ammonium sulphate solution 40% (w/w) (7.3 kton/year) and was sold as substitute for artificial fertilizers. The sustainability of this process is discussed relative to other sludge handling processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The genetic mechanism of cool temperature resistance at the booting stage of rice, is largely unknown in spite of the significance in rice cultivation. We have screened 317 M2 lines derived from chemically mutagenized cv. Taichung 65 which is highly resistant to cool temperature. Repeated screening from M3 through M6 generation recovered seven cool temperature sensitive mutants. They showed significantly lower seed fertility than Taichung 65 when treated with cool water (19-degrees-C). Although the seed fertility fluctuated to some extent with years, four of the seven mutants showed very low seed fertility and one relatively high but significantly lower seed fertility than Taichung 65. The remaining two showed intermediate values. Segregation of seed fertility in F2 plants between Taichung 65 and the mutants suggested that many of the mutants were due to single-gene recessive mutations. In four mutants, pollen development was severely damaged by cool water treatment. Also female organ (embryosac) was malformed in some mutants. These seven mutants are potential materials for the investigation of cool resistance in rice.

TI  - Results of Reservoir Modeling of the Operation and Production of a Recompleted Gas Well in a Geopressured/Geothermal Reservoir in the Wilcox Formation, Texas, for Electricity Generation

AB  - Reservoir modeling of production of hot geothermal fluid and natural gas from a geopressured reservoir in the Wilcox formation, Texas, for geothermal-electricity generation is carried out primarily on the basis of well-log data. The reservoir modeling takes into account operational considerations such as a constant target flow rate, a 30-year reservoir lifetime, and minimum wellhead pressure as well as uncertainty in reservoir parameters such as gas saturation and reservoir volume. The results of the reservoir modeling are presented and their relevance to other similar geopressured/geothermal wells with the potential for natural-gas production is discussed.
   Geopressured/geothermal reservoirs are found throughout the Texas and Louisiana Gulf coast region, generally starting at depths below 8,000 ft, and are characterized by high-temperature/high-pressure, brine-saturated layers of interbedded shales and sandstones with correspondingly large quantities of dissolved natural gas. The temperature of the brine from these formations is high enough that it could be used to run organic Rankine cycle or binary power plants to generate electricity, whereas the dissolved natural gas in the brine could be simultaneously collected and used to generate additional electricity or be sold as a byproduct. However, there is uncertainty about whether these reservoirs can maintain adequate production over the 30-plus-year lifetime of the power plant, and about what the natural-gas-production profiles would look like over this lifetime to supplement revenue from the geothermal-electricity production. This paper uses reservoir modeling to simulate the operation and production of a recompleted gas well in a geopressured/geothermal reservoir in the Wilcox formation, Texas, to assess the feasibility of the use of such reservoirs to produce a constant flow rate of high-temperature brine over a 30-year production lifetime for electricity generation.
   Reservoir modeling is a tool that can help predict fluid-flow rate and natural-gas production from complex reservoirs over a long-term time frame. Multiphase-flow reservoir modeling is used in this study to provide insight on the viability of recovering hot geothermal brine for electricity production over a time frame of 30 years by use of an existing natural-gas well. For this study, data from an abandoned gas well in the Wilcox formation in Texas, including a well log and fluid-chemistry data, are used to create a reservoir model with multiple layers of sandstone and shale with properties inferred from the well log and flow tests. The modeling also considers the impact of the well-operation limitations for the abandoned well after it is recompleted, such as a maximum frictional pressure drop in the well, on the geothermal-brine- and methane-production profiles. To assess the impact of key reservoir characteristics such as reservoir volume and gas saturation on the flow rate of geothermal brine and natural gas over the long term, a parametric-sensitivity analysis is completed by use of a range of reasonable values for these key reservoir parameters.
   For all the reservoir volumes considered (1.42 x 10(7) to 5.90 x 10(7) acre-ft), the flow rate of both geothermal brine and natural gas is sustained over the 30-year production period and it is determined that reservoir longevity is not an issue for electricity production. The free-phase-gas saturation has an observable impact on flow, with a higher free-gas saturation leading to lower geothermal-brine-and methane-flow rates caused by gas choking the flow in the near-well region. Overall, the multiphase reservoir modeling results indicate that for the reservoir considered, the well can be operated so that production of hot geothermal brine can be maintained over the lifetime of a binary power plant close to the target flow rates and that the quantities of natural gas produced would be significant for the overall power-plant-project economics.

AB  - Performance of the thermally-driven metal hydride hydrogen compressor (MHHC) is defined by (a) its H-2 compression ratio and maximum output H-2 pressure; (b) throughput productivity/average output flow rate; (c) specific thermal energy consumption which determines H-2 compression efficiency. In earlier studies, the focus of the R&D efforts was on the optimisation of the design of the MH containers and heat and mass transfer in the MH storage and compression systemaimed at shortening the time of the H-2 compression cycle. This work considers an important but insufficiently studied aspect of the development of the industrial-scale thermally driven MHHC's - selection of the materials and optimisation of the materials performance. Further to the operation in the specified pressure/temperature ranges, materials selection should be based on the estimation of the productivity of the compression cycle, and specific heat consumption required for the H-2 compression, which together determine the process efficiency.
   The current work presents a model to determine productivity and heat consumption for a single- and multi-stage MHHC's which is based on use of Pressure - Composition - Temperature (PCT) diagrams of the utilized metal hydrides at defined operating conditions e temperatures and hydrogen pressures - and main operational features of the MHHC (number of stages, amounts of the MH materials used, cycle time). In Part I of this work [Lototskyy, Yartys, et al., Int J Hydrogen Energy, DOI: 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.090], we showed that the calculated cycle productivities significantly vary for the different materials. Analysis of the system performance carried out in this work (Part II) shows that the throughput productivity and efficiency of a multi-stage MHHC also depends on the types and amounts of the used MH materials in the multi-stage compressor layout. This has been analysed for a number of the most practically important AB(5) and Laves type AB(2) hydrogen storage alloys integrated into the MHHC's.
   A comparison of experimentally measured performances of single-, two- and three-stage industrial-scale MHHC's developed by the authors earlier shows their satisfactory agreement with the modelling results thus demonstrating a high value of the presented method for the proper materials selection during development of the MHHC. As an important future development, the work presents a performance evaluation of a two-stage MHHC for H-2 compression operating in the pressure range from 30 to 500 atm at operating temperatures between 20 and 150 degrees C.

AB  - We present here a mechanistic view of adsorption processes for separation of gas mixtures. The moving-bed adsorber (abandoned due to practical difficulties) is shown to offer orders of magnitude higher productivity than the conventional pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and yields 'perfect separation'. To realize its potential in fixed beds, simulated moving bed (SMB) with pressure or thermal swing and 3-bed and 4-bed PSAs that emulate moving-bed adsorbers have been proposed. Based on their characteristics of phase equilibria and separating agents employed, a classification of adsorption processes has been proposed as 'absorption like', 'distillation like' and 'chromatographic' processes, which provides insight into these processes and a rational basis for their design. The mechanism of separation in moving bed, SMB and the conventional PSA are shown to be similar to that of either absorption or distillation. On the other hand, the duplex, molecular-gate and rapid PSAs are shown to share the same separation mechanism that is akin to heat-transfer mechanism in heat regenerators. Subtle but significant differences in the role of 'reflux' in absorption-like and distillation-like processes and their implications in process design have been highlighted. Though process intensification in molecular-gate PSA and duplex PSA is modest compared to the SMB, they appear to hold promise since they are based on a proven technology. Their adaptability for absorption and extraction using immobilized solvent has been presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among environmental factors, temperature has a direct and crucial influence on the key life processes of survival, development, reproduction, and movement of poikilothermic animals and hence their population dynamics. The lower and upper temperature thresholds and optimal temperature have ramifications for all major life processes, where within a specific range, a temperature change results in a proportional rise or fall of the rate of any given process. There are some basic approaches for modeling development response to temperature in arthropods. The oldest and most widely used model is a simple linear description of arthropod development in relation to temperature. The linear model forms the basis of the well-known thermal summation or degree-day (DD) approach to timing prediction. The second approach for predicting arthropod development rate is nonlinear mathematical models. However, given the fundamental role of thermal models in forecasting and integrated pest management programs, the main purpose of this paper was to facilitate the use of thermal models to estimate the developmental response of arthropods to temperature and select the appropriate model with a view to goodness-of-fit and generalizability by designing a user-friendly software. In this paper, the linear and most common nonlinear thermal models and the main criteria for selecting appropriate models are also reviewed.

AB  - Brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), is an invasive pest of Asian origin first detected in North Carolina in 2009. By 2015, it became an important pest in the mountain and Piedmont regions, but its population densities have remained low in the eastern plains regions. Starting with a cohort of diapausing adults in January of 2018 and 2019, semi-field cage studies were used to document the phenology and reproductive capacity of H. halys through October of each year at Mills River (mountains) and Goldsboro (Southeastern Plains) sites, which have the same photoperiod, but different temperature profiles. Halyomorpha halys was univoltine in the cooler mountain site, but bivoltine in the warmer plains site, leading to earlier emergence from overwintering diapause, greater heat unit accumulations, and a F1 adult generation that emerged before on-set of diapause-inducing conditions, which allowed for an F2 generation. However, only 17.2% of ovipositing F1 females laid egg masses that hatched, compared to > 90% of overwintered females. Poor establishment of H. halys in the plains versus mountains was attributed to heat stress that contributed to a higher percentage of overwintered adults that emerged early and did not oviposit, a truncated oviposition pattern by overwintered adults, and poor F2 egg hatch. Quadratic equations fit relationships between cumulative degree-days from biofix and proportional oviposition and adult eclosion of respective generations. Utility of the phenology model on a wider scale will depend on how well H. halys populations in other areas conform to North Carolina population's response to photoperiod and temperature.

AB  - Rivers are critical to agriculture, industry, and the needs of humans and wildlife. This study evaluates the water quality of the Beheshtabad River in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, using water quality index and multivariate statistical methods. Nitrate, temperature, phosphate, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, total solids, and pH were measured at five selected stations along the river over 6months using standard methods. Water quality index results demonstrated that water quality varied in the selected stations between average and good and that pollution in this section of the Beheshtabad River increases from upstream to downstream. Clustering and principal component analysis were also utilized. Multivariate statistical methods were used to analyze water conditions for efficient management of surface water quality. Agricultural fertilizers, upstream wastewater discharge, and fish farms constitute the main elements that decrease the water quality of the Beheshtabad River. To preserve this water resource against pollution, the implementation of stringent rules and guidelines are needed to enhance health and preserve water resources for future generations.

AB  - Significance: The increased activities of free radicals or reactive oxygen species in tissues of exercising humans and animals were first reported similar to 30 years ago. A great deal has been learned about the processes that can generate these molecules, but there is little agreement on which are important, how they are controlled, and there are virtually no quantitative data. Superoxide and nitric oxide are generated by skeletal muscle and their reactions lead to formation of secondary species. A considerable amount is known about control of superoxide generation by xanthine oxidase activity, but similar information for other generation systems is lacking. Recent Advances: Re-evaluation of published data indicates potential approaches to quantification of the hydrogen peroxide concentration in resting and contracting muscle cells. Such calculations reveal that, during contractions, intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentrations in skeletal muscle may only increase by similar to 100 nM. The primary effects of this modest increase appear to be in "redox'' signaling processes that mediate some of the responses and adaptations of muscle to exercise. These act, in part, to increase the expression of cytoprotective proteins (e.g., heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes) that help maintain cell viability. During aging, these redox-mediated adaptations fail and this contributes to age-related loss of skeletal muscle. Critical Issues and Future Directions: Understanding the control of ROS generation in muscle and the effect of aging and some disease states will aid design of interventions to maintain muscle mass and function, but is dependent upon development of new analytical approaches. The final part of this review indicates areas where such developments are occurring. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 15, 2477-2486.

AB  - In winter, brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis demonstrated poor osmoregulatory ability. Salt-water (SW) transfer resulted in sharp increases in plasma osmolality and chloride levels, a decrease in white muscle water content and high mortality. A clear improvement of the hypo-osmoregulatory mechanism efficiency was observed in spring; by May or June, fish achieved full acclimation within 1 week of SW transfer. In early fall, the time needed to restore osmotic and ionic balance increased once again. A high level of stress was detected only in winter and fall, as indicated by plasma cortisol and glucose concentrations. Great improvement in osmotic and ionic regulation was observed when brook charr were transferred to 8 degrees C SW in February and April while impaired SW adaptability was recorded in individuals transferred to 2.5 degrees C SW in June and August. Temperature itself was more important than a thermal gradient between fresh and salt water. Stress indicators substantiate this temperature-dependent improvement of osmotic and ionic regulation in brook charr. The results support the hypothesis of a minor contribution of cortisol to hypo-osmotic regulation in brook charr, as the cortisol response always seemed to be associated with stress in the experiments.

AB  - Room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery is considered to be a promising candidate for next-generation batteries due to its high theoretical energy density (similar to 1274 Wh kg(-1)) and natural abundance of elements. There are however, a number of concomitant challenges, including large volume change, low ionic conductivity, rapid dendrite growth, and high chemical reactivity, which limit the viability of sodium anodes. Solid electrolyte interphases that address all 4 challenges simultaneously to enable high-rate cycling of sodium anodes remain scarce in the literature. Here we report an artificial metal-alloy interphase (MAI) comprising sodium-tin alloy, which was synthesized using a facile solid-vapor reaction of metallic sodium with tin tetrachloride vapors, instead of using typical liquid electrolytes with tin-based additives (solid-liquid reaction). The MAI was found to facilitate reversible deposition of sodium at relatively high current densities (2-7 mA cm(-2)), and allows sodium electrodes to cycle stably for over 650 cycles at 2 mA cm(-2) in sodium symmetric cells. Owing to the unique properties of MAI, such as strong electrode adhesion (to accommodate volume change), high ionic conductivity (to minimize overpotential), high Young's modulus (to suppress dendrite growth), and low electrolyte permeability (to minimize electrolyte reduction), the sodium anode with MAI can endure extended cycling test in sodium-sulfur batteries for over 500 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. This solid-vapor chemistry concept to synthesize MAIs can also be generalized to other material systems such as sodium-silicon and sodium-titanium alloys.

AB  - Rapidly rising temperatures are expected to cause latitudinal and elevational range shifts as species track their optimal climate north and upward. However, a lack of adaptation to environmental conditions other than climate - for example photoperiod, biotic interactions, or edaphic conditions - might limit the success of immigrants in a new location despite hospitable climatic conditions. Here, we present one of the first direct experimental tests of the hypothesis that warmer temperatures at northern latitudes will confer a fitness advantage to southern immigrants relative to native populations. As rates of warming in the Arctic are more than double the global average, understanding the impacts of warming in Arctic ecosystems is especially urgent. We established experimentally warmed and non-warmed common garden plots at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic with seeds of two forb species (Oxyria digyna and Papaver radicatum) originating from three to five populations at different latitudes across the Arctic. We found that plants from the local populations generally had higher survival and obtained a greater maximum size than foreign individuals, regardless of warming treatment. Phenological traits varied with latitude of the source population, such that southern populations demonstrated substantially delayed leaf-out and senescence relative to northern populations. Our results suggest that environmental conditions other than temperature may influence the ability of foreign populations and species to establish at more northerly latitudes as the climate warms, potentially leading to lags in northward range shifts for some species.

AB  - The integrated steelmaking cycle based on the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BOF) route plays an important role in the production of plain and ultra-low carbon steel, especially for deep drawing operations. BOF steelmaking is based on the conversion of cast iron in steel by impinging oxygen on the metal bath at supersonic speed. In order to avoid the addition of detrimental chemical elements owing to the introduction of uncontrolled scrap and in order to decrease environmental impact caused by the intensive use of coke for the production of cast iron, HBI (hot briquetted iron) can he used as a source of metal and a fraction of cast iron. Forty industrial experimental tests were performed to evaluate the viability of the use of HBI in BOF. The experimental campaign was supported by a thermal prediction model and realized through the estimation of the oxidation enthalpy. Furthermore, the process was thermodynamically analyzed based on oxygen potentials using the off-gas composition and the bath temperature evolution during the conversion as reference data.

AB  - The city of Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, which has a population of 804,474, and has been experiencing rapid growth over the last 15 years, generates approximately 1.39 kg capita(-1) day(-1) of municipal solid waste (MSW). Nearly 700 tonnes of MSW are collected daily, of which 97% is disposed of at landfills. The newest landfill was built using modern technologies, including a landfill gas (LFG) collection system. The rapid growth of Astana demands more energy on its path to development, and the viability analysis of MSW to generate electricity is imperative. This paper presents a technical-economic pre-feasibility study comparing landfill including LFG utilization and waste incineration (WI) to produce electricity. The performance of LFG with a reciprocating engine and WI with steam turbine power technologies were compared through corresponding greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction, cost of energy production (CEP), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) from the analyses. Results demonstrate that in the city of Astana, WI has the potential to reduce more than 200,000 tonnes of GHG per year, while LFG could reduce slightly less than 40,000 tonnes. LFG offers a CEP 5.7% larger than WI, while the latter presents a BCR two times higher than LFG. WI technology analysis depicts a NPV exceeding 280% of the equity, while for LFG, the NPV is less than the equity, which indicates an expected remarkable financial return for the WI technology and a marginal and risky scenario for the LFG technology. Only existing landfill facilities with a LFG collection system in place may turn LFG into a viable project.

AB  - The California ribbed mussel Mytilus californianus (Conrad 1837) is a dominant intertidal species that ranges from Alaska (USA) to Baja California (Mexico) along the west coast of North America. Despite its broad latitudinal range, which results in populations living at widely different temperatures, multiple studies have concluded that this species is genetically homogenous. This may be due to high gene flow, which would inhibit local adaptation, and lack of strong post-settlement selection pressure, which would not favor shifts in allelic frequencies among sites. We investigated several physiological traits that show temperature-adaptive variation in other Mytilus species. We sampled populations of M. californianus at 7 sites across 33 of latitude to test for the possibility of local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. Individuals acclimated to common conditions were examined for possible differences in whole-organism thermal tolerance. The most northern population (Tatoosh Island) had a significantly lower survival rate following an acute heat stress event than the other populations. Additional physiological processes were examined that affect thermal optima and limits: critical thermal maximum (Hcrit) of cardiac function and metabolic capacity (as indexed by tissue activity of an indicator enzyme, malate dehydrogenase). Tatoosh mussels had a significantly lower Hcrit than other sites, indicating that this population may be adapted to cooler conditions compared to other populations. Metabolic activity did not correlate with latitude of collection. Phenotypic plasticity at the adult stage did not explain differences in thermal tolerance. Thus, genetic differences (local adaptation or balanced polymorphism), developmental plasticity, maternal effects, or within-site thermal heterogeneity may be responsible for the observed variation among populations.

AB  - DUV resists are extremely sensitive to temperature variations on the wafer during bake and chill cycles. In resist-processing tracks today, the wafer is moved by a robot or transfer arm, from the bake to chill plate. During this move, since the resist is still above the activation temperature, the wafer temperature is uncontrolled until it is placed on a chill plate. In the new station design presented here, the wafer is heated to the desired bake temperature and chilled back to room temperature before being moved by the robot, resulting in a tight temperature control of the wafer, throughout the process. Two models, axi-symmetric and three-dimensional (geometrically similar to the new station), are generated for analyzing the thermal performance of the above station. The numerical simulations, solving the momentum and energy equations in the computational domain, are performed using the commercial CID software Fluent(R). The simulated temporal evolution of temperature from the beginning to the end of the bake-chill process is verified with the experimental data as measured by a 42-point OnWafer(TM) temperature sensor wafer on the new station. Methods to improve wafer surface temperature uniformity, in light of bake-chill-station mechanical and thermal design losses are discussed. Higher throughput of the cluster, a major productivity improvement contribution of this new design, is also highlighted.

The expected fitness improvement is estimated at every generation of the algorithm and plotted in a heatmap profile. The spread of promising scaling factor values is analyzed for the SHADE and jDE algorithms with two different mutation strategies. In addition, the distance between the individuals in the population is considered, and the connection between distance and scaling factor values is observed. The performed experiments reveal important properties of Differential Evolution mutation operators, as well as widely used parameter adaptation techniques.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is recognized as a widespread and increasingly important anthropogenic environmental pressure on wild species and their interactions. Understanding of how these impacts translate into changes in population dynamics of communities with multiple trophic levels is, however, severely lacking. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment we tested the effect of ALAN on the population dynamics of a plant-aphid-parasitoid community with one plant species, three aphid species and their specialist parasitoids. The light treatment reduced the abundance of two aphid species by 20% over five generations, most likely as a consequence of bottom-up effects, with reductions in bean plant biomass being observed. For the aphid Megoura viciae this effect was reversed under autumn conditions with the light treatment promoting continuous reproduction through asexuals. All three parasitoid species were negatively affected by the light treatment, through reduced host numbers and we discuss induced possible behavioural changes. These results suggest that, in addition to direct impacts on species behaviour, the impacts of ALAN can cascade through food webs with potentially far reaching effects on the wider ecosystem.

AB  - The capacity of species to respond adaptively to warming temperatures will be key to their survival in the Anthropocene. The embryos of egg-laying species such as sea turtles have limited behavioural means for avoiding high nest temperatures, and responses at the physiological level may be critical to coping with predicted global temperature increases. Using the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) as a model, we used quantitative PCR to characterise variation in the expression response of heat-shock genes (hsp60, hsp70 and hsp90; molecular chaperones involved in cellular stress response) to an acute non-lethal heat shock. We show significant variation in gene expression at the clutch and population levels for some, but not all hsp genes. Using pedigree information, we estimated heritabilities of the expression response of hsp genes to heat shock and demonstrated both maternal and additive genetic effects. This is the first evidence that the heat-shock response is heritable in sea turtles and operates at the embryonic stage in any reptile. The presence of heritable variation in the expression of key thermotolerance genes is necessary for sea turtles to adapt at a molecular level to warming incubation environments.

AB  - As a vital element of climate change, elevated temperatures resulting from global warming present new challenges to natural and agricultural sustainability, such as ecological disease management. Mitochondria regulate the energy production of cells in responding to environmental fluctuation, but studying their contribution to the thermal adaptation of species is limited. This knowledge is needed to predict future disease epidemiology for ecology conservation and food security. Spatial distributions of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in 405 Phytophthora infestans isolates originating from 15 locations were characterized. The contribution of MtDNA to thermal adaptation was evaluated by comparative analysis of mtDNA frequency and intrinsic growth rate, relative population differentiation in nuclear and mtDNA, and associations of mtDNA distribution with local geography climate conditions. Significant variation in frequency, intrinsic growth rate, and spatial distribution was detected in mtDNA. Population differentiation in mtDNA was significantly higher than that in the nuclear genome, and spatial distribution of mtDNA was strongly associated with local climatic conditions and geographic parameters, particularly air temperature, suggesting natural selection caused by a local temperature is the main driver of the adaptation. Dominant mtDNA grew faster than the less frequent mtDNA. Our results provide useful insights into the evolution of pathogens under global warming. Given its important role in biological functions and adaptation to local air temperature, mtDNA intervention has become an increasing necessity for future disease management. To secure ecological integrity and food production under global warming, a synergistic study on the interactive effect of changing temperature on various components of biological and ecological functions of mitochondria in an evolutionary frame is urgently needed.

AB  - Low temperatures constrain cellular life due to reductions in nutrient uptake, enzyme kinetics, membrane permeability, and function of other biomacromolecules. This has implications for the biophysical limits of life on Earth, and the plausibility of life in extraterrestrial locations. Although most pseudomonads are mesophilic in nature, isolates such as the Antarctic Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W exhibit considerable psychrotolerance, with an ability to grow even between 4 and 0 degrees C. In this review, we explore the molecular traits and characteristic phenotypes of P. syringae Lz4W that enable life at low temperatures. We describe adaptations that enhance membrane fluidity; examine genes involved in cellular function and survival in the cold; assess capability for energy generation at low temperature; and detail the mechanics of DNA repair and RNA processing at low temperature, and speculate that P. syringae Lz4W can also synthesize glycerol to maintain flexibility of macromolecular systems. In the range 4 to 0oC, there are considerable changes in the properties and behaviour of water. Specifically, density can have adverse impacts on plasma-membrane functions, cytoplasmic viscosity, protein behaviour, and other essential properties of cellular system. We identified a combination of adaptations that may be peculiar to cold-tolerant P. syringae, including increase of unsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane; a RNA polymerase able to function at 0 degrees C; RecBCD- and RuvAB-dependent reestablishment of replication fork; and efficiencies of degradosome machinery and RNA processing by RNaseR at low temperature. Several unresolved questions are discussed in the context of astrobiology, and further work needed on the psychrotolerance of P. syringae.

KW  - BENGUELA ECOSYSTEM
KW  - PELAGIC FISH
AB  - The influence of the environment on selected elements of Southern Africa's marine biota is reviewed in order to provide a basis for examining possible impacts of anticipated climate change on the biota.  Some fish species with pelagic larvae tend to spawn in regions of reduced off-shore transport and turbulence, but sufficient upwelling for the generation of adequate food supplies is also of importance.  Benthic animals may be specially susceptible to factors influencing population densities, and many organisms respond to temperature changes.  There is regional coherence in some biotic and oceangraphic indices, suggestive that environmental perturbations may affect large areas.  The northern Benguela region is influenced by 'Benguela Ninos', which occur infrequently but result in southward displacements of both local populations and more tropical species.  The Benguela Ninos seemingly benefit survival of the early stages of some organisms, but may decrease the production of others by up to 50%.  In the southern Benguela region, a major shift in species dominance occured in the early 1960s.  It is likely that the environment exerted an influence, but the mechanism is not known and the ability to predict both the timing and nature of ecosystem change remains poor.  In the same region, large changes in the strengths of year-classes of important fish populations during a period of high oceanographic variability in the 1980s confirmed previous empirical observations that epipelagic species are favoured by warm conditions and groundfish by a cool environment.  Species of recreational interest migrate to the southeast coast of Africa from both the northeast and the southwest.  The strengths of the migrations may be influenced by environmental conditions in the areas of their origin.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is altering temperature regimes for coastal marine fishes. However, given that temperature changes will not occur in isolation of other stressors, it is necessary to explore the potential consequences of stress on the thermal tolerances and preferences of tropical marine fish in order to understand the thresholds for survival, and predict the associated coastal ecological consequences. In this study, we used exogenous cortisol injections to investigate the effects of a thermal challenge on checkered puffers (Sphoeroides testudineus) as a secondary stressor. There were no significant differences between control and cortisol-treated fish 48 h following cortisol treatment for swimming ability (using a chase to exhaustion protocol), blood glucose concentrations or standard metabolic rate. In the lab, control and cortisol-treated puffers were exposed to ambient (29.1 +/- 1.5 degrees C), ambient +5 degrees C (heat shock) and ambient -5 degrees C (cold shock) for 4 h and to evaluate the consequences of abrupt temperature change on puff performance and blood physiology. Following cold shock, control fish exhibited increases in cortisol levels and weak 'puff' performance. Conversely, fish dosed with cortisol exhibited consistently high cortisol levels independent of thermal treatment, although there was a trend for an attenuated cortisol response in the cortisol-treated fish to the cold shock treatment. A 20-day complementary field study conducted in the puffer's natural habitat, a tidal creek in Eleuthera, The Bahamas, revealed that cortisol-injected fish selected significantly cooler temperatures, measured using accumulated thermal units, when compared to controls. These results, and particularly the discrepancies between consequences documented in the laboratory and the ecological trends observed in the field, highlight the need to establish the link between laboratory and field data to successfully develop management policies and conservation initiatives with regards to anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - Carbon dioxide inventory implications of a biodiesel program in the Philippines are assessed. Biodiesel is assumed to be the methyl ester of coconut oil. Different scenarios for the use of agricultural residues as fuel for heat or power generation are analyzed. Reduction in net CO2 emissions are estimated at 77-104 g/MJ of diesel displaced by biodiesel. These benefits are found to be particularly sensitive to the extent to which residues are utilized. The predicted reductions in CO2 emissions are much greater than values reported in recent studies on biodiesel derived from other vegetable oils, due both to the large amount of potential fuel in the residual biomass and to the low-energy inputs in traditional coconut fanning techniques. However, agricultural productivity constraints suggest that by 2010, the maximum level of biodiesel substitution for the entire country is only 8%. At this level of utilization reductions of 2.85-3.85% in the Philippines' projected 130 x 10(6) tons of carbon dioxide emissions per annum can be realized. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organisms have a limited number of responses that enhance survival in changing environments. They can: 1. Cope within existing physiological flexibility; 2. Adapt to changing conditions; or 3. Migrate to sites that allow survival. Species inhabiting coastal seabed sites around Antarctica have poorer physiological capacities to deal with change than species elsewhere. They die when temperatures are raised by only 5-10 degrees C above the annual average, and many species lose the ability to perform essential functions, e.g. swimming in scallops or burying in infaunal bivalve molluscs when temperatures are raised only 2-3 degrees C. The ability to adapt, or evolve new characters to changing conditions depends, at least in part, on generation time. Antarctic benthic species grow slowly and develop at rates often x5-x10 slower than similar temperate species. They also live to great age, and exhibit deferred maturity. Longer generation times reduce the opportunities to produce novel mutations, and result in poorer capacities to adapt to change. Intrinsic capacities to colonize new sites and migrate away from deteriorating conditions depend on adult abilities to locomote over large distances, or for reproductive stages to drift for extended periods. The slow development of Antarctic benthic species means their larvae do spend extended periods in the water column. However, whereas most continents have coastlines extending over a wide range of latitude, Antarctica is almost circular in outline, is isolated from other oceans by the circumpolar current, and its coastline covers few degrees of latitude. Thus in a warming environment there are fewer places to migrate to. On all three major criteria Antarctic benthic species appear less capable than species elsewhere of responding to change in ways that can enhance survival.

AB  - Flexible devices have attracted much attention due to their great potential as next-generation electronics and for their applications in healthcare, fitness and AI robots. In these devices, the circuits composed of printed metal pastes are regarded as the key components on various flexible substrates. Although low temperature silver (Ag) paste has been applied in these devices, a high price and electromigration seriously limit their wide application. Copper (Cu), which has almost the same conductivity but is low cost and electromigration-resistant has been expected to be a substitute for the Ag-based paste. Herein, sub-micro copper particles with a suitable diameter were synthesized by a simple large-scale polyol method. A Cu paste was further formed from the Cu particles and printed onto a flexible substrate to form a Cu-based pattern. A reactive plasma process was used to sinter the copper pattern at low temperature. A high conductivity Cu pattern with a resistivity of 15.9 mu Omega cm has been successfully fabricated with only 10 minutes sintering at 200 W due to an enhanced plasma effect. The temperature was below 75 degrees C during the plasma process. A V-shape Cu antenna pattern has also been arranged on PET to fabricate a flexible antenna device, and the results show that the pattern has the same sensitivity for high-frequency signals when compared to bulk commercial copper foil.

AB  - Nowadays fossil fuel plays a significant role in the global energy supply and demand. Many non-oil producers and agricultural countries have set the target of biomass utilization as alternative energy in their energy policy plan. Gasification is one of the promising technologies in terms of the conversion of biomass to heat and power. However, this technology has faced many challenges, e.g. high capital cost, low energy conversion efficiency, etc. As the Thai government has promoted the use of biomass as alternative energy and has financially supported the use of agricultural residue for heat and power production in 12 pilot projects, this study will review the current status of the gasification technology used in the projects and discuss the results of a performance test conducted in terms of feedstock consumption rate, producer gas yield, heating value of producer gas, and thermal efficiency. The feedstock used consisted of residue from wood, corncob, palm, etc. Four projects used producer gas for electrical power generation with the capacity ranged from 250 to 300 kWe and 8 projects to produce heat for use in the ceramics industry, for fertilizer drying, hotels, etc. According to the study, it was seen that downdraft air gasification technology is suitable for small-scale heat and power production. The heating value of the producer gas ranged from 1.89 to 5.89 MJ/Nm(3) and the maximum cold gas efficiency of 76.96% was able to be reached. (C) 2015 the Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In animal nutrition, probiotics are considered as desirable alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters. The beneficial effects of probiotics primarily depend on their viability in feed, which demands technical optimization of biomass production, since processing and storage capacities are often strain-specific. In this study, we optimized the production parameters for two broiler-derived probiotic lactobacilli (L. salivarius and L. agilis). Carbohydrate utilization of both strains was determined and preferred substrates that boosted biomass production in lab-scale fermentations were selected. The strains showed good aerobic tolerance, which resulted in easier scale-up production. For the freeze-drying process, the response surface methodology was applied to optimize the composition of cryoprotective media. A quadratic polynomial model was built to study three protective factors (skim milk, sucrose, and trehalose) and to predict the optimal working conditions for maximum viability. The optimal combination of protectants was 0.14g/mL skim milk/ 0.08 g/mL sucrose/ 0.09 g/mL trehalose (L. salivarius) and 0.15g/mL skim milk/ 0.08 g/mL sucrose/ 0.07 g/mL (L. agilis), respectively. Furthermore, the in-feed stabilities of the probiotic strains were evaluated under different conditions. Our results indicate that the chosen protectants exerted an extensive protection on strains during the storage. Although only storage of the strains at 4 degrees C retained the maximum stability of both Lactobacillus strains, the employed protectant matrix showed promising results at room temperature.

AB  - Shifts in tree species distributions caused by climatic change are expected to cause severe losses in the economic value of European forestland. However, this projection disregards potential adaptation options such as tree species conversion, shorter production periods, or establishment of mixed species forests. The effect of tree species mixture has, as yet, not been quantitatively investigated for its potential to mitigate future increases in production risks. For the first time, we use survival time analysis to assess the effects of climate, species mixture and soil condition on survival probabilities for Norway spruce and European beech. Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models based on an extensive dataset of almost 65 000 trees from the European Forest Damage Survey (FDS) - part of the European-wide Level I monitoring network - predicted a 24% decrease in survival probability for Norway spruce in pure stands at age 120 when unfavorable changes in climate conditions were assumed. Increasing species admixture greatly reduced the negative effects of unfavorable climate conditions, resulting in a decline in survival probabilities of only 7%. We conclude that future studies of forest management under climate change as well as forest policy measures need to take this, as yet unconsidered, strongly advantageous effect of tree species mixture into account.

AB  - Thermal conditions during pregnancy affect the length of gestation and phenotype of offspring in viviparous lizards. However, past studies have typically exposed females to basking treatments throughout pregnancy, meaning that effects specific to late pregnancy (including cues for parturition) or to night temperatures are poorly understood. We examined effects of thermal treatments during late-embryonic development on Woodworthia 'Otago/Southland', a viviparous gecko with an unusual capacity to reproduce annually or biennially. Among females from a cool-climate, biennially reproducing population, elevated levels of basking opportunity and night temperature during late summer together increased the proportion of births occurring before winter in the laboratory. Offspring born before winter also had higher mass and body condition than those born after winter. Regardless of the season, the daytime body temperature of females declined shortly before parturition (putatively assisting survival of fully developed embryos in utero), then increased immediately after parturition to match that of neonates. Overall, the combined effects of warmer days and nights could help to explain geographical variation in birth season for this species. Furthermore, climate change might shift the modal birth season at cool sites from spring to the preceding autumn, with loss of offspring mass in utero over warm winters also potentially favouring a shift in birth season over time.

AB  - Water masses are bodies of water with distinctive physical and biogeochemical properties. They impart vertical structure to the deep ocean, participate in circulation, and can be traced over great distances, potentially influencing the distributions of deep-sea fauna. The classic potential temperature-salinity (theta-s) diagram was used to investigate deep-sea sponge (demosponge genus Geodia) association with water masses over the North Atlantic Ocean and Nordic Seas. A novel analysis was conducted, based on sampling the curvature of climatological mean theta-s curves at sponge locations. Sponges were particularly associated with turning points in the theta-s curves, indicative of intermediate and deep water masses. Arctic geodiid species (G. hentscheli and G. parva) were associated with Arctic intermediate and deep waters in the Nordic Seas, and with dense overflows into the northern North Atlantic. Boreal species (G. atlantica, G. barretti, G. macandrewii, and G. phlegraei) were associated with upper and intermediate water masses in the Northeast Atlantic and with upper, Atlantic-derived waters in the Nordic Seas. Taken together with distributional patterns, a link with thermohaline currents was also inferred. We conclude that water masses and major current pathways structure the distribution of a key deep-sea benthic faunal group on an ocean basin scale. This is most likely because of a combination of the physical constraints they place on the dispersal of early life-history stages, ecophysiological adaptation (evolved tolerances) to specific water masses, and the benefits to filter-feeders of certain phenomena linked to water column structure (e.g. nepheloid layers, internal waves/ tides, density-driven currents).

AB  - Marine fish are commonly considered to be characterized by limited population structure because of the absence of geographic barriers and the subsequent high levels of gene flow. In spite of this general observation, many cases of genetic geographical divergence have been observed, and natural selection has been suggested to be a causal factor. The white croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, constitutes an excellent model to test for adaptive hypotheses of population divergence, because of its wide geographic distribution along the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The main objective of this study was to analyze the possible effect of natural selection at the genetic level, using microsatellite loci as molecular markers, and to evaluate the effect of environmental variables, trophic preferences, and phenotypic cohesion on the population structure of M. furnieri. The outlier loci analyses suggested that some of the microsatellites analyzed were under divergent selective regimens, and analyses of population genetic structure considering only these loci revealed a stronger differentiation pattern in almost cases than results compared to those obtained with the entire microsatellite data set. Results obtained also revealed a correlation between phenotypic cohesion, salinity, and temperature with genetic structure in white croakers. These results support previous works which proposed thatwhite croakers inhabiting the Rio de la Plata estuary constitute a different evolutionary unit, maintained to some extent by selective processes.

AB  - European efforts to start substantial improvements of the performance of well established supercritical coal-fired power technology named the AD700 project began in 1998. Major targets were development of austenitic materials and nickel-based super alloys for the hottest sections of boilers, steam lines and turbines. Other targets were development of boiler and turbine designs for the more advanced conditions, and finally economic viability of the AD700 technology has been investigated. The project has been very successful and 40 partners from the European power industry have worked together in several projects co-funded by the European Commission for 10 years. Procurement of a mature and commercially optimised AD700 plant could take place around 2015.
   The investigated nickel-based materials have shown very high creep strengths but they are hard to manufacture. Ongoing tests indicate that the developed austenitic material will fulfil its creep strength target and is now ready for commercialisation.
   Improved materials allow higher steam temperatures and pressures. Improved thermodynamic design optimises plant efficiencies for the given steam parameters. The present paper presents a proposal for an improved steam cycle named the Master Cycle (MC) based on a revision of the double reheat steam cycle where the bleeds of the IP turbines have been moved to a feed pump turbine bleeding on the first cold reheat line.
   The MC offers solid heat rate improvements of similar to 3.5% compared with single reheat cycles. These improvements maintain a flexible operation mode of the plant in relation to renewable energy production plants and facilitate efficient energy supply for a post combustion carbon capture installation. Further thermodynamic improvements enable an efficiency for a seawater-cooled 800MW AD700 power plant around 55% based on the MC. This is the perfect match to the future demand for zero emission power plants.

AB  - Probiotics, in particular, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used as starter cultures in food and pharmaceutical industries. Presence of LAB supports the production and preservation of a diverse range of food products, provides a positive effect on the human gastrointestinal tract, and prevents the progression of many diseases. However, the main limiting factor in the application of LAB is that they hardly survive in acidic conditions, including the human digestive system. This factor inhibits LAB to maintain their functionality and deliver their health benefits to the host. For this purpose, magnetic immobilisation of LAB with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) was conducted to evaluate the effect of IONs on bacterial growth and their viability at low pH. Gram-positiveLactobacillus acidophilus,a well-known species of LAB, was selected for this study. The IONs were successfully synthesised with the average size of 7 nm and used for decoration ofL. acidophiluscells at low pH. Based on the results, a 1.8-fold increase in bacterial viability was observed by decorating cells with 360 mu g/mL IONs.

AB  - The katydid Neoconocephalus triops exhibits in North America substantial developmental plasticity of male mating calls. The AM rate of the summer calls is significantly faster than that of the winter calls at the same temperature. In the tropics, where N. triops originated, males express only the fast summer-call phenotype. We tested two alternative hypotheses: (1) call plasticity in the population from North America evolved in response to selection by female preference after N. triops colonized North America, or (2) call plasticity evolved before N. triops expanded into North America and its expression in the novel environment led to adaptive change of female preferences. First, we tested whether call plasticity was present in tropical populations of N. triops. Tropical males expressed the winter-call phenotype when reared under winter conditions, indicating that call plasticity did not evolve in response to temperate climates. Second, we compared female preferences among temperate and tropical populations. We found that the temperature dependence of preferred AM rate was significantly steeper in temperate N. triops than in a tropical population of N. triops. Third, we compared temperature dependence of female preference of the N. triops populations to three Neoconocephalus species without call plasticity. Only temperate N. triops had significantly steeper temperature dependence than the other species. This steeper temperature dependence matched female preference to the fast summer call at high temperatures and to the slow winter call at low temperatures in temperate populations. These results support the hypothesis that female preference changed in N. triops in North America to compensate for the plasticity of male calls.

AB  - Shallow population structure is generally reported for most marine fish and explained as a consequence of high dispersal, connectivity and large population size. Targeted gene analyses and more recently genome-wide studies have challenged such view, suggesting that adaptive divergence might occur even when neutral markers provide genetic homogeneity across populations. Here, 381 SNPs located in transcribed regions were used to assess large- and fine-scale population structure in the European hake (Merluccius merluccius), a widely distributed demersal species of high priority for the European fishery. Analysis of 850 individuals from 19 locations across the entire distribution range showed evidence for several outlier loci, with significantly higher resolving power. While 299 putatively neutral SNPs confirmed the genetic break between basins (F-CT = 0.016) and weak differentiation within basins, outlier loci revealed a dramatic divergence between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations (F-CT range 0.275-0.705) and fine-scale significant population structure. Outlier loci separated North Sea and Northern Portugal populations from all other Atlantic samples and revealed a strong differentiation among Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean geographical samples. Significant correlation of allele frequencies at outlier loci with sea-water surface temperature and salinity supported the hypothesis that populations might be adapted to local conditions. Such evidence highlights the importance of integrating information from neutral and adaptive evolutionary patterns towards a better assessment of genetic diversity. Accordingly, the generated outlier SNP data could be used for tackling illegal practices in hake fishing and commercialization as well as to develop explicit spatial models for defining management units and stock boundaries.

AB  - Resource selection is a hierarchical and dynamic process. Selection can occur at different spatial and temporal scales, and can change over time with shifts in resource availability. The temporal dynamic of selection was investigated for a harbour seal Phoca vitulina population in Porsangerfjord, Norway, a subarctic fjord with large seasonal fluctuations in resource distribution. The availability of potential harbour seal prey was assumed to be dependent on the prey's biomass densities, distance from the seals' haulout sites and accessibility of the areas where prey was located, restricted by the presence of sea ice during winter and spring. The foraging behaviour of seals was investigated by assessing their preference and foraging response to the seasonal dynamics of prey distribution. The movement and dive patterns of individual seals (n = 10) were tracked with GPS devices. Foraging locations were compared to the availability of potential prey species in the fjord. Results suggested that harbour seals in Porsangerfjord had a preference for small-sized fish (<25 cm). Small codfish were preferred during autumn, but a response to the presence of pelagic fish was seen when the latter aggregated to overwinter in cold deep waters in the inner parts of the fjord. The formation of ice during late winter, however, provoked a shift in preference for small codfish, due to the sudden inaccessibility of pelagic fish. A strong reversed trend was observed in spring when the ice melted. The results indicate preference for small aggregated fish and the presence of a foraging response to changes in resource distribution.

AB  - Genetic signatures of historical, behavioural and environmental processes are evident in contemporary seabird populations. Molecular markers have allowed us to determine historical patterns of gene flow, relationships among taxa, and contemporary dispersal barriers. The Southern Ocean contains a number of small, isolated islands that are home to four families of seabirds: albatrosses, petrels, penguins and skuas, which have been the focus of a number of population genetic studies. While capable of travelling large distances, many seabirds have restricted dispersal and exhibit high levels of population structure; typically in northern areas and areas with high endemism (e.g. New Zealand). We reviewed 29 studies of 25 Southern Ocean seabird species comparing biogeographic patterns, glacial history and barriers to gene flow, especially at-sea distribution and ocean currents. Despite diversity in behaviour and life history, our review demonstrates that population genetic structure of the seabirds corresponds to the same barriers. For penguins, currents are the major impediment to dispersal whereas at-sea distribution and island location influence population structure for many seabirds with genetically distinct populations on islands at the periphery of their range. As environmental conditions change, it will become more important to assess how seabirds respond and how these changes influence both dispersal and population structure. It is particularly important as a disproportionately high number of Southern Ocean seabirds are threatened or near threatened. Future studies need to focus on adaptive genetic markers, range-wide comprehensive sampling, influence of behaviour on genetic structure and lesser studied seabirds such as terns and cormorants.

AB  - Pregnancy is a challenging period for egg laying squamates. Carrying eggs can encumber females and decrease their locomotor performance, potentially increasing their risk of predation. Pregnant females can potentially reduce this handicap by selecting higher temperatures to increase their sprint speed and ability to escape from predators, or to speed up embryonic development and reduce the period during which they are burdened with eggs ('selfish mother' hypothesis). Alternatively, females might select more stable body temperatures during pregnancy to enhance offspring fitness ('maternal manipulation hypothesis'), even if the maintenance of such temperatures compromises a female's locomotor performance. We investigated whether pregnancy affects the preferred body temperatures and locomotor performance of female velvet geckos Amalosia lesueurii. We measured running speed of females during late pregnancy, and one week after they laid eggs at four temperatures (20 degrees, 25 degrees, 30 degrees and 35 degrees C). Preferred body temperatures of females were measured in a cost-free thermal gradient during late pregnancy and one week after egg-laying. Females selected higher and more stable set-point temperatures when they were pregnant (mean =29.0 C, T-set =27.8-30.5 degrees C) than when they were non-pregnant (mean =26.2 degrees C, Tset =23.7-28.7 degrees C). Pregnancy was also associated with impaired performance; females sprinted more slowly at all four test temperatures when burdened with eggs. Although females selected higher body temperatures during late pregnancy, this increase in temperature did not compensate for their impaired running performance. Hence, our results suggest that females select higher temperatures during pregnancy to speed up embryogenesis and reduce the period during which they have reduced performance. This strategy may decrease a female's probability of encountering predatory snakes that use the same microhabitats for thermoregulation. Selection of stable temperatures by pregnant females may also benefit embryos, but manipulative experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis.

AB  - Incorporating species' eco-evolutionary responses to human-caused disturbances remains a challenge in marine management efforts. A prerequisite is knowledge of geographic structure and scale of genetic diversity and connectivity-the so-called seascape genetic patterns. The Baltic Sea is an excellent model system for studies linking seascape genetics with effects of anthropogenic stress. However, seascape genetic patterns in this area are only described for a few species and are completely unknown for invertebrate herbivores, which constitute a critical part of the ecosystem. This information is crucial for sustainable management, particularly under future scenarios of rapid environmental change. Here, we investigate the population genetic structure among 31 locations throughout the Baltic Sea, of which 45% were located in marine protected areas, in one of the most important herbivores of this region, the isopod crustacean Idotea balthica, using an array of 33,774 genome-wide SNP markers derived from 2b-RAD sequencing. In addition, we generate a biophysical connectivity matrix for I. balthica from a combination of oceanographic current models and estimated life history traits. We find population structure on scales of hundreds of kilometers across the Baltic Sea, where genomic patterns in most cases closely match biophysical connectivity, indicating passive transport with oceanographic currents as an important mean of dispersal in this species. We also find a reduced genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity along the main salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea, suggesting periods of low population size. Our results provide crucial information for the management of a key ecosystem species under expected changes in temperature and salinity following global climate change in a marine coastal area.

AB  - The environment is rarely constant and organisms are exposed to temporal and spatial variations that impact their life histories and inter-species interactions. It is important to understand how such variations affect epidemiological dynamics in host-parasite systems. We explored effects of temporal variation in temperature on experimental microcosm populations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Infected and uninfected populations of two P. caudatum genotypes were created and four constant temperature treatments (26 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 32 degrees C) compared with four variable treatments with the same mean temperatures. Variable temperature treatments were achieved by alternating populations between permissive (23 degrees C) and restrictive (35 degrees C) conditions daily over 30 days. Variable conditions and high temperatures caused greater declines in Paramecium populations, greater fluctuations in population size and higher incidence of extinction. The additional effect of parasite infection was additive and enhanced the negative effects of the variable environment and higher temperatures by up to 50 per cent. The variable environment and high temperatures also caused a decrease in parasite prevalence (up to 40%) and an increase in extinction (absence of detection) (up to 30%). The host genotypes responded similarly to the different environmental stresses and their effect on parasite traits were generally in the same direction. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first experimental demonstration that epidemiological dynamics are influenced by environmental variation. We also emphasize the need to consider environmental variance, as well as means, when trying to understand, or predict population dynamics or range.

AB  - Marine mollusc shells enclose a wealth of information on coastal organisms and their environment. Their life history traits as well as (palaeo-) environmental conditions, including temperature, food availability, salinity and pollution, can be traced through the analysis of their shell (micro-) structure and biogeochemical composition. Adding to this list, the DNA entrapped in shell carbonate biominerals potentially offers a novel and complementary proxy both for reconstructing palaeoenvironments and tracking mollusc evolutionary trajectories. Here, we assess this potential by applying DNA extraction, high-throughput shotgun DNA sequencing and metagenomic analyses to marine mollusc shells spanning the last similar to 7,000 years. We report successful DNA extraction from shells, including a variety of ancient specimens, and find that DNA recovery is highly dependent on their biomineral structure, carbonate layer preservation and disease state. We demonstrate positive taxonomic identification of mollusc species using a combination of mitochondrial DNA genomes, barcodes, genome-scale data and metagenomic approaches. We also find shell biominerals to contain a diversity of microbial DNA from the marine environment. Finally, we reconstruct genomic sequences of organisms closely related to the Vibrio tapetis bacteria from Manila clam shells previously diagnosed with Brown Ring Disease. Our results reveal marine mollusc shells as novel genetic archives of the past, which opens new perspectives in ancient DNA research, with the potential to reconstruct the evolutionary history of molluscs, microbial communities and pathogens in the face of environmental changes. Other future applications include conservation of endangered mollusc species and aquaculture management.

AB  - Risk assessment of metal-contaminated habitats based on responses in the field is complicated by the evolution of local, metal-resistant ecotypes. The unpredictability of occurrence of genetically determined adaptive traits, in terms of site-specific geochemistry, a population's inferred exposure history, and in the physiology of resistance, exacerbates the problem. Micro-evolutionary events warrant the attention of ecotoxicologists because they undermine the application of the bedrock of toxicology, the dose-response curve, to in situ field assessments. Here we survey the evidence for the existence of genetically differentiated, metal-resistant, invertebrate populations; we also describe some of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the adaptations. Quantitative changes in tissue-metal partitioning, and in the molecular and cellular responses (biomarkers) to alterations in internal bioreactive metal pools, are widely accepted as indicators of toxicity and/or exposure in free-living organisms. Both can be modulated by resistance. The understanding that all genomes are intrinsically flexible, with subtle sequence changes in promoter regions or epigenetic adjustments conferring significant phenotypic consequences, is deemed highly relevant. Equally relevant is the systems biology insight that genes and proteins are woven into networks. We advocate that biomarker studies should work toward assimilating and exploiting these biological realities through monitoring the activities of suites of genes (transcriptomics) and their expressed products (proteomics), as well as profiling the metabolite signatures of individuals (metabolomics) and by using neutral genetic markers to genotype populations. Ecotoxicology requires robust tools that recognize the imprint of evolution on the constitution of field populations, as well as sufficient mechanistic understanding of the molecular-genetic observations to interpret them in meaningful environmental diagnostic ways.

AB  - Solid oxide fuel cell - internal combustion engine (SOFC-ICE) hybrid systems are an attractive solution for electricity generation. The system can achieve up to 70% theoretical electric power conversion efficiency through energy cascading enabled by utilizing the anode off-gas from the SOFC as the fuel source for the ICE. Experimental investigations were conducted with a single cylinder Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine by altering fuel-air equivalence ratio (phi), and compression ratio (CR) to study the engine load, combustion characteristics, and emissions levels of dry SOFC anode off-gas consisting of 33.9% H-2, 15.6% CO, and 50.5% CO2. The combustion efficiency of the anode off-gas was directly evaluated by measuring the engine-out CO emissions. The highest net-indicated fuel conversion efficiency of 31.3% occurred at phi = 0.90 and CR = 13:1. These results demonstrate that the anode off-gas can be successfully oxidized using a spark ignition combustion mode. The fuel conversion efficiency of the anode tail gas is expected to further increase in a more modern engine architecture that can achieve increased burn rates in comparison to the CFR engine. NOx emissions from the combustion of anode off-gas were minimal as the cylinder peak temperatures never exceeded 1800 K. This experimental study ultimately demonstrates the viability of an ICE to operate using an anode off-gas, thus creating a complementary role for an ICE to be paired with a SOFC in a hybrid power generation plant.

AB  - First-generation sugarcane ethanol production is a well-established technology. However, second-generation ethanol is not yet consolidated in industries. Under these circumstances, this work presents a multi-objective optimization of this process focusing on economic and environmental objectives. The impact of the Brazilian decarbonization program on an integrated biorefinery is analyzed, considering a first-generation ethanol conventional autonomous distillery and a second-generation process with hydrothermal pre-treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of the xylose liquor. The economic metric was the Net Present Value and the environmental assessment was based on the plant inventory considering Global Warming Potential. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm was used, considering the ratio of bagasse diverted to the second-generation process, enzyme loading and solid fraction in the hydrolysis reactor as optimization variables. The carbon credit price was estimated for each point in the Pareto set in order to make the process economically feasible. As the main conclusions, there is a trade-off between economic and environmental targets, indicating that carbon credits may be essential for second-generation ethanol economic feasibility. The optimized integrated biorefinery is able to increase ethanol production by approximately 24% compared to first-generation biorefineries, but an increase in ethanol production higher than 13% would make the process economically unfeasible, while the decarbonization credits are not being commercialized. A price of $ 15.77 for decarbonization credits would make it possible to produce 20% more ethanol, keeping the integrated biorefinery economically feasible. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The ability to predict the consequences of fluctuating environments on species distribution and extinction often relies on determining the tolerances of species or genotypes in different constant environments (i.e. determining tolerance curves). However, very little is known about the suitability of measurements made in constant environments to predict the level of adaptation to rapidly fluctuating environments. To explore this question, we used bacterial clones adapted to constant or fluctuating temperatures and found that measurements across a range of constant temperatures did not indicate any adaptation to fluctuating temperatures. However, adaptation to fluctuating temperatures was only apparent if growth was measured during thermal fluctuation. Thus, tolerance curves based on measurements in constant environments can be misleading in predicting the ability to tolerate fast environmental fluctuations. Such complications could lead to false estimates of the genetic merits of genotypes and extinction risks of species due to climate change-induced thermal fluctuations.

AB  - As with summer mortalities reported in France between 2001 and 2006, mortality caused by the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in Crassostrea gigas affects mostly juveniles, although adults can also be impacted to a small extent. This could suggest that both mortalities have similar causes and that establishment of resistance, in particular to the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), depends on either the size or the age of oysters. The present study reports an investigation of both size and age using three cohorts produced during winter and three produced during summer. Each cohort contained oysters genetically selected to be resistant or susceptible to the summer mortality phenomenon, as well as unselected control oysters. Any abnormal mortality was recorded between production and placement in the field. Transfer to field conditions was then made over thirty deployments between July 2009 and September 2011. All mortalities occurred when seawater temperature was above 16 degrees C, which was termed the 'risk' period. For all deployments made during the risk period, mortality was observed within two weeks post-deployment and most episodes lasted over a week. For deployments made outside of the risk period, mortality occurred as soon as the next risk period began. The absence of detection of OsHV-1 at deployment, the presence of a high viral load of OsHV-1 (>10(+6) DNA copies per mg of fresh tissue) on moribund oysters sampled during peak mortality, and the mortality kinetic all suggest that the mortalities can be attributed to this pathogen alone. The major finding of this study was that the resistance to mortality caused by OsHV-1 increased with both age and size, suggesting a maturation of the immune system against the virus. In field conditions, the relationship between mortality and size was stronger than the relationship between mortality and age. Regression equations of oyster size or age at the onset of the mortality event were derived to estimate the mortality due to OsHV-1. Although larger animals always tended to be more resistant to OsHV-1 than smaller ones, mortality in unselected oysters remained high (>70%) for the size range 0-10 g. Selective breeding to improve resistance to OsHV-1 remains the best way to significantly reduce mortality; however, prudent management strategies for oyster growers could also potentially offer viable solutions. For example, deploying juveniles at a site favouring the growth of oysters after the threat of exposure to OsHV-1 has passed (i.e. at the end of the risk period), and by using cultural practices favouring high growth and/or a site for which the risk period is short due to the seawater temperature. Use of triploid oysters or lines selected for higher growth is also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of climate change may be felt most keenly by tropical ectotherms. In these taxa, it is argued, thermal specialization means a given shift in temperature will have a larger effect on fitness. For species with limited dispersal ability, the impact of climate change depends on the capacity for their climate-relevant traits to shift. Such shifts can occur through genetic adaptation, various forms of plasticity, or a combination of these processes. Here we assess the extent and causes of shifts in 7 physiological traits in a tropical lizard, the rainforest sunskink (Lampropholis coggeri). Two populations were sampled that differ from each other in both climate and physiological traits. We compared trait values in each animal soon after field collection versus following acclimation to laboratory conditions. We also compared trait values between populations in: (i) recently field-collected animals; (ii) the same animals following laboratory acclimation; and (iii) the laboratory-reared offspring of these animals. Our results reveal high trait lability, driven primarily by acclimation and local adaptation. By contrast, developmental plasticity, resulting from incubation temperature, had little to no effect on most traits. These results suggest that, while specialized, tropical ectotherms may be capable of rapid shifts in climate-relevant traits.

AB  - Laboratory selection on environmental stress traits is an evolutionary approach that is informative in the context of understanding stress adaptation. Here we characterize changes in a lipidome of Drosophila melanogaster in lines selected for increased heat (elevated heat knockdown refractoriness), cold (decreased time to recover from chill-coma) and desiccation survival. Selection for desiccation resistance resulted in changes in multiple lipid classes used to characterize a lipidome. This included a decrease in triacylglycerols (TAGs) which is relevant to interpretation of storage lipid levels in previous D. melanogaster desiccation survival selection experiments. Chill-coma recovery rate selection was expected to show extensive changes in lipid classes, but only phosphatidic acids exhibited significant change. Selection for increased heat knockdown resistance resulted in a substantial change in the abundance of a class of lipids (diacylglycerols) which could play a role in mediating the heat shock response or result in an increase in neutral lipid mobilization.

AB  - The concept of centralized biogas plants has been developed in Denmark. At present, 10 plants are in operation with capacities ranging from 50 to 500 tonnes of biomass per day. The biomass consists of approximately 80% manure co-digested with 20% organic waste from abattoirs and various food industries. The effluent is returned as nutritionally defined fertilizer, partly to the farms that supply fresh manure, and partly to other crop farmers. The plants are sited to ensure that the energy can be utilized, mainly for CHP generation. The heat is used for district heating of urban communities. Operational experience shows considerable increases in gas production primarily due to co-digestion of the manure with organic wastes. Possibilities of process regulation have been revealed, and stable thermophilic digestion has been achieved. A two-step process has turned out to be advantageous, the second step being lower temperature post digestion. Environmental and agricultural benefits include savings for farmers, improved fertilization efficiency, less greenhouse gas emission, and cheap, environmentally sound waste recycling. The working economy of the centralized biogas plants has improved, but there is still a need for further reductions in running costs if financially competitive plants are to be created without public investment grants.

AB  - The rapidly increasing contribution towards global warming from the information communication technology (ICT) sector is a clear indication of the need for energy efficient green communication networks. For instance, in the case of cellular networks, over 80% of the total energy is consumed at the access network. On the other hand, incorporating self-sustainability and autonomy in its operation, control, and maintenance is significantly vital due to relatively larger sizes, higher complexities, and dynamic behaviors of future networks than those of current networks. In this paper, with the inspiration from the ecological principle of protocooperation, a novel energy efficient cellular access network architecture is proposed. With the adoption of the wake-up technology, base transceiver stations (BTSs) are made to protocooperate with each other to achieve higher energy efficiency within a cellular access network. Protocooperation is one of the ecological interactions by which two interacting species gain benefit through cooperation. However, this type of cooperation is not compulsory for the survival of any of these two species. To accomplish less energy consumption and higher self-sustainability at the access network, BTSs cooperatively and dynamically switch between active and sleep modes depending on the current traffic situation. The extent of self-sustainability incorporated in the proposed architecture is studied and analyzed. As per the result, our proposed architecture and algorithm are capable of achieving a significant amount of energy saving, which is an important step towards a self-sustainable green communication system.

AB  - Non-native populations of Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) are established around the United Kingdom (UK), with two genetically different stocks originating from separate introductions to the UK and France. In this study, we use a coupled biophysical model to simulate Pacific oyster larval transport, in order to investigate the dispersal of the species from a known population near their northern limit on the west coast of the UK (in the Milford Haven Estuary). The model included a pelagic phase, simulating different swimming behaviours, and a settlement phase based on a hydrospatial substrate map. Following successful settlement elsewhere, subsequent releases simulated potential population spread over successive generations. Our results suggest that, should there be sufficiently warm sea temperatures to allow reproduction, dispersal away from Milford Haven Estuary would most be southeast ward towards the Bristol Channel; but dispersal north and west to Ireland is also possible, depending heavily on pelagic swimming behaviour. Seasonal modifications to circulation were less influential. Our study increases understanding of factors that contribute to oyster population spread, and suggests methods for improved management through numerical predictions.

AB  - A brief overview of tornadic events (wind spouts) over Bulgaria in the period 1904-1989 that have been recorded in the meteorological archive and described in scientific papers is presented. The local tornado (spout) on 15 May 1999 in Zhaltusha village (south of Rhodopes mountain in the most southern part of Bulgaria, close to the Mediterranean coast) is studied in detail. The case is associated with hail ('egg-shaped' stones about 5 cm in diameter) and caused damages of property valued above US$250 000. The high-wind-speed vortex blew off house roofs, rooted out trees, and turned over trucks.
   Using numerical model analysis fields and satellite imagery, evidence is presented, which illustrates the role of synoptic scale mechanisms for the generation of the severe storm. On the large scale, the circulation pattern is associated with a trough disruption process over the area of Western Europe, North Atlantic and Mediterranean. Under the influence of southwestern flow in the lower troposphere, warm and moist Mediterranean air is advected in the region of strong westerlies in the higher levels. Together with the role of low-level warm/moist advection and westerly transport of cold air at the mid-upper levels. diurnal heating, terrain-induced lifting, etc., are also critical for the initiation of deep convection over the region of tornadic event. As a result of these factors, a typical cloud pattern developed that indicates the existence of a local area of negative vertical gradient of the thermal advection in the troposphere, associated with the dramatic destabilisation. Other synoptic- and mesoscale elements may also be revealed or confirmed by satellite and radiosonde data.
   The nearest Rhodopes radiosounding (at Thessaloniki airport) and surface meteorological data from Kurdjaly station are used for air mass analysis in the vicinity of the storm. The obtained result shows very high values of atmospheric instability indices (the energy E-i = 3327 J/kg K, TT1 = 45.6 degreesC, K-1 = 16.5 degreesC). The updraft was up to 20 m/s and the difference of wind velocity at 300- and 700-hPa levels was up to 10 m/s. Cloud water content reached up to 12 g/kg. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Sea Sturgeons are closely related anadromous fishes inhabiting both shores of the North Atlantic Ocean. They are classified in two species: the European sturgeon Acipenser sturio in Europe and the Atlantic sturgeon A. oxyrinchus in North America. The Atlantic sturgeon is further separated into two subspecies: Atlantic sturgeon (North American East Coast populations) A. o. oxyrinchus and Gulf sturgeon A. o. desotoi. Most recent studies of morphology and genetics support these classifications. Furthermore, they produced evidence for a trans-Atlantic colonization event during the early Middle Ages. Atlantic sturgeon colonized Baltic waters, founding a self-reproducing population before they became extinct due to anthropogenic reasons. Today, populations of Atlantic sturgeon are found along the Atlantic Coast from the St. Johns River, Florida to the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, whereas only one relict spawning population of European sturgeon still exists in the Gironde River, France. The evidence of a population of Atlantic sturgeon in Baltic waters requires a detailed comparison of both sea sturgeon species, describing differences and similarities, which may influence the ongoing restoration projects in Europe as well as concerning conservation efforts in North America. This article reviews similarities and differences in the fields of genetics, morphology, and ecological adaptation of European sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon, concluding that, besides morphological and genetic differences, a wider range of spawning temperatures in Atlantic sturgeon is evident. This wider temperature adaptation may be a selective advantage under fast-changing climatic conditions, possibly the mechanism that enabled the species shift in the Baltic Sea during the Middle Ages.

AB  - In vitro hydrogen generation represents a clear opportunity for novel bioreactor and system design. Hydrogen, already a globally important commodity chemical, has the potential to become the dominant transportation fuel of the future. Technologies such as in vitro synthetic pathway biotransformation (SyPaB)-the use of more than 10 purified enzymes to catalyze unnatural catabolic pathways-enable the storage of hydrogen in the form of carbohydrates. Biohydrogen production from local carbohydrate resources offers a solution to the most pressing challenges to vehicular and bioenergy uses: small-size distributed production, minimization of CO2 emissions, and potential low cost, driven by high yield and volumetric productivity. In this study, we introduce a novel bioreactor that provides the oxygen-free gas phase necessary for enzymatic hydrogen generation while regulating temperature and reactor volume. A variety of techniques are currently used for laboratory detection of biohydrogen, but the most information is provided by a continuous low-cost hydrogen sensor. Most such systems currently use electrolysis for calibration; here an alternative method, flow calibration, is introduced. This system is further demonstrated here with the conversion of glucose to hydrogen at a high rate, and the production of hydrogen from glucose 6-phosphate at a greatly increased reaction rate, 157 mmol/L/h at 60 degrees C.

AB  - Hydroelectric power is a major source of electric energy in northwestern Washington, and an important part of the region's economy. In ''run-of-the-river'' hydroelectric projects, water is diverted from a river when the discharge exceeds a specified flow and is conveyed downhill to a powerhouse. Creeks used for hydropower generation also constitute the natural spawning habitat for anadromous cold-water fish. Because fish embryo survival rates decrease with an increase in the percentage of fine sediments in spawning gravels, studies of the potential effects of flow diversion on sediment transport are typically required when applying for a permit to build a run-of-the-river project. To provide insight into the actual impacts of flow diversion on sediment conditions, and thus fish habitat, we reproduced channel-morphology measurements and sediment texture sampling originally made for the pre-construction study of Koma Kulshan, a small run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plant in northwestern Washington that has been in operation since 1990. Potential non-project changes were controlled by additional sampling upstream of the project. Flow diversion appears to have had an impact on fine-sediment transport, but has not significantly affected coarse-sediment transport in the gravel-bed streams studied. This is because flow diversion represents a small portion of the peak flows likely to move coarse sediment, but can be a significant portion of the low flows during which only fine sediment is transported.

AB  - The ability to withstand climate and weather extremes can play a key role in survival and establishment of nonnative species. We investigated the effect of acute exposure to sub-zero temperature on the heart rate and recovery capacity of invasive crayfish Faxonius limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus, and Procambarus clarkii. The experiments used non-invasive sensors to assess cardiac activity relative to survival and recovery of crayfish during short (30 min) and prolonged (60 min) exposures to -18 degrees C. All P. clarkii specimens survived freezing temperature and rewarming and recovered after the short exposure, and 25% recovered after prolonged exposure. All F. limosus and P. leniusculus died during the recovery period following both exposures. In all tested specimens a heartbeat was measurable several hours after conclusion of exposure, gradually declining in F. limosus and P. leniusculus. The P. clarkii heart rate decreased abruptly upon exposure to sub-zero temperature, and recovery to nearly the pre-exposure rate took longer than for F. limosus and P. leniusculus. Heartbeat decline slopes were as follows: P. clarkii, 80.2 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees, > F. limosus, 74.9 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees, > P. leniusculus, 70.3 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees. During the cooling warming cycle, F. limosus and P. leniusculus demonstrated more gradual heartbeat decline and more rapid recovery to original levels but ultimately did not survive, most likely due to energy depletion associated with heartbeat fluctuation while cooling. These findings may increase our understanding of the broader distribution of P. clarkii than expected according to its ecological optima and provide insight into the mechanisms of invasive crayfish adaptability.

AB  - From a laboratory stock of Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon), reared for more than 20 years at 18-degrees-C, two new populations were derived and maintained at 25-degrees and 28-degrees-C for 8 years.  The chromosomal and cytoplasmic contribution to genetic divergence between the two more extreme populations was estimated at 18-degrees-C and 28-degrees-C.  Wing shape and two fitness components (fecundity and fertility) were taken into account.  Fourier descriptors and the position of the centroid were taken as indicators either of wing shape variation, determined by a different response of the two wing compartments to temperature selection, or of wing shape variation determined by both compartments.  The descriptors appear to be good characters:  they show a variability which is genetically controlled and ascribable to genes located on specific chromosomes.  The third chromosome is responsible for the adaptive difference to temperature.  The genes which control wing shape are located on the second and third chromosome, although the contribution of each chromosome depends on the environment in which the flies develop.  Cytoplasmic genes display an effect as large as that of chromosomes, and nucleus x cytoplasm interaction is present.  The correlation between the genetic contributions to compartment-dependent wing shape variation and the contributions to fitness is highly significant, especially at 28-degrees-C.  Wing shape has, therefore, an adaptive significance in relation to temperature, which is particularly expressed in the environment where selection occurred.

AB  - In shallow marine environments, benthic foraminifera are important foundation species and carbonate producers. Understanding their response to future climate is often drawn from their acclimation potential in short laboratory experiments, thereby limiting our understanding of migration, species replacement, and adaptive potential. To overcome this challenge, we examine two species of benthic foraminifera from a thermally polluted field site mimicking future warming. This site and a control station cover 13-36 degrees C causing both warm and cold stress to the local species. Computer Tomography reveals that under heat stress, even with acclimation, Lachlanella significantly reduced its shell volume. In contrast, Pararotalia calcariformata did not reduce its shell volume but reduced the relative amount of calcite with respect to shell volume and changed its reproduction cycle from twice to once per year. Raman spectroscopy indicates that thermal conditions alter the chemical composition of the calcite shells of both species. Calcification during thermal stress creates alterations in the crystal structure that are unexpectedlymore prominent under cold stress than warm stress indicating warming might positively affect the shell's protective function. Supported by previous laboratory experiments and observations from the geological record, our results provide new perspective to the effect of warming on benthic foraminifera.

AB  - The determination of thermophysical properties from an inverse method is an attractive technique both from the experimental and methodological point of view. The aim of this paper is to identify simultaneously the thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusivity of liquids and the heat transfer coefficient by the utilization of the well-known flash method which is coupled to an inverse parameter identification method. To be characterized, a thin layer of the liquid is sandwiched between two metal plates and a cylindrical sample holder. Then it is subjected on its front face to a heat flux density during a short time. The temperature evolution of the rear face of the container is measured during and after the thermal excitation. The identification procedure based on the inverse method consists in the minimization of an objective function that represents the errors between the measured temperature at the rear face and a theoretical model that describes the temperature evolution of the system (liquid and container). The theoretical model, which is a function of the unknown thermophysical properties of the three layer system, is calculated by the use of the thermal quadrupoles formalism. To minimize the objective function, a genetic algorithm is developed and used. Genetic algorithm is categorized as global search heuristics. It is an iterative procedure which borrows the ideas of natural selection and survival of the fittest from natural evolution which were first described by Darwin.
   The identification procedure based on the use the flash method and the developed genetic algorithm is used in this work to identify thermophysical properties of distilled water, glycerol, acetone, and ethylene glycol. A good agreement is found between our experimental results and the thermophysical properties indicated in the literature of the studied liquids. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

CP  - 2nd International Workshop on the Maturation Phenomenon in Cerebral Ischemia - Neuronal Recovery and Plasticity
AB  - In order to elucidate the cellular stress responses of the brain induced by ischemia-reperfusion, we investigated the induction of stress proteins in the cultured astrocytes exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation (H-R). In a separate in vivo study, we examined the inducibility of ischemic tolerance and heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) in moderately symptomatic gerbils by unilateral preconditioning ischemia. In the former studies, we first attempted to clarify the role of the most abundant stress protein, glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78, in H-R. Introduction of antisense oligonucleotide to GRP78 into astrocytes suppressed H-R-induced astrocyte release of interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cell lysates from H-R astrocytes displayed induction of IL-6, which was present in the samples immunoprecipitated with anti-GRP78, suggesting the role of GRP78 as a molecular chaperone for sustaining generation of IL-6 under the stress of H-R. Another unique stress protein, oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150), was purified and through several experimental steps we cloned the ORP150 gene successfully. These stress proteins may contribute to the adaptive response of astrocytes to ischemic stress, thereby ultimately contributing to the enhanced survival of neurons. In the latter studies, ischemic tolerance could be induced in the ipsilateral caudate-putamen of gerbils with moderate neurological signs secondary to preconditioning unilateral ischemia which was reversible but strong enough to induce HSP72. The present investigation strongly suggested an important role of stress proteins in the cellular stress responses of the brain subjected to ischemia-reperfusion.

AB  - Epoxy mold compound (EMC) and optical grade silicone based materials have been widely used in manufacturing Light Emitting Diode (LED). Silicones are being used as encapsulant and lenses for next-generation LED packaging designs, such as chip on board (COB) LEDs. Silicones serve several roles including protective lenses, stress relieving encapsulant, mechanical protection and light path materials. Even though silicone-based materials are typically hydrophobic, they are not resistant to moisture absorption, which may greatly affect the key attributes of silicones such as high transparency, high refractive index, stable thermo-mechanical properties, and tunable hardness. On the other hand, EMCs are used in LEDs as packaging material because of their low cost and high productivity, whereas their moisture absorption is long known. In this study, a new generation of silicone/phosphor composite films and a commonly-used EMC material for COB LEDs are studied regarding their moisture absorption and hygroscopic swelling behaviors by in-situ measurements. Moisture sorption tests were performed using TGA Q5000SA at different humidity and temperature conditions, such as 30 degrees C & 30% RH, 30 degrees C & 60% RH, 30 degrees C & 80% RH, 60 degrees C & 30% RH, 60 degrees C & 60% RH, 60 degrees C & 80% RH, 80 degrees C & 30% RH, 80 degrees C & 60% RH and 80 degrees C & 80% RH. Hygroscopic swelling was detennined using DMA-RH Q800 at 60 degrees C. Material properties including diffusivity, activation energy, saturated moisture concentration and the coefficient of hygroscopic swelling are extracted from the experimental data. Based on the results, comprehensive discussions are made on the characteristics of moisture absorption and hygroscopic swelling for the two different materials.

AB  - This study demonstrated the generation of clean water from seawater collected at the beach coast in Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Malaysia, with carbonized rice husk coated melamine sponge as solar absorber by a solar still. Melamine sponge was utilized as a seawater transportation medium since its porous structure is excellent in channelling the seawater. Whereas carbonized rice husk was used as the photothermal conversion material for its efficient heat absorption due to its black colour and porous structure. Implementing air gap between the seawater body and solar absorber, and restricted water pathway assisted in localizing heat on the top surface of the solar absorber. Clean water was generated under direct solar radiation during the day at an open space with average solar intensity around 1.1 similar to 1.2 kW/m(2) (slightly higher than 1 sun) for about 4 h. Efficiency of the solar absorber was calculated, while the quality of the generated clean water was observed in terms of salinity and pH value. Insulated solar still with carbon-coated sponge showed the highest efficiency at about 54.74%. Salinity of the collected clean water significantly reduced to consumable level which was approximately 55 ppm, and the pH value at about 6.73 where it was within the safe limit of the drinkable water pH.

AB  - Crassostrea nippona is a commercially important oyster species in East Asia for it is edible during the summer when the other oyster species are unavailable. Salinity is one of the important limiting factors to the survival and distribution of this stenohaline species. In this study, 535 million reads (74G data) from C. nippona were produced and assembled into 66,742 transcripts. The number of 19,253 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under salinity stress were identified as salinity stress-response genes. Through comparative evolutionary analysis in five Crassostrea species from East Asia, salinity stress-response genes were noticed to have higher adaptive evolution rates than other genes. This study presents the first de novo transcriptome of C. nippona. Furthermore, comparative evolutionary analysis implies that salinity plays an important role in speciation of Crassostrea species.

AB  - An alternative process of extracting energy from fossil fuels (coal, biomass, hydrocarbons, etc.) without the emission of CO2 is possible with nonequilibrium plasma. Apart from CO and CO2, there exists carbon suboxide (C3O2)-a solid carbon oxide, which can be polymerized to form chemically and thermodynamically stable substances. This article describes a novel process of extracting the energy from fossil fuels without the emission of CO2 while producing hydrogen and carbon suboxide (a reddish, brown polymer), an important constituent of organic fertilizers. This approach has the capability of avoiding drawbacks associated with combustion of fossil fuels, such as CO2 emission. The conversion processes of a hydrocarbon feedstock (n-butane) and characterization of the byproduct of the conversion process with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are discussed. Thermodynamic calculation of energy efficiencies of conversion of readily available hydrocarbon feedstocks such as biomass, natural gas, and low quality coal (lignite and peat) into hydrogen and carbon suboxide is also discussed. Thermodynamic results calculated show energy efficiency of up to 78% for producing carbon suboxide from various hydrocarbon feedstocks when compared to energy efficiency of producing syngas (100%).

AB  - This paper proposes the application of the covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) evolution strategy for the identification of building envelope materials hygrothermal properties. All material properties are estimated on the basis of local temperature and relative humidity measurements, by solving the inverse heat and moisture transfer problem. The applicability of the identification procedure is demonstrated in two stages: first, a numerical benchmark is developed and used as to show the potential identification accuracy, justify the choice for a Tikhonov regularization term in the fitness evaluation, and propose a method for its appropriate tuning. Then, the procedure is applied on the basis of experimental measurements from an instrumented test cell, and compared to the experimental characterization of the observed material. Results show that an accurate estimation of all hygrothermal properties of a building material is feasible, if the objective function of the inverse problem is carefully defined.

AB  - The recent series of global catastrophic events (e.g., heatwaves, flooding) have again raised the concerns over the greater impact of climate change. The focus has been concentrated towards reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel based energy systems. It is necessary to build a commercially viable CO2 sensor with high reliability. The gas-sensing field has shifted from using a cumbersome gas-reference electrode to solid-state electrochemical devices because they can be employed to detect CO2 in real-time overcoming the limits of widely used IR-based CO2 sensors. Here, solid electrolytes and mixed conducting semiconductor-based gas sensors for various gaseous species including CO2 are reviewed. The study on semiconducting metal oxides (SMOs) has been pushed forward as a most viable option for commercializing monolithic all-solid-state electrochemical gas sensors. Among SMOs, the perovskite-type metal oxides are considered as one of the promising structures for next-generation greenhouse gas sensors due to their remarkable thermal and chemical stability. This article also includes the fundamental understanding of essential factors that govern the electrical signals in all-solid-state electrochemical gas sensors. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The ionic liquid (IL) 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide/FeCl3 [OMIM]Br/FeCl3 was prepared with three molar ratios of [OMIM]Br/FeCl3 (0.5 : 1, 1 : 1, and 2 : 1), and fully characterized through H-1 and C-13 NMR, Fourier-transform IR, and Raman spectroscopic techniques. The optical properties of the prepared [OMIM]Br/FeCl3 ILs were revealed via diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectra. The photocatalytic activity of [OMIM]Br/FeCl3 ILs as homogenous photocatalysts were investigated towards hydrogen generation from methanol/water mixtures under visible light irradiation. The FeCl3-based IL with [OMIM]Br/FeCl3 molar ratio of 1 : 1 exhibited the highest visible light photocatalytic activity with a hydrogen productivity of 243.2 mmol h(-1) g(-1) and a hydrogen purity of 95.5 %; such a high hydrogen yield and purity was reported for the first time. It was proposed that [OMIM] Br acted as an electron acceptor, which delayed the electron-hole pair recombination of FeCl3. Also, [OMIM] Br could capture the produced carbon dioxide that is released with hydrogen gas. Additionally, [OMIM] Br/FeCl3 could be reused six times with nearly the same photocatalytic activity. These outstanding credits in terms of hydrogen generation rate and purity plus the economic feasibility, through several cycles of reuse, could certify such an IL as a promising photocatalyst for employment in water splitting. This paper suggests ways forward for research to develop the use of ILs as efficient and effective photocatalysts for hydrogen generation via water splitting.

AB  - The alternative energy sources in general and hydrogen based energy in particular have been currently grabbing great attention. Hydrogen is an efficient green source for power generation owing to its huge energy content. The operational costs and the hydrogen output are the key factors in the selection of a certain technique for the hydrogen production industrially. This study summarizes a new route for hydrogen production starting from a bit complicated hydrogen-containing molecules. Particular attention is given during this work towards a direct pyrrolysis catalytic conversion of long chains n-paraffin into hydrogen with in-situ production of nano-structured carbon particles. The simultaneous isomerization of the n-paraffin contented in the feedstock is also discussed during this process. This research study had provided new advances in the hydrogen production based on carrying out the production process at non-severe conditions namely; low operational temperatures and no pressure was applied. The introduction of a meso-porous molybdenum oxide catalyst for the catalytic hydrogen production is also a point of novelty for the presented work. Promising results have been disclosed at the end of this investigation; approximately 60 wt.% of the feedstock was converted to fuel gases while nearly 30 wt.% of the feed had turned as nano-carbon species. The hydrogen productivity had been detected as high as 42 wt.% of the original feedstock. This in fact might provide a new platform of the hydrogen production throughout the conversion of wax by-products. In comparison to two commercial catalysts, the hydrogen yield obtained by the prepared catalyst in this work had heavily scored. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The New Horizons spacecraft has found evidence for geologic activity on the surface of Pluto, including extensional tectonic deformation of its water ice bedrock see Moore et al. (2016). One mechanism that could drive extensional tectonic activity is global surface expansion due to the partial freezing of an ocean. We use updated physical properties for Pluto and simulate its thermal evolution to understand the survival of a possible subsurface ocean. For thermal conductivities of rock less than 3Wm(-1)K(-1), an ocean forms and at least partially freezes, leading to recent extensional stresses in the ice shell. In scenarios where the ocean freezes and the ice shell is thicker than 260km, ice II forms and causes global volume contraction. Since there is no evidence for recent compressional tectonic features, we argue that ice II has not formed and that Pluto's ocean has likely survived to present day.

AB  - In many animals, temperatures experienced by developing embryos determine offspring sex (e.g. temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD), but most studies focus strictly on the effects of mean temperature, with little emphasis on the importance of thermal fluctuations. In the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an Australian lizard with TSD, data from nests in the field demonstrate that offspring sex ratios are predictable from thermal fluctuations but not from mean nest temperatures. To clarify this paradox, we incubated eggs in a factorial experiment with two levels of mean temperature and three levels of diel fluctuation. We show that offspring sex is determined by an interaction between these critical thermal parameters. Intriguingly, because these two thermal descriptors shift in opposing directions throughout the incubation season, this interactive effect inhibits seasonal shifts in sex ratio. Hence, our results suggest that TSD can yield offspring sex ratios that resemble those produced under genotypic sex-determining systems. These findings raise important considerations for understanding the diversity of TSD reaction norms, for designing experiments that evaluate the evolutionary significance of TSD, and for predicting sex ratios under past and future climate change scenarios.

AB  - Body temperature has a major influence on the physiological processes, growth, reproductive output, and overall survival of ectotherms. When a habitat is altered as a result of natural or anthropogenic influences, the available temperatures in the habitat can change, thus affecting an animal's ability to thermoregulate. We studied thermoregulation in response to habitat change in a population of spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata) in Southern Ontario, Canada. Historically, the study site was ditched to draw down water levels to facilitate peat mining, and the resulting drainage ditches were the only habitat containing surface water and turtles were restricted to these drains. Recent colonization of the site by beaver (Castor canadensis) caused increases in water level and water surface area. We followed spotted turtles (N=16) outfitted with radio transmitters and iButtons to estimate body temperatures (T-b) continuously throughout the active season post-flooding. Turtle models outfitted with iButtons (N=50) were deployed in the nine available habitat types to record environmental temperatures (T-e). Turtles (N=13) were tested in a thermal gradient under laboratory conditions to determine preferred body temperature range (T-set). The T-set for the population ranged from 20 degrees C to 26 degrees C. In the field, T-b was within the T-set range 28% of the time from March to October, and 67% of the time from July to August. Efficiency of thermoregulation was calculated to be highest in July and August. The habitat type with the highest thermal quality was the shallow flooded zone created by beaver damming, and the habitat with the lowest thermal quality was the drain bottom, the drains being the only aquatic habitat available prior to flooding. This study confirms that beaver flooding provided a wide variety of preferable thermal opportunities for spotted turtles. Further investigation is needed to determine the effects of flooding on spotted turtle thermoregulation during nesting and hibernation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior exposure to extreme temperatures can induce thermoprotection in migratory locusts, which is important for survival in their natural environment. An important motor activity that needs to be protected is ventilation. The mechanism underlying heat shock is not ftilly understood, and our goal was to test the idea that cytoskeletal stability is critical for such thermoprotection. Cytoskeletal stabilizers (concanavalin A) and destabilizers (colchicine) were bath-applied in semi-intact locust preparations in both control (C) and pre-treated heat-shocked (3 It, 45 degrees C) animals. We measured parameters of the ventilatory motor pattern during maintained high temperature (43 degrees C) and recorded the times taken for motor pattern generation to fail and then recover on returning to room temperature. We found that concanavalin A mimicked the effects of a prior heat stress in control animals by increasing time to failure and decreasing time to recovery of motor pattern generation. However, colchicine destroyed protection in heat-shocked animals by decreasing time to failure and increasing time to recovery. Our findings confirm that the cytoskeleton has a mechanistic role in preserving neural function at high temperatures, possibly through stabilizing ion channels and other integral membrane proteins (e.g. Na+/K+ ATPase) and their interactions with heat shock proteins.

AB  - In the present work the aerodynamic performances of an innovative rotor blade row have been experimentally investigated. Measurements have been carried out in a large scale low speed single stage cold flow facility at a Reynolds number typical of aeroengine cruise, under nominal and off-design conditions. The time-mean blade aerodynamic loadings have been measured at three radial positions along the blade height through a pressure transducer installed inside the hollow shaft, by delivering the signal to the stationary frame with a slip ring. The time mean aerodynamic flow fields upstream and downstream of the rotor have been measured by means of a five-hole probe to investigate the losses associated with the rotor. The investigations in the single stage research turbine allow the reproduction of both wake-boundary layer interaction as well as vortex-vortex interaction. The detail of the present results clearly highlights the strong dissipative effects induced by the blade tip vortex and by the momentum defect as well as the turbulence production, which is generated during the migration of the stator wake in the rotor passage. Phase-locked hot-wire investigations have been also performed to analyze the time-varying flow during the wake passing period. In particular the interaction between stator and rotor structures has been investigated also under off-design conditions to further explain the mechanisms contributing to the loss generation for the different conditions.

KW  - OXIDATION
AB  - A comparison of the performance of Brassica carinata oil-derived biodiesel with a commercial rapeseed oil-derived biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel is discussed as regards engine performance and regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions. B. carinata is an oil crop that can be cultivated in coastal areas of central-southern Italy, where it is more difficult to achieve the productivity potentials of Brassica napus (by far the most common rapeseed cultivated in continental Europe). Experimental tests were carried out on a turbocharged direct injection passenger car diesel engine fueled with 100% biodiesel. The unregulated exhaust emissions were characterized by determining the SOOT and soluble organic fraction content in the particulate matter, together with analysis of the content and speciation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which are potentially carcinogenic, and of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones)that act as ozone precursors. B. carinata and commercial biodiesel behaved similarly as far as engine performance and regulated and unregulated emissions were concerned. When compared with petroleum diesel fuel, the engine test bench analysis did not show any appreciable variation of output engine torque values, while there was a significant difference in specific fuel consumption data at the lowest loads for the biofuels and petroleum diesel fuel. The biofuels were observed to produce higher levels of NOx concentrations and lower levels of PM with respect to the diesel fuel. The engine heat release analysis conducted shows that there is a potential for increased thermal NOx generation when firing biodiesel with no prior modification to the injection timing. It seems that, for both the biofuels, this behavior is caused by an advanced combustion evolution, which is particularly apparent at the higher loads. When compared with petroleum diesel fuel, biodiesel emissions contain less SOOT, and a greater fraction of the particulate was soluble. The analysis and speciation of the soluble organic fraction of biodiesel particulate suggest that the carcinogenic potential of the biodiesel emissions is probably lower than that of petroleum diesel. Its better adaptivity and productivity in clay and sandy-type soils and in semiarid temperate climate and the fact that the performance of its derived biodiesel is quite similar to commercial biodiesel make B. carinata a promising oil crop that could offer the possibility of exploiting the Mediterranean marginal areas for energetic purposes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extreme heat is a leading weather-related cause of mortality in the United States, but little guidance is available regarding how temperature variable selection impacts heat-mortality relationships.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined how the strength of the relationship between daily heat-related mortality and temperature varies as a function of temperature observation time, lag, and calculation method.
   METHODS: Long time series of daily mortality counts and hourly temperature for seven U.S. cities with different climates were examined using a generalized additive model. The temperature effect was modeled separately for each hour of the day (with up to 3-day lags) along with different methods of calculating daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperature. We estimated the temperature effect on mortality for each variable by comparing the 99th versus 85th temperature percentiles, as determined from the annual time series.
   RESULTS: In three northern cities (Boston, MA; Philadelphia, PA; and Seattle, WA) that appeared to have the greatest sensitivity to heat, hourly estimates were consistent with a diurnal pattern in the heat-mortality response, with strongest associations for afternoon or maximum temperature at lag 0 (day of death) or afternoon and evening of lag 1 (day before death). In warmer, southern cities, stronger associations were found with morning temperatures, but overall the relationships were weaker. The strongest temperature-mortality relationships were associated with maximum temperature, although mean temperature results were comparable.
   CONCLUSIONS: There were systematic and substantial differences in the association between temperature and mortality based on the time and type of temperature observation. Because the strongest hourly temperature-mortality relationships were not always found at times typically associated with daily maximum temperatures, temperature variables should be selected independently for each study location. In general, heat-mortality was more closely coupled to afternoon and maximum temperatures in most cities we examined, particularly those typically prone to heat-related mortality.

AB  - The performance of a six-axis force/torque sensor (F/T sensor) severely decreased when working in an extreme environment due to its sensitivity to ambient temperature. This paper puts forward an ensemble temperature compensation method based on the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) tuning the least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) and trimmed bagging. To be specific, the stimulated annealing algorithm (SA) was hybridized to the WOA to solve the local entrapment problem, and an adaptive trimming strategy is proposed to obtain the optimal trim portion for the trimmed bagging. In addition, inverse quote error (invQE) and cross-validation are employed to estimate the fitness better in training process. The maximum absolute measurement error caused by temperature decreased from 3.34% to 3.9 x 10(-3)% of full scale after being compensated by the proposed method. The analyses of experiments illustrate the ensemble hWOA-LSSVM based on improved trimmed bagging improves the precision and stability of F/T sensors and possesses the strengths of local search ability and better adaptability.

AB  - Self-sustaining populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were established in New Zealand, from a common introduction group, near the turn of the 20th century. To investigate possible population divergence over this relatively short time scale we compared size, growth, and hypersalinity tolerance of families from two populations over their first year of rearing under shared conditions. Differences in initial fry mass were consistent with egg-size differences, but there was also evidence of genetic differences in early growth rates. Size differences between the populations decreased over time and rank correlations of mean family mass with initial egg and fry masses degraded over increasing intervals to nearly zero by the end of the year. Population effects on hypersalinity tolerance were not apparent after 4, 6, or 10 months of rearing (from yolk absorption), but family effects were suggested by ANOVAs and by the existence of groups of families with seemingly different relative seasonal optima for tolerance. Thus far, investigation of juvenile traits under common environmental conditions has shown less genetic divergence between the two New Zealand populations than is suggested by the range of differences found for phenotypic traits measured on wild adults in previous investigations.

AB  - As an emerging developing technique for next-generation lithography, directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymer (BCP) has attracted numerous attention and has been a potential alternative to supplement the intrinsic limitations of conventional photolithography. In this work, the self-assembling properties of a lamellar diblock copolymer poly(styrene-b-methylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA, 22k-b-22k, L-0 = 25 nm) on Si substrate and an atomic layer deposition (ALD)-assisted pattern transfer technology for the application of DSA beyond 16/14 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology nodes, were investigated. Firstly, two key processing parameters of DSA, i.e. annealing temperatures and durations of BCP films, were optimized to achieve low defect density and high productivity. After phase separation of BCP films, self-assembling patterns of low defect density should be transferred to the substrate. However, due to the nano-scale thickness and the weak resistance of BCP films to dry etching, it is nearly impossible to transfer the BCP patterns directly to the substrate. Therefore, an ALD-based technology was explored in this work, in which deposited Al2O3 selectively reacts with PMMA blocks thus hardening the PMMA patterns. After removing PS blocks by plasma etching, hardened PMMA patterns were left and transferred to underneath SiO2 hard mask layer. Using this patterned hard mask, nanowire array of 25 nm pitch were realized on Si substrate. From this work, a high-throughput DSA baseline flow and related ALD-assisted pattern transfer technique were developed and proved to have good capability with the mainstream CMOS technology.

AB  - The emergence of virulent root-knot nematode populations, able to overcome the resistance conferred by some of the resistance genes (R-genes) in Solanaceous crops, i.e., Mi(s) in tomato, Me(s) in pepper, may constitute a severe limitation to their use in the field. Research has been conducted to evaluate the durability of these R-genes, by comparing the reproduction of several laboratory-selected and wild virulent Meloidogyne incognita isolates, on both susceptible and resistant tomatoes and peppers. We first show that the Me1 R-gene in pepper behaves as a robust R-gene controlling avirulent and virulent Me3, Me7 or Mi-1 isolates. Although the reproductive potential of the virulent isolates was highly variable on susceptible and resistant plants, we also confirm that virulence is highly specific to a determined R-gene on which selection has occurred. Another significant experimental result is the observation that a reproductive fitness cost is associated with nematode virulence against Mi-1 in tomato and Me3 and Me7 in pepper. The adaptative significance of trade-offs between selected characters and fitness-related traits, suggests that, although the resistance can be broken, it may be preserved in some conditions if the virulent nematodes are counter-selected in susceptible plants. All these results have important consequences for the management of plant resistance in the field.

Protein Sci. 2019;28:429-438.] described a computational strategy of applying molecular-dynamics simulations to estimate the relative stabilities of single-domain antibodies, and utilized their method to design changes with the aim of increasing the stability of a single-domain antibody with a known crystal structure. The structure from which they generated potentially stabilizing mutations is an anti-cholera toxin single domain antibody selected from a naive library which has relatively low thermal stability, reflected by a melting point of 48 degrees C. Their work was purely theoretical, so to examine their predictions, we prepared the parental and predicted stabilizing mutant single domain antibodies and examined their thermal stability, ability to refold and affinity. We found that the mutation that improved stability the most (7 degrees C) was one which changed an amino acid in CDR1 from an asparagine to an aspartic acid. This change unfortunately was also accompanied by a reduction in affinity. Thus, while their modeling did appear to successfully predict stabilizing mutations, introducing mutations in the binding regions is problematic. Of further interest, the mutations selected via their high temperature simulations, did improve refolding, suggesting that they were successful in stabilizing the structure at high temperatures and thereby decrease aggregation. Our result should permit them to reassess and refine their model and may one day lead to a usefulin silico approach to protein stabilization.

AB  - There are currently only two places in Portugal were native Artemia parthenogenetica can still be found. All other known populations have been eradicated by the invasive species Artemia franciscana, which has caused great losses of Artemia biodiversity in the Mediterranean region. The diploid strains found at the Portuguese salines are therefore of high conservation value. This study aims to assess the survival of these native A. parthenogenetica strains and of A. franciscana under a variety of environmental conditions. The effects of water temperature and salinity, of photoperiod and food supply (shortage) were studied in an experimental setup.
   The Portuguese parthenogenetic Artemia populations showed great variability in their physiological response to different abiotic conditions, suggesting possible local adaptations in response to different selective pressures experienced. For most of the conditions studied A. franciscana outcompeted the Artemia strain from Aveiro, whereas the strain from Rio Maior was more resistant than the A. franciscana under conditions that were similar to its local habitat. Strain-specific resistance to chemical conditions, related to pollution, are appointed as a potential cause why A. franciscana did not successfully invade Aveiro saline. The saline of Rio Maior has possibly not yet been invaded due to the fitness of its local Artemia strain in combination with its inland location. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of CO2 (LCCO2) emissions from automobiles using a hybrid life-cycle inventory approach to predict the growth of electrified vehicles in Japan. Herein, the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), plug-in HEV (PHEV), and battery electric vehicle (BEV) versions of the mass-produced Toyota Prius hatchback are analyzed, considering the automobile-usage environment in Japan. In particular, a breakeven analysis of HEV vs. PHEV vs. BEV is conducted in terms of LCCO2 emissions that are affected by (i) outside air temperature and (ii) CO2 emissions during power generation from the present day up to 2030. Our results show that HEV has the lowest LCCO2 emissions when the current thermal-power-dependent electricity generation mix (average for 2012-2014) is considered, followed in order by PHEV and BEV. However, it is predicted that in 2030, PHEV will have the lowest LCCO2 emissions, followed in order by HEV and BEV, as it is anticipated that nuclear and renewable energy sources will be widely available by 2030. PHEV is expected to gain popularity by 2030. Regarding BEV, large quantities of CO2 emissions are emitted during battery production. Furthermore, due to the domestic electricity generation mix from the present day up to 2030, the LCCO2 emissions of BEV will exceed those of HEV and PHEV.

TI  - FUEL EFFICIENCIES, ALLOCATION OF FUELS AND FUEL COSTS FOR POWER AND DESALINATION IN DUAL PURPOSE PLANTS - A NOVEL METHODOLOGY
T2  - DESALINATION
LA  - English
AB  - The top management or the owners of a company are mainly interested in the overall economics and productivity of their industrial plants, and are always on the lookout for analyses which should be able to guide them in their decision and policy making processes.
   They usually like the overall outputs to be compared to total inputs in terms of quantities and costs, are generally not bothered about the intricacies of individual plant/unit efficiencies and the technicalities, and therefore they are always looking towards simple and easier ways to assess their operations, plant effectiveness and economics.
   For the owners of a cogeneration power plant producing power and water, it is just another industrial plant which should produce two saleable products, from burning the fuel and processing the sea water. Cost-wise this should be economical and balanced.
   The Water and Electricity Department (WED), Abu Dhabi, has been using various types of hydrocarbon fuels as the main source of energy inputs for its power and desalination plants. The experience in fuel control has resulted in development of a proposed novel methodology for the analysis of combined power and desalination plants as a single unit, as far as fuel efficiency, the allocation of fuels to power and desalination and the relevant specific fuel costs for power generation and water production are concerned.
   The paper presents the idea of using a heat value for potable water produced from desalination of sea water. It discusses the use of overall fuel efficiency of the system for fuel allocation to power and desalination, and balancing the energy input against the output of power and desalination plants in the WED network, based on its own data.

AB  - Evolutionary biologists often seek to infer historical patterns of relatedness among organisms using phylogenetic methods and to gauge the evolutionary processes that determine variation among individuals in extant populations. But relatively less effort is devoted to making evolutionary biology a truly predictive science, where future evolutionary events are precisely foreseen. Accurate predictions of evolvability would be particularly useful in the evolution of infectious diseases, such as the ability to preemptively address the challenge of pathogens newly emerging in humans and other host populations. Experimental evolution of microbes allows the possibility to rigorously test hypotheses regarding pathogen evolvability. Here, we review how genetic robustness was a useful predictor in gauging which variants of RNA virus f6 should evolve faster in a novel high-temperature environment. We also present new data on the relative survival of robust and brittle viruses across elevated temperatures and durations of ultraviolet exposure, to infer a possible mechanism for robustness. Our work suggests that virus adaptability in a new environment can be predicted given knowledge of virus canalization in the face of mutational input. These results hint that accurate predictions of virus evolvability are a realistic possibility, at least under circumstances of adaptive thermotolerance.

AB  - The claim that supercontinents insulate the mantle is largely based on recognition that seismically slow mantle below the Atlantic-African geoid high coincides with the former location of Pangea. We investigate the viability of continental insulation by varying both plate geometries and mantle properties in six three-dimensional (3D) mantle convection models. The efficiency of continental insulation is quantified by calculating the rate of change of the average temperature in the subcontinental mantle. Our findings generally agree with two-dimensional (2D) modeling results. However, we conclude that 2D convection models may exaggerate subcontinental heating, particularly in largely bottom heated cases, and that subcontinental heating results from an absence of subduction in the subcontinental mantle rather than the insulation of active upwellings. Correspondingly, we find that when large degrees of internal heating are present in the mantle, hotter-than-average regions evolve below large oceanic plates.

AB  - Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD), caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum, is an endemic and problematic disease in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture. Previously, we have identified SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) associated with BCWD resistance in rainbow trout. The objectives of this study were (1) to validate the SNPs associated with BCWD resistance in a commercial breeding population; and (2) to evaluate retrospectively the accuracy of MAS (marker-assisted selection) for BCWD resistance in this commercial breeding program. Three consecutive generations of the Troutlodge May breeding population were evaluated for BCWD resistance. Based on our previous studies, a panel of 96 SNPs was selected and used to genotype the parents and ten offspring from each of the 138 full-sib families of the 2015 generation, and 37 SNPs associated with BCWD resistance were validated. Thirty-six of the validated SNPs were clustered on chromosomes Omy3, Omy8 and Omy25. Thus, at least three QTL (quantitative trait loci) for BCWD resistance were validated in the 2015 generation Three SNPs from each QTL region were used for haplotype association analysis. Three haplotypes, Omy3TGG, Omy8GCG and Omy25CGG, were found to be associated with BCWD resistance in the 2015 generation. Retrospective analyses were then performed to evaluate the accuracy of MAS for BCWD resistance using these three favorable haplotypes. The accuracy of MAS was estimated with the Pearson correlation coefficient between the total number of favorable haplotypes in the two parents and the family BCWD survival rates. The Omy8 and Omy25 haplotypes were positively correlated with the family BCWD survival rates across all three generations. The accuracies of MAS using these two haplotypes together were consistently around 0.5, which was equal or greater than the accuracy of the conventional family-based selection in the same generation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MAS for BCWD resistance is feasible in this commercial rainbow trout breeding population.

AB  - Rhinella spinulosa is an anuran toad species distributed latitudinal and altitudinal (1200-5000 m) from Peru to Argentina, inhabiting mountain valleys in the Andes. Considering the broad range of habitats where they live, it is important to understand the thermal physiological mechanisms, thermal tolerances and physiological adaptations for surviving in rigorous environments. We investigated the thermal parameters (field body temperature, selected body temperature, locomotor performance in field and laboratory conditions, and thermal extremes) during diurnal activity for a population of juvenile, post-meta-morphosed toads (Rhinella spinulosa) from the Monte Desert of San Juan, Argentina. Post-metamorphic toads are active from approximately 1100-1900 (in contrast to nocturnal adult toads). Our findings show that these toads have a wide thermal tolerance range, ranging from a critical thermal maximum of 36.9 degrees C to crystallization temperatures below 0 degrees C. During their active period, toads always showed suboptimal thermal conditions for locomotion. Despite the suboptimal condition for the locomotion, diurnal activity is likely to confer thermal advantages, allowing them to search for food and increase digestion and growth rates. We also found that the toads are capable of super-cooling, which prevents mortality from freezing when the environmental temperatures drop below 0 degrees C. The environmental temperatures are below zero at night, when toads are inactive and take refuge under rocks. In summary, this toad population demonstrates high thermal plasticity, as shown by a relatively high level of activity sustained over a wide range of ambient temperature (similar to 35 degrees C). These thermal adaptations allow this species of juvenile toads to inhabit a wide range of altitudes and latitudes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Because of ongoing climate change, populations of organisms are being subjected to stressful temperatures more often. This is especially problematic for ectothermic organisms, which are likely to be more sensitive to changes in temperature. Therefore, we need to know if ectotherms have adapted to environmental temperature and, if so, what are the evolutionary mechanisms behind such adaptation. Here, we use the nematode Pristionchus pacificus as a case study to investigate thermal adaptation on the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion, which experiences a range of temperatures from coast to summit. We study the evolution of high-temperature tolerance by constructing a phylogenetic tree of strains collected from many different thermal niches. We show that populations of P. pacificus at low altitudes have higher fertility at warmer temperatures. Most likely, this phenotype has arisen recently and at least twice independently, consistent with parallel evolution. We also studied low-temperature tolerance and showed that populations from high altitudes have increased their fertility at cooler temperatures. Together, these data indicate that P. pacificus strains on La Reunion are subject to divergent selection, adapting to hot and cold niches at the coast and summit of the volcano. Precisely defining these thermal niches provides essential information for models that predict the impact of future climate change on these populations.

AB  - In this study, animal-borne telemetry with temperature sensors was coupled with extensive habitat temperature monitoring in a dimictic reservoir, to test the following hypotheses: behavioural thermoregulation occurs throughout the year and temperature selection varies on a diel and seasonal basis, in a winter-specialist diel-migrating fish. Burbot Lota lota demonstrated nightly behavioural thermoregulation throughout the year, with a large seasonal shift between selection for very cold temperatures (<2 degrees C) optimal for reproduction during the spawning period and selection for warmer temperatures (12-14 degrees C) optimal for hunting and feeding during non-reproductive periods. During daylight hours, while L. lota avoided habitats warmer than optimal for reproduction and feeding during the spawning and non-reproductive periods, respectively, active selection was limited to selection for 4-6 degrees C habitat during the prespawning period. Although behavioural thermoregulation explained the night-time migration, behavioural thermoregulation only partially explained daytime behaviour, indicating that diel migration is best explained by a combination of factors. Thus, thermal-habitat selection was a good predictor of night-time habitat occupancy in a diel-migrating species. Together, these results show that thermal-habitat selection by fishes may be important throughout the year and a more seasonally plastic behaviour than previously recognized.

AB  - Bacteria of the genus Spiroplasma are widely found in plants and arthropods. Some of the maternally transmitted Spiroplasma endosymbionts in arthropods are known to kill young male hosts (male killing). Here, we describe a new case of Spiroplasma-induced male killing in a moth, Ostrinia zaguliaevi. The all-female trait caused by Spiroplasma was maternally inherited for more than 11 generations but was spontaneously lost in several lineages. Antibiotic treatment eliminated the Spiroplasma infection and restored the 1:1 sex ratio. The survival rates and presence/absence of the W chromosome in the embryonic and larval stages of O. zaguliaevi showed that males were selectively killed, exclusively during late embryogenesis in all-female broods. Based on phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, dnaA and rpoB gene sequences, the causative bacteria were identified as Spiroplasma belonging to the tick symbiont Spiroplasma ixodetis clade. Electron microscopy confirmed bacterial structures in the follicle cells and follicular sheath of adult females. Although many congeneric Ostrinia moths harbor another sex ratio-distorting bacterium (Wolbachia), only O. zaguliaevi harbors Spiroplasma.

AB  - Tetracycline (TC) antibiotic removal from water bodies is important to provide clean water and sanitation. Mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) photocatalyst derived from three different types of precursors manages to remove TC effectively under visible light irradiation. Among urea, thiourea, and melamine precursors, melamine-prepared GCN (MGCN) via thermal polymerization has the highest efficiency to photodegrade tetracycline (TC) antibiotics up to 99.5% (0.0122 min(-1)) within 240 min. The COD for TC removal by using MGCN was up to 77.5% after 240 min of degradation. This is due to the slow charge recombination and rapid charge carrier migration. The MGCN encounters different properties such as high crystallinity, dense structure allowing fast charges migration, and nitrogen vacancies that create a defect state that suppresses charge recombination. It was found that the conduction band (CB) of MGCN was located at a more negative position (E-CB = -0.33 V) than (O-2/O-2(center dot-)) and the valence band (VB) was placed at a more positive position (E-VB = 2.30 V) than (H2O/OH center dot), which allows generation of both radicals for photodegradation. Based on the cell viability test, the photodegraded TC in the water how non-toxicity toward Balb/c 3T3 cells after being irradiated (lambda > 420 nm) for 240 min under visible light. The MGCN prepared in this study demonstrated the highest effectiveness and recyclable photocatalyst for the removal of TC among all GCNs.

AB  - It is widely accepted that hydraulic failure due to xylem embolism is a key factor contributing to drought-induced mortality in trees. In the present study, an attempt is made to disentangle phenotypic plasticity from genetic variation in hydraulic traits across the entire distribution area of a tree species to detect adaptation to local environments.
   A series of traits related to hydraulics (vulnerability to cavitation and hydraulic conductivity in branches), growth performance and leaf mass per area were assessed in eight Pinus canariensis populations growing in two common gardens under contrasting environments. In addition, the neutral genetic variability (F-ST) and the genetic differentiation of phenotypic variation (Q(ST)) were compared in order to identify the evolutionary forces acting on these traits.
   The variability for hydraulic traits was largely due to phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, the vulnerability to cavitation displayed a significant genetic variability (approx. 5 of the explained variation), and a significant genetic environment interaction (between 5 and 19 of the explained variation). The strong correlation between vulnerability to cavitation and survival in the xeric common garden (r 081; P 005) suggests a role for the former in the adaptation to xeric environments. Populations from drier sites and higher temperature seasonality were less vulnerable to cavitation than those growing at mesic sites. No trade-off between xylem safety and efficiency was detected. Q(ST) of parameters of the vulnerability curve (0365 for P-50 and the slope of the vulnerability curve and 0452 for P-88) differed substantially from F-ST (0091), indicating divergent selection. In contrast, genetic drift alone was found to be sufficient to explain patterns of differentiation for xylem efficiency and growth.
   The ability of P. canariensis to inhabit a wide range of ecosystems seemed to be associated with high phenotypic plasticity and some degree of local adaptations of xylem and leaf traits. Resistance to cavitation conferred adaptive potential for this species to adapt successfully to xeric conditions.

AB  - In natural populations, insects regularly face an adverse impact of different natures: harsh weather swings, lack of food resources, the insecticidal treatment. We studied the effect of repeated episodes of mild heat stress of different frequencies on stress resistance of Drosophila melanogaster females. We found out that the mild heat stress (38 degrees C, 1 hr) repeated daily within 2 weeks resulted in (a) an increased activity of the dopamine (DA) metabolism enzymes, DA-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase, which suggested a decrease in DA level, and (b) an increased survival rate under acute heat stress (38 degrees C, 4 hr). The same mild heat stress repeated weekly had no effect on these parameters.

AB  - Climate change will alter many aspects of the ecology of organisms, including dispersal patterns and population connectivity(1). Understanding these changes is essential to predict future species distributions, estimate potential for adaptation, and design effective networks of protected areas(2). In marine environments, dispersal is often accomplished by larvae. At higher temperatures, larvae develop faster(3-5), but suffer higher mortality(4-6), making the effect of temperature on dispersal difficult to predict. Here, we experimentally calibrate the effect of temperature on larval survival and settlement in a dynamic model of coral dispersal. Our findings imply that most reefs globally will experience several-fold increases in local retention of larvae due to ocean warming. This increase will be particularly pronounced for reefs with mean water residence times comparable to the time required for species to become competent to settle. Higher local retention rates strengthen the link between abundance and recruitment at the reef scale, suggesting that populations will be more responsive tolocal conservation actions. Higher rates of local retention and mortality will weaken connectivity between populations, and thus potentially retard recovery following severe disturbances that substantially deplete local populations. Conversely, on isolated reefs that are dependent on replenishment from local broodstock, increases in local retention may hasten recovery.

AB  - Numerous opportunities For the separation and Fractionation of milk and whey components are presented as a result of continuing developments in filtration membranes modules and processes. The preparation of sufficient quantities of selected protein groups for functionality studies and food application tests requires considerable amounts of starting material, particularly in the case of whey-based constituents. Adequate amounts of membrane filtration surface area are, therefore, needed in order to expedite processing time, limit conditions for microbial growth and increase productivity from a product development point of view. With this objective in mind, a series of large pilot plant membrane separation systems based on microfiltration, ultrafiltration and electrodialysis were recently installed and commissioned. Rapid ultrafiltration of whey for the generation of high protein concentrates under a wide variety of conditions, including 'cold' filtration, is facilitated by a Memtech(TM) spiral wound membrane plant with a maximum surface area of 144 m(2) that is accommodated within 3 modules mounted in parallel. Designed to operate on a continuous feed-and-bleed principle, product is heated while pumping via a plate-heater to the plant's balance tank in order to raise temperature to the desired operating condition. Magnetic now meters mounted on the feed, permeate and diafiltration water lines enable the volume concentration ratio to be controlled throughout a run. Defatting of rennet whey by microfiltration using a Tetra Pak Alcross(TM) M, Type 2 x 19 Special, crossflow microfiltration (MF) plant fitted with a 0.1 mu m pore size ceramic membrane with a filtration area of 13.3 m(2) trebled flux rate during ultrafiltration at 12 degrees C under steady state conditions. High protein whey protein concentrates (ca. 80% total protein) were processed in the defatted and nondefatted state at either 50 degrees C or 12 degrees C for functional characterisation, Preliminary analyses indicate that all 4 WPC's produced weak gels. Native phosphocasein was prepared from skim milk using the above MF plant. Partial demineralisation of skim milk prior to MF was facilitated using an Ionics (Ionics Inc.) Electromat(TM) ED, featuring a 100-cell pair Mark III electrodialysis membrane stack. Electrodialysis resulted in improvements in the heat stability profile of phosphocasein, at the expense of rennet coagulation properties which were totally eliminated even in the presence of added calcium.

AB  - The Western honeybees Apis mellifera carnica and A. m. ligustica are closely related subspecies living in neighbouring regions. Metabolism and the upper lethal thermal limits are crucial physiological traits, adapted in the evolutionary process to environment and climate conditions. We investigated whether samples from these two ecotypes differ in these traits. The standard metabolic rate was higher in the A. m. ligustica population only at a high temperature (T (a) similar to 40 A degrees C; dVCO(2) = 12 nl s(-1); P < 0.05), probably due to a higher body temperature (dT(thorax) = 1.5 A degrees C; P < 0.01). The critical thermal maximum of activity and respiration was similar (difference activity CTmax = 0.8 A degrees C, respiratory CTmax = 1.1 A degrees C). The lethal temperature (LT50, 8h) revealed higher tolerance and survival rates of the Ligustica bees (Carnica 50.3 A degrees C; Ligustica 51.7 A degrees C; P < 0.02). Results reveal the adaptation of the two subspecies to their historic climate conditions, possibly favouring Ligustica in a warming environment.

AB  - The productivity zoning at the landscape level can help forest managers on land use decision making, based on correct area selection for the crop. The goal of this research was to estimate and generate a Eucalyptus productivity zoning of Sao Paulo state northeast and to determine the main limiting factors to growth based on model (temperature, frost, vapor deficit pressure, available soil water, and soil fertility). Productivity estimation was done using the model 3-PG, using as inputs estimated rainfall, maximum a minimum temperatures and soil maps. To validate the model, were compared the mean annual increment at 7 years (MAI 7) estimated by 3-PG with the inventory projection (forest with 5 to 8 years), corresponding around 58,000 ha. The average of all validated area was similar between the 3-PG estimation (41.9 m(3) ha(-1)ano(-1)) and inventory projection, (44.1 m(3) ha(-1)ano(-1)). However, when the comparison of the IMA7 between measured and predicted, stratified by soil type and farm was done, we found high data dispersion, probably because of the average climatic data used as model input, soil type detailing reflecting the soil water content, genetic material adaptation and silviculture management, or interaction of those factors. The results suggested that increase the analytical scale reduce the precision of the estimates. It was possible to make the zoning of the real productivity of Eucalyptus in the northeastern state of Sao Paulo. The most productivity areas were located at south. The main growth constraints were vapor pressure deficit and soil water content.

AB  - Background: In nature, insects have evolved behavioural and physiological adaptations to cope with short term exposure to extreme temperatures. Extreme heat events may increase as a result of climate change; this in turn will affect insect population dynamics. We examined the effect of abrupt and ecologically relevant gradual exposure to high temperatures on the survival and hsp70 gene expression in diamondback moth (DBM) adults and the parasitoid Diadegma insulare, as well as in parasitized and non-parasitized DBM larvae.
   Principal Findings: Tolerance to high temperatures in DBM adults was higher than in D. insulare adults. There was no difference in the survival of DBM adults between abrupt and ramped increases from 25 to 38 degrees C; however, at 40 degrees C survival was higher when the temperature increased gradually. In contrast, more D. insulare adults survived when the temperature was ramped rather than shifted abruptly to both 38 and 40 degrees C. There was no heat stress effect of up to 40 degrees C on the survival of either parasitized or non-parasitized DBM larvae. In adults of both species, more hsp70 expression was observed when temperatures increased abruptly to 38 degrees C compared to ramping. In contrast, at 40 degrees C significantly more expression was found in insects exposed to the ramping rather than the abrupt regime. Hsp70 expression level was in agreement with adult survival data and appears to be a good indicator of stress levels. In parasitized and non-parasitized larvae, hsp70 expression was significantly higher after abrupt shifts compared to ramping at both temperatures.
   Conclusions/Significance: Hsp70 gene expression was responsive to extreme temperatures in both DBM and D. insulare, which may underlie the ability of these insects to survive in extreme temperatures. Survival and hsp70 expression upon abrupt changes are distinctly different from those after ramping indicating that experimental protocol must be considered before extrapolating laboratory results to natural field situations.

AB  - Tilapias are one of the most important species in commercial aquaculture world wide. As mixed-sex tilapia stocks are mainly farmed in extensive systems their high fecundity and reproduction rate results in overcrowding of ponds. Therefore all-male stocks are highly desirable. Previous investigations in this species showed a strong influence of temperature on sex determination with an suspected underlying genetic basis. Thus, losses in productivity due to stunting of mixed sex Nile Tilapia stocks could be alleviated by production of temperature sensitive lines to sustainably increase the proportion of males by temperature treatment (36 degrees C/10 days). Starting with 36 families of Oreochromis niloticus from Lake Manzala (Egypt) as base population a two generation selection experiment was conducted to develop high and low temperature sensitive lines. The percentage of males in treatment groups was the selection criteria and the families showing the largest or lowest surplus in their sex ratios were selected. The results clearly indicated that selection for sex ratio in temperature treated groups is possible. In the second generation of selection a male percentage of 89.7% was obtained in the high line. Downwards selection resulted in a decrease of the male percentage from 65.2% to 54% in the second generation of selection. No correlated response to selection was observed in the sex ratios of control groups. The results showed that selection for temperature dependent sex ratios is a feasible approach. Thus, it seems to be possible to increase the male proportion in Nile tilapia by means of selection for temperature dependent sex determination.

AB  - Local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are main mechanisms of organisms' resilience in changing environments. Both are affected by gene flow and are expected to be weak in zooplankton populations inhabiting large continuous water bodies and strongly affected by currents. Lake Baikal, the deepest and one of the coldest lakes on Earth, experienced epilimnion temperature increase during the last 100years, exposing Baikal's zooplankton to novel selective pressures. We obtained a partial transcriptome of Epischura baikalensis (Copepoda: Calanoida), the dominant component of Baikal's zooplankton, and estimated SNP allele frequencies and transcript abundances in samples from regions of Baikal that differ in multiyear average surface temperatures. The strongest signal in both SNP and transcript abundance differentiation is the SW-NE gradient along the 600+km long axis of the lake, suggesting isolation by distance. SNP differentiation is stronger for nonsynonymous than synonymous SNPs and is paralleled by differential survival during a laboratory exposure to increased temperature, indicating directional selection operating on the temperature gradient. Transcript abundance, generally collinear with the SNP differentiation, shows samples from the warmest, less deep location clustering together with the southernmost samples. Differential expression is more frequent among transcripts orthologous to candidate thermal response genes previously identified in model arthropods, including genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins, heat-shock proteins, proteases, enzymes of central energy metabolism, lipid and antioxidant pathways. We conclude that the pivotal endemic zooplankton species in Lake Baikal exists under temperature-mediated selection and possesses both genetic variation and plasticity to respond to novel temperature-related environmental pressures.

AB  - Strict maternal transmission of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is hypothesized to permit the accumulation of mitochondrial variants that are deleterious to males but not females, a phenomenon called mother's curse. However, direct evidence that mtDNA mutations exhibit such sexually antagonistic fitness effects is sparse. Male-specific mutational effects can occur when the physiological requirements of the mitochondria differ between the sexes. Such male-specific effects could potentially occur if sex-specific cell types or tissues have energy requirements that are differentially impacted by mutations affecting energy metabolism. Here we summarize findings from a model mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibility in the fruit fly Drosophila that demonstrates sex-biased effects, but with deleterious effects that are generally larger in females. We present new results showing that the mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibility does negatively affect male fertility, but only when males are developed at high temperatures. The temperature-dependent male sterility can be partially rescued by diet, suggesting an energetic basis. Finally, we discuss fruitful paths forward in understanding the physiological scope for sex-specific effects of mitochondrial mutations in the context of the recent discovery that many aspects of metabolism are sexually dimorphic and downstream of sex-determination pathways in Drosophila. A key parameter of these models that remains to be quantified is the fraction of mitochondrial mutations with truly male-limited fitness effects across extrinsic and intrinsic environments. Given the energy demands of reproduction in females, only a small fraction of the mitochondrial mutational spectrum may have the potential to contribute to mother's curse in natural populations.

AB  - Urbanization is known to cause noticeable changes in the properties of local climate. Studies have shown that urban areas, compared to rural areas with less artificial surfaces, register higher local temperatures as a result of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and a high proportion of its population residing in densely built high-rise buildings are experiencing some degrees of thermal discomfort. This study selected Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, two typical urban communities in Hong Kong, to gather evidence of microclimate variation and sources of thermal discomfort. UHIs were estimated from 58 logging sensors placed at strategic locations to take temperature and humidity measurements over 17 consecutive days each in the summer/hot and winter/cool periods. By employing geographic information and global positioning systems, these measurements were geocoded and plotted over the built landscape to convey microclimate variation. The empirical data were further aligned with distinct environmental settings to associate possible factors contributing to UHIs. This study established the existence and extent of microclimate variation of UHI within urban communities of different environmental configuration and functional uses. The findings provided essential groundwork for further studies of UHI effects to inform sources of local thermal discomfort and better planning design to safeguard environmental health in public areas.

AB  - Plasma medicine is an interdisciplinary field and recent clinical studies showed benefits of topical plasma application to chronic wounds. Whereas most investigations have focused on plasma-skin cell interaction, immune cells are omnipresent in most tissues as well. They not only elicit specific immune responses but also regulate inflammation, which is central in healing and regeneration. Plasma generates short-lived radicals and species in the gas phase. Mechanisms of plasma-cell interactions are not fully understood but it is hypothesized that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) mediate effects of plasma on cells. In this study human blood cells were investigated after cold atmospheric plasma treatment with regard to oxidation and viability. Plasma generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the responses were similar in cells treated with concentration-matched H2O2. Both treatments gave an equivalent reduction in viability and this was completely abrogated if catalase was added prior to plasma exposure. Further, five oxidation probes were utilized and fluorescence increase was observed in plasma-treated cells. Dye-dependent addition of catalase diminished most but not all of the probe fluorescence, assigning H2O2 a dominant but not exclusive role in cellular oxidation by plasma. Investigations for other species revealed generation of nitrite and formation of 3-nitrotyrosine but not 3-chlorotyrosine after plasma treatment indicating presence of RNS which may contribute to cellular redox changes observed. Together, these results will help to clarify how oxidative stress associates with physical plasma treatment in wound relevant cells.

AB  - Rainfall scenarios are of considerable interest for design flood and flood risk analysis. To this end, the stochastic generation of continuous rainfall sequences is often coupled with the continuous hydrological modelling. In this context, the spatial and the temporal rainfall variability represents a significant issue, especially for basins in which the rainfall field cannot be approximated through the use of a single station. Therefore, methodologies for the spatially and temporally correlated rainfall generation are welcome. An example of such a methodology is the well-established Spatial-Temporal Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (STNSRP), a modification of the single-site Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) approach, designed to incorporate specific features to reproduce the rainfall spatial cross-correlation. In order to provide a simple alternative to the STNSRP, a new method of generating synthetic rainfall time series with pre-set spatial temporal correlation is proposed herein. This approach relies on the single-site NSRP model, which is used to generate synthetic hourly independent rainfall time series at each rain gauge station with the required temporal autocorrelation (and several other appropriately selected statistics). The rank correlation method of Iman and Conover (IC) is then applied to these synthetic rainfall time series in order to introduce the same spatial cross-correlation that exists between the observed time series. This combination of the NSRP model with the IC method consents the reproduction of the observed spatial-temporal variability of a rainfall field.
   In order to verify the proposed procedure, four sub-basins of the Upper Tiber River basin are investigated whose basin areas range from 165 km(2) to 2040 km(2). Results show that the procedure is able to preserve both the rainfall temporal autocorrelation at single site and the rainfall spatial cross-correlation at basin scale, and its performance is comparable with that of the STNSRP model for rainfall field generation. Given its simple formal structure (based on well established methods: i.e. NSRP and IC), we believe that the proposed approach can be conveniently utilized to generate spatially and temporally correlated rainfall scenarios.

AB  - The fish embryo test (FET) is an alternative to the classic freshwater toxicity test used to assess environmental hazards and risks to fish. This test has been standardized and adopted by the Organization for Economic and Cooperation and Development (OECD). As salinity may affect the substances' toxicity, we describe the development of an alternative euryhaline test species for embryonic ecotoxicological tests: the Brazilian silverside Atherinella brasiliensis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1825). This species is broadly distributed along the coast of South America and is able to inhabit a broad range of environmental and saline conditions. Ours is the first study on the maintenance of a native South American species for natural reproduction and the generation of embryos for tests. The embryos used are transparent and possess fluorescent cells which have only been seen in a few species and which may be used as markers, making it an alternative assessment tool for the lethal and sublethal substances in marine and estuarine environments. We provide a detailed description and analysis of embryonic development under different salinities and temperatures. The embryos and larvae developed in similar ways at different salinities, however as temperatures increased, mortality also increased. We considered the effects of the reference toxicants Zn2+ and SDS using a protocol similar to the FET that was standardized for zebrafish. Brazilian silverside embryos are as sensitive as freshwater, or euryhaline fish, to the surfactant but are more resistant to metals prior to hatching. We were able to show the advantages of the Brazilian silverside as a model for a marine fish embryo test (FETm) with high levels of reproducibility and little contaminated waste.

AB  - Beekeeping in Africa has been practiced for many years through successive generations and along inherited patterns. Beekeepers continue to face challenges in accessing consistent and business-driven markets for their bee products. In addition, the honeybee populations are decreasing due to colony collapse disorder (CCD), fire, loss of bees in swarming, honey buggers and other animals, moths, starvation, cold weather, and Varoa mites. The main issues are related to un-controlled temperature, humidity, and traditional management of beekeeping. These challenges result in low production of honey and colony losses. The control of the environmental conditions within and surrounding the beehives are not available to beekeepers due to the lack of monitoring systems. A Smart Beehive System using Internet of Things (IoT) technology would allow beekeepers to keep track of the amount of honey created in their hives and bee colonies even when they are far from their hives, through mobile phones, which would curtail the challenges currently faced by the beekeepers. However, there are challenges in the design of energy-efficient embedded electronic devices for IoT. A promising solution is to provide energy autonomy to the IoT nodes that will harvest residual energy from ambient sources, such as motion, vibrations, light, or heat. This paper proposes a Self-Powered Smart Beehive Monitoring and Control System (SBMaCS) using IoT to support remote follow-up and control, enhancing bee colonies' security and thus increasing the honey productivity. First, we develop the SBMaCS hardware prototype interconnecting various sensors, such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, piezoelectric transducer-which will work as a weight sensor-motion sensor, and flame sensor. Second, we introduce energy harvesting models to self-power the SBMaCS by analyzing the (i) energy harvested from adult bees' vibrations, (ii) energy harvesting through the piezoelectric transducer, and (iii) radio frequency energy harvesting. Third, we develop a mobile phone application that interacts with the SBMaCS hardware to monitor and control the various parameters related to the beehives. Finally, the SBMaCS PCB layout is also designed. SBMaCS will help beekeepers to successfully monitor and control some important smart beekeeping activities wherever they are using their mobile phone application.

AB  - We used a cold-climate viviparous lacertid lizard (Eremias prezwalskii) as a model system to test the maternal manipulation hypothesis. Twenty-four gravid females collected from a population in Inner Mongolia (northern China) were maintained in the laboratory for the whole gestation length, with 12 allowed to bask for 14-h daily and the other 12 for 10-h daily. Females selected lower body temperatures but did not thermoregulate more precisely when gravid. The mean gestation length was shorter in females provided with longer basking opportunity. Neonates in the two treatments differed in tail length and the number of ventral scales but not in other examined morphological traits, with offspring born in the 14-h treatment having longer tails but fewer ventral scales. Offspring were sexually dimorphic at birth, with females being smaller in tail length, head length and fore-limb length but having more ventral scales than males of the same size. Offspring born in the 14-h treatment were not only faster runners but also grew faster than did offspring born in the 10-h treatment. Our data validate the main predictions of the maternal manipulation hypothesis that females should shift selected body temperatures during gestation to provide optimal thermal conditions for developing embryos and that phenotypic traits determined by maternal thermoregulation should enhance offspring fitness. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the maternal manipulation hypothesis applies to cold-climate viviparous reptiles.

AB  - Experimental evolution of bacteriophage provides a powerful means of studying the genetics of adaptation, as every substitution contributing to adaptation can be identified and characterized. Here, I use experimental evolution of MS2, an RNA bacteriophage, to study its adaptive response to a novel environment. To this end, three lines of MS2 were adapted to rapid growth and lysis at cold temperature for a minimum of 50 phage generations and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Using this system, I identified adaptive substitutions, monitored changes in frequency of adaptive Mutations through the Course of the experiment, and measured the effect on phage growth rate of each substitution. All three lines showed a substantial increase in fitness (a two- to threefold increase in growth rate) due to a modest number of substitutions (three to four). The data show some evidence that the substitutions occurring early in the experiment have larger beneficial effects than later ones, in accordance with the expected diminishing returns relationship between the fitness effects of a mutation and its order of substitution. Patterns of molecular evolution seen here-primarily a paucity of hitchhiking mutations-suggest an abundant supply of beneficial mutations in this system. Nevertheless, some beneficial mutations appear to have been lost, possibly due to accumulation of beneficial mutations on other genetic backgrounds, clonal interference, and negatively epistatic interactions with other beneficial mutations.

AB  - N-Based fertilisers are paramount to support our still-growing world population. Current industrial N-2 fixation is heavily fossil fuel-dependent, therefore, a lot of work is put into the development of fossil-free pathways. Plasma technology offers a fossil-free and flexible method for N-2 fixation that is compatible with renewable energy sources. We present here a pulsed plasma jet for direct NOx production from air. The pulsed power allows for a record-low energy consumption (EC) of 0.42 MJ (mol N)(-1). This is the lowest reported EC in plasma-based N-2 fixation at atmospheric pressure thus far. We compare our experimental data with plasma chemistry modelling, and obtain very good agreement. Hence, we can use our model to explain the underlying mechanisms responsible for this low EC. The pulsed power and the corresponding pulsed gas temperature are the reason for the very low EC: they provide a strong vibrational-translational non-equilibrium and promote the non-thermal Zeldovich mechanism. This insight is important for the development of the next generation of plasma sources for energy-efficient NOx production.

AB  - The article presents final results of a 6-year screening trial carried out in central Chile comparing the adaptability and growth rates of 38 woody legume trees or shrubs mainly originating in the Chaco savanna region of southern South America, and two non-legumes of western European origin, Quercus suber (cork oak)and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Introductory plots, containing 28 individuals of each species, were established in the subhumid mediterranean climate, inner drylands (secano interior), of southcentral Chile (35 degrees 58'S 72 degrees 17'W, mean annual precipitation 695 mm, concentrated in the seven coldest months of the year).
   After 6 years, only three species showed excellent growth and survival (>86%) rates, and none of these was from the Chaco region: Acacia decurrens (Australia), Fraxinus excelsior (Europe), and Chamaecytisus proliferus subsp. palmensis (Tagasaste) from La Palma, Canary Islands. These latter two species were the fastest growing, yielding large quantities of edible and N-rich forage (4406+/-1650 and 223.0+/-137.4 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). F. excelsior also showed high potential as a source of a high quality wood for turning or cabinetry. Unexpectedly, the principal cause of mortality among the 38 species tested was frost rather than drought or acid soils. Many species in the legume genera Anadenanthera, Caesalpinia, Enterolobium, Faidherbia, Gleditsia and Prosopis performed poorly. Results are discussed in the context of a long-term ecological rehabilitation project based on agroforestry development and innovation for the Chilean secano interior. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A 3D finite element analysis has been carried out of the whole manufacturing process of a shackle involving the steps of closed-die forging and de-flashing of the extremity jaws, the open-die forging of the central body, and the ram bending of the crown. Thermal effects related to the transportation from the gas furnace to the mechanical press and from convective/radiative cooling were also taken into consideration. An elastic-plastic law with viscous effects was used to describe the thermo-mechanical behavior of the 34CrNiMo6 low alloy steel used for the shackle. Based on a fully coupled thermo-mechanical approach, the evolution of thermal and mechanical parameters was studied in details and compared with experimental measurements. A good agreement between the predicted and the experimental data for the die load, process energy, and the dimensions of the flash and the shackle was obtained. This study showed that design, optimization, and analysis of parameters for the manufacturing of shackles can be done efficiently with the use of the numerical simulation; such a numerical design could enhance the productivity.

AB  - Various theories have been proposed to explain the Moon's current inclined orbit. We test the viability of these theories by reconstructing the thermal-orbital history of the Moon. We build on past thermal-orbital models and incorporate the evolution of the lunar figure including a fossil figure component. Obliquity tidal heating in the lunar magma ocean would have produced rapid inclination damping, making it difficult for an early inclination to survive to the present-day. An early inclination is preserved only if the solid-body of the early Moon were less dissipative than at present. If instabilities at the Laplace plane transition were the source of the inclination, then the Moon had to recede slowly, which is consistent with previous findings of a weakly dissipative early Earth. If collisionless encounters with planetesimals up to 140 Myr after Moon formation excited the inclination, then the Moon had to migrate quickly to pass through the Cassini state transition at 33 Earth radii and reach a period of limited inclination damping. The fossil figure was likely established before 16 Earth radii to match the present-day degree-2 gravity field observations.

AB  - The exposure to extremely high temperatures varies across population groups. Those with better adaptation strategies (such as air conditioning) suffer less. This paper combines China's daily mean temperature data with comprehensive national survey data at the household level and estimates the relationship between high-temperature exposure and adaptation behavior of urban dwellers. We find that the usage of air conditioning and electric fans by urban households in China increases with their summer high-temperature exposures. The rise in the number of days with extreme heat (mean temperature exceeding 80 degrees F) induces the purchase and use of air conditioning. High-temperature adaptability varied across households-the rich are more likely to increase air conditioning usage to cope with the high-temperature discomfort; while the poor are less likely to afford such a market product for adaptation, they suffer more from high-temperature exposure. Such a variation in the affordability and usage of market products to adapt to climate risks will exacerbate the climate-induced inequality.

AB  - Population explosion and increasing living standard of people resulted in generation of more than a Giga ton of waste per annum worldwide. Hence waste is one of the global problems in 21st century and expected that waste generation continues in future also. Every human activity is left with some waste. There are some major sectors for waste generation, such as manufacturing sector, agricultural sector (in the form of biomass) and municipality waste etc. These wastes are having minimal value or even negative values and creating problem or burden to the environment, human health etc. Therefore, it is utmost important to process and manage those wastes properly. The existing waste management processes involves: recycling, dumping and landfilling, incineration/combustion etc., which are neither sufficient to nullify the adverse effect of the waste nor economic process. These management processes involve human intervention and thereby resulting huge expenses. Nowadays, there is a paradigm shift from management of waste into conversion of waste producing fertilizer, fuel, energy as well as carbon materials etc. In this review, effort is given exclusively to summarize the different processes of waste conversion into functional carbon material such as activated carbon, porous carbon, carbon nanotube, graphene, carbon dot, carbon fibre etc. It has been discussed with the help of illustrative examples from the literatures.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary restriction (DR) and variable diets on phenotypes and gene expression in oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), one of the most economically important pests in the family Tephritidae around the world. As expected, we found that DR altered the B. dorsalis phenotypes by significantly increasing stress resistance and lifespan, but reduced egg production when compared with the control diet. The results suggested a trade-off between reproduction versus somatic maintenance (stress resistance) and lifespan in B. dorsalis. Diet also had a significant effect on hatchability, and DR could increase the egg hatching success of B. dorsalis. Furthermore, DR up-regulated metabolic pathways involved in energy homeostasis and down-regulated pathways in egg production, which might mediate trade-offs between somatic maintenance and reproduction under DR regimes. The gene expression profiles in response to the acute dietary switches indicated that the digestive and metabolic pathways maybe involved in the adaptability of flies to variable dietary resources. In summary, the research facilitates a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the B. dorsalis' phenotypic adjustments to the different qualities of the available diets.

AB  - Global warming can have a significant impact on building energy performance and indoor thermal environment, as well as the health and productivity of people living and working inside them. Through the building simulation technique, this paper investigates the adaptation potential of different selections of building physical properties to increased outdoor temperature in Australia. It is found that overall, an office building with lower insulation level, smaller window to wall ratio and/or a glass type with lower shading coefficient, and lower internal load density will have the effect of lowering building cooling load and total energy use, and therefore have a better potential to adapt to the warming external climate. Compared with clear glass, it is shown that the use of reflective glass for the sample building with WWR being 0.5 reduces the building cooling load by more than 12%. A lower internal load can also have a significant impact on the reduction of building cooling load, as well as the building energy use. Through the comparison of results between current and future weather scenarios, it is found that the patterns found in the current weather scenario also exist in the future weather scenarios, but to a smaller extent.

AB  - Simple Summary The beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is an economic pest that causes significant damage to various vegetables and field crops in Korea. Timely forecasting of pest emergence and occurrence plays a vital role in pest management. To predict the spring emergence and population dynamics of S. exigua, constant temperature-mediated developmental parameters of S. exigua were studied with linear and nonlinear models on different plant hosts. The temperature and plant host significantly influenced the development of S. exigua. The total developmental time decreased with the increase in temperature, although there was no development at extreme temperatures. We developed a forecasting model, and our findings predicted the spring emergence of S. exigua in June. Thus, continuous monitoring of S. exigua in crop fields is needed to be ready to take advanced management measures against S. exigua. This study investigated the effects of different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27, 30, 35, and 40 degrees C) on the development rate of Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) eggs, larvae, pupae, and total immatures on plant hosts (soybean, maize, potato, and green pea). The eggs of S. exigua developed successfully at all the tested temperatures, except at 40 degrees C. The total developmental time (egg-adult) decreased with an increasing temperature from 15 to 35 degrees C on plant hosts. Stage-specific parameters such as the lower threshold temperature (TH) were determined using linear and nonlinear models (Sharpe-Schoolfield-Ikemoto [SSI]). The lower developmental threshold (LDT) and thermal constant (K) were determined using a linear model. The LDT and K for the total immature stage had respective values of 11.9 degrees C and 397.27 degrees -day (DD) on soybean, 11.6 degrees C and 458.34 degrees -day (DD) on maize, 11.2 degrees C and 446.23 degrees -day (DD) on potato, 10.7 degrees C and 439.75 degrees -day (DD) on green pea, and 12.2 degrees C and 355.82 degrees -day (DD) on the artificial diet. The emergence frequency of adult S. exigua over the full range of constant temperatures was simulated using nonlinear developmental rate functions and the Weibull function. This study predicted the spring emergence date in the first to second weeks of June, with approximately five generations for plant hosts. The interaction of temperature and plant host also influenced the development and longevity of the adults. Overall, the findings of this study may be useful for predicting the number of generations, occurrence, population dynamics in crop fields, and management of S. exigua.

AB  - The Northeast region of Brazil (NEB) concentrates on average 18 % of the total deaths associated with lightning strikes in Brazil. When considering population, the state of Piaui had the highest mortality rate in the region (1.8 deaths million(-1)), much higher than the national rate (0.8) and the NEB rate (0.5). This work aimed to evaluate the space-time distribution of total lightning (intracloud, cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground) in NEB, covering the period from 1998 to 2013. For this purpose, we used data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, which provided information on the occurrence of total lightning, and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor aboard on TERRA satellite, which provided the terrain elevation data to verify the influence of topography on the flash rate density (FRD). The full distribution was used to identify the hotspots (cities with the highest FRD), while the monthly distribution helped in the cluster analysis. NEB has great spatial and temporal variability of the recorded lightning rates, with average of 0-44.5 flash km(-2) year(-1). The regions with high total lightning rates are located in the states of Piaui, MaranhAo and west of Bahia. The topography of the region seems to act as a facilitator of the convective process, leading to the formation of intense upward currents, essential for the generation of electric charges inside thunderstorms. CAPE values showed good relationship with lightning occurrence in the region. The cluster with the highest occurrence of lightning and hotspots is in the region of influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and Mesoscale Convective Systems, suggesting an important relationship with large organized cloud systems.

AB  - The Dabu Cu-Mo porphyry deposit is situated in the southern part of the Lhasa terrane within the post-collisional Gangdese porphyry copper belt (GPCB). It is one of several deposits that include the Qulong and Zhunuo porphyry deposits. The processes responsible for ore formation in the Dabu deposit can be divided into three stages of veining: stage I, quartz-K-feldspar (biotite) chalcopyrite pyrite, stage II, quartz-molybdenite +/- pyrite +/- chalcopyrite, and stage III, quartz-pyrite +/- molybdenite. Three types of fluid inclusions (FIs) are present: liquid-rich two-phase (L-type), vapor-rich two-phase (V-type), and solid bearing, multi-phase (S-type) inclusions. The homogenization temperatures for the FIs from stages I to III are in the ranges of 272-475 degrees C, 244-486 degrees C, and 299-399 degrees C, and their salinities vary from 2.1 to 49.1, 1.1 to 55.8, and 2.9 to 18.0 wt% NaCl equiv., respectively. The coexistence of S-type, V-type and L-type FIs in quartz of stage I and II with similar homogenization temperatures but contrasting salinities, indicate that fluid boiling is the major factor controlling metal precipitation in the Dabu deposit. The ore forming fluids of this deposit are characterized by high temperature and high salinity, and they belong to a H2O-NaCl magmatic-hydrothermal system. The H-O-S-Pb isotopic compositions indicate that the ore metals and fluids came primarily from a magmatic source linked to Miocene intrusions characterized by high Sr/Y ratios, similar to other porphyry deposits in the GPCB. The fluids forming the Dabu deposit were rich in Na and Cl, derived from metamorphic dehydration of subducted oceanic slab through which NaCl-brine or seawater had percolated. The inheritance of ancient subduction-associated arc chemistry, without shallow level crustal assimilation and/or input of the meteoric water, was responsible for the generation of fertile magma, as well as CO2-poor and halite-bearing FIs associated with post-collisional porphyry deposits. The estimated mineralization depths of Qulong, Dabu and Zhunuo deposits are 1.6-43 km, 0.5-3.4 km and 0.2-3.0 km, respectively, displaying a gradual decrease from eastern to western Gangdese. Deep ore-forming processes accounted for the generation of giant-sized Qulong deposit, because the exsolution of aqueous fluids with large fraction of water and chlorine in deep or high pressure systems can extract more copper from melts than those formed in shallow systems. However, the formation of small-sized Dabu deposit can be explained by a single magmatic event without additional replenishment of S, metal, or thermal energy. In addition, the ore-forming conditions of porphyry Cu-Mo deposits in GPCB are comparable to those of porphyry Cu +/- Au +/- Mo deposits formed in oceanic subduction-related continental or island arcs, but differ from those of porphyry Mo deposit formed in the Dabie-Qinling collisional orogens. The depth of formation of the mineralization and features of primary magma source are two major controls on the metal types and ore-fluid compositions of these porphyry deposits.

AB  - Oxidative stresses commonly exist in natural environments, and microbes have developed a variety of defensive systems to counteract such events. Although increasing evidence has shown that high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and low temperature (LT) induce antioxidant defense responses in cells, there is no direct evidence to prove the connection between antioxidant defense mechanisms and the adaptation of bacteria to HHP and LT. In this study, using the wild-type (WT) strain of a deep-sea bacterium, Shewanella piezotolerans WP3, as an ancestor, we obtained a mutant, OE100, with an enhanced antioxidant defense capacity by experimental evolution under H2O2 stress. Notably, OE100 exhibited better tolerance not only to H2O2 stress but also to HHP and LT (20 MPa and 4 degrees C, respectively). Whole-genome sequencing identified a deletion mutation in the oxyR gene, which encodes the transcription factor that controls the oxidative stress response. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that the genes associated with oxidative stress defense, anaerobic respiration, DNA repair, and the synthesis of flagella and bacteriophage were differentially expressed in OE100 compared with the WT at 20 MPa and 4 degrees C. Genetic analysis of oxyR and ccpA2 indicated that the OxyR-regulated cytochrome c peroxidase CcpA2 significantly contributed to the adaptation of WP3 to HHP and LT. Taken together, these results confirmed the inherent relationship between antioxidant defense mechanisms and the adaptation of a benthic microorganism to HHP and LT.
   IMPORTANCE Oxidative stress exists in various niches, including the deep-sea ecosystem, which is an extreme environment with conditions of HHP and predominantly LT. Although previous studies have shown that HHP and LT induce antioxidant defense responses in cells, direct evidence to prove the connection between antioxidant defense mechanisms and the adaptation of bacteria to HHP and LT is lacking. In this work, using the deep-sea bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 as a model, we proved that enhancement of the adaptability of WP3 to HHP and LT can benefit from its antioxidant defense mechanism, which provided useful insight into the ecological roles of antioxidant genes in a benthic microorganism and contributed to an improved understanding of microbial adaptation strategies in deep-sea environments.

AB  - Regional-scale 40Ar-39Ar data presented in this paper reveal significant across-strike and along-strike age differences in the Committee Bay belt (CBb), Rae Province, Nunavut, Canada, that complement variations in observed monazite ages. 40Ar-39Ar hornblende ages are c. 1795, 1775, and 1750 Ma in the western, eastern and central parts of the Prince Albert Group (PAG) domain respectively. The migmatite domain and Walker Lake intrusive complex are characterized by c. 1750-1730 40Ar-39Ar hornblende ages without significant along-strike variation. The 40Ar-39Ar data provide important constraints on the cooling history and on thermal modelling that elucidates the controls on diachroneity and metamorphic patterns within the belt. In the western CBb, prograde monazite growth occurred 26 +/- 10 Myr earlier in the migmatite domain (1864 +/- 9 Ma; peak P-T = 5 kbar-700 degrees C) than in the PAG domain (1838 +/- 5 Ma; peak P-T = 5 kbar-580 degrees C). Calculations indicate that this earlier monazite growth results from tectonic thickening of higher heat productivity Archean lithologies in the migmatite domain, which undergoes more rapid prograde heating than the less radiogenetic and lower grade rocks of the PAG domain. Granite generation via biotite dehydration melting at 800 degrees C and 20 km depth is predicted to occur c. 1835 Ma, in agreement with geochronological constraints. The tectonic burial of crustal domains with contrasting radiogenic properties also explains the general congruence of lower to upper amphibolite facies metamorphic zones generated during the two main orogenic cycles (i.e. M-2-D-1 and M-3-D-2). The modelled timing of prograde monazite growth in the migmatite domain suggests that D-2 tectonic thickening began at 1872 +/- 9 Ma, some 8 +/- 3 Myr before monzazite growth, coeval with the inferred time of collision of the Meta Incognita terrane with the southern Rae Province. Along-strike diachroneity, reflected in 25 Myr younger monazite and 40Ar-39Ar hornblende ages in the eastern relative to the western PAG domain, cannot be accounted for by heat productivity contrasts along the belt. Instead the younger deformation and metamorphism in the eastern CBb was driven by its proximity to the eastern promontory of the Superior Province which collided with the Rae Province at c. 1820 Ma. The 40Ar-39Ar data presented here support the interpretation that the youngest monazite in the CBb crystallized at c. 1790 Ma in the central CBb when this part of the belt was downfolded into a gentle synformal structure while the western part of the belt cooled through 40Ar-39Ar hornblende closure. The results of this study illustrate the important influence of contrasting rock properties on the thermal evolution of orogenic belts and on the temporal record of this evolution.

AB  - With advantages such as being dopant-free and with relatively low thermal budgets, carrier selective contacts (CSCs) are gaining more attention recently. Among CSC materials Copper(I) Sulfide (Cu2S) is nontoxic and earth-abundant, but rarely investigated in this field. In this report, we present an assessment of the viability of applying Cu2S (through thermal evaporation) as hole selective contacts (HSCs) on silicon (Si) bottom sub-cell for III-V/Si tandem solar cells. A band alignment profile of Si/Cu2S stack is presented, based on characterization results for layers deposited by evaporation on n-type Si (n-Si), that suggests a dipole junction is formed at their interface and hole-selectivity and electron-blocking should be evident. Moreover, a characterization of passivation quality associated with structures of Cu2S/Si and Cu2S/a-Si:H/Si is presented.

AB  - Fine grained polycrystalline NiTi shape memory alloys containing 15 at.% Hf and Zr and zero or 3 at.% Cu fabricated by ingot metallurgy were investigated using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction in order to examine the viability of producing stable and affordable high temperature shape memory alloys. The alloys produced had a high thermal hysteresis, in excess of 70 degrees C but At temperatures of over 250 degrees C were obtained for Ni50Ti35Hf15. 3 at.% Cu additions did not significantly reduce the per-cycle degradation of transformation temperatures but did reduce the transformation temperatures. The evolution of the lattice parameters during the first five thermal cycles was observed. Negative thermal expansion was found in the b(B19'), cell direction in all the alloys examined and significant deviations in the lattice parameters in the region of transformation were found. A per-cycle evolution in the end-point B19' lattice parameters was observed, but no such evolution was found for the B2 phase, which is rationalised by appealing to the increase in population of interface dislocations.

AB  - Number of mares mated per stallion, foaling rate, reproductive life and generation interval of a Warmblood population were analysed exemplary as a basis for future breeding strategy. Records were obtained, for the period 1978 to 1991, from Hanoverian herd registration book. Out of the 189.006 registered matings 109.005 foalings were observed within the span of 14 breeding years.
   During the period between 1978 to 1991,45.4% stallions were mated with less than 10 mares. On an average, the stallions were kept for 4.0 years for breeding and mated with 29.S mares (s = 34.6) per season. The mean value of stallions mated with less than 10 mares per year, was 41.9%. The average foaling rate was 57.7% per year. The foaling rate increased with increase in the artificial insemination practise. In 1990 more than 61 % foalings were observed. The reproductive life of the mares born in 1977 was analysed. The average reproductive life of such mares were 4.6 years with 2.7 foals born within the span of 14 years. The generation intervals for dam-daughter, dam-son, sire-daughter and sire-son were L(dd) = 9.1, L(ds) = 9.2, L(sd) = 10.7 and L(ss) = 10.7 years for each respective path (s = 4.2-4.8).
   The integration of performance tests on mares in a breeding programme were discussed. Therefore, simulation studies were conducted. The application of test results for estimating more accurate breeding values of sires results distinctly higher selection response (about 25%) per generation.

AB  - Mass reflow (MR) has been widely used in the interconnecting process of electronic packaging. However, use of conventional MR shows a limitation in the miniaturization trend of electronic devices because of thermal damage to heat-sensitive polymer components from the high process temperature and long bonding time. Furthermore, MR cannot avoid warpage issues because it cannot provide thermal selectivity to the bonding area. These representative problems of MR indicate the need for an advanced bonding process with selectivity and mass product possibility. To meet the requirements of electronic packaging, advanced bonding processes were needed. Laser-assisted bonding (LAB) has been spotlighted as a next-generation interconnection technology to overcome the problems of MR. LAB has extremely fast ramping up speed with accurately controlled wavelength and excellent thermal selectivity. The LAB process could be applied in bonding of flexible, foldable, and even stretchable applications involving a polymer component with a low glass transition temperature. Furthermore, the short process time of LAB could provide not only enhanced productivity, but improvement in mechanical properties as a result of finer grain size and reduction in intermetallic compound (IMC) formation.
   SAC305 solder paste was printed on two kinds (OSP and ENEPIG) of surface-finished Cu electrode, and MR and LAB processes were performed to create solder joints. The mechanical reliability of solder joint was evaluated with shear test according to the JEDEC standard. Formation and growth of an IMC layer at the interface between SAC solder and Cu after soldering were identified with FESEM. A high-temperature storage test was performed to evaluate the long-term reliability of LAB compared to that of MR. Voids in solder joints were identified by x-ray scanner to compare the soldering processes and surface finish depending on aging time. Smaller IMC layer between solder joint and electrode thickness and fewer voids in solder joints were produced with LAB compared to MR.

AB  - Napier grass is a promising energy source on account of its strong adaptability and high productivity. Herein, an O-2-aided alkaline pretreatment with mild operating conditions was developed to modify Napier grass stem structure for improving its fractionated efficiency and enzymatic digestibility. Compared with the conventional alkaline pretreatment, it could be proceeded at lower temperature (80 degrees C) and dilute NaOH solution (1%) to remove over 80% lignin and retain 92% cellulose. The recovered lignin possessed typical structures of native lignin and well-preserved molecular weight, anticipating feasible potential in preparation of biomaterials or aromatic chemicals. Coupled with the enzymatic hydrolysis managements of solid remain and hydrolysate after the pretreatment, the recovery yields of glucose and xylose based on the raw material feeds reached 89.7% and 90.2%, respectively. This contribution demonstrates a highly-reliable strategy to fractionate Napier grass stem for maximizing fermentation sugar production and valorizing lignin toward sustainable biorefinery processes.

AB  - We present a high-resolution multiproxy middle Miocene sea surface temperature (SST) and productivity (SSP) reconstruction of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1318, from the upper slope edge (similar to 400 m water depth) of the Porcupine Basin continental margin, eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Biomarker and dinoflagellate cyst proxies reveal warm and mostly stratified waters during the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) that cooled similar to 3 degrees C across the Miocene Climate Transition (MCT). The organic biomarker (TEX86 and UK ' 37) paleothermometers document a series of 11 transient cooling events (CEs), superimposed on the long-term climate evolution. These CEs are associated with increases in cold-water dinocysts and correlate to global benthic delta O-18 shifts, including the Mi-2, Mi-3, and Mi-4 events. Most CEs are also associated with increases in primary productivity. A prolonged interval of high SSP between similar to 13.8 and 13.6 Ma supports the idea that carbon production (and burial) in shallow areas represents a feedback mechanism contributing to long-term atmospheric CO2 decline and cooling during the MCT. SST comparison in three North Atlantic sites (Azores Site 608, Porcupine Basin Site U1318, and Rockall Plateau Site 982) reveals that MCO SSTs are much warmer at Site 608 than at the other two sites. The low-resolution SST record of Site 982 shows no decrease in temperature around the MCT. This may be linked to contemporaneous tectonic changes in the Tethys, Central American, and Arctic Seaways impacting local ocean circulation, superimposed on global drivers of climate change.

AB  - Female adults of the rice leaf bug Trigonotylus caelestialium (Kirkaldy) (Heteroptera: Miridae) produce non-diapause eggs under long-day conditions, whereas they produce diapause eggs under short-day conditions. These egg-production modes change following a photoperiodic change from long-day to short-day conditions or vice versa, with individual variations in responsiveness shown in the time from the photoperiodic change to the mode change. Strains of this insect with higher or lower responsiveness to photoperiodic change were established after several generations of selection, indicating that the individual variation has a genetic basis. The selected strains that were more responsive and less responsive to one photoperiodic change were found to be less responsive and more responsive to the opposite photoperiodic change, respectively, indicating a significant negative correlation between responsiveness to reciprocal photoperiodic changes. The selected strains also had a significantly different incidence of diapause-egg producers in stationary photoperiods compared to a non-selected strain, showing that selections for responsiveness to photoperiodic change were essentially the same as selections for a higher or lower incidence of diapause-egg producers. These results indicate that responsiveness to photoperiodic change is one aspect of the tendency to produce diapause or non-diapause eggs. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Practical use of tetraploids in culture of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to make triploid production fish depends on (1) the effectiveness of the induction process and (2) the ability of tetraploids to reproduce and yield viable offspring. Investigations were undertaken to develop a protocol for the induction of tetraploidy to compensate for differences in time to first cleavage (i.e., first cleavage interval [FCI]). Small aliquots of eggs (similar to 500) from individual females were immediately fertilized and evaluated for FCI. The remaining eggs were stored at 4 degrees C for less than 24 h and were subjected to varying hydrostatic pressures at different initiation times and durations of treatment based on FCI. Tne most successful protocol involved treatment at 9,000 lb/ in(2)(633 kg/cm(2)) for 8 min starting at 62-65% of the FCI for two strains, while the results for the third strain were less clear and need further investigation. Observed population-level changes FCI over one generation of culture in our facilities reinforced the desirability of using protocols that varied with FCI. With the variation noted in FCI and the lack of information on its control, we recommend that treatment initiation be based on FCI analysis of a sample of eggs from each female used for tetraploidy induction. Although more research is needed to optimize the yield from this approach to triploid production, there is the potential for the selection of the best tetraploid lines to predictably generate genetically improved triploid rainbow trout for aquaculture.

AB  - The harpacticoid copepod Tisbe holothuriae HUMES was collected from Saronicos Gulf (Greece) and cultured under laboratory conditions, through several generations. Experiments of a factorial design were used to estimate the combined effects of temperature (14, 19, 24-degrees-C) and salinity (26, 32, 38, 44 parts per thousand) on the various parameters (development time, maturation time of egg sacs, interval time between egg sacs, longevity, number of offspring per egg sac, number of egg sacs per female and total offspring per female) and the demographic variables (T:Mean generation time, Ro:Net productive rate, r(m):Intrinsic rate of natural increase) of population dynamics of T. holothuriae. Response-surfaces curves were used to discern the interaction between the factors and to predict the optimum conditions for mass culture.
   Increase of temperature caused a decrease of Mean generation time and Net reproductive rate. The Intrinsic rate of natural increase decreased at temperatures lower or higher than 19-degrees-C. Salinities lower or higher than 38 parts per thousand led to an increase of the values of T and a decrease of the values of Ro and r(m). The linear and quadratic effects of temperature were proved to be important factors affecting most of the parameters of the population dynamics of T. holothuriae. The temperature-salinity interaction was found to be not statistically significant in all the studied parameters. At the optimum conditions (T:19-degrees-C, S:38 parts per thousand) the demographic variables were estimated as T = 11.107 days, Ro = 29.25 and r(m) = 0.304.

AB  - The global budgets of argon and heat-producing elements have traditionally been used to argue for layered-mantle convection because they require a large fraction of Earth's mantle to remain isolated from mantle convection. We revise these mass balance arguments using our new composition model of the primitive mantle and show that the global budgets of argon, heat-producing elements, and rare earth elements are consistent with Earth's mantle almost entirely composed of the mid-ocean ridge basalt source mantle, supporting the notion of whole mantle convection. Combined with a recent theory on the thermal evolution of Earth, our revised thermal budget implies inefficient mixing and processing in the past, explaining the survival of long-lived geochemical heterogeneities in convecting mantle.

AB  - Development and survival of reptilian embryos are affected by the temperature and moisture within the nest. Moreover, thermal and hydric conditions during incubation also affect phenotypes of hatchlings. Thus, females should select nest sites that enhance hatching success and produce hatchlings with phenotypes fit for the local environment. The objective of this study was to determine the substrate temperature and moisture conditions selected by eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) for nesting. In the laboratory, gravid females were housed in a large enclosure that provided suitable nesting substrate. Gradients of temperature and moisture within the substrate were established to provide a wide range of conditions from which females could choose. Fifteen (65%) females selected nest conditions within the moisture and temperature range that results in successful embryonic development. Two females (9%) nested in extremely dry conditions, and six females (26%) oviposited on the substrate surface. Females that nested in the field selected nest sites with similar conditions as females that nested in the laboratory. In general, we provide support for the idea that females choose nest sites with thermal and hydric conditions that are associated with positive hatching success.

AB  - Background Mutation accumulation (MA) has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. One example is that accumulation of conditionally neutral mutations leads to fitness trade-offs among heterogenous habitats which cause population divergence. Here we suggest that temperature, which controls the rates of all biochemical and biophysical processes, should play a crucial role for determining mutational effects. Particularly, warmer temperatures may mitigate the effects of some, not all, deleterious mutations and cause stronger environmental dependence in MA effects. Results We experimentally tested the above hypothesis by measuring the growth performance of ten Escherichia coli genotypes on six carbon resources across ten temperatures, where the ten genotypes were derived from a single ancestral strain and accumulated spontaneous mutations. We analyzed resource dependence of MA consequences for growth yields. The MA genotypes typically showed reduced growth yields relative to the ancestral type; and the magnitude of reduction was smaller at intermediate temperatures. Stronger resource dependence in MA consequences for growth performance was observed at higher temperatures. Specifically, the MA genotypes were more likely to show impaired growth performance on all the six carbon resources when grown at lower temperatures; but suffered growth performance loss only on some, not all the six, carbon substrates at higher temperatures. Conclusions Higher temperatures increase the chance that MA causes conditionally neutral fitness effects while MA is more likely to cause fitness loss regardless of available resources at lower temperatures. This finding has implications for understanding how geographic patterns in population divergence may emerge, and how conservation practices, particularly protection of diverse microhabitats, may mitigate the impacts of global warming.

AB  - Currently a resource more and more used by the petroleum industry to increase the efficiency of steam flood mechanism is the addition of solvents. The process can be understood as a combination of a thermal method (steam injection) with a miscible method (solvent injection), promoting, thus, reduction of oil viscosity and interfacial tensions between injected fluid and oil. Solvents are hydrocarbons well known for reducing these tensions and facilitating the production of heavy oil. The use of solvent alone tends to be limited because of its high cost. When co-injected with steam, the vaporized solvent condenses in the cooler regions of the reservoir and mixes with the oil, creating a zone of low viscosity between steam and heavy oil. Mobility of the displaced fluid is then improved, resulting in an increase of oil recovery. To better understand this improved oil recovery method, a numerical study of the process was done contemplating the effects of some operational parameters (distance between wells, steam injection rate, solvent type and injected solvent volume) on cumulative oil production and oil rates. A semi synthetic model was used. Some reservoir data were obtained similar to those found in Brazilian Potiguar Basin and others ones were obtained from literature. Simulations were performed in STARS (CMG, 2007.11). It was found that injected solvent volumes increased oil recovery and oil rates. Further, the majority of the injected solvent was produced and can be recycled. High initial productions achieved by models that use solvent have normally a significant impact on the operation economics, because earlier productions suggest that fluids injection (steam and solvent) can be interrupted earlier. On environmental point of view, it would have a reduction of energy and water consumptions for steam generation, having diminished Green House Gases (GHG) emissions. Also it is important to emphasize that the high oil rates presented by these models can generate an earlier financial return, and this would be decisive for the economic viability of the project.

AB  - Because cities contain high levels of impervious surfaces and diminished buffering effects of vegetation cover, urbanized environments can warm faster over the day and exhibit more rapid warming over space due to greater thermal heterogeneity in these environments. Whether organismal physiologies can adapt to these more rapid spatio-temporal changes in temperature rise within cities is unknown, and exploring these responses can inform not only how plastic and evolutionary mechanisms shape organismal physiologies, but also the potential for organisms to cope with urban development. Here, we examined how plasticity in thermal tolerance under faster and slower rates of temperature change might evolve in response to the more rapid spatio-temporal temperature rise in cities. We focused on acorn ants, a temperature-sensitive, ground-dwelling ant species that makes its home inside hollowed out acorns. We reared acorn ant colonies from urban and rural populations under a common garden design in the laboratory and assessed the thermal tolerances of F1 offspring workers using both fast (1 degrees C min(-1)) and slow (0.2 degrees C min(-1)) rates of temperature change. Relative to the rural population, the urban population exhibited higher heat tolerance when the temperature was increased quickly, providing evidence that temperature ramp-rate plasticity evolved in the urban population. This result was correlated with both faster rates of diurnal warming in urban acorn ant nest sites and greater spatial heterogeneity in environmental temperature across urban foraging areas. By contrast, rates of diurnal cooling in acorn ant nest sites were similar across urban and rural habitats, and correspondingly, we found that urban and rural populations responded similarly to variation in the rate of temperature decrease when we assessed cold tolerance. Our study highlights the importance of considering not only evolutionary differentiation in trait means across urbanization gradients, but also how trait plasticity might or might not evolve.

AB  - Kauffman's NK model for genetic evolution and adaption is analyzed for K = N - 1. In this case it describes adaptive walks on random fitness landscapes, and its dynamics is equivalent to the Metropolis algorithm for Derrida's random-energy model at zero temperature. We derive analytical expressions for the average length and duration of adaptive walks, and for the variance about these averages. The results are exact to leading order in N, the number of genes. We also find that the lengths of walks are Poisson distributed to leading order in 1/ln N, and that the duration of walks essentially is exponentially distributed to leading order in l/N.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is predicted to facilitate individual survival and/or evolve in response to novel environments. Plasticity that facilitates survival should both permit colonization and act as a buffer against further evolution, with contemporary and derived forms predicted to be similarly plastic for a suite of traits. On the other hand, given the importance of plasticity in maintaining internal homeostasis, derived populations that encounter greater environmental heterogeneity should evolve greater plasticity. We tested the evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in coastal British Columbian postglacial populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that evolved under greater seasonal extremes in temperature after invading freshwater lakes from the sea. Two ancestral (contemporary marine) and two derived (contemporary freshwater) populations of stickleback were raised near their thermal tolerance extremes, 7 and 22 degrees C. Gene expression plasticity was estimated for more than 14000 genes. Over five thousand genes were similarly plastic in marine and freshwater stickleback, but freshwater populations exhibited significantly more genes with plastic expression than marine populations. Furthermore, several of the loci shown to exhibit gene expression plasticity have been previously implicated in the adaptive evolution of freshwater populations, including a gene involved in mitochondrial regulation (PPARAa). Collectively, these data provide molecular evidence that highlights the importance of plasticity in colonization and adaptation to new environments.

AB  - Plasma sodium concentrations in field-caught Western tiger snakes, Notechis scutatus, from semi-arid Carnac Island (CI) varied seasonally, with snakes exhibiting significant hypernatraemia during summer and normal concentrations following autumn rain. In contrast, field-caught tiger snakes from a perennial fresh-water swamp (Herdsman Lake, HL) exhibited no significant increase in plasma sodium concentrations during summer. Laboratory-induced hypernatraemia caused thermal depression in both populations; there was a weak negative relationship between plasma sodium concentration and temperature selection that was significant for CI snakes. Hypernatraemia significantly elevated circulating concentrations of the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) in both CI and HL snakes. CI snakes injected with a physiological dosage of AVT also evidenced thermal depression. Despite the positive correlation between AVT and both plasma sodium concentration and osmolality for laboratory snakes, field samples from CI snakes indicate that circulating levels of AVT may be influenced more by plasma osmolality than sodium levels. The data suggest that, in CI snakes, chronic dehydration in the field leads to hypernatraemia which may lead to elevated levels of AVT if plasma osmolality also increases. This will in turn invoke a depression in thermal behaviour that may improve the water economy and survival of snakes on semi-arid CI. Although HL snakes do not experience seasonal dehydration, physiological changes away from the stable homeostatic state appear to prompt the same behavioural shifts, illustrating the intrinsic nature of the thermal behaviour in different populations of the same species of snake.

AB  - A critical requirement for both next generation conventional and nuclear plants is the development of simplified inelastic design and fitness for purposes procedures that give a reasonably accurate prediction of the complex multiaxial time dependent stress strain behavior. The accumulation of this inelastic strain in the form of coupled creep-fatigue damage over time is one of the principal damage mechanisms which will eventually lead to crack initiation in critical, high temperature equipment. Two main procedures that address creep-fatigue loading are generally used, either a time fraction or a ductility exhaustion approach. It is generally accepted that these methods enable conservative predictions within a factor of 2 to 3 and hence are reliable methods for code based design and fitness for purpose type assessments. However, for complex cycles, this may not be the case; for example, prior relaxation cycles are found to accelerate the creep rupture of the material with the result that a significant reduction in creep life can be observed. An investigation was undertaken into the influence of prior relaxation on resultant failure using a typical low alloy ferritic power station steel. Both time-based and strain based methods were used to predict the damage caused by the stress relaxation cycles followed by operation at steady state. The predictions found that while ductility exhaustion methodologies based on mean properties were adequate in predicting the failure life, time fraction methods were found to be extremely nonconservative for mean properties and only lower bound solutions provided an estimate of remaining creep life. The ASME time fraction approach, using isochronous curves was found to be extremely conservative for K = 0.67, but was able to predict similar damages to ductility exhaustion when K = 1 was used. The Monkman-Grant approach resulted in predictions that erred on the conservative side. The results have implications for both current and future conventional and nuclear power stations as it may be difficult for time based approaches to account accurately for complex cycling, shakedown conditions or stress relaxation at welds.

AB  - Temperature, precipitation, and climatic productivity expressed by Thornthwaite Memorial model in the major corn production regions in Inner Mongolia in the last 60 years were analyzed to assess the potential impacts of climate change on corn production. Temperature in Inner Mongolia from 1951 to 2010 has been increasing and abrupt changes occurred at all the six stations. Precipitation did not show significant trend, but with dramatic fluctuations. Changes in climatic productivity manifested that precipitation was the main constraint in Inner Mongolia, especially in warm and hot temperate corn production zones. In response to climate change, cool temperate zone in Inner Mongolia has the potential to serve as the stable corn production region in the future. Comparison and correlation analysis between climatic productivity and unit yield revealed that the standstill stage in maize production in Inner Mongolia may be constrained by meteorological factors, as should be a new concern about local food security in the future.

AB  - We evaluated and compared the thermal quality for a lizard community (9 species) in Sierra del Ajusco and Pedregal de San Angel (central Mexico) along an altitudinal gradient (2 320-3 530 m) to determine whether different thermal environments may be influencing species distribution and thermoregulatory behavior. Six areas that differ in elevation and vegetation type are chosen to survey environmental operative temperatures. Habitat thermal quality is estimated from the mean deviation of operative temperatures from lizards' selected thermal range. Results indicate 3 key findings: 1) operative temperature and thermal quality are higher at lower elevations (2 320 and 2 540 m), where xeric scrub vegetation was abundant; 2) thermal quality is lowest in closed-canopy pine forest (2 870 and 3 220 m); and 3) intermediate values of operative temperature and thermal quality are observed in open grassland habitat (3 000 and 3 530 m). These results support our hypothesis that elevation and vegetation type affect thermal quality and we conclude that thermal ecology studies should be conducted at multiple spatial scales to gain a better understanding of factors influencing the thermal niche and thermoregulatory profiles.

AB  - Neutrophils kill invading microbes and therefore represent the first line of defense of the innate immune response. Activated neutrophils assemble NADPH oxidase to convert substantial amounts of molecular oxygen into superoxide, which, after dismutation into peroxide, serves as the substrate for the generation of the potent antimicrobial hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the phagosomal space. In this minireview, we explore the most recent insights into physiological consequences of HOCl stress. Not surprisingly, Gram-negative bacteria have evolved diverse posttranslational defense mechanisms to protect their proteins, the main targets of HOCl, from HOCl-mediated damage. We discuss the idea that oxidation of conserved cysteine residues and partial unfolding of its structure convert the heat shock protein Hsp33 into a highly active chaperone holdase that binds unfolded proteins and prevents their aggregation. We examine two novel members of the Escherkhia coil chaperone holdase family, RidA and CnoX, whose thiol-independent activation mechanism differs from that of Hsp33 and requires N-chlorination of positively charged amino acids during HOCl exposure. Furthermore, we summarize the latest findings with respect to another bacterial defense strategy employed in response to HOCl stress, which involves the accumulation of the universally conserved biopolymer inorganic polyphosphate. We then discuss sophisticated adaptive strategies that bacteria have developed to enhance their survival during HOCl stress. Understanding bacterial defense and survival strategies against one of the most powerful neutrophilic oxidants may provide novel insights into treatment options that potentially compromise the ability of pathogens to resist HOCl stress and therefore may increase the efficacy of the innate immune response.

AB  - The oligochaete Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri at Foundry Cove (FC), New York evolved genetic resistance to cadmium (Cd) and lost resistance after contaminated sediments were removed by dredging. Selection (on survival time in dissolved Cd) was used to generate tolerance to evaluate fitness cost, the commonplace expectation for evolutionary reversal. The hypothesis that gene flow from neighboring populations could "swamp" resistance was addressed by 16S rDNA sequences. In disagreement with the cost hypothesis, selected-Cd tolerant worms and controls showed no difference in total fecundity or growth rate in environments. Highly-Cd-tolerant worms of the FC-selected population grew rapidly at different temperatures and showed no growth impairment in the presence of Cd, indicating metabolically efficient resistance. Genetic structure at FC was consistent with invasion of genotypes from an adjacent population in the time since dredging. Applying selection to lines from FC and a reference site, demonstrated a more rapid increase in Cd tolerance in FC-origin lines, indicating standing allelic variation for resistance at FC (despite phenotypic erosion). The selection experiment supports the view that resistance is simply controlled-probably by one allele of large effect. Whether such rapid "readaptation" could occur naturally is an important question for understanding broad effects of pollutants.

AB  - Intervention technologies for inactivating Salmonella on whole chia seeds are currently limited. Determination of the thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella on chia seeds and selection of an appropriate nonpathogenic surrogate will provide a foundation for selecting and optimizing thermal pasteurization processes for chia seeds. In this study, chia seed samples from three separate production lots were inoculated with a five-strain Salmonella cocktail or Enterococcus faecium NRRL-B2354 and equilibrated to a water activity of 0.53 at room temperature (25 degrees C). After equilibration for at least 3 days, the inoculated seeds were subjected to isothermal treatments at 80, 85, or 90 degrees C. Samples were removed at six time points, and surviving bacteria were enumerated. Whole chia seeds were diluted in a filter bag at 1:30 because bacterial recovery with this method was similar to that obtained from ground seeds. Survivor data were fitted to consolidated models: one primary model (log linear or Weibull) and one secondary model (Bigelow). E. faecium had higher thermal resistance than did Salmonella, suggesting that E. faecium may be a suitable conservative nonpathogenic surrogate for Salmonella. The Weibull model was a better fit for the survivor data than was the log-linear model for both bacteria based on the lower root mean square error and corrected Akaike's information criterion values. Lipid oxidation measurements and fatty acid concentrations were significantly different from those of the control samples, but the overall magnitude of the differences was relatively small. The thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella and E. faecium on chia seeds may be used as a basis for developing thermal pasteurization processes for chia seeds.

TI  - POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING ON NATIVE FISHES OF THE SOUTHERN GREAT-PLAINS AND THE SOUTHWEST
T2  - FISHERIES
LA  - English
AB  - Fish in streams of the southern Great Plains and southwestern North America may be particularly vulnerable to extirpation or extinction due to global warming.  Streams of this region already have some of the hottest free-flowing water on earth (summer maxima of 38-40-degrees-C), and even now fish live at times very near their lethal thermal limits.  Unlike, many terrestrial and marine organisms or fishes of some rivers, fishes in these prairie stream systems cannot migrate northward to cooler temperatures in the event of global warming.  If warming of 3-4-degrees-C occurs, a substantial number of species endemic to this region could face extinction unless they adapt behaviorally or genetically for thermal increases.  Existing evidence suggests little likelihood of successful behavioral adjustments.  Data on thermal tolerance of local populations provide conflicting evidence:  one widespread species of the Great Plains shows no difference in thermal tolerance across its range, whereas another shows adaptation to environmental temperatures at the local level.  Because of the evolutionarily brief time predicted for global warming, it is unlikely that genetic options can arise rapidly enough through mutation to allow species to cope with hotter environments.  Species that survive major increases in environmental temperature will likely be ones with adequate existing genetic variation to allow survival and selection of at least some individuals.  Overall, the outlook for native fishes of the Great Plains and southwest is bleak, if predicted temperature increases occur.

AB  - Climate change is increasing global temperatures and the frequency and severity of droughts in many regions. These anthropogenic stresses pose a significant threat to plant performance and crop production. The plant-associated microbiome modulates the impacts of biotic and abiotic stresses on plant fitness. However, climate change-induced alteration in composition and activities of plant microbiomes can affect host functions. Here, we highlight recent advancements in our understanding of the impact of climate change (warming and drought) on plant-microbiome interactions and on their ecological functions from genome to ecosystem scales. We identify knowledge gaps, propose new concepts and make recommendations for future research directions. It is proposed that in the short term (years to decades), the adaptation of plants to climate change is mainly driven by the plant microbiome, whereas in the long term (century to millennia), the adaptation of plants will be driven equally by eco-evolutionary interactions between the plant microbiome and its host. A better understanding of the response of the plant and its microbiome interactions to climate change and the ways in which microbiomes can mitigate the negative impacts will better inform predictions of climate change impacts on primary productivity and aid in developing management and policy tools to improve the resilience of plant systems.

AB  - Nuclear fuel cycles based on thorium are gaining close attention due to its higher availability and more homogenous geographical distribution. Thorium cycles, likely to be less problematic with regard to waste generation and weapons proliferation, will extend the availability of nuclear fuel by hundreds/thousands of years. The principal Th cycle involves the transmutation of the fertile Th-232 isotope into the fissile isotope U-233 by means of neutron capture. In the present study, the coupled operation of a hybrid fission/fusion system and a standard thermal reactor is analyzed. Using the MCNP neutronic transport code, the behavior for U-233 consumption/generation in both systems as a function of Th/U feed ratio to each reactor is analyzed. The useful composition range for the feed to the thermal reactor was found to be between 1.7% and 2.25%; within these range, breeder input enrichment can be found which causes the rate of consumption and generation of U-233 to be identical. Under this condition, from the point of view of the fissile isotope, the cycle is closed, with no net generation or consumption. The cycle requires a Th-232 input to compensate the amount spent on breeding the fissile material; for the range of interest, this varies between 0 and 35% of the total mass flow in the breeder leg of the cycle.

AB  - The compelling biologic basis for combining hyperthermia with modern cancer therapies including radiation and chemotherapy was first appreciated nearly half a century ago. Hyperthermia complements radiation as conditions contributing to radio-resistance generally enhance sensitivity to heat and sensitizing effects occur through increased perfusion/tumor oxygenation and alteration of cellular death pathways. Chemosensitization with hyperthermia is dependent on the particular mechanism of effect for each agent with synergistic effects noted for several commonly used agents. Clinically, randomized trials have demonstrated benefit including survival with. the addition of hyperthermia to radiation or chemotherapy in treatment of a wide range of malignancies. Improvements in treatment delivery techniques, streamlined logistics, and greater understanding of the relationship of thermal dosimetry to treatment outcomes continue to facilitate wider clinical implementation. Evolving applications include thermal enhancement of immunotherapy, targeted drug delivery and application of principals of thermal biology towards integration of thermal ablation into multimodality oncologic care.

AB  - Climate change-induced extreme heat events are becoming a major issue in different parts of the world, especially in developing countries. The assessment of regional and temporal past and future change in heat waves is a crucial task for public health strategies and managements. The historical and future heat index (HI) time series are investigated for temporal change across Iran to study the impact of global warming on public health. The heat index is calculated, and the nonparametric trend assessment is carried out for historical time series (1981-2010). The future change in heat index is also projected for 2020-2049 and 2070-2099 periods. A rise in the historical heat index and extreme caution conditions for summer and spring seasons for major parts of Iran are notable for historical (1981-2010) series in this study. Using different climate change scenarios shows that heat index will exceed the critical threshold for human adaptability in the future in the country. The impact of climate change on heat index risk in Iran is significant in the future. To cope with this crucial situation, developing early warning systems and health care strategies to deal with population growth and remarkable socio-economic features in future is essential.

AB  - Although growth response functions have previously been developed for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) populations in British Columbia, new analyses were conducted: (1) to demonstrate the merit of a new local climate model in genecological analysis; (2) to highlight new methods for deriving response functions; and (3) to evaluate the impacts of management options for existing geographically defined seed planning units (SPUs) for reforestation. Results of this study suggest that new methods for anchoring population response functions, and a multivariate approach for incorporating climate variables into a single model, considerably improve the reliability of these functions. These functions identified a small number of populations in central areas of the species distribution with greater growth potential over a wide range of mean annual temperature (MAT). Average productivity of lodgepole pine is predicted to increase (up to 7%) if moderate warming (similar to 2 degrees C MAT) occurs in the next few decades as predicted, although productivity would substantially decline in some SPUs in southern BC. Severe global warming (> 3 degrees C MAT) would result in either a drastic decline in productivity or local populations being extirpated in southern SPUs. New deployment strategies using the best seed sources for future reforestation may not only be able to mitigate the negative impact of global warming, but may even be able to increase productivity in some areas.

AB  - Many bacteria in nature are nutritionally deprived, and there has been heightened interest during the past decade in the properties of these bacteria. We subjected five populations of Escherichia coli to prolonged starvation in a minimal salts medium, during which time the density of viable cells declined by several orders of magnitude. From each one, we isolated a surviving clone that showed some heritable difference in colony morphology. We then characterized these mutants in two ecologically relevant respects. First, we determined the nature of their selective advantage, if any, during prolonged starvation. (i) Three of the five mutants had significantly lower net death rate when progenitor and mutant clones were starved separately. (ii) Three mutants showed a significant reduction in death rate in mixed culture that was frequency dependent and manifest when the mutant clone was initially rare. This pattern suggests that these mutants fed on some byproduct of progenitor cells (living or dead). (iii) Two mutants caused the death rate of their progenitors to increase significantly relative to the rate measured in the absence of the mutant. This pattern suggests that these mutants had become allelopathic to their progenitors. Thus, three distinct ecological adaptations to prolonged starvation are evident. No advantage was detected for one mutant, whereas two mutants exhibited multiple advantages. Second, we asked whether the starvation-selected mutants were as fit in growth-supporting conditions as their progenitors. All five mutants were inferior to their progenitor during competition in fresh medium. Evidently, there is an evolutionary tradeoff between performance under growth and starvation conditions.

AB  - This is Part II of two papers evaluating the feasibility of providing all energy for all purposes (electric power, transportation, and heating/cooling), everywhere in the world, from wind, water, and the sun (WWS). In Part I, we described the prominent renewable energy plans that have been proposed and discussed the characteristics of WWS energy systems, the global demand for and availability of WWS energy, quantities and areas required for WWS infrastructure, and supplies of critical materials. Here, we discuss methods of addressing the variability of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches demand (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources, using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in vehicle batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy supplies), the economics of WWS generation and transmission, the economics of WWS use in transportation, and policy measures needed to enhance the viability of a WWS system. We find that the cost of energy in a 100% WWS will be similar to the cost today. We conclude that barriers to a 100% conversion to WWS power worldwide are primarily social and political, not technological or even economic. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the chief challenges in hydrogen production through the photocatalytic splitting of water is to employ an efficient photocatalyst that has an absorption edge at the range of long wavelengths. In this study, composite structures made of different Ag-based shells over the core of Fe(2)O(3)nanoparticles were utilized as novel magnetic photocatalysts for hydrogen generation from water. Specifically, Ag nanoparticles, Ag/(3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTS), and Ag/polyethyleneimine (PEI) were capped on the surface of the hematite core to produce three visible light-effective photocatalysts. Structural and textural properties of the synthesized photocatalysts were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, their thermal stability and optical properties were respectively studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV reflectance. Photocatalytic activities of the presented core/shells were planned either as a function of the magnetic force or composition of the shell layer. It could be noted that the incorporation of organic or polymer layer could significantly increase the electronic density at the metal centers. Thus, the ability of iron oxide to catalyze the water-splitting process could be enhanced. Hence, the variation of shell structure could show a key-role in the photocatalytic potential of the presented structures in terms of manipulating the composition of produced gases. On the other hand, the magnetic nature of hematite could also positively affect the photocatalytic activity of these structures by minimizing the scattering of light irradiation during the splitting process. Particularly, shifting the way of photocatalysts dispersion from magnetic to mechanical (during water splitting) had in turn reduced hydrogen productivity from 540 to 485 mmol h(-1) g(-1). This obviously confirms the relationship between the level of hydrogen production by the presented photocatalysts and their magnetic nature which results in quenching of irradiation scattering.

AB  - Heat. shock affects reproductive performance in insects including Tribolium. castaneum. In. this study, the effects of heat shock on ovary development and hsp83 expression in T castaneum. Were investigated. Two lines of T castaneum, H line and C line, from, the same base population were established and maintained for five successive generations. In each generation, the newly hatched beetles (within 3 h after eclosion) in the H line were treated with a heat shock at 40 degrees C for I h, and those in the C line Were raised at normal temperature (30 degrees C) as control treatment. Four trails related to ovary development. were measured for the beetles of the fifth generation: days from eclosion to laying the first eggs (T-o), days from, eclosion to laying, the first hatchable eggs (T-h), ovariole size on the third day after eclosion, and pupal mass of their offspring. The results showed that the beetles of the H line had a significantly longer pre-oviposition period (0.6 more days) and smaller ovariole size than those of the C line. No significant difference in pupal mass was observed. Applying heal shock to the offspring of the fifth generation of both lines led to significantly higher hsp83 expression in offspring of the C line than in offspring of the H line. Within each line, the hsp83 expression. level in offspring with heat shock was significantly higher than that of offspring without heat shock, but, the difference in the C line was much larger than that in the H line. We infer from these results that a tradeoff between heat resistance, registered as hsp83 expression, and ovarian development operates under heal, stress in T. castaneum.

AB  - Cutting tool plays an important criterion for the overall performance of machining to achieve better tool-life, superior surface finish along with immense productivity. The evolution of cutting temperature along with increased cutting parameters accelerates the plastic deformation of insert tip, cutting edge breakage and thus affects the surface quality. Built-up-edge (BUE) formation also enhances rapid tool wear, fluctuations of cutting forces, and vibration. Therefore in modern manufacturing to enhance productivity considering good surface quality, there is striving for innovation and research in the area of novel cutting tool materials. Hard machining emerges as a newer process alternative to traditional grinding performance where popular cutting tool materials used as CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride), ceramics, and coated carbides etc. The benefits of hard machining serve as reduction of the manufacturing cycle, cost, and environmental friendly. Thermal softening and reduction of shear stress due to the rise of cutting temperature enable hard machining easier under dry environment compared to flood cooling. However, tool wear and surface roughness deteriorates and thus reduces tool life due to frequent failure of cutting edge. Thus in the current review, the performance of cutting tool materials during machining hardened steels is focused. Moreover, a proper selection of cooling and lubrication strategy can prolong the tool life and surface finish. Different hard thin layer coatings on carbide tools enhance the machining performance due to thermal barrier, abrasion, and diffusion resistance properties. Due to techno-economical feasibility, coated carbide cutting tools are extensively used during hard machining in recent years which has been developed by CVD/PVD method.

AB  - A proportion of Helicoverpa armigera collected from fields in Okayama Prefecture (Western Japan; 34.6 degrees N. 134.1 degrees E) does not enter diapause when reared under a short days at 20 degrees C during the larval stages. However, diapause in such photo-insensitive individuals call be induced when they are reared at moderately low temperatures, Such as 15 degrees C. regardless of photoperiod. To determine whether such photo-insensitive individuals can survive overwintering in fields, the present study compares the cold hardiness and sugar content between nondiapausing and diapausing pupae of photo-insensitive individuals selected over several generations at 20 degrees C under a short day photoperiod (LD 10 : 14 h). Diapausing and nondiapausing, pupae are obtained under the short days by rearing at 15 and 20 degrees C, respectively, during larval and pupal stages. These pupae are stepwise acclimated at a reduction of 5 degrees C every 5 days to 0 degrees C. Maximum survival periods, of nondiapausing and diapausing pupae at 0 degrees C are approximately 30 and 90 days, respectively. Trehalose content in diapausing pupae increases, reaches a maximum level (1.95 mg 100 mg(-1) in males and 2.1 mg 100mg(-1) in females) 28days after exposure to 0 degrees C and then decreases. On the other hand, glucose content in diapausing pupae increases (maximum level: 0.32 mg 100 mg(-1) in males and 0.21 mg 100 mg(-1) in females) with decreasing trehalose content 42 days after exposure to 0 degrees C. The decrease in trehalose content and the increase in glucose content may be linked to termination of diapause in H. armigera. These results suggest that, in Japan, the photo-insensitive individuals call only survive in the mild winters of southern regions. and not in the severe winters of northern regions.

AB  - This study investigates the techno-economic feasibility of an off-grid integrated solar/wind/hydrokinetic plant to co-generate electricity and hydrogen for a remote micro-community. In addition to the techno-economic viability assessment of the proposed system via HOMER (hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources), a sensitivity analysis is conducted to ascertain the impact of +/- 10% fluctuations in wind speed, solar radiation, temperature, and water velocity on annual electric production, unmet electricity load, LCOE (levelized cost of electricity), and NPC (net present cost). For this, a far-off village with 15 households is selected as the case study. The results reveal that the NPC, LCOE, and LCOH (levelized cost of hydrogen) of the system are equal to $333,074, 0.1155 $/kWh, and 4.59 $/kg, respectively. Technical analysis indicates that the PV system with the rated capacity of 40 kW accounts for 43.7% of total electricity generation. This portion for the wind turbine and the hydrokinetic turbine with nominal capacities of 10 kW and 20 kW equates to 23.6% and 32.6%, respectively. Finally, the results of sensitivity assessment show that among the four variables only a +10% fluctuation in water velocity causes a 20% decline in NPC and LCOE.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
LA  - English
AB  - Multifunctional nanodevices integrated with excellent optoelectric and thermoelectric properties are highly demanded for developing next generation self-powered optoelectronics. In the work, we demonstrate the viability of a coupled structure of homologous In2O3(ZnO)(m) with In-doped ZnO into heterojunction belts synthesized by alloy-evaporation deposition, offering multiple functions with strong confined optical emissions and high power factors. Energy-filter secondary electron images reveal a five-layer contrast in the width direction of the belts due to different ionization energies corresponding to In2O3(ZnO)(m)/In:ZnO/ZnO/In:ZnO/In2O3(ZnO)(m) as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy analysis. The indium-doped ZnO channels confined in two sides behave like quantum wells through band alignment, and become predominant in the main UV emission at 385 nm, as revealed by cathodoluminescence spectroscopic imaging. More intriguingly, this novel heterostructure provides an ideal pathway to enhance electron conduction through the indium doped ZnO layer, and the homologous In2O3(ZnO)(m) layer contains numerous interfaces to impede phonon transportation. In this way, the power factor of the heterostructure is greatly enhanced to be 2.07 x 10(-4) W m(-1) K-2 at room temperature, as compared to about 1.03 x 10(-5) W m(-1) K-2 for the undoped ZnO nanowires. This unique heterostructure achieved by a facile one-step growth process offers a new concept for designing devices by manipulating photons via coupling with electrons and phonons.

AB  - Estimating the performance of all the components of a recuperated micro gas turbine cycle plays a determinant role in improving their reliability for distributed power generation and cogeneration. The monitoring and diagnostic activity consists in continuously evaluating the productivity capacity and the efficiency of the plant, using the stream of data coming from the plant's instrumentation. In this framework a diagnostic tool for the micro gas turbine installed at the TPG test rig (located in Savona, Italy) was developed, with the objective of monitoring the operating parameters of the turbomachine, the performance of the heat exchanger and, in general, the good operation of the plant.
   Even though the commercial machine is equipped with the essential probes for control (rotational speed, TOT, intake temperature and eating water temperature meters) and diagnostic purposes (vibration sensor, filter differential pressure and other thermocouples), further instruments were introduced in the test rig to measure a larger number of properties and points. As result of this, a wide number of measurements is available and can be effectively used for the development of a diagnostic model. The diagnostic model presented in this paper is written in Matlab-Simulink (R) environment and, in its first version, provides information about compressor and turbine efficiency and heat exchanger effectiveness. The model was developed starting from the turbomachinery maps and the heat exchanger design performance. A validation of the code was performed using the measurements coming directly from the data acquisition system. Preliminary results coming from the model are presented, showing the different performance of each component of the plant in the various operating conditions.

AB  - The increasing fossil energy demand and carbon emissions pose a significant challenge to the world. According to climate adaptability design, the balcony is open type in Changsha. The study evaluates the energy-saving potential and the economic and environmental feasibility of installing the balcony in living rooms, and considering the effect of balcony orientations and air conditioning types. The economic viability is analyzed using the construction cost of the balcony and the extra market price of a residence with a balcony paid by the holder, respectively. Environmental feasibility assessment mainly adopts the CO2 emission payback period as the index. The annual electricity saving percentage of the split-type air conditioner in the living rooms facing four orientations with a balcony is in between 6.7% and 12.3%. And the balcony's investment payback period facing east or west orientation is less than 50 years based on construction cost. It has better environmental benefits with the CO2 emission payback period of the balcony facing four orientations is in between 10.4 and 24.6 years. Considering a living room constructed with a balcony, it is not feasible for dwellers to use a gas boiler, adopting the radiant floor system during the heating from the perspective of economic and CO2 emission.

AB  - The sex-determining mechanism has important demographic and genetic consequences by virtue of its effect on the population sex ratio. Here we investigate the effect of temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) on the primary sex ratio of the harpacticoid copepod, Tigriopus californicus. At the two experimental temperatures (15degrees and 22degreesC) used in this study, the primary sex ratio is almost always biased in favour of males. Higher temperatures induce masculinization and the change in sex ratio is not caused by differential mortality of the sexes. The mean level of TSD in the population is small (proportion of males increases by similar to5% between 15degrees and 22degreesC) because only one-third of the families actually exhibit a significant sex-ratio response while the rest of the population is insensitive to temperature. A comparison of the primary sex ratio and the level of TSD between two locations reveals few differences among populations. Finally, individuals still exhibited TSD after having been maintained under constant temperature conditions in the lab for several generations. In addition the proportion of temperature-sensitive individuals remained unchanged. This suggests that the observed level of TSD is not an artefact of testing field-captured individuals in a novel laboratory environment. At this point the adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination in T californicus remains unknown.

AB  - Various stresses are commonly encountered by probiotics in their ecological niches. Effects of adaptation treatments on the heat tolerance of Lactobacillus plantarum KLDS 1.0628 were evaluated. Cells pre-adapted to heat, cold, oxidative, acid, bile salt, and osmotic stresses were evaluated for tolerance and cross-protection against subsequent challenge. Except for cold, pre-adaptation to sublethal levels of stress significantly improved the cell viability after heat challenge compared to the control. Heat-adapted cells showed the highest heat stress tolerance, with their tolerance factor against heat challenge reaching 31.38-fold after pre-adaptation at 45 degrees C for 1 h. Moreover, adaptation treatments improved tolerance to the same stress and evoked cross-protection against heterologous challenges, inducing a significantly lower ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acid content in the cell membrane of L. plantarum KLDS 1.0628. The results indicated that adaptation treatments are potential strategies for enhancing the survival rate of probiotics and exerting their functional properties.

AB  - Residential buildings constitute one of the largest demands for electricity. Although the contribution of air-conditioning to total energy use is quite small in many climates, this end-use can place a disproportionate demand upon the central electrical generation, transmission, and distribution system, particularly in the late afternoon of hot summer days. Even in some heating dominated climates, these can be the times of system-wide peak demand, and it is common for electrical systems (such as in Ontario. Canada) to meet marginal demands during these peak periods using generators fired by GHG-intensive fuels (coal and natural gas). The viability of achieving a zero peak house (ZPH)-a house that draws no electricity from the grid during system-wide peak periods-has been assessed via detailed building performance simulations using a case study house based upon a tract-built design in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was found that 41%-51% of the goal of eliminating electricity consumption during the summer Ontario on-peak period (11h00 to 17h00 during weekdays from May 1 through October 31) could be achieved through a combination of architectural, control, efficiency, and occupant behaviour measures. It was also found that the remaining demand for electricity could be completely eliminated using realistically sized photovoltaic and battery systems for on-site generation and storage of electricity.

AB  - Deep-sea reef ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity but are particularly threatened by seawater warming, because the species that live there have evolved within a narrow thermal range. The degree to which cold-water corals (CWCs), the reef builders, can acclimate to changes in their thermal environment requires more investigation. Our study is one of the very first to assess the thermal performance of Dendrophylliidae CWCs on a 2-year basis. Colonies of Dendrophyllia cornigera and D. ramea, collected in the Mediterranean Sea, were exposed during 2 years to their natural mean temperatures (referred as control temperature, CT) or to temperatures being 4 degrees C (T+4) and 8 degrees C (T+8) higher. A 4 degrees C decrease in temperature (T-4) was also tested for D. ramea. Several physiological parameters, such as rates of growth, calcification, and respiration, as well as total organic carbon release were measured after 2 and 20 months of treatment. The results obtained show that Dendrophylliidae corals are able to survive a +4 degrees C over a two-year period, and even a +8 degrees C for D. ramea. The elevation in temperature induced a transient increase in all physiological parameters. However, after 20 months, parameters were significantly decreased compared to the first measurement. At the end of the experiment, growth rates were even significantly lower at T+4 and T+8 compared to the control temperature, suggesting that the coral lifespan is significantly reduced over the long term. Finally, we observed a positive relationship between respiration and calcification rates in these corals, suggesting that the calcification process is dependent on the inorganic carbon provided by respiration. Overall, this study shows that physiological processes in CWC species are slow and that long-term incubations are necessary to predict the impact of climate change on their survival capacities.

AB  - Preferential temperature as a physiological feature is crucial for spiders, since it determines the selection of key habitats for their survival and reproduction. In this work, we study the daily and geographical variation of the preferential temperature of the spider Sicarius thomisoides subjected to different degrees of daily thermal oscillation in their habitats. Preferred temperatures differ between coastal and inland populations, but in both cases, there is a marked bimodality in the daily pattern of temperature preference, with two peaks per day that would be given by the changes in the hours of activity. These nocturnal spiders select higher temperatures in the evening (active period) and select lower temperatures during late morning (resting period). In laboratory, spiders have preferred temperatures that differ from those found in their habitats, so they must tolerate or compensate non-preferred temperatures by active thermoregulation in natural conditions.

AB  - Paleo-temperature data indicates that the Earth's mantle has not cooled at a constant rate. The data show slow cooling from 3.8 to 2.5 Ga followed by more rapid cooling until the present. This has been argued to indicate a transition from a single plate mode to a plate tectonics. However, a tectonic change may not be necessary. Multistage cooling can result from deep water cycling coupled to mantle convection. Melting and volcanism removes water from the mantle (degassing). Dehydration tends to stiffen the mantle, which slows convective vigor and plate velocities causing mantle heating. Higher mantle temperature tends to lower mantle viscosity and increase plate velocities. If these two tendencies are in balance, then mantle cooling can be weak. Breaking this balance, via a switch to net mantle rehydration, can cool the mantle more rapidly. We use coupled water cycling and mantle convection models to test the viability of this hypothesis. Within model and data uncertainty, the hypothesis that deep water cycling can lead to a multi-stage Earth cooling is consistent with data constraints. Probability distributions, for successful models, indicate that plate and plate margin strength play a minor role for resisting plate motions relative to the resistance from interior mantle viscosity.

AB  - Buildings are responsible for approximately 36% of carbon emissions in the European Union. Besides, gradual aging and a lack of adaptability and flexibility of buildings often lead to destructive interventions, resulting not only in higher costs but also in a large amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). Recently, an innovative system (Ref. VEEP project) has been developed to recycle CDW for the manufacturing of energy-efficient prefabricated concrete elements (PCE) for new building construction. By applying life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA), this study aimed to determine whether the use of VEEP PCE leads to lower carbon emission and lower associated costs over the life cycle of an exemplary four-story residential building in the Netherlands than a business-as-usual (BAU) PCE scenario. This paper provides a case study on the alignment and/or integration of LCA and LCC in an independent and a combined manner (via monetization). This study examines how the internalization of carbon emission and discount rate will affect the final life cycle costs over a 40-year life span. The simulation results show that the key to economic viability and environmental soundness of VEEP PCE is to reduce production cost and to optimize the thermal performance of the novel isolation material Aerogel; internalization of external cost monetarizes the environmental advantage thus slightly expands the cost advantage of low carbon options, but leads to larger uncertainty about the LCC result.

AB  - As the contribution of renewable energy grows in electricity markets, the complexity of the energy mix required to meet demand grows, likewise the need for robust simulation techniques. While decades of wind, solar, and demand profiles can sometimes be obtained, this is too few samples to provide a statistically meaningful analysis of a system with baseload, peaker, and renewable generation. To demonstrate the viability of an energy mix, many thousands of samples are needed. Synthetic time series generation presents itself as a suitable methodology to meet this need. For a synthetic time series to be statistically viable, several conditions must be met. The series generator must produce independent, identically distributed samples, each having the same fundamental properties as the original signal without duplicating it exactly. One approach for such a generator is training a surrogate model using Fourier series decomposition for seasonal patterns and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models to describe time-correlated statistical noise about the seasonal patterns. When combined, the Fourier plus ARMA (FARMA) model has been shown to provide an infinite set of independent, identically distributed sample time series with the same statistical properties as the original data [1]. When considering an energy mix with renewable electricity production, several time series of energy, grid, and weather measurements are needed for each synthetic year modeled to statistically comprehend the efficiency of any given energy mix. This includes measurements of solar exposure, air temperature, wind velocity, and electricity demand. These cannot be considered independent series in a given synthetic year; for example, in summer months demand may be higher when solar exposure and air temperature are high and wind velocity is low. To capture and reproduce the correlations that might exist in the measured histories, the ARMA can further be extended as a Vector ARMA (VARMA). In the VARMA algorithm, covariance in statistical noise is captured both within a history as part of the autoregressive moving average and with respect to the other variables in the time series. In this work, the implementation of the Fourier VARMA in the RAVEN uncertainty quantification and risk analysis software framework [2] is presented, along with examples of correlated synthetic history generation. Finally, methods to extend synthetic signals to multiyear samples are presented and discussed.

AB  - Although photovoltaic (PV) technology has been projected as one of the most promising candidates to replace conventional fossil based power generation, claims about the potential disadvantages of the PV panels end-of-life (EoL) deserve careful attention in order to fully establish a feasibility and viability baseline and support technological and implementation policies. The current challenge concerning PV technology resides in making them efficient and competitive in comparison with traditional power generation systems, without disregarding the appraisal of EoL impacts. The emergy analysis method proved to be a reliable approach for the evaluation of the efficiency, effectiveness and environmental friendliness of technological processes under a global scale perspective and may likely be applied to the EoL PV investigation as a complement of conventional energy and economic assessments. Therefore, this method was used in this study to evaluate the sustainability of a PV panel recycling process. In addition, this paper aims to explore the implications of methodological assumptions when Emergy Accounting (EMA) tackles waste management systems, in order to address the shortcomings in this field.
   Results show that the PV panel treatment can generate large environmental benefits not only at the local scale of the process, but also at the larger scale of the industrial manufacture and material recovery, as well as at the even larger scale of the biosphere where resources come from and pollution is released. The comparison between the emergy invested for electricity production via PV and fossil energy sources also including EoL resource and environmental costs, highlights that PV technology is competitive under both energy and environmental points of view. This comparison reveals that the solar technologies imply remarkable emergy savings (1.45E+12 sej/kWh for fossil sources versus 3.57E+11 sej/kWh for crystalline silicon photovoltaic down to 2.31E+11 sej/kWh for cadmium telluride photovoltaic). Results clearly show that PV solar power can be considered a mature technology and can favorably compete with other renewable and non-renewable options for electricity generation. However, efficiency improvements of PV panels thermal recovery are still possible and may lead to further decrease of still too large emergy costs of the treatment process, not to talk of potential recovery alternatives such as chemical treatment for silicon cells and better upstream industrial design.

AB  - Coral reefs within 10 degrees of the equator generally experience <= 3 degrees C seasonal variation in water temperature. Ectotherms that have evolved in these conditions are therefore expected to exhibit narrow thermal optima and be very sensitive to the greater thermal variability (>6 degrees C) experienced at higher latitudes (>= 10 degrees N/S). The impact of increased thermal variability on the fitness and distribution of thermally sensitive reef ectotherms is currently unknown. Here, we examine site-attached planktivorous coral reef damselfishes that rely on their physiological capacity to swim and forage in the water column year round. We focus on 10 species spanning four evolutionarily distinct genera from a region of the Great Barrier Reef that experiences >= 6 degrees C difference between seasons. Four ecologically important indicators showed reduced performance during the winter low (23 degrees C) compared with the summer peak (29 degrees C), with effect sizes varying among species and genera, as follows: (i) the energy available for activity (aerobic scope) was reduced by 35-45% in five species and three genera; (ii) the energetically most efficient swimming speed was reduced by 17% across all species; and (iii) the maximal critical swimming speed and (iv) the gait transition speed (the swimming mode predominantly used for foraging) were reduced by 16-42% in six species spanning all four genera. Comparisons with field surveys within and across latitudes showed that species-specific distributions were strongly correlated with these performance indicators. Species occupy habitats where they can swim faster than prevailing habitat currents year round, and >95% of individuals were observed only in habitats where the gait transition speed can be maintained at or above habitat currents. Thermal fluctuation at higher latitudes appears to reduce performance as well as the possible distribution of species and genera within and among coral reef habitats. Ultimately, thermal variability across latitudes may progressively cause sublethal changes to species performance and lead to a contraction of biogeographical range.

AB  - Extreme cold marine and freshwater temperatures (below 4 degrees C) induce massive deterioration to the cell membranes of organisms resulting in the formation of ice crystals, consequently causing organelle damage or cell death. One of the adaptive mechanisms organisms have evolved to thrive in cold environments is the production of antifreeze proteins with the functional capabilities to withstand frigid temperatures. Antifreeze proteins are extensively identified in different cold-tolerant species and they facilitate the persistence of cold-adapted organisms by decreasing the freezing point of their body fluids. Various structurally diverse types of antifreeze proteins detected possess the ability to modify ice crystal growth by thermal hysteresis and ice recrystallization inhibition. The unique properties of antifreeze proteins have made them a promising resource in industry, biomedicine, food storage and cryobiology. This review collates the findings of the various studies carried out in the past and the recent developments observed in the properties, functional mechanisms, classification, distinct sources and the ever-increasing applications of antifreeze proteins. This review also summarizes the possibilities of the way forward to identify new avenues of research on anti-freeze proteins.

AB  - Variation in temperature can affect the expression of a variety of important fitness-related behaviours, including those involved with mate attraction and selection, with consequences for the coordination of mating across variable environments. We examined how temperature influences the expression of male mating signals and female mate preferences-as well as the relationship between how male signals and female mate preferences change across temperatures (signal-preference temperature coupling)-in Enchenopa binotata treehoppers. These small plant-feeding insects communicate using plantborne vibrations, and our field surveys indicate they experience significant natural variation in temperature during the mating season. We tested for signal-preference temperature coupling in four populations of E. binotata by manipulating temperature in a controlled laboratory environment. We measured the frequency of male signals-the trait for which females show strongest preference-and female peak preference-the signal frequency most preferred by females-across a range of biologically relevant temperatures (18 degrees C-36 degrees C). We found a strong effect of temperature on both male signals and female preferences, which generated signal-preference temperature coupling within each population. Even in a population in which male signals mismatched female preferences, the temperature coupling reinforces predicted directional selection across all temperatures. Additionally, we found similar thermal sensitivity in signals and preferences across populations even though populations varied in the mean frequency of male signals and female peak preference. Together, these results suggest that temperature variation should not affect the action of sexual selection via female choice, but rather should reinforce stabilizing selection in populations with signal-preference matches, and directional selection in those with signal-preference mismatches. Finally, we do not predict that thermal variation will disrupt the coordination of mating in this species by generating signal-preference mismatches at thermal extremes.

AB  - Large-eddy simulations (LES) of the Sydney bluff-body swirl-stabilized methane-hydrogen flame are performed, employing two chemistry representation methods, namely a conventional structured tabulation technique and artificial neural networks (ANNs). A generalized method for the generation of optimal artificial networks (OANNs) has been proposed by Ihme et al. [M. Ihme, A.L. Marsden, H. Pitsch, Neural Comput. 20 (2) (2008) 573-601]. This method is, for the first time, applied in LES of turbulent reactive flows, guaranteeing an optimal chemistry representation with error control, which was previously not possible. The network performance with respect to accuracy, data retrieval time, and storage requirements is compared with the structured tabulation of increasing resolution, and effects or long-time error accumulation on the statistical results during a numerical simulation are discussed. Using the optimization algorithm, it is demonstrated that ANN accuracies can be achieved which are comparable with structured tables of moderate to fine resolution. Furthermore, it is shown that for a comparable number of synaptic weights, the network fitness increases with increasing number of hidden layers. Compared to the tabulation technique, data retrieval from the network is computationally more expensive; however, the additional overhead associated with the ANN evaluation remains acceptable in LES applications. Results for flow field statistics and scalar quantities which are obtained from LES are in good agreement with experimental data, and possible reasons for the differences between computed and measured temperature profiles near the bluff-body are discussed. The difference in the velocity statistics between simulations employing structured table and network representation are small, and deviations in the CO, profiles on the fuel-rich side of the flame are mainly attributed to the sensitivity of CO2 with respect to changes in progress variable.

AB  - Cells constantly produce oxidizing species because of their metabolic activity, which is counteracted by the continuous production of antioxidant species to maintain the homeostasis of the redox balance. A deviation from the metabolic steady state leads to a condition of oxidative stress. The source of oxidative species can be endogenous or exogenous. A major exogenous source of these species is tobacco smoking. Oxidative damage can be induced in cells by chemical species contained in smoke through the generation of pro-inflammatory compounds and the modulation of intracellular pro-inflammatory pathways, resulting in a pathological condition. Cessation of smoking reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with cigarette use. Next-generation products (NGPs), as alternatives to combustible cigarettes, such as electronic cigarettes (e-cig) and tobacco heating products (THPs), have been proposed as a harm reduction strategy to reduce the deleterious impacts of cigarette smoking. In this review, we examine the impact of tobacco smoke and MRPs on oxidative stress in different pathologies, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and tumors. The impact of tobacco cigarette smoke on oxidative stress signaling in human health is well established, whereas the safety profile of MRPs seems to be higher than tobacco cigarettes, but further, well-conceived, studies are needed to better understand the oxidative effects of these products with long-term exposure.

AB  - Objectives: Injury prevention exercise programmes for amateur soccer have gained considerable attention, but little is known about their relevance and adaptability to professional soccer settings. The first aim of this study was to evaluate the delivery and content of injury prevention exercise programmes used by professional youth soccer teams, compared to the industry standard injury prevention exercise programme for soccer, the Federation Internationale de Football Association's FIFA 11+. The second aim was to document specific challenges to implementing injury prevention exercise programmes in this context.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Methods: The participants were soccer coaches, fitness coaches and physiotherapists (n=18) from four teams in a professional youth soccer academy. Each team's chosen injury prevention exercise programmes were observed weekly across an entire soccer season (160 sessions). The delivery and content of the programmes were documented on a standardised worksheet and compared to the FIFA 11+. Specific implementation challenges were recorded.
   Results: Fitness coaches were the primary deliverers of injury prevention exercise programmes, with support from physiotherapists. Multiple delivery formats and locations were employed, along with the extensive use of equipment. Across all injury prevention exercise programme sessions, a median of one FIFA 11+ exercise was performed in its original form and a further four in a modified form. Implementation challenges included poor staff communication, competing training priorities and heavy game schedules.
   Conclusions: Although the basic components of the FIFA 11+ hold relevance for professional youth male teams, the delivery and content of injury prevention exercise programmes require considerable tailoring for this context. Recognising this will inform the development of improved, context-specific injury prevention exercise programmes, along with corresponding strategies to enhance their implementation.

AB  - In honeybees there are three alleles of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase gene: F, M and S. Allele frequencies are correlated with environmental temperature, suggesting that the alleles have temperature-dependent fitness benefits. We determined the enzyme activity of each allele across a range of temperatures in vitro. The F and S alleles have higher activity and are less sensitive to high temperatures than the M allele, which loses activity after incubation at temperatures found in the thorax of foraging bees in hot climates. Next, we predicted the protein structure of each allele and used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their molecular flexibility. The M allozyme is more flexible than the S and F allozymes at 50 degrees C, suggesting a plausible explanation for its loss of activity at high temperatures, and has the greatest structural flexibility at 15 degrees C, suggesting that it can retain some enzyme activity at cooler temperatures. MM bees recovered from 2 h of cold narcosis significantly better than all other genotypes. Combined, these results explain clinal variation in malate dehydrogenase allele frequencies in the honeybee at the molecular level.

AB  - In small sedentary ectotherms, patterns of spatial use result from the interplay between multiple, often conflicting factors, including abiotic and biotic interactions. Evaluating the costs and benefits of these pressures is crucial to make correct behavioural decisions in terms of fitness. The insular Sao Vicente's wall gecko Tarentola substituta provides a relatively simple model system to study these questions as it inhabits arid rocky habitats where refuges are limited, density of conspecifics is high, and terrestrial predators are almost absent. In the field, adults tend to find diurnal shelter under mid-sized rocks, frequently in male-female couples, while juveniles occupy small rocks which are thermally suboptimal. A lab experiment was conducted to determine the roles of ecological (shelter size and temperature) and social (conspecifics) factors in refuge selection. Single and pair combinations of geckos of different age and sex classes were allowed to select among four refuges: cold small, hot small, cold large, or hot large rock. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that larger and thermally buffered rocks would be the preferred refuges, and that adult male-female pairs under the same rock would be more frequent than other combinations.Geckos primarily selected larger shelters, trading off the presence of conspecifics against thermal quality. In social terms, sex, adult condition and size-related disparity shaped the patterns of aggregation, resulting in lower aggregation frequencies between adults and juveniles and even between juveniles of different sizes. These results reasonably match field observations suggesting selection of rocks as diurnal retreats according to their thermal properties, and social aggregations mainly involving adult males and females but not juveniles. Overall, this combined evidence provides insights on the spatial ecology of geckos, and likely other ectotherms, under conditions of low predation, limited resources and high intraspecific competition, such as those prevailing on island systems.

CP  - ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition
AB  - Considering the fact that Kuwait receives annual global irradiation of about 2088 kWh/m(2), the potential for utilizing solar energy for electric power generation cannot be overlooked. Micro-grid connected PV plants are one important option for the energy mix that can be pursued to meet part of the future demand for energy. To assess the viability of such option, we investigated the technical and the economic feasibility of installing PV solar panels on local gas stations' rooftops. Gas stations were targeted because of their unobstructed flat rooftops and being mostly far away from high-rise buildings and other shade-causing objects. The daily and monthly energy consumption data of one typical gas station were used in this study. PVsyst software was used to determine the optimal technical parameters of the system. The available rooftop area of the gas station, fitted with the selected PV models and the inverters resulted in an installed capacity of 77.3 kWp. The system was able to generate 121.3 MWh/year which covers about 72 % of the annual energy consumption of the gas station. Factors affecting the system output such as near shading, soiling, and temperature effects were considered. The economic analysis of the system estimated the cost of kWh to be around $0.088. The overall cost of the system incurred during its lifetime (25 years), including inverters replacement cost, maintenance cost, and financial cost, was about $269,200.

AB  - In ectotherms, variation in body temperature (T-b) affects physiological performance and, ultimately, fitness. Therefore, reptiles regulate T-b behaviourally by choosing habitats of optimal temperature. The main goal of this study was to determine the link between patterns of thermoregulation and habitat selection in Common Musk Turtles inhabiting a thermally challenging region. We expected habitat selection to be based on the fulfillment of thermoregulatory requirements, which can be accomplished by selecting thermally superior habitats. From early May to late August 2007, we tracked 22 Common Musk Turtles with temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters and collected daily Tb profiles with automated radio-telemetry data loggers. In addition, temperature data loggers were placed in the study area to measure the range of environmental operative temperatures (T-e) available to musk turtles. The habitats with the highest thermal quality were aquatic habitats with surface cover (i.e., lily pads, macrophytes, etc.) followed by shallow water. As expected, musk turtles used habitats non-randomly and had a strong preference for thermally superior habitats. This is consistent with the typical aquatic basking behaviour observed in musk turtles, suggesting that there is a strong link between thermal quality of habitats and habitat selection, even in this almost entirely aquatic turtle.

AB  - Introduction. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is one of the world's most devastating pests. Although originally from the Americas, this insect has become a global food security threat. The reason is that its polyphagia and adaptability combine with the effects of climate change. In Costa Rica, the species of the Spodoptera order, are considered minor pests in sugarcane production. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap in population dynamics of the moths of this genus. Objective. Monitor the populations of S. frugiperda, S. sunia, and S. exigua species in a sugarcane field. Materials and methods. The study was conducted in a sugarcane plantation of the variety CC 01-1940, located in Guanacaste, Costa Rica between February 2018 and May 2019. Sexual pheromone-baited traps formulated for S. frugiperda, S. sunia, and S. exigua were used, each pheromone corresponded to a treatment and ten replicates of each one were established. The abundance of each species was compared and correlated with several climatological variables. Results. The highest percentage of catches corresponded to S. frugiperda, followed by S. sunia, while the captures of S. exigua were marginal. For both S. frugiperda and S. sunia, the dry season months favored larger populations, so factors such as higher average temperature, thermal amplitude, and lower relative humidity were associated with higher captures in the traps. Conclusions. Increases in the average temperature and decrease in rainfall periods could increase the incidence of Spodoptera genus as pests in sugarcane production.

AB  - We investigated the effects of family selection on the growth rates of four genetic lines of Litopenaeus vannamei, the Pacific white shrimp, from Venezuela. The mean family weight at selection was 16.79 g and the mean growth rate was 0.169 g d(-1) at a mean age of 138 days. The mean growth rates per generation were 0.141 g d(-1) for the parental generation (P-0), 0.173 g d-1 for the F-1 and 0.191 g d(-1) for the F-2. Survival varied from 83.3% to 94.4%. There were statistically significant differences between lines, with lines B and C, growing at higher temperatures and lower salinities, showing the fastest growth. Regression analysis between growth rate and age for each genetic line showed high r(2) values, but smaller than those shown between growth rate and generation. The mean heritability (h(2)) estimated for growth rate was 0.25 +/- 0.04, with line per generation values ranging from 0.18 to 0.38. The mean heritability for growth rate per line showed some variation but there was no correlation between heritability and growth rate. Females showed a greater gain in growth rate per generation than males due to their faster growth when they were older. This study shows the high potential of these L. vannamei populations for the future of shrimp culture in the Americas.

AB  - The cryopreservation of noctuid eggs in liquid nitrogen has proved be a promising tool in the mass production of Trichogramma, however studies into this technique have only just begun. This study evaluated the response of different densities of the female of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley to the parasitism of Mythimna sequax eggs stored and not stored in liquid nitrogen, and the performance of females reared only in cryopreserved eggs. The study evaluated the influence of the number of T. pretiosum females (4, 8 and 12) released to parasitise 40 M. sequax eggs, stored and not stored for 15 days in liquid nitrogen, as well as the performance of T. pretiosum females reared in eggs stored for three generations and females reared in non-stored eggs. Parasitism by T. pretiosum in stored eggs was 84%, twice the value obtained in previous studies. The emergence of parasitoids was greater than 95% in both experiments. The performance of females raised in stored eggs did not differ from that of females raised in non-stored eggs. The data show that the technique of cryopreservation of M. sequax eggs may be a viable alternative in the mass production of T. pretiosum.

AB  - The phenology of oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busek), on apple (Malus spp.) in North Carolina was studied using pheromone traps and egg sampling in abandoned and commercial orchards in 2000 and 2001, with subsequent development of an oviposition degree-day model and management studies in relation to codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), phenology. Oriental fruit moth eggs were found in greater numbers on leaves early and on fruit later in the growing season, on the top versus the bottom of the leaf surface, and on the calyx area versus the side or stem end of the fruit. A degree-day (DD) model to predict oriental fruit moth oviposition was developed based on temperature accumulations from peak moth trap capture of the first (overwintering) generation, by using 7.2 and 32.2degreesC as the temperature limits. The model predicted four ovipositing generations 4 oriental fruit moth with the second beginning 507 DD after peak moth catch. Using predictions of the oriental fruit moth and codling moth degree-day oviposition models, an experiment was conducted to determine the level of second generation oriental fruit moth control with methoxyfenozide applied under different scenarios for first generation codling moth. Methoxyfenozide was equally effective in managing codling moth and oriental fruit moth for all treatment timings.

AB  - Heat stress elicits the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in honey bee subspecies. These highly conserved proteins have significant role in protecting cells from thermal-induced stresses. Honey bees in subtropical regions face extremely dry and hot environment. The expression of HSPs in the nurses and foragers of indigenous (Apis mellifera jemenitica) and imported European (Apis mellifera ligustica and Apis mellifera carnica) honey bee subspecies after heat shock treatment were compared using SDS-PAGE. Hsp70 and Hsp82 were equally expressed in the nurses of all tested bee subspecies when exposed to 40 degrees C and 45 degrees C for 4 h. The forager bees exhibited differential expression of HSPs after heat stress. No HSPs was expressed in the foragers of A. m. jemenitica, and Hsp70 was expressed only in the foragers of A. m. ligustica and A. m. carnica at 40 degrees C. A prominent diversity in HSPs expression was also exhibited in the foragers at 45 degrees C with one HSP (Hsp70) in A. m. jemenitica, two HSPs (Hsp40 and Hsp70) in A. m. carnica, and three HSPs (Hsp40, Hsp60 and Hsp70) in A. m. ligustica. No HSPs was expressed in the control nurse and forager bees at any of the tested temperatures. These findings illustrated the differences in HSP expression among nurse and forager bees. It is obvious that the native foragers are more heat tolerant with least HSPs expression than exotic bee races. Further investigations will help to understand the potential role of HSPs in the adaptability, survival, and performance of bee subspecies in harsh climate of the subtropical regions.

AB  - The intensity and timing of infestation events of caligid copepods in wild or cultured fish populations may be predicted from previous local production of nauplius I of the parasite. However, this relationship is not well established, the spatial scales over which it operates are unclear, and the role of host reactions to the invading copepodid is unknown. Rate of development (and population structure), generation time and rate and actual reproductive output are temperature-dependent. In Ireland between five and seven generations of Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer) can develop annually and generation time varies from over 120 days in winter to 23 days in summer. Host reactions may affect the rate of development of the parasite but are less important than temperature. Host reactions may also cause parasite mortality, but this effect is specific for individual host parasite associations. The distribution of L. salmonis in cultured host populations is typically normal but is very over-dispersed in wild populations with heavy infestations. Parasite-induced morphological damage to the host is correlated with physiological impacts. Physiological effects are present even when morphological damage is slight and so intermittent chemotherapeutic control of infestations cannot prevent some parasite impact from occurring.

AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon whereby temperature levels in urban areas are higher than in surrounding rural settings. Urban heat islands are a matter of increasing concern, since they can affect communities by exacerbating air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions (due to the greater use of air conditioning) and the occurrence of heat-related illness, and may lead to higher levels of mortality. This paper provides a description of the phenomena of (UHI) and an analysis of how cities are vulnerable to it. It highlights the need for resilience and the variety of means by which the UHI can be tackled. It describes a set of trends in two regions in Germany and Australia, which illustrate the scope of the problem in the northern and southern hemispheres, and the scale of vulnerability. Then, existing UHI vulnerability assessments are analysed to highlight common features and differences. Based on this, we propose a classification of adaptability parameters to support vulnerability assessments. The paper also discusses current mitigation approaches mentioned in the literature, and how these address some vulnerabilities. It concludes that both a better understanding of the UHI phenomena and consideration of the particular context of each city is needed to make urban areas more resilient to UHI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bumblebees are generally believed to be annual insects. However, here we will show that under laboratory conditions the bumblebee Bombus terrestris (L.) can produce a second generation without a period of cold storage (diapause) or CO2 narcosis (a method to break diapause). It is also shown that this so-called non-diapause trait can be selected for. The percentage of non-diapausing queens increased from 8% (minimum) to 97% (maximum) in two generations of selection. However, it was not possible to maintain isofemale non-diapause lines. Colonies of the fourth and fifth generation remained small (expressed in worker number) and produced a small number of queens. Also the percentage of queens that started laying eggs (defined as the percentage non-diapause) decreased in the fourth and fifth generations. To study whether this decline of the non-diapause lines was caused by inbreeding, a control experiment was conducted. In this control experiment queens were mated with their brothers (full-sib mating) for several generations and the number of queens that start egg laying was measured. This revealed that inbreeding can have a negative effect on the egg-laying capacities of queens thus causing the decline of inbred (non-diapause) lines.

AB  - Cold shock adaptability is a key survival skill of gut bacteria of warm-blooded animals. Escherichia coli cold shock responses are controlled by a complex multi-gene, timely-ordered transcriptional program. We investigated its underlying mechanisms. Having identified short-term, cold shock repressed genes, we show that their responsiveness is unrelated to their transcription factors or global regulators, while their single-cell protein numbers' variability increases after cold shock. We hypothesized that some cold shock repressed genes could be triggered by high propensity for transcription locking due to changes in DNA supercoiling (likely due to DNA relaxation caused by an overall reduction in negative supercoiling). Concomitantly, we found that nearly half of cold shock repressed genes are also highly responsive to gyrase inhibition (albeit most genes responsive to gyrase inhibition are not cold shock responsive). Further, their response strengths to cold shock and gyrase inhibition correlate. Meanwhile, under cold shock, nucleoid density increases, and gyrases and nucleoid become more colocalized. Moreover, the cellular energy decreases, which may hinder positive supercoils resolution. Overall, we conclude that sensitivity to diminished negative supercoiling is a core feature of E. coli's short-term, cold shock transcriptional program, and could be used to regulate the temperature sensitivity of synthetic circuits.

AB  - Building envelopes can manage light, heat gains or losses, and ventilation and, as such, play a key role in the overall building performance. Research has been focusing on increasing their efficiency by proposing dynamic and adaptive systems, meaning that they evolve to best meet the internal and external varying conditions. Living organisms are relevant examples of adaptability as they have evolved, facing extreme conditions while maintaining stable internal conditions for survival. From a framework based on the inspiration of living envelopes such as animal constructions or biological skins, the concept of an adaptive envelope inspired by the Morpho butterfly was proposed. The system can manage heat, air, and light transfers going through the building and includes adaptive elements with absorption coefficients varying with temperature. This paper presents the developed framework that led to the final concept as well as the concept implementation and assessment. A prototype for heat and light management was built and integrated into a test bench. Measurements were performed to provide a first assessment of the system. In parallel, geometrical parametric models were created to compare multiple configurations in regards to indicators such as air, light, or heat transfers. One of the models provided light projections on the system that were compared with measurements and validated as suitable inputs in grey-box models for the system characterization.

AB  - An Italian effort has been initiated under a cooperation between ENEA and CIRTEN for the investigation of a concept for a small size Generation IV Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) demonstration project (DEMO) which could provide significant support to the European Lead-cooled System (ELSY), by validating lead technology and the overall system behaviour.
   A demonstration reactor is expected to prove the viability of technology for use in a future commercial power plant, construction and operation, with the purpose of assessing the general strategy to use, to the largest extent. Thus, the first step towards the DEMO conceptual design has been the specification of the issues of ELSY - assumed as reference LFR - to investigate/validate, the objectives to reach, tools and methodology.
   As a result, a set of general requirements that must be met have been first identified and further scope analyses have been carried out in order to determine suitable core configurations.
   Finally, static neutronics analyses have been performed using the ERANOS2.1 deterministic code in conjunction with the JEFF3.1 nuclear data library to accomplish a preliminary core characterization; the mutual compatibility of both objectives and technological constraints has been confirmed a posteriori by thermal-hydraulic estimations.
   Results have shown that a 250 MWth lead-cooled MOX-fueled DEMO may be a viable concept: in the case of 480 degrees C reference coolant outlet temperature, 2 m s(-1) average coolant velocity and 42 cm active core extension, high neutron flux values (around 2.5 times the ELSY ones) have been obtained (peak flux: 6.3 x 10(15) cm(-2) s(-1) with corresponding fast fraction of approximately 15.8%, i.e., some 1 x 10(15) cm(-2) s(-1)) thanks to the significant power densities reached.

AB  - A selection experiment in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was initiated to verify if the proportion of females after temperature treatment could be significantly altered by selection. Rainbow trout spawners out of six populations were used to produce a diallel cross in which all populations were used as male as well as female parents. The 95 families of this breeding base were tested for their temperature sensitivity as follows. After an incubation period of 42 days, alevins of each family were subdivided into a treatment group and a full sib control group (12 degrees C), each consisting of 300 fish. Temperature treatments were carried out with 18 degrees C for 30 days. Each treatment and corresponding control group was raised separately until an age of 9 months post fertilization. Then a random sample of 10 fingerlings out of each control group was kept for later selection decisions. All other fish from the treatment and control groups were sexed by microscopic inspection of gonad squashes. The families were ranked according to the percentage of females, and families with the highest (n = 6) and lowest percentage of females (n = 6) in their sex ratios after temperature treatment were selected to produce two divergent lines (high and low line). After one generation of selection the temperature-treated groups in the high line showed a female percentage of 58%. whereas the low line had an average female proportion of 44%. The realized heritability was 0.63 in the high and 0.71 in the low line. This study provides the first evidence that the sex ratios in temperature-treated groups of rainbow trout can be selected as a quantitative trait. Additionally, in the meiotic gynogenetic offspring derived from a female spawner, which showed low percentages of females after temperature treatment in previous matings, 16% males were observed in the temperature-treated group. Thus, there seem to be two possible consumer- and environment-friendly ways to increase significantly the proportion of females in rainbow trout: directly via selection of families which show a high percentage of females in their sex ratios after temperature treatment to build up a corresponding temperature sensitive line or indirectly via neo-males derived from temperature treatments of gynogenetic offspring.

AB  - Invertebrates lack the cellular and physiological machinery of the adaptive immune system, but show specificity in their immune response and immune priming. Functionally, immune priming is comparable to immune memory in vertebrates. Individuals that have survived exposure to a given parasite are better protected against subsequent exposures. Protection may be cross-reactive, but demonstrations of persistent and specific protection in invertebrates are increasing. This immune priming can cross generations ("trans-generational" immune priming), preparing offspring for the prevailing parasite environment. While these phenomena gain increasing support, the mechanistic foundations underlying such immune priming, both within and across generations, remain largely unknown. Using a transcriptomic approach, we show that exposing bumblebee queens with an injection of heat-killed bacteria, known to induce trans-generational immune priming, alters daughter (worker) gene expression. Daughters, even when unexposed themselves, constitutively express a core set of the genes induced upon direct bacterial exposure, including high expression of antimicrobial peptides, a beta-glucan receptor protein implicated in bacterial recognition and the induction of the toll signaling pathway, and slit-3 which is important in honeybee immunity. Maternal exposure results in a distinct upregulation of their daughters' immune system, with a signature overlapping with the induced individual response to a direct exposure. This will mediate mother-offspring protection, but also associated costs related to reconfiguration of constitutive immune expression. Moreover, identification of conserved immune pathways in memory-like responses has important implications for our understanding of the innate immune system, including the innate components in vertebrates, which share many of these pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mortality impacts of hot and cold temperatures have been thoroughly documented, with most locations reporting a U-shaped relationship with a minimum mortality temperature (MMT) at which mortality is lowest. How MMT may have evolved over previous decades as the global mean surface temperature has increased has not been thoroughly explored.
   OBJECTIVE: We used observations of daily mean temperatures to investigate whether MMT changed in Stockholm, Sweden, from the beginning of the 20th century until 2009.
   METHODS: Daily mortality and temperature data for the period 1901-2009 in Stockholm, Sweden, were used to model the temperature-mortality relationship. We estimated MMT using distributed lag nonlinear Poisson regression models considering lags up to 21 days of daily mean temperature as the exposure variable. To avoid large influences on the MMT from intra-and interannual climatic variability, we estimated MMT based on 30-year periods. Furthermore, we investigated whether there were trends in the absolute value of the MMT and in the relative value of the MMT (the corresponding percentile of the same-day temperature distribution) over the study period.
   RESULTS: Our findings suggest that both the absolute MMT and the relative MMT increased in Stockholm, Sweden, over the course of the 20th century.
   CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the MMT over the course of the 20th century suggests autonomous adaptation within the context of the large epidemiological, demographical, and societal changes that occurred. Whether the rate of increase will be sustained with climate change is an open question.

Future warming may have large global impacts including ocean oxygen depletion and associated adverse effects on marine life, such as more frequent mortality events(4-8), but long, comprehensive simulations of these impacts are currently not available. Here we project global change over the next 100,000 years using a low-resolution Earth system model(9), and find severe, long-term ocean oxygen depletion, as well as a great expansion of ocean oxygen-minimum zones for scenarios with high emissions or high climate sensitivity. We find that climate feedbacks within the Earth system amplify the strength and duration of global warming, ocean heating and oxygen depletion. Decreased oxygen solubility from surface-layer warming accounts for most of the enhanced oxygen depletion in the upper 500 m of the ocean. Possible weakening of ocean overturning and convection lead to further oxygen depletion, also in the deep ocean. We conclude that substantial reductions in fossil-fuel use over the next few generations are needed if extensive ocean oxygen depletion for thousands of years is to be avoided.

AB  - Low temperature is a critical factor restricting the growth and survival of aquatic animals, but research on the mechanism of response to low temperature in Cherax destructor is limited. C. destructor is one of the most important freshwater crustaceans with strong adaptability in Australia, and it has been commercialized gradually in recent years. Here, growth indicators, antioxidant parameters, anti-stress gene expression, and transcriptome sequencing were used on crayfish following 8 weeks of low-temperature acclimation. The results showed that weight gain, length gain, and molting rates decreased as the temperature decreased. The activity of antioxidant enzymes decreased, while the content of antioxidant substances and the expression of anti-stress genes increased. Transcriptome sequencing identified 589 differentially expressed genes, 279 of which were upregulated and 310 downregulated. The gene functions and pathways for endocrine disorders, glucose metabolism, antioxidant defense, and immune responses were identified. In conclusion, although low-temperature acclimation inhibited the basal metabolism and immune ability of crayfish, it also increased the antioxidant substance content and anti-stress-gene expression to protect the organism from low-temperature damage. This study provided molecular insights into the study of low-temperature responses of low-temperature-tolerant crustacean species.

AB  - Research and development for superconducting radio-frequency cavities has made enormous progress over the last decades from the understanding of theoretical limitations to the industrial mass fabrication of cavities for large-scale particle accelerators. Key technologies remain hot topics due to continuously growing demands on cavity performance, particularly when in pursuit of high quality beams at higher beam currents or higher luminosities than currently achievable. This relates to higher order mode (HOM) damping requirements. Meeting the desired beam properties implies avoiding coupled multi-bunch or beam break-up instabilities depending on the machine and beam parameters that will set the acceptable cavity impedance thresholds. The use of cavity HOM-dampers is crucial to absorb the wakefields, comprised by all beam-induced cavity Eigenmodes, to beam-dynamically safe levels and to reduce the heat load at cryogenic temperature. Cavity damping concepts may vary, but are principally based on coaxial and waveguide couplers as well as beam line absorbers or any combination. Next generation energy recovery linacs and circular colliders call for cavities with strong HOM-damping that can exceed the state-of-the-art, while the operating mode efficiency shall not be significantly compromised concurrently. This imposes major challenges given the rather limited damping concepts. A detailed survey of established cavities is provided scrutinizing the achieved damping performance, shortcomings, and potential improvements. The scaling of the highest passband mode impedances is numerically evaluated in dependence on the number of cells for a single-cell up to a nine-cell cavity, which reveals the increased probability of trapped modes. This is followed by simulations for single-cell and five-cell cavities, which incorporate multiple damping schemes to assess the most efficient concepts. The usage and viability of on-cell dampers is elucidated for the single-cell cavity since it can push the envelope towards quasi HOM-free operation suited for next generation storage and collider rings. Geometrical end-cell shape alterations for the five-cell cavity with already efficient mode damping are discussed as a possibility to further lower specific high impedance modes. The findings are eventually put into relation with demanding impedance instability thresholds in future collider rings.

AB  - The cellar population of Drosophila melanogaster at the Chateau Tahbilk Winery (Victoria, Australia) was perturbed for alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene frequencies. Phenol oxidase (Phox) frequencies were also perturbed and monitored as a control. Subsequent gene frequency changes, together with information on population structure, indicated that selection acted on the chromosome regions of both loci. Adh gene frequencies returned to preperturbation levels in a predictable manner. A model in which the relative fitness of Adh phenotypes was determined by temperature-dependent specific activities of enzymes of Adh genotypes adequately accounts for the rate of gene frequency change at this locus. Thus temperature behaves as a selective agent in modulating Adh gene frequencies in this cellar environment.

AB  - An electrical power generator for use with biomass cooking stoves has been developed. The design is intended for users in developing countries who lack regular access to electricity. Electricity is generated based on the thermoelectric effect. A bespoke heat collector captures heat from the combustion chamber of the cooking stove and transfers it to a single thermoelectric generator (TEG) module. To maintain a sufficiently high temperature difference across the TEG, heat is dissipated using a passive single phase liquid thermosiphon system. This cooling system eliminates the requirement for mechanical components such as fans or pumps, which are unreliable and draw significant electrical power. In a controlled laboratory setting, a maximum power of 5.8 W has been produced from a single TEG installed into a low cost ceramic cooking stove currently disseminated in large numbers in Malawi, Africa. The TEG power is controlled using a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) conditioning circuit with an estimated efficiency of similar to 70%. The circuit provides a stable 5 V output via a USB connector for charging mobile phones, lights, power banks and other devices. Experiments have shown that the device is capable of performing for extended periods without significant reduction in performance. The magnitude of the power generated by this passive cooling system is observed to be comparable to that delivered by similar TEG-stove systems driven by active cooling. An average power generation of over 4 W was achieved which, including circuit efficiency, provided similar to 10 W.h of useful electrical energy over a 4 h burning interval, which is sufficient for charging low powered electrical appliances. Five prototypes fitted with data measurement and acquisition were deployed to families in rural Malawi in order to evaluate real-life performance of the technology. Initial field-trial results have advocated the viability of the TEG-stove technology for charging low powered electronic devices typically used in developing countries such as Malawi.

AB  - Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.), having a rich composition of biologically active connections and antioxidants, is gaining increasing popularity among agricultural producers. Increasing the production of sour cherry fruits requires the introduction of modern technology, one of the elements of which is low-growing rootstocks. For many cultures, the use of low-growing rootstocks has been widely studied, but there is very little information on their use in cherry plantations. We studied new varieties and rootstocks of cherries in the conditions of the dry steppe zone, where this issue had not been studied before. Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) varieties-Toy, Memory of Zhukova, and Loznovskaya-are the most adapted to the conditions in which the experiments were conducted. Russian breeding forms (Krymsk, Krasnodar region), which were taken as rootstocks, are widely used for sweet cherries (Prunus avium L.), but are practically never used for sour cherries (Prunus cerasus L.). The influence of rootstocks on such parameters as drought resistance, heat resistance, winter hardiness, and productivity was studied in variety-rootstock combinations. The study showed that they had the greatest drought resistance, and accordingly affected the grafted variety with rootstock, in the pedigree of which there are wild species. These rootstocks were of the VSL and RVL series. The study of the productivity of variety-rootstock combinations showed that in the grafted varieties the most rapid entry into the fruiting season and the greatest increase in the yield was facilitated by the rootstock forms of VSL-1 and VSL-2 (K5) which made it possible to obtain a yield of 5.8-8.1 kg/tree, depending on the variety grafted onto them. However, it is necessary to continue the research that has been started in order to fully determine the possible qualitative and quantitative parameters of the studied variety-rootstock combinations and to identify the most promising ones for further introduction into industrial production. This work was carried out within the framework of the topic of the state task of the Scientific Research Center of Agroecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences No. 0713-2019-0009: "Theoretical foundations, creation of new competitive biotypes of agricultural crops with high productivity, quality, sustainability and varietal technologies based on the latest methods and technological solutions in a changing climate, including seed breeding and nursery breeding".

AB  - In Argentina, there is an important potential to utilize organic waste to generate bioenergy. This work analyzes the environmental impacts and the energetic and economic requirements of the biogas produced by digesting the sewage sludge (SS) produced in a wastewater treatment plant in a medium city in Argentina. The SS is co-digested with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), and the basis of this study is the life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA is performed according to ISO 14040-44 using the SimaPro simulator. First, the transport of the raw materials to the biogas plant was defined. Then, the co-digestion and the biogas treatment for final use were evaluated. The co-digestion was improved with glycerol, and the generation of biogas was estimated using the GPS-X software. Two alternatives for the end use of biogas were considered: combined heat and power (CHP) and biomethane generation. For the first, H2S and water vapor were removed from the raw biogas stream, and for the second, also CO2 was removed. The H2S removal process was simulated in the SuperPro software by anaerobic biofiltration. The same software was used to simulate the removal of CO2 absorption-desorption with water as solvent. Finally, the environmental impacts related to the end use of biogas (CHP and biomethane) were evaluated. The environmental, energetic and economic analyses showed that the co-digestion of SS and OFMSW has great potential for reducing the environmental impacts and increasing the economic and energetic value of the substances via the production of biomethane, electricity and, potentially, fertilizer.

AB  - Invasive species provide powerful in situ experimental systems for studying evolution in response to selective pressures in novel habitats. While research has shown that phenotypic evolution can occur rapidly in nature, few examples exist of genomewide adaptation on short "ecological" timescales. Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus) have become a successful and impactful invasive species in Florida over the last 30 years despite major freeze events that caused high python mortality. We sampled Florida Burmese pythons before and after a major freeze event in 2010 and found evidence for directional selection in genomic regions enriched for genes associated with thermosensation, behaviour and physiology. Several of these genes are linked to regenerative organ growth, an adaptive response that modulates organ size and function with feeding and fasting in pythons. Independent histological and functional genomic data sets provide additional layers of support for a contemporary shift in invasive Burmese python physiology. In the Florida population, a shift towards maintaining an active digestive system may be driven by the fitness benefits of maintaining higher metabolic rates and body temperature during freeze events. Our results suggest that a synergistic interaction between ecological and climatic selection pressures has driven adaptation in Florida Burmese pythons, demonstrating the often-overlooked potential of rapid adaptation to influence the success of invasive species.

AB  - At SPIE2010, excellent performance of the cutting edge immersion lithography scanner, the NSR-S620D, which is based on the new "Streamlign" platform was demonstrated. Last year's work focused mainly on machine evaluation data([1]). Now, many S620Ds are employed at customers' sites and being used in device manufacturing. In this paper, the authors will introduce the latest factory data, as well as various techniques that enable superior yield and enhance productivity in IC manufacturing.
   It is well understood, that in order to achieve further device shrinks without using traditional techniques such as NA expansion or wavelength reduction, several practical issues must be overcome. Extremely tight overlay performance will be required for pitch splitting double patterning, for example. In addition, it is also necessary to control the image plane and the aberration of the optics much more carefully. Of course these improvements must also be achieved with sufficient productivity (throughput). In order to satisfy all of the requirements for mass production at customer factories, many variable factors must be dealt with.
   One of these variable factors is the characteristics of the processed wafers that include on-flatness, grid distortion, steep topology around the edge, or topography of the previous layers' patterns. These factors typically impact overlay and/or auto focus accuracy. Another variable is the difference in exposure conditions between layers, which include illumination conditions, dose, reticle transmittance, and the alignment marks. Exposure induced heating in particular is the key issue for today's enhanced throughput capabilities, with regards to achieving both optimal accuracy and productivity. In some IC production facilities, and often foundries, many different kinds of products are manufactured in parallel. However, in order to enhance performance and accuracy, it is sometimes necessary to optimize machine parameters for each product. Cleary this requires quick tuning capabilities to minimize overhead affects for each product.
   As discussed earlier, various techniques must be utilized to minimize the gap between machine inspection data and manufacturing performance at customer sites. This paper discusses such technologies and provides the supporting data.

AB  - The main objective of the present work was to establish and maintain a colony of Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus, Riohacha strain, under laboratory conditions and to study its life cycle. The colony's insectary was established from adult male and female mosquitoes collected from peripheral neighborhoods of Riohacha, Colombia. Environmental conditions established in the insectary were 26.5 degrees C average temperature, 80% average relative humidity, and 12 h photoperiodicity. Eight continuous generations were taken into account for maintaining the mosquitoes and analyzing their life cycle. The male mosquito's average life cycle was 26.8 days. The female's cycle was 30.8 days. Analysis of each of the biological stages of development (mean days) produced the following results: egg incubation 4.55 +/- 0.291, larvae 8.28 +/- 0.499, pupae 1.32 +/- 0.215, adult male 12.65 +/- 5.920, and adult female 16.73 +/- 6.034. The Riohacha colony has been maintained for 32 generations in 31 months. Comparison of the Riohacha colony with the previously established Cartagena and Barranquilla colonies showed few differences in the duration of stages of the life cycle between strains.

AB  - Mechanisms leading to gene variations are responsible for the diversity of species and are important components of the theory of evolution. One constraint on gene evolution is that of protein foldability; the three-dimensional shapes of proteins must be thermodynamically stable. We explore the impact of this constraint and calculate properties of foldable sequences using 3660 structures from the Protein Data Bank. We seek a selection function that receives sequences as input, and outputs survival probability based on sequence fitness to structure. We compute the number of sequences that match a particular protein structure with energy lower than the native sequence, the density of the number of sequences, the entropy, and the "selection" temperature. The mechanism of structure selection for sequences longer than 200 amino acids is approximately universal. For shorter sequences, it is not. We speculate on concrete evolutionary mechanisms that show this behavior.

AB  - Escherichia coli 0151:H7 is a foodborne pathogen. This bacterial strain can generate Shiga-like toxins (SLTs), which can cause serious sickness and even death. Thus, it is important to develop effective and sensitive methods that can be used to rapidly identify the presence of SLTs from complex samples. Pigeon egg white (PEW) contains abundant glycoproteins, including pigeon ovalbumin (POA) (similar to 60%). POA possesses Gal-alpha(1 -> 4)-Gal-beta(1 -> 4)-GlcNAc termini,. which can recognize the B subunits in SLT type 1 (SLT-1B). Thus, POA is a suitable probe for trapping SLT-1B. In this work, we used PEW proteins as starting materials to react with aqueous tetrachloroauric acid for generation of PEW-protein-immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs@PEW) via one-pot reactions. We demonstrated that the generated AuNPs@PEW were mainly dominated by POA-immobilized Au NPs. The as-prepared AuNPs@PEW were used as affinity probes to selectively probe SLT-1B from complex cell lysates derived from E. coli 0157:H7. The selective trapping step can be completed within similar to 90 s under microwave heating (power = 450 W) to enrich sufficient SLT-1B for Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric analysis. Furthermore; this approach:can be used to detect SLT-1B at a concentration as low as similar to 40 pM. The feasibility of using the proposed method to selectively detect SLT-1B from ham contaminated by E. coli 0157:H7 was also demonstrated.

AB  - Any modification of the environment that leads to a physiological, genetic, or epigenetic adaptive response in microorganisms may be considered as a stress. Historically, forms of stresses affecting biological structures were classified either as non-thermal, such as osmotic, oxidative, or acid stress or as thermal stress, hot or cold. Currently, the classification in biology is as abiotic, including physical and chemical stress, or biotic. The aim of this mini-review is to show, through the example of microorganisms, that the response to stress can be considered, in biology, as a global phenomenon, which can be extended to anthropogenic pressure.

AB  - Ectothermic organisms, such as insects and reptiles. rely on external heat sources to control body temperature and possess physiological and behavioral traits that are temperature dependent. It has therefore been hypothesised that differences in body temperature resulting from phenotypic properties. such as color pattern. may translate into selection against thermally inferior phenotypes. We tested for costs and benefits of pale versus dark coloration by comparing the behaviors (i.e., basking duration and bouts) of pygmy grasshopper (Tetrix undulata) individuals exposed to experimental situations imposing a trade-off between temperature regulation and feeding. We used pairs consisting of two full-siblings of the same sex that represented different (genetically coded) color morphs but had shared identical conditions from the time of fertilization. Our results revealed significant differences in behavioral thermo regulation between dark and pale individuals in females, but not in males. Pale females spent more time feeding than dark females, regardless of whether feeding was associated with a risk of either hypothermia or overheating. In contrast, only minor differences in behavior (if any) were evident between individuals that belonged to the same color morph but had been painted black or gray to increase and decrease their heating rates. This suggests that the behavioral differences between individuals belonging to different color morphs are genetically determined, rather than simply reflecting a response to different heating rates. To test for effects of acclimation on behaviors, we used pairs of individuals that had been reared from hatchlings to adults under controlled conditions in either low or high temperature. The thermal regime experienced during rearing had little effect on behaviors during the experiments reported above, but significantly influenced the body temperatures selected in a laboratory thermal gradient. In females (but not in males) preferred body temperature also varied among individuals born to mothers belonging to different color morphs, suggesting that a genetic correlation exists between color pattern and temperature preferences. Collectively, these findings, at least in females. are consistent with the hypothesis of multiple-trait coevolution and suggest that the different color morphs represent alternative evolutionary strategies.

AB  - Understanding how populations adapt to heterogeneous thermal regimes is essential for comprehending how latitudinal gradients in species diversification are formed, and how taxa will respond to ongoing climate change. Adaptation can occur by innate genetic factors, by phenotypic plasticity, or by a combination of both mechanisms. Yet, the relative contribution of such mechanisms to large-scale latitudinal gradients of thermal tolerance across conspecific populations remains unclear. We examine thermal performance in 11 populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus, ranging from Baja California Sur (Mexico) to British Columbia (Canada). Common garden experiments show that survivorship to acute heat-stress differs between populations (by up to 3.8 degrees C in LD50 values), reflecting a strong genetic thermal adaptation. Using a split-brood experiment with two rearing temperatures, we also show that developmental phenotypic plasticity is beneficial to thermal tolerance (by up to 1.3 degrees C), and that this effect differs across populations. Although genetic divergence in heat tolerance strongly correlates with latitude and temperature, differences in the plastic response do not. In the context of climate warming, our results confirm the general prediction that low-latitude populations are most susceptible to local extinction because genetic adaptation has placed physiological limits closer to current environmental maxima, but our results also contradict the prediction that phenotypic plasticity is constrained at lower latitudes.

AB  - Given the significant increasing trend of droughts in Northeast China (NEC) under climate change, it is of particularly urgency to quantify the drought risk to vegetation in different ecosystems. Based on the theory of risk formation, we developed a quantitative framework for the assessment of ecosystem drought risk that integrates both drought hazard and vulnerability (sensitivity and adaptability). To quantitatively assess the drought risk to different vegetation types in NEC, we used long-term (1982-2015) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) data. The effects of climate change and non-climatic factors (mainly human activities) on the NDVI dynamics and drought risk were analyzed using the partial least squares regression method to explore key drivers of risk formation. Our findings indicate that almost 45.4% of ecosystem vegetation in NEC is at a moderate or high risk of drought. Our findings indicate that vulnerability is key to NEC drought risk assessment, and adaptability plays an important role in regulating sensitivity. Land cover is the main driving factor for the spatial pattern of drought vulnerability in NEC, and forests have the lowest vulnerability. The impact of climate change on vegetation dynamics in dry years (R-dry(2) = 0.35) is significantly higher than over the entire study period (R-all(2) = 0.20). Cropland drought risk is dominated by human activities, whilst woodland and grassland drought risk is controlled by temperature and precipitation variability, respectively. The driving force analysis of vegetation dynamics and drought risk improves our understanding of the mechanisms behind the formation of risk patterns in NEC. Our study provides a basis for land use management and the formulation of drought adaptation options for vegetation types at different growth stages.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection the incidence of which varies with the environment and climate. Knowingly, the reported incidence of dengue is an insensitive indicator of infection risk in a locality. The Ovitrap Index has been in use in many countries. This index is a measurement of mosquito eggs in specified geographic locations which, in turn, reflects the distribution of Aedine mosquitoes, the vector for dengue. An alert system, founded on the Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, was created from a synthesis of geospatial data on ovitrap indices in Hong Kong. The inter-relationship between ovitrap indices and temperature was studied. This inference forms the rationale for the generation of weighted overlays to define risk levels. The weighting can be adjusted to set the sensitivity of the alert system. The system is operational at two levels: (1) for the general public to assist in the evaluation of dengue risk in the community, and (2) for professionals and academia in undertaking technical analysis. The alert system offers one objective means to defining the risk of dengue in a society, which would not be affected by the incidence of the infection itself.

AB  - Changes in legislation have opened the Mexican geothermal resources for exploitation to private companies; therefore the evaluation of the known geothermal areas has a high priority to plan further exploitation and possibly the expansion of the well fields. The calculation of the remaining productivity of geothermal fields currently in exploitation can be achieved with less uncertainty using the parameters obtained from production and injection wells, as well as the production efficiency of the installed plants. No information about previous volumetric evaluation is available for the fields presently being exploited, and there is the possibility that they may support an increase in their energy output or extend further their production life. The most widely used calculation technique is the USGS volumetric method that requires the knowledge of parameters that can be measured only after exploitation started. Heat in place-volumetric evaluation was undertaken for two fields in Mexico: Cerro Prieto and the Las Tres Virgenes geothermal fields, using all information obtained by exploration surveys and exploitation drilling. The obtained values allow planning a possible expansion of the fields based on their estimated mean potential output that is 1397 MWe for Cerro Prieto and 48 MWe for Las Tres Virgenes compared to the presently installed capacity of 580 MWe.

AB  - Continuous culture methods enable cells to be grown under quantitatively controlled environmental conditions, and are thus broadly useful for measuring fitness phenotypes and improving our understanding of how genotypes are shaped by selection. Extensive recent efforts to develop and apply niche continuous culture devices have revealed the benefits of conducting new forms of cell culture control. This includes defining custom selection pressures and increasing throughput for studies ranging from long-term experimental evolution to genome-wide library selections and synthetic gene circuit characterization. The eVOLVER platform was recently developed to meet this growing demand: a continuous culture platform with a high degree of scalability, flexibility, and automation. eVOLVER provides a single standardizing platform that can be (re)-configured and scaled with minimal effort to perform many different types of high-throughput or multi-dimensional growth selection experiments. Here, a protocol is presented to provide users of the eVOLVER framework a description for configuring the system to conduct a custom, large-scale continuous growth experiment. Specifically, the protocol guides users on how to program the system to multiplex two selection pressures - temperature and osmolarity - across many eVOLVER vials in order to quantify fitness landscapes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants at fine resolution. We show how the device can be configured both programmatically, through its open-source web-based software, and physically, by arranging fluidic and hardware layouts. The process of physically setting up the device, programming the culture routine, monitoring and interacting with the experiment in real-time over the internet, sampling vials for subsequent offline analysis, and post experiment data analysis are detailed. This should serve as a starting point for researchers across diverse disciplines to apply eVOLVER in the design of their own complex and high-throughput cell growth experiments to study and manipulate biological systems.

AB  - 1. Litter decomposition is a biogeochemical process fundamental to element cycling within ecosystems, influencing plant productivity, species composition and carbon storage.
   2. Climate has long been considered the primary broad-scale control on litter decomposition rates, yet recent work suggests that plant litter traits may predominate. Both decomposition paradigms, however, rely on inferences from cross-biome litter decomposition studies that analyse site-level means.
   3. We re-analyse data from a classical cross-biome study to demonstrate that previous research may falsely inflate the regulatory role of climate on decomposition and mask the influence of unmeasured local-scale factors.
   4. Using the re-analysis as a platform, we advocate experimental designs of litter decomposition studies that involve high within-site replication, measurements of regulatory factors and processes at the same local spatial grain, analysis of individual observations and biome-scale gradients.
   5. Synthesis. We question the assumption that climate is the predominant regulator of decomposition rates at broad spatial scales. We propose a framework for a new generation of studies focused on factoring local-scale variation into the measurement and analysis of soil processes across broad scales. Such efforts may suggest a revised decomposition paradigm and ultimately improve confidence in the structure, parameter estimates and hence projections of biogeochemical models.

AB  - Nothofagus antarctica is the most representative species of the native mixed forest occupying ecotone areas between forests and steppe in NW Patagonia, South-America. In this type of environment, vulnerability to climate change is particularly enhanced. Predictions of future climatic conditions for this region indicate an increment of atmospheric temperature and also, a high variability of rain events, threatening forest persistence and productivity. In this framework, management strategies are crucial to guarantee sustainability of native vegetation systems. The objective of this study was to study the effect of tree density on the ecophysiological limitations of water use of N. antarctica, as a proxy to its productivity, during a drought period. Compared with the unthinned forest, the thinned forest showed higher soil water availability, higher sapflow density (Js) and canopy conductance (Gc) values, similar aerodynamic conductance (Ga) and a low degree of coupling to vapor pressure deficit. Ecophysiological results demonstrated a high limitation over gas exchange of individual N. antarctica trees imposed by the resistance in the hydraulic soil-to-leaf pathway in the unthinned-natural condition. Surprisingly, our results suggest structural limitations in the unthinned stand which reduce the ability of N. antarctica trees to take advantage of wet seasons, at least in the short term. Thinning could decrease the susceptibility of N. antarctica-based systems to drought stress, by increasing resource availability to the remaining trees, thus contributing to enhance the persistence of this species under climate change conditions.

AB  - In this research article, an attempt has been made to predict the thermophysical properties of moist air in a solar still cavity with the help of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling. Six training algorithms have been used to train, test, and validate the ANN model (viz. OSS, CGP, CGF, RP, SCG, and LM). Water and inner glass cover temperatures were selected as the input parameters whereas, the model output are: thermal conductivity, partial vapour pressure at water & glass surface, thermal conductivity, volumetric expansivity, specific heat, latent heat of vaporization, and dynamic viscosity. The findings have revealed that the proposed ANN model can be used to predict the thermophysical properties of moist air with excellent accuracy. The results of ANN model were tested against the well-established relations of Tsilingiris. Out of all the training algorithms used LM was found to be the best in all the stages of ANN modelling, as the results are well within an accuracy level of more than 95%. Hence, the developed LM algorithm-based ANN model is one of the most suitable algorithm for the prediction of the thermophysical properties of moist air.

AB  - Acclimation and adaptation, which are key to species survival in a changing climate, can be observed in terms of membrane lipid composition. Remodelling membrane lipids, via homeoviscous adaptation (HVA), counteracts membrane dysfunction due to temperature in poikilotherms. In order to assess the potential for acclimation and adaptation in the honeycomb worm, Sabellaria alveolata, a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out common-garden experiments using individuals from along its latitudinal range. Individuals were exposed to a stepwise temperature increase from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C and membrane lipid composition assessed. Our results suggest that S. alveolata was able to acclimate to higher temperatures, as observed by a decrease in unsaturation index and 20:5n-3. However, over the long-term at 25 degrees C, lipid composition patterns are not consistent with HVA expectations and suggest a stress response. Furthermore, unsaturation index of individuals from the two coldest sites were higher than those from the two warmest sites, with individuals from the thermally intermediate site being in-between, likely reflecting local adaptation to temperature. Therefore, lipid remodelling appears limited at the highest temperatures in S. alveolata, suggesting that individuals inhabiting warm environments may be close to their upper thermal tolerance limits and at risk in a changing climate.

AB  - The lifecycle of most microbial pathogens can be divided into two states: existence outside and inside their hosts. The sudden temperature upshift experienced upon entry from environmental or vector reservoirs into a warm-blooded host is one of the most crucial signals informing the pathogens to adjust virulence gene expression and their host-stress survival program. This article reviews the plethora of sophisticated strategies that bacteria have evolved to sense temperature, and outlines the molecular signal transduction mechanisms used to modulate synthesis of crucial virulence determinants. The molecular details of thermal control through conformational changes of DNA, RNA and proteins are summarized, complex and diverse thermosensing principles are introduced and their potential as drug targets or synthetic tools are discussed.

AB  - Ocean warming is a major consequence of climate change, with the surface of the ocean having warmed by 0.11 degrees C decade(-1) over the last 50 years and is estimated to continue to warm by an additional 0.6 - 2.0 degrees C before the end of the century(1). However, there is considerable variability in the rates experienced by different ocean regions, so understanding regional trends is important to inform on possible stresses for marine organisms, particularly in warm seas where organisms may be already operating in the high end of their thermal tolerance. Although the Red Sea is one of the warmest ecosystems on earth, its historical warming trends and thermal evolution remain largely understudied. We characterized the Red Sea's thermal regimes at the basin scale, with a focus on the spatial distribution and changes over time of sea surface temperature maxima, using remotely sensed sea surface temperature data from 1982 - 2015. The overall rate of warming for the Red Sea is 0.17 +/- 0.07 degrees C decade(-1), while the northern Red Sea is warming between 0.40 and 0.45 degrees C decade(-1), all exceeding the global rate. Our findings show that the Red Sea is fast warming, which may in the future challenge its organisms and communities.

AB  - To establish a next-generation production process for SOG-Si, we proposed the electrochemical reduction process of SiO2 using a liquid Zn cathode in molten CaCl2. In this study, we focused on the dissolved SiO2 to improve the productivity of the process. The ionic species and electrochemical reduction of silicate ions at solid graphite and liquid Zn electrodes in molten CaCl2 with various O2-/SiO2 ratios (r(O2-)/SiO2 ) at 1123 K were investigated. Ionic species of silicates in the melts were determined by Raman spectroscopy. The dominant species were SiO32- (r(O2-)/SiO2 = 1.0) and SiO44- (r(O2-)/SiO2 = 1.5 and 2.0). Cyclic voltammetry, XRD, and SEM revealed that the electrochemical reduction of SiO3 (2-), Si2O7 (6-), and SiO4 (4-) occurs at the graphite electrode from 1.35 V, 1.12 V, and 0.75 V vs Ca2+/Ca, respectively. The electrochemical reduction potentials of silicate ions at the liquid Zn electrode shifted to more negative values in the order SiO32- > Si2O76- > SiO44-. The reaction observed at 0.60 V was attributed to the simultaneous electrochemical reduction of silicate ions and formation of Ca-Zn alloy. The indirect reduction of silicate ions by Ca-Zn alloy was also confirmed. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.

AB  - The global challenge of understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses to climate extremes and climate change is addressed in this review of research enabled through environmental research infrastructure (RI) provided by Australia's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN). Two primary climatic drivers of ecosystem structure and function in Australia are fire and aridity, to which Australian flora and fauna have shown marked adaptability. Australian vegetation shows resilience to climate extremes of flooding rains, droughts and heatwaves such that variability in primary productivity of Australian vegetation has a tangible effect on the global carbon cycle. Nonetheless, Australian flora and ecosystems could be vulnerable to projected climate change (e.g. to increasing vapour pressure deficit). Refugia are also vulnerable to climate change, with conditions in these areas already near the tipping point for a change in community composition. Ensuring genetic diversity during directional change in climate (e.g. increasing aridity) requires proactive approaches to conservation and restoration projects. To address these challenges, TERN provides environmental RI at three scales of observation: (i) environmental monitoring using remote sensing techniques at a landscape and continental scale; (ii) a spatially extensive network of ecosystem monitoring plots; and (iii) intensely measured sites collecting detailed data on ecosystem processes. Through partnerships with international environmental RIs, TERN enables research that addresses global challenges, on the first steps toward the forecasting of ecosystem-climate interactions.

AB  - Family-based selective breeding can be an effective strategy for controlling diseases in aquaculture. This study aimed to estimate (co) variance components for resistance to bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) and columnaris disease (CD) in two unrelated rainbow trout nucleus breeding populations: the USDA, ARS, National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture odd-year line (ARS-Fp-R), which has been subjected to five generations of selection for improved resistance to BCWD, and the Troutlodge, Inc., May-spawning odd-year line (TLUM), which has been selected for improved growth performance but not for disease resistance. A total of 46,805 and 27,821 pedigree records were available from both populations, respectively. Between 44 and 138 families per generation and population were evaluated under controlled BCWD and CD challenges, providing 32,311 and 17,861 phenotypic records for BCWD resistance, and 13,603 and 9,413 for CD resistance, in the ARS-Fp-R and TLUM populations, respectively. A two-trait animal threshold model assuming an underlying normal distribution for the binary survival phenotypes was used to estimate (co) variance components separately for each population. Resistance to BCWD (h(2) &#x003D; 0.27 +/- 0.04 and 0.43 +/- 0.08) and CD (h(2) &#x003D; 0.23 +/- 0.07 and 0.34 +/- 0.09) was moderately heritable in the ARS-Fp-R and TLUM populations, respectively. The genetic correlation between the resistance to BCWD and CD was favorably positive in the ARS-Fp-R (0.40 +/- 0.17) and TLUM (0.39 +/- 0.18) populations. These findings suggest that both disease resistance traits can be improved simultaneously even if genetic selection pressure is applied to only one of the two traits.

AB  - Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are being designed to achieve many of the same goals as Generation IV reactors in much smaller individual package sizes. The experience with developing a fabrication roadmap to Generation IV reactors can be transferred as guidance for fabrication design of SMRs. Some areas where fabrication process development needs to come early in the sequence are materials for fast neutron areas, connections of thick to thin for combinations of pressure containment and fluid flow, fabrication with planned coating of internal surfaces, and materials that push beyond existing upper temperature limits. For instance, the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) shifted to lower peak temperatures as the enormity of the materials qualification task for the originally planned peak temperatures became apparent. Materials replacements for long lifetime were needed in NGNP even when the peak temperature was lowered, with some like silicon carbide composite fuel rods not expected to be available for initial production. Several new welding techniques such as short-circuit transfer, narrow groove, tandem gas metal arc, hybrid laser-gas metal arc, and friction stir are also available. These techniques offer improved weld quality and higher productivity in assembly operations. Other fabrication considerations, such as qualification of joining methods, long life mechanical components, and dissimilar material joints will be discussed.

TI  - Climate and weather factors affecting winter sheltering by shoreline Copper Rockfish Sebastes caurinus in Howe Sound, British Columbia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - We monitored winter sheltering behavior of Copper Rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) in layered boulders at a shoreline in British Columbia and identified possible links to climate change and evolutionary adaptation. During late autumn and winter, these fish were inside the interstices of the boulder pile (termed "winter sheltering"); these fish were actively swimming above the boulders during spring through early fall. Sheltering duration did not vary between normal and most El Nino years (154-177 days). Sheltering longer than 6 months occurred during strong La Nina winters (197-241 days). Additionally, the proximate stimulus for entry into sheltering was intense Arctic outflow windstorms. Emergence from sheltering appears linked to water temperatures, occasionally related more to spring river flooding (snowmelt). The winter sheltering behavior we describe may be unique to shoreline populations in inland seas. Sheltering may confer a fitness advantage by conserving energy or reducing mortality from predation, thus increasing longevity and chances for successful reproduction. Our observations suggest that an ONI threshold of 0.8 degrees C or greater would be better suited than the current 0.5 degrees C threshold used to define ONI events.

AB  - The ground cricket Dianemobius nigrofasciatus overwinters as an egg in Japan, being univoltine in Hokkaido and northern Honshu and bivoltine farther south. In Hokkaido, however, this cricket is heard singing in winter in several fumarolic fields covered with moss and grasses locally known as bokke. In such warm islets the adult density was high in early summer and again in autumn, indicating that the cricket is bivoltine in contrast to the univoltine life cycle outside the bokke habitats in Hokkaido. Eggs laid by females collected at regular intervals from a bokke habitat showed a clear seasonal cycle of diapause incidence. At 26 degrees C, the bokke strains produced non-diapause eggs under long days and diapause eggs under short days as in the southern bivoltine populations, although the critical day-length was longer than in the south. Several strains derived from non-bokke habitats in Hokkaido and northern Honshu produced high percentages of diapause eggs under long days as well as short days as expected for the univoltine life cycle. Winter adults singing in bokke habitats could be either survivors of the autumn generation or individuals derived from eggs laid in autumn and then matured in response to the high soil temperature. In the laboratory, the proportion of egg diapause in short days was decreased by selection only for several generations. Phylogenetic trees of bokke and non-bokke populations, based on both the nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial COI gene and four allozyme loci, suggest that bokke populations have not been isolated from non-bokke populations for an evolutionarily significant time.

AB  - Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) reserves are crucial for trees to cope with weather extremes, thus to ensure their survival and ecological plasticity. The NSC reserves can depend on social status, suggesting uneven plasticity of trees at the stand level. In stemwood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), which is a widespread and important species, NSC reserves are stored in parenchyma in wood rays (WR). The quantity of WRs is adjusted intra-annually, allowing retrospective analysis of factors affecting their formation. Accordingly, the differences in WR quantity in stemwood of dominant and intermediate (canopy trees with reduced and narrow crowns) maturing Scots pine were assessed by quantitative wood anatomy. Tangential cuts from the outermost 30 treerings were analysed. The relative ray area was intermediate, i.e. covering about 5% of the tangential cut, yet expressed high individuality among the trees. The size and amount of WR mainly differed between the earlywood and latewood; WRs in latewood were higher although narrower in comparison to earlywood, yet their total amount was higher in earlywood. Canopy status had only a slight effect, as quantity and height of WR tended to be higher for the intermediate trees, particularly in earlywood. The size and quantity of WR expressed interannual variation, which was mainly related to the meteorological conditions prior to the formation of the tree-ring (previous summer and autumn) indicating legacy effects of climatic factors on NSC and susceptibility of trees to cumulative effects of weather extremes. However, the climatic signals in the inter-annual variation of WR were weaker than observed before, likely due to location of the studied stand in the mid-part of the species range. Nevertheless, the observed differences in mean values and inter-annual variation of WR suggested a withinspecies diversity of carbon allocation patterns, supporting adaptability of the species.

AB  - Nowadays main qualitative indices depend on concrete structure formation and curing while constructing cast-in-situ concrete and reinforced concrete structures and especially it concerns winter conditions. Therefore the regime of thermal treatment influences on concrete properties characterizing its strength, porosity, durability, frost resistance etc. In this connection selection of regimes and their corrections are reasonable to be tested while using models. Convenience in mathematical modeling is in reproduction of the operational process in time. However explicit mathematics is obtained only for relatively simple systems or at the cost of specific assumptions and suppositions. In this connection it is expedient to use physical simulation along with mathematical one. The physical simulation presupposes manufacturing, thermal treatment and testing of prototype models.
   Development of efficient, scientifically-substantiated technology for thermal treatment of cast-in-situ concrete is impossible without information support and working environment. The proposed mathematical model of thermal treatment for castin-situ structures determines sequence of the operations to be executed. Shapes, geometric dimensions, surface area have been determined in the paper. The required thermotechnical characteristics of formwork systems for structures under concreting have been used for making calculations of thermal treatment regimes. The model has taken into account three main stages of thermal treatment: temperature rising, isothermal warming and cooling. The paper provides formulae for their determination including total heat expenditure: for temperature rising of the concrete mix, for thermal treatment of 1 M-3 concrete mix, for cement exothermic reaction per 1 M-3, for reinforcement heating per 1 M-3, for moisture evaporation, for heating of formwork system. The following heat losses have been determined: in the environment, in the process of passing through the exterior surface of the formwork, in case of temperature rising in one of the constructive element and per 1 M-3 of its concrete mix. The paper reveals determination of hourly heat consumption for a concrete structure as a whole.
   The proposed methodology makes it possible to determine the required characteristics of heat treatment process for concrete mixes, to optimize regimes of heat treatment, promptly to make corrections in the created situation, to automatize the process and when it is necessary to make comparison of some solutions in the form of graphics and diagrams.

AB  - The urban heat island effect is linked to the built environment and threatens human health during extreme heat events. In this study, we analyzed whether characteristic land uses within an urban area are associated with higher or lower surface temperatures, and whether concentrations of. hot. land uses exacerbate this relationship. Zonal statistics on a thermal remote sensing image for the City of Toronto revealed statistically significant differences between high average temperatures for commercial and resource/industrial land use (29.1 degrees C), and low average temperatures for parks and recreational land (25.1 degrees C) and water bodies (23.1 degrees C). Furthermore, higher concentrations of either of these land uses were associated with more extreme surface temperatures. We also present selected neighborhoods to illustrate these results. The paper concludes by recommending that municipal planners and decision-makers formulate policies and regulations that are specific to the problematic land uses, in order to mitigate extreme heat.

AB  - Heat transfer is key to the survival of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera L.) in the wide range of hot (e.g. sub-Saharan) and cool climates (e.g. maritime-temperate) in which they have evolved and adapted. Here, a validated computational fluid dynamics, conjugate heat transfer model was used to determine the heat transfer of honey bee colonies in simulated standard wooden hives, complete with combs and brood, for a broad range of honey bee sizes, from slender lowland African A.m. scutellata, to broader (larger diameter) Northern European A.m. mellifera, across the whole range of brood covering honey bee densities, as well as when evenly distributed throughout the hive. It shows that under cooling stress, brood covering, broad subspecies need less than a third of the number of bees per unit of brood area for thermal insulation compared to slender subspecies. Also, when distributed evenly around the nest, broad subspecies lose less brood heat than when brood covering. These simulations demonstrate that honey bee girth has climate-based evolutionary advantages directly for the colony as well as via the survival of the individual. In addition, it shows that non-clustering behavioural patterns of passive honey bees can make significant, subspecies distinctive changes to nest heat loss and therefore honey production and climate change survival.

AB  - Detonation cell width is an important parameter in hydrogen explosion assessments. The experimental data on gas detonation are statistically analyzed to establish a universal method to numerically predict detonation cell widths. It is commonly understood that detonation cell width, lambda, is highly correlated with the characteristic reaction zone width, lambda. Classical parametric regression methods were widely applied in earlier research to build an explicit semiempirical correlation for the ratio of lambda/delta. The obtained correlations formulate the dependency of the ratio lambda/delta on a dimensionless effective chemical activation energy and a dimensionless temperature of the gas mixture. In this paper, support vector regression (SVR), which is based on nonparametric machine learning, is applied to achieve functions with better fitness to experimental data and more accurate predictions. Furthermore, a third parameter, dimensionless pressure, is considered as an additional independent variable. It is found that three-parameter SVR can significantly improve the performance of the fitting function. Meanwhile, SVR also provides better adaptability and the model functions can be easily renewed when experimental database is updated or new regression parameters are considered.

AB  - Application of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) constitutes a valuable non-thermal pasteurization process in modern food conservation. Triggered by our interest in the rapid adaptive evolution towards HHP resistance in the food-borne pathogen E. coli O157:H7 (strain ATCC 43888) that was demonstrated earlier, we used genetic screening to identify specific loci in which a loss-of-function mutation would be sufficient to markedly increase HHP survival. As such, individual loss of RssB (anti RpoS-factor), CRP (catabolite response protein) and CyaA (adenylate cyclase) were each found to confer significant HHP resistance in the 300 MPa range (i.e. > 1,000-fold), and this phenotype invariably coincided with increased resistance against heat as well. In contrast to loss of RssB, however, loss of CRP or CyaA also conferred significantly increased resistance to 600 MPa (i.e. > 10,000-fold), suggesting cAMP/CRP homeostasis to affect extreme HHP resistance independently of increased RpoS activity. Surprisingly, none of the rapidly emerging HHP-resistant mutants of ATCC 43888 that were isolated previously did incur any mutations in rssB, crp or cyaA, indicating that a number of other loci can guide the rapid emergence of HHP resistance in E. coli O157:H7 as well. The inability of spontaneous rssB, crp or cyaA mutants to emerge during selective enrichment under HHP selection likely stems from their decreased competitive fitness during growth. Overall, this study is the first to shed light on the possible genetic strategies supporting the acquisition of HHP resistance in E. coli O157:H7. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose a model for the generation of average MORBs based on phase relations in the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-CO2 system at pressures from 3 to 7 GPa and in the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-Na2O-FeO (CMASNF) system at pressures from similar to0.9 to 1.5 GPa. The MELT seismic tomography (Forsyth et al., 2000) across the East Pacific Rise shows the largest amount of melt centered at similar to30-km depth and lesser amounts at greater depths. An average mantle adiabat with a model-system potential temperature (T-P) of 1310degreesC is used that is consistent with this result. In the mantle, additional minor components would lower solidus temperatures similar to50degreesC, which would lower T-P of the adiabat for average MORBs to similar to1260degreesC. The model involves generation of carbonatitic melts and melts that are transitional between carbonatite and kimberlite at very small melt fractions (<0.2%) in the low-velocity zone at pressures of similar to2.6 to 7 GPa in the CMAS-CO2 system, roughly the pressure range of the PREM low-velocity zone. These small-volume, low-viscosity melts are mixed with much larger volumes of basaltic melt generated at the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition in the pressure range of similar to0.9 to 1.5 GPa.
   In this model, solidus phase relations in the pressure range of the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition strongly, but not totally, control the major-element characteristics of MORBs. Although the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition suppresses isentropic decompression melting in the CMAS system, this effect does not occur in the topologically different and petrologically more realistic CMASNF system. On the basis of the absence of plagioclase from most abyssal peridotites, which are the presumed residues of MORB generation, we calculate melt productivity during polybaric fractional melting in the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition interval at exhaustion of plagioclase in the residue. In the CMASN system, these calculations indicate that the total melt productivity is similar to24%, which is adequate to produce the oceanic crust. The residual mineral proportions from this calculation closely match those of average abyssal peridotites.
   Melts generated in the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition are compositionally distinct from all MORB glasses, but do not have a significant fractional crystallization trend controlled by olivine alone. They reach the composition field of erupted MORBs mainly by crystallization of both plagioclase and olivine, with initial crystallization of either one of these phases rapidly joined by the other, This is consistent with phenocryst assemblages and experimental studies of the most primitive MORBs, which do not show an olivine-controlled fractionation trend. The model is most robust for the eastern Pacific, where an adiabat with a T-P of similar to1260degreesC is supported by the MELT seismic data and where the global inverse correlation of (FeO)(8) with (Na2O)(8) is weak. Average MORBs worldwide also are well modeled. A heterogeneous mantle consisting of peridotite of varying degrees of major-element depletion combined with phase-equilibrium controls in the plagioclase-spinel lberzolite transition interval would produce the form of the global correlations at a constant T-P, which suggests a modest range of TP along ridges. Phase-composition data for the CMASNF system are presently not adequate for quantitative calculation of (FeO)(8)-(Na2O)(8)-(CaO/Al2O3)(8) systematics in terms of this model. The near absence of basalts in the central portion of the Gakkel Ridge suggests a lower bound for T-P along ridges of similar to1240degreesC, a potential temperature just low enough to miss the solidus for basalt production at similar to0.9 GPa. An upper bound for T-P is poorly constrained, but the complete absence of picritic glasses in Iceland and the global ridge system suggests an upper bound of similar to1400degreesC. In contrast to some previous models for MORB Generation that emphasize large potential temperature variations in a relatively homogeneous peridotitic mantle, our model emphasizes modest potential temperature variations in a peridotitic mantle that shows varying degrees of heterogeneity. Calculations indicate that melt productivity changes from 0 to 24% for a change in T-P from 1240 to 1260degreesC, effectively producing a rapid increase to full crustal thickness or decrease to none as ridges appear and disappear.

AB  - Understanding individual and population responses to climate change is emerging as an important challenge. Because many phenotypic traits are sensitive to environmental conditions, directional climate change could significantly alter trait distribution within populations and may generate an evolutionary response.
   In species with environment-dependent sex determination, climate change may lead to skewed sex ratios at hatching or birth. However, there are virtually no empirical data on the putative link between climatic parameters and sex ratios from natural populations.
   We monitored a natural population of viviparous lizards with temperature-dependent sex determination (Niveoscincus ocellatus) over seven field seasons. Sex ratios at birth fluctuated significantly among years and closely tracked thermal conditions in the field, with the proportion of male offspring increasing in colder years.
   This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of local climatic conditions (e.g. temperature) on offspring sex ratio fluctuations in a free-living population of a viviparous ectotherm. A succession of warmer-than-usual years (as predicted under many climate-change scenarios) likely would generate female-biased sex ratios at birth, while an increase in interannual variation (as also predicted under climate change scenarios) could lead to significant fluctuations in cohort sex ratios. If cohort sex ratio bias at birth leads to adult sex ratio bias, long-term directional changes in thermal conditions may have important effects on population dynamics in this species.

AB  - 1. 'Alba' is a genetic polymorphism in butterflies of the genus Colias (the sulphurs) which confers on its female carriers white (A-) rather than yellow (aa) wings. Previous studies of 'alba's' resource-based effects in Colias alexandra and Colias scudderi suggested the rare morph should be eliminated in each species. Here the selective regime acting on 'alba's' wing colour effect is examined to determine if it can maintain polymorphism.
   2. Field experiments and observations reveal species-specific differences in morph fecundity resulting from selection on wing colour. 'Alba' female and male Colias lose flight time, an index of Colias fitness, to unproductive courtship with pierines (white butterflies in the subfamily Pieridae), a form of interference competition. Flight time losses are greater in C. alexandra, which co-occur more extensively with pierines than C. scudderi. 'Alba' females also spent less time being harassed by courting male Colias than yellow females; this form of sexual selection on morph wing colour is particularly strong in C. alexandra.
   3. Loss of male and 'alba' female Colias flight time and the degree of male Colias preference for the yellow morph correlate with the extent each Colias species co-occurs with pierines, suggesting interference competition influences Colias courtship decisions and 'alba' frequency.
   4. Both interference competition and sexual selection are density dependent in their effects; these effects were modelled using Holling's equation. Modelling results show temporal variation in Colias and pierine densities over the past 20 years caused morph fitness to vary such that in at least one year each morph in each species had greater relative fitness with respect to colour-based selective pressures. Although this selective regime does not maintain polymorphism under temporal models of fitness variation, trade-offs between these colour-based effects and 'alba's' temperature and resource-based effects in a spatially heterogeneous environment could maintain polymorphism.

AB  - Background: A key question in evolutionary biology is the relationship between species traits and their habitats. Caves offer an ideal model to test the adjustment of species to their surrounding temperature, as they provide homogeneous and simple environments. We compared two species living under different thermal conditions within a lineage of Pyrenean beetles highly modified for the subterranean life since the Miocene. One, Troglocharinus fonti, is found in caves at 4-11 degrees C in the ancestral Pyrenean range. The second, T. ferreri, inhabits the coastal area of Catalonia since the early Pliocene, and lives at 14-16 degrees C.
   Results: We found no differences in their short term upper thermal limit (ca. 50 degrees C), similar to that of most organisms, or their lower thermal limit (ca. -2.5 degrees C), higher than for most temperate insects and suggesting the absence of cryoprotectants. In longer term tests (7 days) survival between 6-20 degrees C was almost 100% for both species plus two outgroups of the same lineage, but all four died between 23-25 degrees C, without significant differences between them.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that species in this lineage have lost some of the thermoregulatory mechanisms common in temperate insects, as their inferred default tolerance range is larger than the thermal variation experienced through their whole evolutionary history.

AB  - A number of hypotheses have been proposed about the association between developmental stability, phenotypic variability, heritability, and environmental stress. Stress is often considered to increase both the asymmetry and phenotypic variability of bilateral traits, although this may depend on trait heritability. Empirical studies of such associations often yield inconsistent results. This may reflect the diversity of traits and conditions used or a low repeatability of any associations. To test for repeatable associations between these variables, multiply replicated experiments were undertaken on Drosophila melanogaster using a combination stress at the egg, larval, and adult stages of reduced protein, ethanol in the medium, and a cold shock. Both metric and meristic traits were measured and levels of heritable variation for each trait estimated by maximum likelihood and parent-offspring regression over three generations. Trait means were reduced by stress, whereas among-individual variation increased. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was increased by stress in some cases, but few comparisons were significant. Only one trait, orbital bristle, showed consistent increases in FA. Changes in trait means, trait phenotypic variability, and developmental stability as a result of stress were not correlated. Extreme phenotypes tended to have higher levels of FA, but only the results for orbital bristles were significant. All traits had low to intermediate heritabilities except orbital bristle, which showed no heritable variation. Only traits with low heritability and high levels of phenotypic variability may show consistent increases in FA under stress. Overall, the independence of phenotypic variability, plasticity, and the developmental stability of traits extend to changes in these measures under stressful conditions.

AB  - The calling behavior, mating time, and the reproductive compatibility of virgin adults of fall armyworms, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), were studied in this work. Larvae were collected on maize (Zea mays L.) from six states located on the Pacific coast (Chiapas, Michoacan, and Sinaloa), on the Gulf of Mexico (Veracruz and Yucatan), and in central Mexico (Morelos). Before the experiments, insects were reared under laboratory conditions for one generation. We recorded the age at which females called for the first time, the onset time of calling, the duration of calling, the onset time of copulation, and the duration of copulation. The calling rhythms of the six populations were dissimilar. Females from all populations began to call in the second or third scoto-phase. The time for onset of calling and the duration of calling were significantly different among the S. frugiperda populations studied. Spodoptera frugiperda pairs from Sinaloa, Veracruz, Yucatan, and Morelos started to copulate earlier than the pairs from Chiapas and Michoacan. Pairs from Veracruz and Yucatan copulated longer than those from Michoacan, Morelos, Chiapas, and Sinaloa. Our crossing experiment using females and males from the six populations showed that individuals from different populations could copulate and produce fertile offspring. Thus, although the S. frugiperda populations showed variability in the timing of reproduction, the populations were not reproductively incompatible, which indicated that geographic distance has not led to reproductive isolation in corn-strain populations of S. frugiperda in Mexico.

AB  - Background: Temporal variation of temperature-health associations depends on the combination of two pathways: pure adaptation to increasingly warmer temperatures due to climate change, and other attenuation mechanisms due to non-climate factors such as infrastructural changes and improved health care. Disentangling these pathways is critical for assessing climate change impacts and for planning public health and climate policies. We present evidence on this topic by assessing temporal trends in cold-and heat-attributable mortality risks in a multi-country investigation.
   Methods: Trends in country-specific attributable mortality fractions (AFs) for cold and heat (defined as below/above minimum mortality temperature, respectively) in 305 locations within 10 countries (1985-2012) were estimated using a two-stage time-series design with time-varying distributed lag non-linear models. To separate the contribution of pure adaptation to increasing temperatures and active changes in susceptibility (non-climate driven mechanisms) to heat and cold, we compared observed yearly-AFs with those predicted in two counterfactual scenarios: trends driven by either (1) changes in exposure-response function (assuming a constant temperature distribution), (2) or changes in temperature distribution (assuming constant exposure-response relationships). This comparison provides insights about the potential mechanisms and pace of adaptation in each population.
   Results: Heat-related AFs decreased in all countries (ranging from 0.45-1.66% to 0.15-0.93%, in the first and last 5-year periods, respectively) except in Australia, Ireland and UK. Different patterns were found for cold where AFs ranged from 5.57-15.43% to 2.16-8.91%), showing either decreasing (Brazil, Japan, Spain, Australia and Ireland), increasing (USA), or stable trends (Canada, South Korea and UK). Heat-AF trends were mostly driven by changes in exposure-response associations due to modified susceptibility to temperature, whereas no clear patterns were observed for cold.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest a decrease in heat-mortality impacts over the past decades, well beyond those expected from a pure adaptation to changes in temperature due to the observed warming. This indicates that there is scope for the development of public health strategies to mitigate heat-related climate change impacts. In contrast, no clear conclusions were found for cold. Further investigations should focus on identification of factors defining these changes in susceptibility.
