AB  - The article describes the results of a psychological field experiment conducted to determine the effectiveness of the program on improving students' resilience and psychological resistance to extreme factors in the simulation of professional activity.
   The study was conducted in the Far East Fire and Rescue Academy. The sample is represented by 52 cadets of the faculty of fire safety from 19 to 21 years of age. Type of the research: psychological field experiment with the use of smoke and heat simulation training facilities. At the stage of ascertaining experiment in 2016 diagnostic sections were carried out on the entire sample to study the psychological characteristics and physiological reactions to stress in the smoke and heat training chambers. Targets for psychological exposure were identified. At the stage of the formative experiment, the random sampling was divided into experimental and control groups. Cadets of the experimental groups (30 participants) participated in the program to improve resilience and psychological stability. Cadets of the control group (22 participants) did not participate in the psychological program. At the stage of the control experiment with the participation of the entire sample in 2017 a repeated study of psychological characteristics and physiological responses to stress in smoke and heat training chambers was conducted.
   Methods of psychological diagnostics: test of viability by D.A. Leontiev and E.I. Rasskazova; Life-purpose Orientations test by D.A. Leontiev; Multifactor Personality Questionnaire "Adaptability"; coping test by R. Lazarus, method of determining the accentuations of character by K. Leonhard and G. Shmisek; Ltischer-Test modified by L.N. Sobchik; the Structure of motivation of labor activity" C. Zamfir, the method of studying motivation in university studies by T.I. Ilyina; correction tables (Landolt rings). Methods of studying the psycho-physiological parameters: "Heart rate variability analysis" of the rehabilitation psycho-physiological complex "Reakor"; assessment of the functional state of the central nervous system based on a simple visual motor reaction using a psycho physiological testing device "Psychophysiologist". Statistical methods: nonparametric Wilcoxon T-test, IBM SPSS Statistics 20.
   The results of the study showed that the program of psychological support for cadets: contributes to the improvement of vitality and emotional stability, and clarifies the life purpose orientations. In addition, the indicators of personal adaptive potential and regulation of behavior increase. The program allows to regulate coping behavior strategies, as well as at the psychological and psycho-physiological levels it helps to improve the attention functions and the level of performance.

AB  - Ammonium nitrate (AN) has proven to be an unstable and hazardous component of mineral fertilizers. In order to analyze the influence of various potassium salts on thermal properties of ammonium nitrate, differential thermal analysis coupled with thermogravimetry and mass spectrometry was used. Each potassium salt was mixed with AN to create samples with AN:salt mass ratios of 4:1, 9:1 and 49:1. It was concluded that an addition of potassium influences phase transitions of AN. Depending on the salt used, an exothermic decomposition of AN was either accelerated (potassium chloride) or inhibited to the varying degree. Carbonate salts and potassium metabisulfite were too reactive to be used in a fertilizer production, while nitrate, sulphate and both phosphates are considered to be appropriate additives and could be used in a multicomponent fertilizer production.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the thermomechanical and in vitro biological response of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) plates for craniofacial reconstructive surgery. Methods: PLGA 85/15 craniofacial plates were produced by injection molding by testing two different temperatures (i.e., 240 degrees C, PLGA_lowT, and 280 degrees C, PLGA_highT). The mechanical properties of the produced plates were characterized by three-point bending tests, dynamic mechanical analysis, and residual stress. Crystallinity and thermal transitions were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, in vitro cell interaction was evaluated by using SAOS-2 as cell model. Indirect cytotoxicity tests (ISO 10-993) were performed to prove the absence of cytotoxic release. Cells were then directly seeded on the plates and their viability, morphology, and functionality (ALP) checked up to 21 days of culture. Results: A similar performance of PLGA_lowT and PLGA_highT plates was verified in the three-point bending test and dynamic mechanical analyses. Also, the two processing temperatures did not influence the in vitro cell interaction. Cytotoxicity and ALP activity were similar for the PLGA plates and control. Cell results demonstrated that the PLGA plates supported cell attachment and proliferation. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the presence of sub-micron particles, which were identified as inorganic mineral deposits resulting from osteoblast activity. Conclusion: The present work demonstrated that the selected processing temperatures did not affect the material performance. PLGA plates showed good mechanical properties for application in craniofacial reconstructive surgery and adequate biological properties.

AB  - Geopolymer matrices represent one of the main sustainable alternatives to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and other clinker-based blended cements. Real scale applications are limited and a relevant amount of data is still needed to assess the early age and long-term behavior of these systems. Particularly, the early-age monitoring of geopolymers represent a key parameter for mix design optimization. Most of the available methods for the measurement of temperature evolution due to polycondensation kinetics and early age deformations are related to laboratory activities. The upscaling to in situ techniques represents a crucial step toward technological assessment. To this aim, authors propose to use Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) embedded in the geopolymer matrices. Starting from a case study by authors related to the design of externally bonded fiber reinforced geopolymers for strengthening of existing structures, the matrix was optimized in terms of quartz filler content. The measurements carried out by means of FBG sensors allowed to reduce filler content respect to the abovementioned work. Particularly, quartz content can be reduced by 50%. The temperature associated to polycondensation was slightly below 65 degrees C for the three studied systems, limiting the use of designed metakaolin geopolymer to non-massive structures, since thermal cracking could occur, unless further research will be able to assess the viability of retardants. The experimental results confirm that FBG represent an accurate method for simultaneous shrinkage and temperature measurements for geopolymers and the application in real scale structures for remote sensing could help to create database on inner temperatures and early age deformations.

AB  - Stress often induces metabolically expensive countermeasures. Bivalve shell production is costly and can thus be indirectly impacted by environmental stress. Suboptimal salinity and temperature may constitute stressors that allocate energy away from shell production to cellular processes such as osmoregulation or to the repair of cellular damage. In the course of climate change, water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are predicted to increase, and salinity is predicted to regionally decrease. These shifts may lead to increased stress for temperate marine species adapted to relatively cool water temperatures and high salinity conditions. To better understand the importance of climate change-related stress, we assessed the isolated and interactive effects of salinity and temperature on shell increment (cumulative growth: shell), cellular oxidative stress (accumulation of oxidized lipids and proteins: lipofuscin), instantaneous physiological condition (condition index: CI), and mortality of young Mytilus edulis and Arctica islandica from the western Baltic Sea. Temperature and salinity interactively affected shell increment, lipofuscin accumulation, and mortality of M. edulis as well as shell increment of A. islandica. Shell increment of M. edulis was less affected by hyposalinity than shell increment of A. islandica. In both species the CI decreased and lipofuscin accumulation increased with increasing temperature. Lipofuscin accumulation negatively correlated with shell increment in M. edulis. We conclude that Baltic Sea populations of ecologically relevant bivalve species may experience severe stress by the predicted regional scenario of warming and desalination if evolutionary adaptation does not happen at a similar rate.

AB  - A non-supersymmetric renormalizable SO(10) model is investigated for its viability in explaining the observed fermion masses and mixing parameters along with the baryon asymmetry produced via thermal leptogenesis. The Yukawa sector of the model consists of complex 10(H) and (126) over bar (H) scalars with a Peccei-Quinn like symmetry and it leads to strong correlations among the Yukawa couplings of all the standard model fermions including the couplings and masses of the right-handed (RH) neutrinos. The latter implies the necessity to include the second lightest RH neutrino and flavor effects for the precision computation of leptogenesis. We use the most general density matrix equations to calculate the temperature evolution of flavoured leptonic asymmetry. A simplified analytical solution of these equations, applicable to the RH neutrino spectrum predicted in the model, is also obtained which allows one to fit the observed baryon to photon ratio along with the other fermion mass observables in a numerically efficient way. The analytical and numerical solutions are found to be in agreement within a factor of O(1). We find that the successful leptogenesis in this model does not prefer any particular value for leptonic Dirac and Majorana CP phases and the entire range of values of these observables is found to be consistent. The model specifically predicts (a) the lightest neutrino mass m(nu 1) between 2-8 meV, (b) the effective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay m(beta beta) between 4-10 meV, and (c) a particular correlation between the Dirac and one of the Majorana CP phases.

   2. Females actively thermoregulate in the field, although the efficiency of thermoregulation is restricted by environmental constraints.
   3. Gravid females in more favourable habitats in the period encompassing the middle third of development (the assumed sex determining period) select higher temperatures, with lower variance and have greater thermoregulatory efficiency than during the rest of pregnancy, thus thermoregulating more precisely during this period.

AB  - The paradigm for the latitudinal gradient in species richness is that it is unimodal with a tropical peak. For 27 published studies, and global datasets of 65 000 recent and 50 000 fossil marine species, we found that almost all datasets were significantly bimodal with a dip in species richness near the equator. The locations of mid-latitude peaks varied between taxa and were higher in the northern hemisphere where the continental shelf is greatest. Our findings support hypotheses of tropical species evolving in response to temperature variation near the edges of the tropics and available high-productivity habitat. They suggest that the equator may already be too hot for some species and that the modes may move further apart due to climate warming.

AB  - Enchytraeus albidus is a terrestrial earthworm widespread along the coasts of northern Europe and the Arctic. This species tolerates freezing of body fluids and survives winters in a frozen state. Their acclimatory physiological mechanisms behind freeze tolerance involve increased fluidity of membrane lipids during cold exposure and accumulation of cryoprotectants (glucose) during the freezing process. Gene regulatory processes of these physiological responses have not been studied, partly because no gene expression tools were developed. The main aim of this study was to understand whether the freeze tolerance mechanisms have a transcriptomic basis in E.albidus. For that purpose, first the transcriptome of E.albidus was assembled with RNAseq data. Second, two strains from contrasting thermal environments (Germany and Greenland) were compared by mapping barcoded RNAseq data onto the assembled transcriptome. Both of these strains are freeze tolerant, but Greenland is extremely freeze tolerant. Results showed more plastic responses in the Greenland strain as well as higher constitutive expression of particular stress response genes. These altered transcriptional networks are associated with an adapted homeostasis coping with prolonged freezing conditions in Greenland animals. Previously identified physiological alterations in freeze-tolerant strains of E.albidus are underpinned at the transcriptome level. These processes involve anion transport in the hemolymph, fatty acid metabolism, metabolism, and transport of cryoprotective sugars as well as protection against oxidative stress. Pathway analysis supported most of these processes, and identified additional differentially expressed pathways such as peroxisome and Toll-like receptor signaling. We propose that the freeze-tolerant phenotype is the consequence of genetic adaptation to cold stress and may have driven evolutionary divergence of the two strains.

AB  - We examine the distributional effects of high temperature on worker performance and the effectiveness of adaptation when capital investments such as air conditioning are not feasible. Using a longitudinal data set of 3196 professional archers in 57 competitions during 2010-2016 in China, which includes accurate performance measures at the individual-by-contest level, we show that heat causes more uneven performance distributions by hurting the bottom performers more than the top performers. More frequent heat reduces average performance and raises distributional inequality more than increases in average temperature. Gaining experience and long-term acclimatization together can mitigate 70% of the heat impacts, demonstrating the potential of adaptation.

AB  - The new generation of Nuclear Power Plant (e.g. WESTINGHOUSE AP600, GE Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR), ABB Process Inherent Ultimate Safety (PIUS), etc.) have been designed in order to satisfy today's needs. They are simple, economic: midsize and fully standardized. Those plants enhance safety by extensively relying on passive safety systems that use natural forces and phenomena such as gravity, condensation and evaporation. Evolutionary plants rely on a full Reactor Coolant System (RCS) depressurization to allow gravity injection from an In Containment Tank and assure with its operation the long term core cooling. Depressurization is obtained by the opening of Motor Operated Valves or Squib valves actuated on a logic signal. The concept of depressurizing the primary system following a Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) signal was even developed in The past for the application to the Westinghouse Pressurizer Water Reactor (PWR) Italian Reference Plant. Studies performed to support the licensing process and design of both evolutionary and innovative reactors, have shown that cold water injection may, under particular plant conditions. induce a large plant depressurization.
   The conceptual design of a Passive Injection and Depressurization System (PIDS), based on the idea of depressurizing die Reactor Coolant System (RCS) by mixing cold water with die RCS hot water and inducing steam condensation in the primary system, has been pursued. While, die PIDS concept is applicable both to boiling and pressurized water reactor design, the PIDS so far developed has been conceived for the application to a PWR design. Due to die PIDS innovative concept: before proceeding to the actual system design, an experimental campaign has been undertaken. The aim was to explore the physical phenomena occurring during system actuation and operation and to demonstrate die concept viability. The first experimental step, devoted to asses siphon triggering phenomenologies and the components performances of the PIDS, has been performed at SIET laboratory in Piacenza, Italy. The test objectives were to:
   identify the limit conditions which would lead to an adverse mass distribution, then delaying the PIDS intervention (i.e. TMI Scenarios-Pressurizer filled by a Water/Steam mixture),
   confirm that the system will be actuated as soon as the reactor coolant system water level reaches the actuation level;
   confirm that spurious actuations are not foreseen;
   confirm that the injection flow is stable during PIDS operation:
   characterize the PIDS components performances:
   assess the PIDS performance in presence of non condensable gasses.
   The test facility design and scaling and the experimental activities have been supported by extensive RELAP5 Mod3 simulations, A visual tool (Nuclear Plant Analyzer, NPA) has been also used for the analysis of die results.
   The present paper. after a brief description of the PIDS concept, reports some of die more significant pretest analyses and experimental test results.

AB  - Aims Competition, temperature and nutrient are the most important determinants of tree growth in the cold climate on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Although many studies have reported their individual effects on tree growth, little is known about how the interactions of competition with fertilization and temperature affect root growth. We aim to test whether climate warming and fertilization promote competition and to explore the functional strategies of Picea asperata in response to the interactions of these factors.
   Methods We conducted a paired experiment including competition and non-competition treatments under elevated temperature (ET) and fertilization. We measured root traits, including the root tip number over the root surface (RTRS), the root branching events over the root surface (RBRS), the specific root length (SRL), the specific root area (SRA), the total fine root length and area (RL and RA), the root tips (RTs) and root branching (RB) events. These root traits are considered to be indicators of plant resource uptake capacity and root growth. The root biomass and the nutrient concentrations in the roots were also determined.
   Important Findings The results indicated that ET, fertilization and competition individually enhanced the nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) concentrations in fine roots, but they did not affect fine root biomass or root traits, including RL, RT, RA and RB. However, both temperature and fertilization, as well as their interaction, interacting with competition increased RL, RA, RT, RB and nutrient uptake. In addition, the SRL, SRA, RTRS and RBRS decreased under fertilization, the interaction between temperature and competition decreased SRL and SRA, while the other parameters were not affected by temperature or competition. These results indicate that P. asperata maintains a conservative nutrient strategy in response to competition, climate warming, fertilization and their interactions. Our results improve our understanding of the physiological and ecological adaptability of trees to global change.

AB  - Throughout the oceans, small fish and other micronekton migrate between daytime depths of several hundred meters and near-surface waters at night. These diel vertical migrations of mesopelagic organisms structure pelagic ecosystems through trophic interactions, and are a key element in the biological carbon pump. However, depth distributions and migration amplitude vary greatly. Suggested proximate causes of the migration such as oxygen, temperature, and light often correlate and therefore the causal underpinnings have remained unclear. Using mesopelagic fishes and the Norwegian Sea as a study system, we developed a dynamic state variable model that finds optimal migration patterns that we validate with acoustic observations along a latitudinal gradient. The model describes predation risk and bioenergetics, and maximizes expected energy surplus, a proxy for Darwinian fitness. The model allows us to disentangle the drivers of migration and make predictions about depth distribution and related fitness consequences along a latitudinal trajectory with strong gradients in environmental drivers and vertical distribution of scattering layers. We show that the model-predicted vertical migration of mesopelagic fishes matches that observed along this transect. For most situations, modelled mesopelagic fish behaviour can be well described by a light comfort zone near identical to that derived from observations. By selectively keeping light or temperature constant, the model reveals that temperature, in comparison with light, has little effect on depth distribution. We find that water clarity, which limits how deeply light can penetrate into the ocean, structures daytime depths, while surface light at night controlled the depth of nocturnal ascents.

CP  - 1st International Conference on Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture in The Tropics (IC-FSSAT)
AB  - Wheat is a sub-tropical plant which adaptability in the tropics in areas with altitudes over 1000 m above sea level (asl). Cultivation on the highlands is in competition with vegetables and fruits in terms of land use, therefore, it is essential to have wheat genotypes adaptive to the lowlands. This study aimed to test and select offspring of three adaptive mutant on lowland with high temperature ranged from 28 to 33 degrees C. The benefit of the research is to obtain a potential strain of adaptive wheat mutants in the lowlands. The experiment was conducted at Experimental farm of Agriculture Faculty, Hasanuddin University Makassar at an altitude below 50 m from sea level. The study was conducted from March to June 2017. The experimental study applied a randomized block design with three replications. The treatments consisted of 20 mutants of wheat with 4 varieties used for comparison. They were Nias, Selayar, Dewata, and Munal. Results showed that the wheat mutant N.300 4.3.6 (1.92 t per hectare) gave highest growth and production and was significantly different from all other mutants and comparing varieties. The mutant genotypes that gave higher growth and production than all comparing varieties were N.350 3.1.4 (1.86 t per hectare), N.200 2.3.3 (1.67 t per hectare), N. 250 4.2.1 (1.48 t per hectare), N.200 2.4.B.6 (1.36 t per hectare), N.250 4.5.2 (1.26 t per hectare), N.350 3.2.2 (1.26 t per hectare), and N.350 3.1.3 (1.22 t per hectare). Mutants that produce higher yields than the three comparing varieties (Dewata, Selayar and Munal) with yields > 1 t per hectare, yet lower than Nias varieties (1.15 t per hectare) are N.200 2.5.2 (1.11 t per hectare), N.250 4.6.2 (1.14 t per hectare), and N.350 3.6.2 (1.07 t per hectare. In conclusion, there are 11 potential mutant genotypes for further experiment in order to develop adaptive wheat to lowlands.

AB  - A magnetohydrodynamic model of a steady, transverse C-type shock in a dense molecular cloud is presented. A complete gas-grain chemical network is taken into account: the gas-phase chemistry, the adsorption of gas species on dust grains, various desorption mechanisms, the grain surface chemistry, the ion neutralization on dust grains, the sputtering of grain mantles. The population densities of energy levels of ions CI, CII and OI and molecules H-2, CO, H2O are computed in parallel with the dynamical and chemical rate equations. The large velocity gradient approximation is used in the line radiative transfer calculations. The simulations consist of two steps: (i) modelling of the chemical and thermal evolution of a static molecular cloud and (ii) shock simulations. A comparison is made with the results of publicly available models of similar physical systems.
   The focus of the paper is on the chemical processing of gas material and ice mantles of dust grains by the shock. Sputtering of ice mantles takes place in the shock region close to the temperature peak of the neutral gas. At high shock speeds, molecules ejected from ice mantles are effectively destroyed in hot gas, and their survival time is low-of the order of dozens of years. After a passage of high-speed C-type shock, a zone of high abundance of atomic hydrogen appears in the cooling postshock gas that triggers formation of complex organic species such as methanol. It is shown that abundances of some complex organic molecules (COMs) in the postshock region can be much higher than in the preshock gas. These results are important for interpretation of observations of COMs in protostellar outflows.

AB  - Ocean acidification is already having measurable impacts on marine ecosystems. Intraspecific variation in the responses of marine organisms to ocean acidification can reveal genetic differences in tolerance to low pH conditions and determine the potential for a species to adapt to a changing environment. This study tests for the existence of genetic variation in both the transmission success of the trematode Maritrema novaezealandense to its second intermediate amphipod host, Paracalliope novizealandiae, and the extent of parasite-induced mortality in that host, in response to decreasing pH. Eight parasite genotypes were tested in a custom-built ocean acidification simulation system, at 8.1 pH (current ocean conditions) and under conditions of 7.4 pH (worst-case scenario future prediction). The parasites had significantly higher infection success in the more acidic treatment, but there was no significant difference among genotypes in how infection success was affected by pH. In contrast, some parasite genotypes induced higher mortality in amphipods than other genotypes, but this genetic effect was also independent of pH. Overall, our results reveal no significant intergenotype variation in how the parasite responds to ocean acidification with respect to two key traits, infection success and parasite-induced host mortality, suggesting limited potential for adaptation in the face of acidifying conditions.

During the optimization of the parameters, according to the different specifications, the idea which looks on secondary targets as the boundary restrictions is proposed, so that the problem of multi-objective normalization is solved. The secondary optimizing method about "coarse adjusting initially, meticulous adjusting successively" is proposed in the optimization based on adaptive Genetic Algorithm. The simulation results which have reached the leading standard of industry indicate the advantage and validity of the method comparing with other method used in the design of bandgap references.

AB  - Natural populations are normally exposed to substantial environmental stress. The consequences of stress include elevated metabolic costs and additive genetic variability. From the former, preferred habitats should be located in environments corresponding to minimum total energy expenditure. This tendency occurs in the field for behavioral adaptation of Drosophila to variable temperature (and humidity) conditions. Laboratory studies of resource preference in Drosophila suggest a low genetic variability. However, under more stressful field conditions, genetic variability should be higher. Habitat preference studies under stressful conditions therefore need to be emphasized in modeling situations in nature.

AB  - In this paper, a simple model was proposed using finite element analysis (FEA) with a commercial FEA software ABAQUS to simulate the two-dimensional (2-D) laser heat transfer in an aluminum material. Without relying on the conventional hydrodynamic model, the proposed model not only predicts the evolutions of the temperature field and ablation profiles in the target material, but also provides an estimation on the evolutions of electron density, plasma temperature, and plasma absorption coefficient. The assumptions used in the model include the local thermal equilibrium and additional assumptions regarding the average plasma temperature and vapor density. The assumptions allowed the laser heat transfer equation to be solved together with the Saha-Eggert equation and conservation equations of matter and charge. When compared to the existing hydrodynamic models, the proposed model solves a less number of nonlinear equations and hence is computationally more efficient. The proposed FE model was employed to study the plasma-shielding effect on PLA produced by a 193 nm Excimer laser and a 266 nm Nd:YAG laser. The predictions of ablation depths, electron density, and plasma temperature agree well with the experimental data. Moreover, effects of the laser intensity and the average plasma temperature on the efficiency of the plasma shielding during PLA were also investigated and discussed in this study.

AB  - The Oceanic Institute (01), in collaboration with researchers from the University of Arizona (UAZ), established a population of specific pathogen free (SPF) Fenneropenaeus chinensis through Secondary Quarantine (SQ) in Kona, Hawaii. Shrimp were 0.38 g (S.D.+/- 0.13 g) when they entered the nursery/growout module of the SQ facility. Juveniles from five maternal families were stocked in separate 230-L nursery tanks, as was a sixth family comprised of shrimp from two of the seven original spawns. After tagging, representative shrimp from all six families were stocked in a 50-m(2) concrete raceway that was enclosed in a biosecure greenhouse. After 155 days in the growout module, mean shrimp weight was 23.4 g (S.D.+/- 7.25 g) and females (29.1 +/- 4.61 g) were 74% larger than males (16.7 +/- 2.44 g). A Sprung Structure (TM) was erected to enclose the biosecure maturation and hatchery module of the SQ facility. Broodstock were subjected to an acclimation process where they were kept in seawater at 22 degrees C, followed by a reduction in water temperature of 1 degrees C/day until the temperature reached 17 degrees C. At this time, unilateral eyestalk ablation was performed on female broodstock and water temperature was further reduced at the same rate until it reached 12 degrees C. After 2 weeks, water temperature was raised to 17 degrees C at a rate of 1 degrees C/day to induce ovarian development. Production of an F, generation of Fe. chinensis was successfully accomplished using artificial insemination, and representative shrimp from this generation have tested negative for all specifically listed pathogens using histology and PCR/RT-PCR. Of particular interest with Fe. chinensis is their cold tolerance. This species may represent a valuable resource for shrimp farmers in temperate and sub-tropical climates to grow a second "winter" crop, thereby increasing production and profitability for the shrimp farmer.

AB  - The study of the first laboratory generation of isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster, founded by wild flies collected in populations of various geographical origins, has shown that virgin females differ in their capacity to control egg deposition.  This capacity to delay the ovulation process when no sexual partner is available is genetically determined.  The present study shows that the frequency distribution of the various phenotypes varies progressively along a latitudinal cline from Afrotropical to European regions, or from neotropical to nearctic areas, while a few oriental populations appear off the cline.  This variation in initial retention capacity, added to a similar variation in number of ovarioles conditioning a potential increase in fecundity for mated flies, induces variation in reactivity to insemination which may be an adaptation to a variable environment.  Moreover, similar study of F1 virgin females from isofemale lines founded by wild flies collected in Spring, Summer and Autumn in two French populations over ten successive years revealed that seasonal genetic variations occur in this capacity to postpone egg-laying in case of non-insemination.  The frequency of the different phenotypes follows cyclical seasonal variations.  Long retention phenotypes are more frequent in Spring and Autumn samples, whereas short retention phenotypes, closer to the ancestral African type, are more common in Summer generations.  This balancing selection temporarily modifies the genetic equilibrium of the population, enhancing its competitive ability.  Temperature appears to be the primordial selective factor both in geographical and in seasonal variations.

AB  - Rock phosphate is the fundamental component for the manufacture of phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizers. The aim of this study is to predict how sample preparation of Kef Essennoun phosphate responds to heat treatment and to estimate the purity of the raw and calcined phosphates. The influence of temperature (600-900 degrees C) was evaluated. The evolution of thermal treatment and the characterization of the Kef Essennoun ore (Djebel Onk mine, Algeria) were carried out by various analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the raw phosphate is a mixture of six phases, of which carbonate hydroxyapatite [Ca-10(PO4)(3)(CO3)(3)(OH)(2)] is the dominant phase. With heat treatment, at 700 degrees C, a fluorapatite [Ca-5(PO4)(3)F] phase appeared, as confirmed by XRD analysis, with good crystallization indicated by SEM. The P(2)O(5)content was increased from 28.389% in raw phosphate to 31.085% in the calcined product. The dissolution of the calcined phosphate at 900 degrees C was completed by HNO(3)acid attack, and occurred rapidly at ambient temperature. The results show that the production of phosphoric acid by Ca-5(PO4)(3)F was more easily achieved with optimized consumption of the acid attack.

AB  - In many exploited marine fish species, older individuals within cohorts often have slower growth rates at age than their younger counterparts, a process generally attributed to fishing. However, environmental changes might also contribute to the selective disappearance of faster growing individuals because of the increasing constraints acting on growth in suboptimal environments. Using otoliths of anchovy and sardine collected each year in spring since 2000 in the Bay of Biscay, we measured individuals? growth during age-0 and catch-up growth during age-1, and followed their changes in time from 2000 to 2018 to quantify the magnitude of selective mortality. We then determined whether the variations in growth and selective mortality were related to seasonal temperature, food quantity, stock biomass or stock harvest rate. In both species, there was a decline in growth during age 0 over time and a catch-up growth declined in anchovy. Density-dependence had a strong effect on growth in anchovy. In both species, there was a systematic selective disappearance of individuals with large growth at age-0 within each cohort and selection has changed over time to favour individuals with large catch-up growth in anchovy. Moreover, diversifying selection occurred for growth at age-0 in both species and catch-up growth in anchovy. In anchovy, years with high selective disappearance of large individuals, high catchup growth and high diversifying selection were those in which the harvest rates were high (environmental variables having more limited effect). In sardine, the selective disappearance of large individuals was stronger in years with low food quantity and the magnitude of selection acting on growth was unrelated to this stock?s harvest rate. Though fishing exerted strong selection pressure in anchovy, selective mortality against large growth still occurred even at low harvest rates in both species, suggesting that this might be a natural process affecting these small pelagic forage fish species. Although anchovy and sardine have a similar trophic position, their selection regimes differed due to differences in their stock dynamics, environmental sensitivity, and fishing rate. It might therefore be hazardous to extrapolate the responses of single species to environmental and anthropogenic factors onto others.

AB  - Under global change scenarios, multistress conditions may occur regularly and require adaptation. However, the adaptation to one stressor might be associated with the increased sensitivity to another stressor. Here, we investigated the ecological consequences of such trade-off under multiple stress. We compared the pesticide tolerance of the crustacean Gammarus pulex from agricultural streams with populations from reference streams. Under optimum temperature, G. pulex from agricultural streams were considerably more tolerant to pesticides as compared to the reference populations. Here, we assume that the increased tolerance in agricultural populations is the combination of acclimation, epigenetic effect, and genetic evolution. After experimental pre-exposure to very low concentration (LC50/1000), reference populations showed increased pesticide tolerance. In contrast, pre-exposure did not further increase the tolerance of agricultural populations. Moreover, these populations were more sensitive to elevated temperature alone due to the hypothesized fitness cost of genetic adaptation to pesticides. However, both reference and agricultural populations showed a similar tolerance to the combined stress of pesticides and warming due to stronger synergistic effects in adapted populations. As a result, pesticide adaptation loses its advantage. The combined effect was predicted well using the stress addition model, developed for predicting the synergistic interaction of independent stressors. We conclude that under multistress conditions, adaptation to pesticides reduces the general stress capacity of individuals and trade-off processes increase the sensitivity to additional stressors. This causes strong synergistic effects of additional stressors on pesticide-adapted individuals.

AB  - Determination of the optimal operating conditions for large-scale production of carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNTs), mainly carbon nanotubes (CNTs) but also graphene-related materials (GRMs), remains as a major industrial and scientific challenge. For this purpose, our group is conducting an extensive study to evaluate the effect of the reaction conditions and catalyst compositions on the productivity and selectivity to different carbonaceous nanomaterials. In the case of Co-based catalysts, we have found that the promotion with Cu or Mn has a dramatic effect on the type of carbon nanomaterials synthesized. Thus, the presence of Cu promotes the growth of CNTs, while Mn favors the formation of two-dimensional GRMs. In this context, we present here a comprehensive study of the CNTs growth via catalytic decomposition of methane using a Co-Cu/cellulose derived carbon catalyst. The influence of the reaction temperature (650-950 *C) and feed composition (7.1%-42.9% of CH4 and H2) on the yield and CNTs quality was evaluated. A transition in the characteristics of the carbonaceous nanomaterial growth was observed at about 800 *C. Below this temperature, the reaction was selective towards the formation of CNTs, while above 800 *C, the obtained nanomaterial exhibited a graphite-like morphology. In addition, the catalyst deactivation was quite low in the CNTs growth regime, attaining high productivity under 11 h of operation. The model used to study the kinetics of carbon formation allowed understanding the most influential variables in the growth process, revealing the existence of a transition temperature at which there is a change in the preferential path for the formation of CNTs or GRMs. After exploring a large set of reaction conditions, the best operating parameters for growing CNTs with high productivity (0.29 gC/gcat.h) and quality (ID/IG = 1.10, I2D/IG = 0.13) were found at 750 degrees C under 28.6% CH4:14.3% H2:57.1% N2.

AB  - Variable blank holder force (VBHF) that the blank holder force varies through the stroke is recognized as one of the advanced manufacturing technologies for sheet metal forming. On the other hand, slide velocity (SV) that controls the die velocity is rarely discussed in the literature. In particular, variable SV (VSV) that the SV varies through the forming process is an attractive forming technique for improving the product quality and the productivity. This paper proposes a practical approach of optimization of VBHF and VSV trajectory for sheet forming. First, based on the experimental result, the finite element analysis model is developed. Then, a multi-objective design optimization considering the product quality and the productivity is performed. A sequential approximate optimization that response surface is repeatedly constructed and optimized is adopted to identify the pareto-frontier. Three points on the pareto-frontier are selected, and the experiment using the servo press (H1F200-2, Komatsu Industries, Corp.) is conducted. Through the comparison of numerical and experimental results, the validity of the proposed approach is examined.

AB  - Heavy metal ions contamination, a threat to ecological balance, aquatic life, and human health, co-exists in water bodies and soil systems such as mining sites, tanneries, petrochemical refineries, pesticide, fertilizer, construction, chemical industries, and others. In this study, raw rice husk and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activated novel rice husk (RH)-based adsorbents: potassium hydroxide (KOH) activated RH (KOH-RH), KOH activated RH hydrochar (KOH-RHH), and KOH activated silver (Ag) nanoparticle modified RH (AgNP-KOH-RH) were synthesized and applied on synthetic wastewater to treat hazardous heavy metal ions, Cu2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ through fixed-bed flow column adsorption. Maximum Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ uptake was obtained 7.14 mg/g, 9.02 mg/g and 8.53 mg/g, respectively by KOH-RHH. The maximum Fe3+ and Mn2+ uptake was 1.66 mg/g and 0.98 mg/g, respectively by AgNP-KOH-RH. After 1st run of adsorption, the adsorbents were recovered and reused for 2nd adsorption run. Maximum Cu2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ uptake was 11.98 mg/g, 9.46 mg/g, 1.29 mg/g, 19.55 mg/g and 14.58 mg/g, respectively obtained by KOH-RHH at 2nd adsorption run. AgNP-KOH-RH obtained the minimum retention time for adsorption and maximum color removal for both runs. Compared with commercial adsorbents such as coconut shell activated carbon, higher heavy metal ions adsorption capacity (>90%) and color removal have been obtained with both KOH-RHH and AgNP-KOH-RH. The adsorption kinetics was well fitted into the intra-particle diffusion (IPD) kinetics model. The detailed characterization of the adsorbents such as surface area, porosity, and surface morphology was conducted for deriving the mechanism. It can be stated that the significant adsorption capacity of heavy metals and color by KOH-RHH and AgNP-KOH-RH with repetitive adsorption runs will provide new insight into adsorption mechanisms and the development of next-generation commercial adsorbents for industrial wastewater treatment.

AB  - Ne-(2-furoylmethyl)-l-lysine (furosine) is well-known indicator of early stage of Maillard reaction in processed food. Yet the toxicological aspects associated with its exposure remain rarely studied. Here, we investigated the effects of furosine exposure on cell viability, DNA damage, and its mutagenic potential by using MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide), TUNEL assay (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling assay), and Ames assay techniques on human cell lines, i.e., liver HepG-2, kidney Hek-293, neuronal SK-N-SH, and intestinal Caco-2, respectively. Our results showed that kidney Hek-293 cell line was the most sensitive to furosine exposure as significant reduction in cell viability and induction of DNA damage were observed at 50 mg/L concentration. In contrast, intestinal Caco-2 cell lines showed resistance to furosine exposure as DNA damage was only observed at 800 mg/L concentration of furosine. Ames assay indicated that furosine has no mutagenic effects on TA 100 and TA 1535 strains. Hence, this study suggests that furosine is a strong toxicant for kidney cells.

AB  - Gas hydrates stored in the continental margins of the world's oceans represent the largest global reservoirs of methane. Determining the source and history of methane from gas hydrate deposits informs the viability of sites as energy resources, and potential hazards from hydrate dissociation or intense methane degassing from ocean warming. Stable isotope ratios of methane (C-13/C-12, D/H) and the molecular ratio of methane over ethane plus propane (C1/C2+3) have traditionally been applied to infer methane sources, but often yield ambiguous results when two or more sources are mixed, or when compositions were altered by physical (e.g., diffusion) or microbial (e.g., methanotrophy) processes. We measured the abundance of clumped methane isotopologue (13CH3D) alongside 13C/12C and D/H of methane, and C1/C2+3 for 46 submarine gas hydrate specimens and associated vent gases from 11 regions of the world's oceans. These samples are associated with different seafloor seepage features (oil seeps, pockmarks, mud volcanoes, and other cold seeps). The average apparent equilibration temperatures of methane from the D13CH3D (the excess abundance of 13CH3D relative to the stochastic distribution) geothermometer increase from cold seeps (15-65 & DEG;C) and pockmarks (36-54 ?), to oil-associated gas hydrates (48-120 & DEG;C). These apparent temperatures are consistent with, or a few tens of degrees higher than, the temperature expected for putative microbial methane sources. Apparent methane generation depths were derived for cold seep, pockmark, and oil seep methane from isotopologue-based temperatures and the local geothermal gradients. Estimated methane generation depths ranged from 0.2 to 5.3 kmbsf, and are largely consistent with source rock information, and other chemical geothermometers based on clay mineralogy and fluid chemistry (e.g., Cl, B, and Li). Methane associated with mud volcanoes yielded a wide range of apparent temperatures (15-313 & DEG;C). Gas hydrates from mud volcanoes the Kumano Basin and Mediterranean Sea yielded 813C-CH4 values from-36.9 to-51.0%, typical for thermogenic sources. D13CH3D values (3.8-6.0%) from these sites, however, are consistent with prevailing microbial sources. These mud volcanoes are located at active convergent plate margins, where hydrogen may be supplied from basement rocks, and fuel methanogenesis to the point of substrate depletion. In contrast, gas hydrate from mud volcanoes located on km-thick sediments in tectonically less active or passive settings (Black Sea, North Atlantic) yielded microbial-like 813C-CH4 and C1/C2+3 values, and low D13CH3D values (1.6-3.3%), which may be due to kinetic isotope effects. Additionally, using samples from two sites, we found that D13CH3D values of hydrate-bound gas and vent gas agree within measurement error. This study is the first to document the link between methane isotopologue-based temperature estimates and key submarine gas hydrate seepage features, and validate previous models about their geologic driving forces.

AB  - A modified Response Surface Methodology was used for the optimization of lipase production by immobilized cells of Rhizopus oryzae (ATCC 96382). Multiple responses optimization strategy was adopted to optimize process condition of surface immobilization technique for the optimization of lipase productivity. Five parameters, pH, Temperature, revolutions per minute, olive oil and glucose were considered, and their effect was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively by using a modified central composite design approach and model validation. The second order regression equation was developed for the three yield parameters are Y-P/B, Y-L/P and Y-L/B, where Y is the yield parameter at their corresponding values of L: Lipase (U/mL), P: Protein (mg/mL) and B: Biomass (mg/mL). The regression equation was fitted and model fit (R-2) was 0.604 (Y-P/B), 0.746 (Y-L/P) and 0.618 (Y-L/B), respectively showing an effective fit. Further, the model was validated theoretically and experimentally at higher level of production. Different growth patterns were observed during 120 h of fermentation period.

AB  - The objective of this work was to identify potato characteristics that have higher adaptation stability for important agronomic characteristics for the contrasting autumn and spring climatic conditions of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The tuber characteristics evaluated were maturity, average number of tuber plant yield, texture, tuber shape, depth of eyes and general appearance. Reduced tuber quality and yield were observed in the autumn crop compared to the spring, due to variations in temperature, radiation and photoperiod. Coefficient of variation were higher in the autumn, in particular for plant yield, average number of tubers, texture and general appearance. Correlation coefficients were moderately high and significant (r < 0,80) for texture, tuber shape and depth of eyes, and low (r < 0,40) for maturity, number of tubers, plant yield and general appearance. The results of this study showed that the characteristics and population studied, the plant productivity and number of tubers are not constant parameters comparing crops in contrasting climates. Characteristics such as texture, tuber shape and depth of eyes can be selected with high intensities, based on their high stability. Selection based on tuber general appearance may be more intense in the spring, when the quality and productivity parameters are maximized.

AB  - Many studies have examined the impact of climatic variability on agricultural productivity, although an understanding of these effects on farmland values and their relationship to farmers' decisions to adapt and modify their land-use practices remains nascent in developing nations. We estimated the impacts of the deviation in our study year's (2012) temperature and precipitation patterns from medium-term (1980-2011) climatic patterns on farmland values in Pakistan. This was accomplished by employing a modified form of a Ricardian regression model. We also examined farmers' perceptions of climate change during this period, as well as their perceptions of climate change impacts on farm productivity, in addition to past and anticipated farm adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that positive temperature deviation from the medium-term mean - indicative of climatic change - affects farmland values in Pakistan. Deviation in annual cumulative precipitation conversely appears to have no significant impact. Estimates of the marginal impact of temperature deviation suggested a slight but negative linear relationship with farmland values. The location of farms in areas where farmers can avail financial or extension services conversely had a positive impact on farmland values, as did the availability of irrigation facilities. Our analysis of farmers' perceptions of climate change and their consequent adaptation behavior indicated a relatively high degree of awareness of climatic variability that influenced a number of proactive and future anticipated farm adaptation strategies. Examples included increased use of irrigation and farm enterprise diversification, as well as land-use change, including shifting from agriculture into alternative land uses. National policy in Pakistan underscores the importance of maintaining a productive rural agricultural sector. Our findings consequently highlight the importance of appropriate adaptation strategies to maintain both farm productivity and farmland values in much of Pakistan. The implications of increased extension and financial services to enhance farmers' potential for climate change adaptation are discussed.

AB  - Genetic studies on cold tolerance at the reproductive stage in rice could lead to significant reductions in yield losses. However, knowledge about the genetic basis and adaptive differentiation, as well as the evolution and utilization of the underlying natural alleles, remains limited. Here, 580 rice accessions in two association panels were used to perform genome-wide association study, and 156 loci associated with cold tolerance at the reproductive stage were identified.Os01g0923600andOs01g0923800were identified as promising candidate genes inqCTB1t, a major associated locus. Through population genetic analyses, 22 and 29 divergent regions controlling cold adaptive differentiation inter-subspecies (Xian/IndicaandGeng/Japonica) and intra-Geng,respectively, were identified. Joint analyses of four cloned cold-tolerance genes showed that they had different origins and utilizations under various climatic conditions.bZIP73andOsAPX1differentiating inter-subspecies evolved directly from wild rice, whereas the novel mutationsCTB4aandCtb1arose inGengduring adaptation to colder climates. The cold-tolerantGengaccessions have undergone stronger selection under colder climate conditions than other accessions during the domestication and breeding processes. Additive effects of dominant allelic variants of four identified genes have been important in adaptation to cold in modern rice varieties. Therefore, this study provides valuable information for further gene discovery and pyramiding breeding to improve cold tolerance at the reproductive stage in rice.

AB  - Annual plasticulture strawberry production has not been adopted as rapidly in cold climate regions as has occurred in warmer production areas due to uncertainty about potential benefits. Recent trials have demonstrated the potential of regionally adapted varieties in the annual plasticulture system in cold regions, but optimal production practices have not been determined. Summer planting of short-day varieties in these areas would increase flexibility for growers, allowing additional cropping options and improved land use management. The performance of six short-day strawberry varieties (Chandler, Clancy, Jewel, Ovation, Seneca and Ventana) was examined in a series of four annual production trials using cold-stored bare-root crowns for spring planting or a new type of planting stock termed a 'crown plug' for two summer plantings. Procedures for producing crown plugs from cold-stored crowns are described. The crown plug summer plantings significantly outperformed the spring planted bare-root plants across all varieties. The July planting established using crown plugs had higher yield and higher mean berry weight across all six varieties compared to the May bare-root planting (623 g/plant-12.5 g mean fruit weight vs. 330 g/plant-10.6 g mean fruit weight, respectively). In the July planting, 'Seneca', 'Ventana' and 'Jewel' exceeded the mean yield per plant for the planting as a whole and the other three varieties also produced more than previously reported for the May planting established with bare-root plants. The August crown plug planting was less productive than the July planting (623 g/plant vs. 498 g/plant, respectively) but was still more productive than both spring plantings. No difference was observed between the April and May plantings across the six varieties. Utilizing crown plugs also reduced the duration of weed control measures needed, improved efficiency of setting plants and limited the need for blossom and runner removal in the field, thus demonstrating labor cost savings that can offset the cost of crown plug production while also producing higher overall yield and mean fruit weight in the varieties in the trial. The summer plantings established with crown plugs demonstrated improved survival through a second winter dormancy period but produced relatively poor yield and berry size in the second harvest season. Crown plugs provide flexibility and improved productivity for growers utilizing annual plasticulture production in cold climate regions.

AB  - The pattern and intensity of pigmentation have direct impact on individual fitness through various ecological factors. In a Drosophila melanogaster population from southern Japan, thoracic trident pigmentation intensity of most of the strains could be classified into Dark or Light-type. The expression level variation of the ebony gene correlated well with this phenotype and the allelic differences in expression indicated that the variation is partly due to cis-regulatory changes. In the similar to 13 kb gene region, we identified 17 nucleotide sites and 2 indels that were in complete association with the thoracic trident pigmentation intensity. Interestingly, 11 out of 19 sites located within similar to 0.5 kb of the core epidermis enhancer. These sites had no obvious association with the abdominal pigmentation intensity in the previously analysed African populations from Uganda and Kenya, which suggested that multiple potential mutational pathways in the cis-regulatory control region of a single gene could lead to similar phenotypic variation within this species. We also found that the Light-type enhancer haplotype is strongly linked to a cosmopolitan inversion, In(3R)Payne, which is predominant in warmer climatic regions in both hemispheres. The sequence pattern suggested that the strong linkage may be due to selective forces related to thermal adaptation. The inferred selection for lighter pigmentation in the Japanese population is in the opposite direction of the previously reported case of selection for darker individuals in African populations. Nevertheless, both adaptive changes involved cis-regulatory changes of ebony, which shows that this gene is likely to be a common target of natural selection.

AB  - RNA sequencing is a popular next-generation sequencing technique for assaying genome-wide gene expression profiles. Nonetheless, it is susceptible to biases that are introduced by sample handling prior gene expression measurements. Two of the most common methods for preserving samples in both field-based and laboratory conditions are submersion in RNAlater and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Flash freezing in liquid nitrogen can be impractical, particularly for field collections. RNAlater is a solution for stabilizing tissue for longer-term storage as it rapidly permeates tissue to protect cellular RNA. In this study, we assessed genome-wide expression patterns in 30-day-old fry collected from the same brood at the same time point that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 degrees C or submerged and stored in RNAlater at room temperature, simulating conditions of fieldwork. We show that sample storage is a significant factor influencing observed differential gene expression. In particular, genes with elevated GC content exhibit higher observed expression levels in liquid nitrogen flash-freezing relative to RNAlater storage. Further, genes with higher expression in RNAlater relative to liquid nitrogen experience disproportionate enrichment for functional categories, many of which are involved in RNA processing. This suggests that RNAlater may elicit a physiological response that has the potential to bias biological interpretations of expression studies. The biases introduced to observed gene expression arising from mimicking many field-based studies are substantial and should not be ignored.

AB  - With reference to an integrated photovoltaic battery (PV-BES) system for grid-connected end users, a feed-in tariff scheme is discussed in this article. This scheme solely rewards self-consumption. Zero is the generation price paid for the generated renewable energy, and zero is the export price paid for the renewable energy delivered to the grid. This feed-in tariff scheme, referred to as S-FIT, also excludes the net-metering service and the possibility that the grid recharges or discharges the batteries.
   To calculate the incentive tariff, an optimization problem is adopted. The problem returns the minimum value of the tariff so that the subsidy given to the end user is equal to the difference between the instalments paid for the integrated PV-BES system and the savings obtained from the electricity bill. The period during which the end user has secured this grant is ten years.
   The S-FIT scheme is applied to the case of the Italian Public Administration from 2011 to 2015. Consequently, the real values of temperature, irradiation, and energy consumption are measured every 15 min, and the real electricity prices over the period 2011-2015 are considered. The optimal solution returned by the optimization problem allows for a significant reduction of the electricity bill by 49.56%; moreover, the self-produced energy is equal to at least 50%, whereas the self-consumed energy is equal to at least 80%.
   The optimal solution that is calculated using 2011 data is applied for 2012-2015. Although the electricity prices were subject to a radical change during this period, the optimal solution still allows for a significant reduction of the electricity bill; in particular, this reduction is equal to 44.98% when the PV-BES system is adopted, whereas it is equal to 33.65% when only the PV system is adopted. In both cases, the optimal solution ensures self-produced energy of at least 50% and self-consumed energy of at least 80%.
   This article ends with an assessment of the impact of the integrated PV-BES system on the load profile from the grid perspective and the satisfactory degree of self-sufficiency achieved by the end user. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmospheric layers from the upper convection zone to the lower corona, we investigate the self-consistent excitation of slow magneto-acoustic body waves (slow modes) in a magnetic flux concentration. We find that the convective downdrafts in the close surroundings of a two-dimensional flux slab "pump" the plasma inside it in the downward direction. This action produces a downflow inside the flux slab, which encompasses ever higher layers, causing an upwardly propagating rarefaction wave. The slow mode, excited by the adiabatic compression of the downflow near the optical surface, travels along the magnetic field in the upward direction at the tube speed. It develops into a shock wave at chromospheric heights, where it dissipates, lifts the transition region, and produces an offspring in the form of a compressive wave that propagates further into the corona. In the wake of downflows and propagating shock waves, the atmosphere inside the flux slab in the chromosphere and higher tends to oscillate with a period of nu approximate to 4 mHz. We conclude that this process of "magnetic pumping" is a most plausible mechanism for the direct generation of longitudinal chromospheric and coronal compressive waves within magnetic flux concentrations, and it may provide an important heat source in the chromosphere. It may also be responsible for certain types of dynamic fibrils.

AB  - The issue of climatic change and its strong influence on species distributions is currently of great interest in the field of biogeography. In this study, three varieties of Stipa tianschanica (S. tianschanica var. tianschanica, S. tianschanica var. gobica and S. tianschanica var. klemenzii), which are high-quality forage for local rangeland, were selected from the desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau and Central Asia. Based on high-resolution environmental data for past, current and future climate scenarios, we modelled the suitable habitat in 6 periods for S. tianschanica var. tianschanica, S. tianschanica var. gobica and S. tianschanica var. klemenzii using MaxEnt and GIS technology; evaluated the importance of environmental factors in shaping their distribution; and identified distribution shifts under different climate change scenarios. Our results showed that temperature seasonality (bio04) and precipitation in October and November (pre10, pre11) were the most critical factors shaping the distribution of S. tianschanica var. tianschanica, while precipitation in June, August and December (pre06, pre08 and pre12) were the most critical for shaping the distributions of S. tianschanica var. gobica and S. tianschanica var. klemenzii. The suitable future habitat for the three species tended to increase under the RCP2.6 scenario and to decrease to varying degrees in the desert steppe in the RCP8.5 scenario in 2070 as global warming intensified. Overall, the size of the core distribution area and direction of the core distributional shifts are different for each species over the 6 periods. Our prediction showed that although these three varieties belong to the same species, their survival strategy and adaptability are different when faced with the same climate change scenarios. The projected spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution range shifts for S. tianschanica var. tianschanica, S. tianschanica var. gobica and S. tianschanica var. klemenzii will be useful references in developing desert steppe management and conservation strategies for these three ecologically important varieties.

AB  - We report the result of H2O-undersaturated melting experiments on charges consisting of a layer of powdered sillimanite-bearing metapelite (HQ36) and a layer of powdered tonalitic gneiss (AGC150). Experiments were conducted at 10 kbar at 900-degrees, 925-degrees and 950-degrees-C. When run alone, the pelite yielded approximately 40 vol% strongly peraluminous granitic melt at 900-degrees-C while the tonalite produced only approximately 5 vol% weakly peraluminous granitic melt. At 950-degrees-C, the pelite and the tonalite yielded approximately 50 vol% and approximately 7 vol% granitic melt, respectively. When run side by side, the abundance of melt in the tonalite was approximately 10 times higher at all temperatures than when it was run alone. In the pelite, the melt abundance increased by approximately 25 vol%. When run alone, biotite dehydration-melting in the tonalite yielded orthopyroxene and garnet in addition to granitic melt. When run side by side only garnet was produced in addition to granitic melt. Experiments of relatively short duration, however, also contained Al-rich orthopyroxene. We suggest that the large increase in melt fraction in the tonalite is mainly a result of increased activity of Al2O3 in the melt, which lowers the temperature of the biotite dehydration-melting reaction. In the pelite, the increase in the abundance of melt is caused by transport of plagioclase component in the melt from the tonalite-layer to the pelite-layer. This has the effect of changing the bulk composition of this layer in the direction of ''minimum-temperature'' granitic liquids. Our results show that rocks which are poor melt-producers on their own can become very fertile if they occur in contact with rocks that contain components that destabilize the hydrous phase(s) and facilitate dehydration-melting. Because of this effect, the continental crust may have an even greater potential for granitoid melt production than previously thought. Our results also suggest that many anatectic granites most likely contain contributions from two or more different source rocks, which will be reflected in their isotopic and geochemical compositions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the impacts of anthropogenic activity on the health status of intertidal clam populations of the Saguenay Fjord and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada). Clams were collected during low We at sites subject to direct contamination and at sites far from human activity. Clams were analyzed for tributyltin and dibutyltin total levels and toxic stress (glutathione S-transferase, gonadal lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks), immunocompetence (phagocytic activity, hemocyte count and viability), reproduction (gonado-somatic index, gamete maturation, and vitellogenin-like proteins), energy status (temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport, and gonad lipids), and individual status (age, condition factor, and growth index). These responses were compared against population characteristics such as live clam density, number of empty shells, and sex ratio. The results show that clam density decreased with distance from the estuary (high salinity level) to upstream of the fjord (low salinity). There was no clear relationship between the number of empty shells and distance or site quality. Clam density values corrected against distance were significantly correlated with hemocyte viability, phagocytic activity, mitochondrial electron transport (MET), DNA damage in gonad, and temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity. A canonical analysis of the various groups of biomarkers revealed that population metrics were more strongly related with immunocompetence, followed by energy status and temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity. However, toxic stress biomarkers were strongly associated with energy status and reproduction. This was further confirmed by non-linear modeling using adaptive artificial neural networks (genetic selection and back propagation learning paradigms), where the following parameters were able to predict population parameters with <20% error: gonad maturation and somatic index, MET (at 4 degrees C), gonad LPO, DNA damage, and phagocytic capacity. Intertidal clam populations were influenced by a distance gradient effect (salinity), where immunocompetence, in addition to energy status, was the strongest physiological parameter related to clam population metrics.

AB  - Extreme Temperature Events (ETEs), including heatwaves, warm spells, cold waves and cold spells, have disastrous impacts on human health and ecosystems. The frequency, intensity, and duration of ETEs is projected to increase due to climate change. However, very little research has been done on ETEs in South Africa, and only a few attempts have been made to identify and examine trends. Currently, ten known publications have examined ETEs across South Africa, the majority of which use the South African Weather Service (SAWS) climate database as the primary source. The general findings indicate that the incidence and duration of extreme warm temperatures are increasing, while cold extremes are decreasing. However, inconstancies exist in the indices used to identify ETEs, selection of meteorological stations, study period, and statistical methods used to examine trends. We review the methodological approaches to define ETEs, the extreme temperature indices adopted, the selection of meteorological stations, study periods, data quality and homogeneity, statistical trend analysis, and results. From these, we propose an approximate number of stations to adequately portray temperature variability on a national and regional level. Finally, we reflect on projections of ETEs under current climate change conditions, and the implications of cold and warm ETEs in a South African context.

AB  - Lag is a temporary period of nonreplication seen in bacteria that are introduced to new media. Despite latency being described by Muller in 1895, only recently have we gained insights into the cellular processes characterizing lag phase. This review covers literature to date on the transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, physiological, biochemical, and evolutionary features of prokaryotic lag. Though lag is commonly described as a preparative phase that allows bacteria to harvest nutrients and adapt to new environments, the implications of recent studies indicate that a refinement of this view is well deserved. As shown, lag is a dynamic, organized, adaptive, and evolvable process that protects bacteria from threats, promotes reproductive fitness, and is broadly relevant to the study of bacterial evolution, host-pathogen interactions, antibiotic tolerance, environmental biology, molecular microbiology, and food safety.

AB  - We describe a hot-air treatment device to be used in quarantine research to disinfest fruits of pests.  The device consists of instruments mounted to a 1.905 cm thick plywood structure (1.2 m long by 1.2 m wide by 2.44 m high) with an insulated door.  Relays, fuses, heater, fan, steam generator, airflow meter, dew-point sampling system, and thermocouple wires are connected to electricity and to each other through a main power panel and to a computer.  The software used controlled air at precise dry-bulb and dew-point temperatures for selected time durations to prevent condensation on fruit surfaces and fruit desiccation.  Air mass flow rate was adjustable with a variable speed control.  When 'Keitt' mangoes infested with Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew), larvae were treated with air at 51.67-degrees-C for 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min, mortality was 20, 45, 79, 96, 100, and 100%, respectively.  The estimated treatment time for 99.9968% mortality was 101 min (85-131 min, 95% FL).

AB  - The Cu-CHA zeolite today represents an attractive platform to design catalysts for deNO(x) applications by NH3-assisted selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) and for the low-temperature selective oxidation of methane to methanol (MTM). Accessing a quantitative understanding of Cu-speciation in this material is a key step to unveil structure-performance relationships for these high-impact processes. Herein, we select Cu-CHA as a case study to demonstrate the potential of chemometric approaches, such as multivariate curve resolution (MCR) applied in combination with principal component analysis (PCA). We employ these methods to assist the interpretation of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments in the near-edge (XANES) region, determining the spectroscopic signatures and concentration profiles of the pure Cu-species formed. We pinpoint the composition impact on the material reducibility and highlight Cu-speciation-productivity relationships for the MTM process. Furthermore, we report novel insights on the formation of O-2-derived species in Cu-CHA, obtained from MCR analysis of high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XANES data collected during thermal treatment of Cu-CHA in both He and O-2 gas flow. Multivariate analysis, in combination with the superior energy resolution adopted, allows us to identify an additional Cu(II) species. This component, different from the previously characterized Z[Cu(II)OH] moiety, is only formed at significant concentrations in O-2 and it is envisaged to play an important role in the MTM conversion.

AB  - Pseudotaxus chienii, a rare tertiary relict species with economic and ecological value, is a representative of the monotypic genusPseudotaxusthat is endemic to China.P. chieniican adapt well to habitat isolation and ecological heterogeneity under a variety of climate and soil conditions, and is able to survive in harsh environments. However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs ofP. chieniiusing the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms. Based on the PacBio Iso-Seq data, we obtained 44,896, 58,082, 50,485, and 67,638 full-length unigenes from the root, stem, leaf, and strobilus, respectively, with a mean length of 2692 bp, and a mean N50 length of 3010.75 bp. We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters. The gene families related to biotic/abiotic factors, including the TPS, CYP450, and HSP families, were characterized. The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs ofP. chienii. Our findings will facilitate further studies on the functional genomics, adaptive evolution, and phylogeny ofP. chienii, and lay the foundation for the development of conservation strategies for this endangered conifer.

AB  - Diseases caused by the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini and the minute intestinal fluke. Haplorchis taichui, are clinically important, especially in the Northeast and North regions of Thailand. It is often difficult to distinguish between these trematode species using morphological methods due to the similarity of their eggs and larval stages both in mixed and co-infections. A sensitive, accurate, and specific detection method of these flukes is required for an effective epidemiological control program. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of O. viverrini and H. taichui infections in human feces by using formalin-ether sedimentation and high annealing temperature random amplified polymorphic DNA (HAT-RAPD) PCR methods. Fecal specimens of people living along the Mae Ping River, Chomtong district were examined seasonally for trematode eggs using a compound microscope. Positive cases were analyzed in FIAT-RAPD, DNA profiles were compared with adult stages to determine the actual species infected, and specific DNA markers of each fluke were also screened. Our results showed that out of 316 specimens, 62 were positive for fluke eggs which were pre-identified as O. viverrini and H. taichui. In addition, co-infection among these two fluke species was observed from only two specimens. The prevalence of H. taichui infections peaked in the hot-dry (19.62%), gradually decreased in the rainy (18.18%), and cool-dry seasons (14.54%), respectively. O. viverrini was found only in the hot-dry season (6.54%). For molecular studies, 5 arbitrary primers (Operon Technologies, USA) were individually performed in HAT-RAPD-PCR for the generation of polymorphic DNA profiles. The DNA profiles in all 62 positives cases were the same as those of the adult stage which confirmed our identifications. This study demonstrates the mixed infection of O. viverrini and H. taichui and confirms the extended distribution of O. viverrini in Northern Thailand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Supercooling point (SCP), survival at low temperatures, rate of water loss in dry air at 20degreesC and survival under desiccating conditions of eggs of Polydesmus angustus (Diplopoda) were determined. The results were compared with those obtained previously for the eight post-embryonic stadia, to obtain an overview of the changes in resistance to cold and desiccation throughout the species' development. The SCP temperatures of egg batches ranged from -14.8 to -30.6degrees C and were significantly lower than those of the active stadia. Eggs were not affected by prolonged exposure to low temperature above 0degreesC and survived much better than active stadia when cooled to -6 and -10degreesC. This indicates that the cold hardiness of P. angustus is highest in the egg stage and decreases during development. On the other hand, the rate of water loss was significantly higher from eggs than from active stadia. When eggs were taken out of their protective nest, they lost water at the high rate of 7% min(-1) in dry air. They also survived for a shorter time than active stadia at 76% RH and 20degreesC. The resistance to desiccation of P. angustus is lowest at the egg stage and increases during development. The results suggest that the life cycle of P. angustus may have responded to selection pressures other than cold and drought, and do not support the hypothesis that cold hardiness and resistance to desiccation are overlapping adaptations in terrestrial arthropods.

AB  - Gassing in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is a serious challenge, especially at high voltage and elevated temperature. In this study, we use On-line Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (OEMS) and a two-compartment cell with a newly developed aluminum edge-seal to elucidate the origin of H-2 evolution in LIBs. We demonstrate that the new sealing is entirely impermeable for gaseous and liquid species, thus allowing us to measure the true H-2 evolution from H2O reduction at a graphite electrode, without interference from the lithium counter-electrode. We further report that graphite//NMC full-cells without any diffusion barrier between anode and cathode show enhanced H-2 generation, especially for high charging potentials and at elevated temperature. We propose that the diffusion of protic electrolyte oxidation species (R-H+) from the cathode to the anode and their subsequent reduction is the origin of enhanced H-2 gassing. To prove this hypothesis, methanesulfonic acid is added to the electrolyte as a chemical source of protons. At the negative graphite electrode, all H+ can be quantitatively reduced to H-2. By the use of the electrolyte additives vinylene carbonate (VC) and lithium bis(oxalato) borate (LiBOB), less H-2 evolution is observed, since the reduction of both H2O and R-H+ is hindered by a more effective SEI on graphite. Finally, we demonstrate that the Al-sealed diffusion barrier between anode and cathode can stop the diffusion of oxidation products to the anode and therefore essentially eliminates the generation of H-2 caused by high cathode potentials.

AB  - Background & obiectives: Temperature plays a significant role in insect's development where a rise in temperature, accelerates the insect's metabolic rates, increases egg production and makes blood feeding more frequent. It also shortens the time period required for the development of pathogens within insects. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the most important vector-borne diseases transmitted by different sandfly species. In this study, a phenological model was used to estimate the number of generations, peak activity and temporal variability of sandflies in the main VL foci in northwest Iran.
   Methods: Development requirements of different life stages of a Phlebotomus papatasi laboratory colony were measured and were subjected to the formula for calculation of accumulated degree day (ADD) for field sandflies using the online soft (UC IPM), using horizontal cut-off method and single triangle model. Sandflies population dynamics was monitored in the field during the seasonal activity in the region and its association with the ADD was tested using SAS software.
   Results: Populations of sandflies accommodated well with the amount of accumulated degree days (ADD) in the region. During the seasonal activity, a total of 639 ADD were produced which was enough to support one complete life cycle and growth of the next generation up to late larval instar. Larvae of the second generation hibernate through winter and the first adult population appears in the mid to late June of the next year when they receive at least 182 ADD from the beginning of the spring. The highest population density of sandflies was observed in early August, followed by a rapid decrease in early September, with the adult population disappearing completely in late September. This is the first degree day model related to sandflies in the most important VL foci of Iran.
   Interpretation & conclusion: Further studies in various regions with variable climate are recommended in order to better estimate and understand the development time, population dynamics and activities of the vectors which in turn Could be used in proper implementation of effective vector control programmes.

AB  - In seasonally variable environments, phenotypic plasticity in phenology may be critical for adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions. Using an 18-generation longitudinal dataset from natural damselfly populations, we show that phenology has strongly advanced. Individual fitness data suggest this is likely an adaptive response towards a temperature-dependent optimum. A laboratory experiment revealed that developmental plasticity qualitatively matches the temperature dependence of selection, partially explaining observed advance in phenology. Expanding our analysis to the macroevolutionary level, we use a database of over 1-million occurrence records and spatiotemporally matched temperature data from 49 Swedish Odonate species to infer macroevolutionary dynamics of phenology. Phenological plasticity was more closely aligned with adaptation for species that have recently colonised northern latitudes, but with higher phenological mismatch at lower latitudes. Our results show that phenological plasticity plays a key role in microevolutionary dynamics within a single species, and such plasticity may have facilitated post-Pleistocene range expansion in this insect clade.

AB  - Revisiting the past 60 yrs of studies of the ecology of fishes on coral reefs reveals successive decadal trends that highlight many lasting contributions relevant to fisheries biology, conservation biology, and ecology in general. The Bulletin of Marine Science was founded in 1951, about the same time SCUBA was first used to study reef fishes, so the 1950s was a decade of initial subtidal exploration by early pioneers. Detailed natural-history investigations of the use of space, food, and time by reef fishes developed in the 1960s, including studies based from undersea habitats late that decade. The 1970s saw the first comprehensive observational studies of reef-fish communities, as well as initial breakthroughs in behavioral ecology, especially regarding cleaning symbiosis, mating systems, and sex reversal. In community ecology, the conventional wisdom that interspecific competition structured reef-fish assemblages via equilibrium dynamics and resource partitioning was called into question by the "lottery hypothesis," which posited that coexistence of ecologically similar species was fostered by nonequilibrial dynamics. The 1980s, in turn, were dominated by debate regarding the relative importance of larval supply vs post-settlement interactions in determining the local abundance and diversity of reef fishes. The "recruitment limitation hypothesis" asserted that larval settlement was so low that subsequent population dynamics were not only unpredictable, but also density-independent. Population and community studies during the 1990s thus focused largely on detecting demographic density dependence in reef-fish populations and identifying the mechanisms underlying this ultimate source of population regulation. From the 1980s to the present, studies of behavioral ecology and interactions between fishes and other reef organisms continued to flourish. Late in the 20th century, it became clear that coral reefs and their fish inhabitants were increasingly threatened, and conservation biology of reef fishes developed as a substantial new subdiscipline. The 2000s comprised the "connectivity" decade as new means of tracking patterns of larval dispersal developed. Knowledge of how larval dispersal connects local populations and/or results in self-recruitment that replenishes a local population is essential for understanding metapopulation dynamics and implementing effective fisheries management and conservation efforts. There is currently a major shift toward conservation biology among many reef-fish ecologists, including studies of the effects of and solutions for overfishing, habitat degradation, invasive species, ocean warming and acidification, and other human-caused environmental challenges. Marine reserves and protected areas are now well documented to be particularly effective at fostering both ecological resilience in general and fisheries sustainability on coral reefs. Future research must necessarily be conservation-based if there are to be any reasonably undisturbed reeffish communities for coming generations of ecologists to study. I personally believe that those of us who have observed the demise of coral reefs first-hand have two major responsibilities: first, conduct basic or applied research indirectly or directly relevant to conservation of reef fishes, and second, speak out as both citizens and scientists to bear witness to these losses, which are largely unseen by the public, and assist managers and policymakers in saving our remaining reefs.

AB  - Biological traits of a prospective candidate for biological control of the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS), Homalodisca coagulata (Say) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), in the United States are herein reported. The mymarid wasp, Gonatocerus tuberculifemur (Ogloblin), is an egg-parasitoid native to Argentina and its first known host is Tapajosa rubromarginata (Signoret), a species related to GWSS. Laboratory studies were made in Tucuman and Buenos Aires Provinces, Argentina. Seven generations were maintained in the laboratory, and only one adult emerged per host egg. The average parasitism rate was 71.6% of total eggs. Although eggs of all ages (4 to 190 h old) were parasitized, wasps did not emerge from eggs over 96 h old. The percentage of wasp emergence was 66.5% from eggs between 4 and 72 h old. Over the seven generations that G. tuberculifemur was reared, the parasitism rate ranged between 55-84%. This percentage of emergence increased as the parasitoid generations progressed. The duration of development from oviposition to adult emergence of G. tuberculifemur was 12.6 +/- 1.8 days (range 11.4-13.0) at 22.5-27.5 degrees C and 70-80% RH. The duration of development was significantly affected by sex and temperature. Males developed faster than females (12.2 vs. 12.8, respectively). The sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1. Average adult longevity was 6.73 +/- 3.93 days fed on honey. Male and female longevity was not significantly different. Oviposition and mating behavior are described.

AB  - Insect sounds dominate the acoustic environment in many natural habitats such as rainforests or meadows on a warm summer day. Among acoustic insects, usually males are the calling sex: they generate signals that transmit information about the species-identity, sex, location, or even sender quality to conspecific receivers. Males of some insect species generate signals at distinct time intervals, and other males adjust their own rhythm relative to that of their conspecific neighbors, which leads to fascinating acoustic group displays. Although signal timing in a chorus can have important consequences for the calling energetics, reproductive success and predation risk of individuals, still little is known about the selective forces that favor the evolution of insect choruses. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the neuronal network responsible for acoustic pattern generation of a signaler, and pattern recognition in receivers. We also describe different proximate mechanisms that facilitate the synchronous generation of signals in a chorus and provide examples of suggested hypotheses to explain the evolution of chorus synchrony in insects. Some hypotheses are related to sexual selection and inter-male cooperation or competition, whereas others refer to the selection pressure exerted by natural predators. In this article, we summarize the results of studies that address chorus synchrony in the tropical katydid Mecopoda elongata, where some males persistently signal as followers although this reduces their mating success.

AB  - The Beiya Au deposit is the largest Cenozoic Au deposit in the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan porphyry metallogenic belt. Numerous studies document that high water content and fO(2) are vital factors for the generation of Au mineralization. In this belt, only the Wandongshan and Hongnitang districts are considered to be of economic importance, while the other districts, such as Bailiancun, are barren. So in order to reveal the importance of water content and oxidation state for Beiya porphyry-style Au mineralization, the amphiboles and zircons compositions are used to evaluate the physicochemical conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature, fO(2), and water content) of the Wandongshan ore-fertile porphyries and Bailiancun ore-barren porphyries observed in the Beiya Au deposit. The results show that the water content of the Wandongshan parent magma (<= 4.11 0.4 wt %) are slightly higher than those of the parent magma at Bailiancun (<= 3.91 0.4 wt %), while the emplacement pressure of the Wandongshan parent magma (31.5-68.6 MPa) is much lower than that of the parent magma at Bailiancun (142.3-192.8 MPa), indicating that the Wandongshan magma reached water saturation earlier. In addition, the Wandongshan porphyries crystallized from more oxidized magma (average of Delta FMQ = +3.5) with an average temperature of 778 degrees C compared to the Bailiancun porphyries (average of Delta FMQ = +1.5) with a mean magmatic temperature of 770 degrees C. The Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio of zircon in the Wandongshan ore-related intrusions (average Ce4+/Ce3+ of 62.00) is much higher than that of the Bailiancun barren porphyries (average Ce4+/Ce3+ of 23.15), which further confirmed Wandongshan ore-related magma is more oxidized than the Bailiancun barren magma. Therefore, melts that are more enriched in water and with a high oxidation state will be more fertile to form an economic porphyry-style Au system.

TI  - Heritability of the somatotype components in Biscay families
T2  - HOMO-JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE HUMAN BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - RESEMBLANCE
AB  - The anthropometric somatotype is a quantitative description of body shape and composition. Familial studies indicate the existence of a familial resemblance for this phenotype and they suggest a substantial action by genetic factors on this aggregation. The aim of this study is to examine the degree of familial resemblance of the somatotype components and of a factor of shape, in a sample of Biscay nuclear families (Basque Country, Spain).
   One thousand three hundred and thirty nuclear families were analysed. The anthropornetric somatotype components [Carter, J.E.L., Heath, B.H., 1990. Somatotyping. Development and applications. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 503] were computed. Each component was fitted for the other two through a stepwise multiple regression, and also fitted through the LMS method [Cole, T., 1988. Fitting smoothed centile curves to reference data. J. Roy. Stat. Soc. 151, 385-418] in order to eliminate the age, sex and generation effects. The three raw components were introduced in a PCA from which a shape factor (PCI) was extracted for each generation. The correlations analysis was performed with the SEGPATH package [Province, M.A., Rao, D.C., 1995. General purpose model and computer programme for combined segregation and path analysis (SEGPATH): automatically creating computer from symbolic language model specifications. Genet. Epidemiol. 12, 203-219]. A general model of transmission and nine reduced models were tested. Maximal heritability was estimated with the formula of [Rice, T., Warwick, D.E., Gagnon, J., Bouchard, C., Leon, A.S.,Skinner, J.S., Wilmore, J.H., Rao, D.C., 1997. Familial resemblance for body composition measures: the HERITAGE family study. Obes. Res. 5, 557-562]. The correlations were higher between offspring than in parents and offspring and a significant resemblance between mating partners existed. Maximum heritabilities were 55%, 52% and 46% for endomorphy, mesomorphy and ectomorphy, respectively, and 52% for PCI.
   In conclusion, the somatotype presents a moderate degree of familial aggregation. For the somatotype components, as well as for PCI, the degree of familial resemblance depends on age. The sex only has a significant effect on ectomorphy. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - A mathematical model of a new reactor design has been proposed. In the new reactor the catalyst is deposited over the external surface of the tubes, where the coolant flows. The widespread industrial process of oxidation of o-xylene into phthalic anhydride was investigated. The results obtained show significant advantages of the new design in comparison with the conventional fixed bed reactor operating in the industry. They are: much higher productivity, easily controlled temperature regime, raised selectivity and decrease content of side products, as well as an opportunity for additional feed-in of the reagent along the reactor height. The technological regime of the oxidation process was optimized.

AB  - We analysed the patterns of genetic variability of eastern Mediterranean populations of the scleractinian coral Cladocora caespitosa, from the Aegean and Levantine seas, using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, 11 of which were newly characterized. The observed genetic pattern reflects a scenario of isolation by environment: F-ST comparisons showed a higher degree of genetic differentiation between the two Cypriot populations that are separated by only 11 km than between these two Levantine populations and the Aegean population in Greece, which are separated by 1300 km. We hypothesize that local-scale oceanographic factors influenced the dispersal of planulae between the geographically close populations, playing a crucial role in the genetic structure of this coastal coral. Yet, despite being characterized as a species with limited dispersal and high self-recruitment, large-scale migration does eventually occur as first-generation migrants were identified between the most distant populations. In line with previous findings of reproductive plasticity in C. caespitosa, we also found localized differences in reproduction mode (sexual vs. asexual) within a geographically limited context. Several individuals were identified as clones, indicating the predominance of asexual reproduction in one of the Cypriot populations. We interpret this predominance either as a direct response to or as an indirect consequence of perturbations suffered by this C. caespitosa population. These perturbations are caused by unfavourable environmental conditions that threatened local survival, in particular water temperature changes and windstorm swells. Asexual reproduction may be a mechanism used by C. caespitosa to counteract mortality events and recolonize devastated areas, and likely accounts for the occasional high levels of clonality and low levels of genetic diversity. Local adaptations such as these should therefore be considered in conservation and management strategies to maintain and preserve the gene pool of this endangered species.

AB  - Biofilm is the most successful and widely distributed form of life on earth, it is not simply structured collections of cells attached to surfaces but is a dynamic complex biological system able to respond to environmental changes. The biofilm characteristics make it unique and central to microbial evolution and adaptation. The ability to establish biofilms is a key trait for microorganisms growing in extreme environments like extreme temperature, high radiation, acidic or alkaline pH values, heavy metal pollution, and high salinity. In this article, we report the main features of biofilm and how these characteristics make biofilms a successful survival strategy in extreme conditions. All aspects examined in this article help to explain why biofilms are a successful survival strategy in extreme conditions and why the ability to establish biofilms is a key trait for microorganisms growing in extreme environments.

AB  - Clarke (1987; Mar Ecol Frog Ser 38:89-99) analysed the effects of variation in maintenance metabolic costs with temperature on reproductive metabolism in poikilothermic animals. Based on model calculations, he concluded that annual mass-specific gonad production (GP) and the share of assimilated energy used for reproductive purposes (RE) are affected in opposite ways by temperature. In animals of similar size and ecology either GP will decrease with decreasing temperature ii RE remains constant or RE will increase with decreasing temperature if GP remains constant. Empirical data on productivity of marine benthic invertebrate populations suggest that the evolutionary adaptation of gonad metabolism tends toward changing GP and maintaining RE independent of temperature.

AB  - We study the quantum Zeno effect of the circuit-QED system at finite temperature for both selective measurement and nonselective measurement proposals. For the selective measurement proposal, we explicitly show that the counter-rotating terms (CRTs) become as significant as rotating wave terms (RWTs) with increase of temperature. We also derive an analytic expression for the survival probability which correctly captures the leading contribution for both RWTs and CRTs in the frequent measurement limit. Beyond this limit, we observe a nonexponential decay of the survival probability by further considering the effect of the variation of initial states during repeated measurements. For the nonselective measurement proposal, we find that the survival probability demonstrates the same behavior as in the selective measurement case in the short-time regime while it deviates from an exponential form and approaches a nonvanishing value in the long-time scale due to the repopulation effect.

AB  - Genetic divergence is impacted by many factors, including phylogenetic history, gene flow, genetic drift, and divergent selection. Rotifers are an important component of aquatic ecosystems, and genetic variation is essential to their ongoing adaptive diversification and local adaptation. In addition to coding sequence divergence, variation in gene expression may relate to variable heat tolerance, and can impose ecological barriers within species. Temperature plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by affecting species abundance, spatio-temporal distribution, and habitat colonization. Recently described (formerly cryptic) species of the Brachionus calyciflorus complex exhibit different temperature tolerance both in natural and in laboratory studies, and show that B. calyciflorus sensu stricto (s.s.) is a thermotolerant species. Even within B. calyciflorus s.s., there is a tendency for further temperature specializations. Comparison of expressed genes allows us to assess the impact of stressors on both expression and sequence divergence among disparate populations within a single species. Here, we have used RNA-seq to explore expressed genetic diversity in B. calyciflorus s.s. in two mitochondrial DNA lineages with different phylogenetic histories and differences in thermotolerance. We identify a suite of candidate genes that may underlie local adaptation, with a particular focus on the response to sustained high or low temperatures. We do not find adaptive divergence in established candidate genes for thermal adaptation. Rather, we detect divergent selection among our two lineages in genes related to metabolism (lipid metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics).

AB  - The relationship between thermal and reproductive biology is complex and poorly understood. We measured selected body temperatures (T-sel) for the viviparous gecko Hoplodactylus maculatus. T-sel was compared among pregnant females, nonpregnant females, and males from two sites: a cool site with biennially reproducing geckos and a warm site with annually reproducing geckos. T-sel was measured at five times of day during three seasons and compared with microhabitat temperature (T-top) and field body temperature (T-b). T-sel varied with time of day in all comparisons, and the effect of reproductive condition on T-sel differed between sites and seasons. At both sites, when T-sel differed between reproductive conditions, pregnant females had higher T-sel than nonpregnant females and males. Stage of pregnancy affected the degree of elevation of T-sel. Measurements of microhabitat temperature and field T-b showed that, even in the warmest season, geckos rarely had the opportunity to achieve T-sel at the cool site but were able to do so at the warm site. The elevation of T-sel with pregnancy is extreme in this species (up to 8 degrees C), which suggests that an increase in T-b is critical to successful reproduction. Interactions between the effects of time of day, season, and reproductive condition on T-sel must be considered in the assessment of thermoregulation in reptiles.

AB  - Public health planning needs the support of evidence-based information on current and future climate, which could be used by health professionals and decision makers to better understand and respond to the health impacts of extreme heat. Climate models provide information regarding the expected increase in temperatures and extreme heat events with climate change and can help predict the severity of future health impacts, which can be used in the public health sector for the development of adaptation strategies to reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality. This study analyzes the evolution of extreme temperature indices specifically defined to characterize heat events associated with health risks, in the context of a changing climate. The analysis is performed by using temperature projections from the Canadian Regional Climate Model. A quantile-based statistical correction is applied to the projected temperatures, in order to reduce model biases and account for the representativeness error. Moreover, generalized Pareto distributions are used to extend the temperature distribution upper tails and extrapolate the statistical correction to extremes that are not observed in the present but that might occur in the future. The largest increase in extreme daytime temperatures occurs in southern Manitoba, Canada, where the already overly dry climate and lack of soil moisture can lead to an uncontrolled enhancement of hot extremes. The occurrence of warm nights and heat waves, on the other hand, is already large and will increase substantially in the communities of the Great Lakes region, characterized by a humid climate. Impact and adaptation studies need to account for the temperature variability due to local effects, since it can be considerably larger than the model natural variability.

AB  - The composition and thermal state of the lithospheric mantle under the North Atlantic craton was investigated using a suite of peridotite xenoliths from the diamond-bearing Sarfartoq kimberlite dike swarm of southwestern Greenland. Elevated olivine and whole-rock Mg# (>0.9) attest to the refractory nature of the Sarfartoq mantle showing comparable degrees of depletion to other cratonic roots. Modal analyses indicate that the Sarfartoq mantle is not typified by the orthopyroxene enrichment observed in the Kaapvaal root, but shows more affinity with the Canadian Arctic (Somerset Island), Tanzania, and East Greenland (Wiedemann Fjord) peridotites. The Sarfartoq peridotites have equilibrated at temperatures and pressures ranging from 660 to 1,280 degreesC and from 2.2 to 6.3 GPa, and define a relatively low mantle heat flow of 13.2+/-1 mW/m(2.) In addition, the lithospheric mantle underneath the Sarfartoq area is compositionally layered as follows: (1) an internally stratified upper layer (70 to 180 km) consisting of coarse, un-deformed, refractory garnet-bearing and garnet-free peridotites and, (2) a lower layer (180 to 225 km) characterized by fertile, CPX-bearing, porphyroclastic garnet lherzolites. The stratification observed in the upper refractory harzburgite layer (70-180 km) is reflected by an increase in fertility (e.g., decrease in olivine abundance and forsterite content) with depth. The sharp nature of the boundary between the upper and lower layers may indicate multistage growth of the lithospheric mantle.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variations in the distribution of the marine picoplanktic cyanobacteria population and mixing conditions were found in the Ebro River estuary outflow to the Mediterranean Sea in Spain. Six sampling surveys were undertaken between July 1999 and February 2000 for distances up to 15 km from the river mouth. Measurements were taken of flow velocity, salinity, temperature, depth and picocyanobacteria (PCB) abundances. Gradient Richardson (Rig) and Reynolds (Re) numbers were determined to evaluate hydrodynamics. In summer, large values of Rig arise from the small flow rates, and small values of velocity shear between the surface fresh water layer and the bottom saline layer; conversely, in winter the large flow rates and attendant large velocity shears between the layers give rise to small values of Rig. Flow conditions in the fall are an intermediate case between the summer and winter cases. Vertical abundance distributions were resolved through the river water, interfacial region, and the bottom salt wedge; longitudinal gradients of PCB abundances were also resolved. Seasonal differences in the PCB abundance values were observed. Analysis of cell numbers (C) showed that the variable dC/dS, the dependence of cell number upon salinity gradient (dS) was critical. A non-dimensional number; the cellular gradient number (Cg) is introduced. Cg has useful biological interpretations that can potentially be included in ecological modeling. For example, Cg = 1 pertains to perfect adaptability of the organism to adjust to changing environmental conditions, whereas Cg = 0 describes total mortality. For a system with strong advection there is insufficient time for cells to adapt to the changing environment, and so those cell counts are unchanged. This is the case for the Ebro estuary in winter as advection of salinity (and hence PCB abundance) dominates the other loss processes for large flow rates. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern power systems are being shifted its attention towards distributed generations (DGs). DGs have allured more concern as an auspicious opportunity with considerable economic profits. To minimize the power generation costs of DGs, day-to-day operation scheduling is essential. The role of this study is to offer an optimal operation schedule for DG with several energy sources including renewable energy sources (RES), considering economic facets. In order to achieve the cost minimization along with optimal scheduling, an objection function has been formulated and solved using the optimization algorithms. This study aims to present the applications of differential evolution (DE) algorithm and its variants such as opposition-based differential evolution (ODE), self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE), improved differential evolution (IDE), and cultivated differential evolution (CuDE) for scheduling DG optimally. A scheme for optimal scheduling of thermal, wind power, and solar PV generators has been evaluated. The simulations have been carried out on IEEE 14 bus system, IEEE 30 bus system, IEEE 57 bus system, and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO), as a real part of 62 bus Indian utility system (IUS). The novelty of this study lies in simulating a real-time system for solving optimal scheduling problem, in that way helping decision makers to choose the optimal operation points. The results indicate that the SaDE outperformed other DE variants by giving the best fitness value and convergence rate.

AB  - Precision fertilization is one of the important links in the precision agricultural operation system. In recent years, the demand for precision fertilization in facility greenhouse has become more and more urgent. As such, this paper designs an accurate and practical fertilization on-line monitoring system. The system adopts capacitance conversion chip PCAP01 and SCM STM32F103C8T6 to build a capacitance detection circuit. The effective acquisition of differential capacitance sensor microcapacitor signal output under this system is realized. The response relationship between the mass flow and the sensor capacitance output was studied, and a linear fitting model of fertilization was established. According to the prediction, the model determination coefficient was 0.9997. The experiment shows that the system has good adaptability to ambient temperature. The average measurement error is 1.13%, which meets the technical requirements of flow measurement. The capacitive fertilization online measurement system provides an effective way for the on-line acquisition of fertilization flow. It is of great significance for the implementation of high-precision variable fertilization.

AB  - With the development of smart materials, smart coatings have attracted extensive attentions in all works of life and have been gradually put into use in all fields. "These coatings, adopting a controllable and reproduction way to feel and respond to the surroundings, are able to make relevant changes in temperature, colors, sound, light, etc."(Lin & Sun 2009). This paper studies the application of smart coatings in wall painting, and tries to benefit wall paintings with new functions, environmental adaptability and stronger self-regulation ability that are not possessed by traditional coatings to achieve an ecological and intelligent development of wall paintings.
   With the quickened pace of environmental protection and energy saving, smart coatings, as a new product in painting industry that can be widely used, have arisen much concern. It has not only been used in high-tech fields, but also made appearance in the surrounding areas. Smart coatings are now used in wall painting, a newly- developed field, which can be beneficially provided with new functions and richened forms and contents that can be not brought about by the traditional materials.

AB  - Every plants need an enviromnent which is in accordance with its adaptability. However, the environment always changes so that it requires regular analysis to maintain plant fertility. Environmental data such as temperature, humidity from soil and air, rainfall, light intensity can be processed using computer algorithms in the form of a sequential (time series) matrix. The paper proposed a sequential Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (FARM) for plants enviromnent classification using Internet of Things (IoT). FARM is used to extract association rule in form of fuzzy memberships from plant environment data that collected from sensors of IoT. Fuzzy is used to facilitate grouping of sensor data and detect changes in the environment when the degree of membership becomes irrelevant. Fuzzy membership degrees are also mapped based on time series to interpret routine environmental changes. The paper showed results of a FARM algorithm for plant environments and prototypes from IoT circuits. FARM algorithm and IoT evaluated using real time data collecting of Aglaonema costatum (Chinese Evergreen). The results shown the FARM capable to extract relevant fuzzy rules with different parameter of tolerance of dependent.

AB  - The self-adaptive low-high evaluation evolutionary-algorithm (SALHE-EA) is used to solve multimodal optimization problems. SALHE-EA is able to find the multiple optima of a single objective function (OF) and to give an idea of the fitness landscape in the neighborhood of these optima. This aspect is of crucial importance when the single OF is obtained using the weighted sum of the OFs, each related to a different goal of the optimization problem. This paper presents an improved version of SALHE-EA. This new version has several new features and, mainly, the suitability for parallelization.

AB  - Selective laser melting (SLM) shows a positive prospect as an additive manufacturing (AM) technique for fabrication of 3D parts with complicated structures. A transient thermal model was developed by the finite element method (FEM) to simulate the thermal behavior for predicting the time evolution of temperature field and melt pool dimensions of Ti6Al4V powder during SLM. The FEM predictions were then compared with published experimental measurements and calculation results for model validation. This study applied the design of experiment (DOE) scheme together with the response surface method (RSM) to conduct the regression analysis based on four processing parameters (exactly, the laser power, scanning speed, preheating temperature and hatch space) for predicting the dimensions of the melt pool in SLM. The preliminary RSM results were used to quantify the effects of those parameters on the melt pool size. The process window was further implemented via two criteria of the width and depth of the molten pool to screen impractical conditions of four parameters for including the practical ranges of processing parameters. The FEM simulations confirmed the good accuracy of the critical RSM models in the predictions of melt pool dimensions for three typical SLM working scenarios. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Day/night zooplankton sampling in Kosterfjorden, Sweden, gave information on population succession, vertical distribution and feeding df Calanus finmarchicus over 17 months. Copepodid Stage 1 and 2 (C-I, C-II) were present from December to August, indicating reproduction during most of the year. Mating and breeding for the overwintering generation mainly took place in February/March, resulting in peak abundance of C-I in March/April. Secondary breeding periods were in April and July/August, but the resulting recruitment from these were low. The relative recruitment success in the first spring was around 13 times higher than during the second spring. Low temperature in the surface water early in the year and depression of the spring phytoplankton bloom may have caused the failure in the second year. Population biomass peaked at >15 g dry weight m(-2) during the numeric peak of the youngest stages in March/April. A more sustainable level of high biomass of 8 to 10 g dw m(-2) was gradually built up during summer, mainly due to a continuous accumulation of C-Vs. Adults and C-Vs comprised the overwintering population, with 7 to 14% and 85 to 93%, respectively, for the 2 years, but only C-Vs staying in the deep water were in a resting state. Adult males showed a strong diurnal vertical migration (DVM) of the usual type from spring to early autumn and a reversed DVM during the cold season. They were in a feeding state throughout the year. Adult females showed the usual type of DVM during summer to autumn, but commonly a reversed DVM during winter to spring. They were usually in a feeding state, with no pronounced differences between surface and deep water or between day and night. C-Vs aggregated in the deep water from October to March and performed DVM in April to June. They were commonly feeding in the deep water between March and June but showed no or very low feeding activity there from July to February. C-Vs in the surface water were commonly feeding and showed the highest proportion of feeding in autumn, when the population in the deep water was inactive. C-V constituted up to nearly 100% of the population biomass, and therefore must be of profound ecological importance. Defined by this dominant role, the population of C. finmarchicus can be characterised as having an active period of feeding, reproduction and development from February to July with a following 6 to 7 months of resting in the deep water, when development is arrested and no feeding occurs.

Muller, 1785) from the littoral of the Rybinsk Reservoir. The graphic method is used to analyze the experimental data. In the study during the vegetation season the following parameters are determined: range of selected (preferred) temperatures (17.4-26.5A degrees C) corresponding to the optimum temperatures for growth and development of cladocerans in the waterbodies, the temperature zone of normal vital activity (13.0-27.0A degrees C), ranges of avoidance temperatures (6.0-13.0A degrees C and > 27.0A degrees C), and lethal temperatures (< 6.0 and > 33.0A degrees C). The possible reasons and mechanisms of temperature responses in cladocerans are discussed.

AB  - Through the history of mankind, until the mid-19th century, biomass, particularly wood, represented the most important source of energy. In many countries of Europe, the awareness of the importance of forest biomass as fuel has been closely connected to the general understanding and the realization of own and world energetic situation. Forest biomass represents an important source of energy, whose use should be paid more attention to in the future. In its traditional forms, biomass is still a very significant source of energy in most countries of the southeast Europe and it will continue to be so in the near future. However, it is more and more used not just for thermal energy production, but also for the production of electric and cooling energy which is considered as an important part of the energetic transition which is a promising model with high economic and ecological advantages. The use of biomass energy offers significant possibilities for opening new jobs, thus having a significant positive impact on the local and national economy. This paper describes the present stage of the energetic transition in the south-eastern European countries and the role of forest biomass in its implementation. Examples and events in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Serbia are analysed. Rural development projects as well as the use of bioenergy biomass has a great potential for income generation, increase of productivity and opening of small village companies. From the macroeconomic perspective, the use of biomass contributes to all the important elements in the development of the south-eastern European countries.
   Key drivers as well as the obstacles which can be encountered in the energetic transition in local government units can be structured as follows; potential stimulus, refers to the most south-eastern European countries regarding their significant afforestation and forest biomass potential, market stimulus due to cost-effective accessible plants and equipment for biomass, as well as the adequate support of manufacturing firms, the use of commercial and business connections: where most of biomass trades among the south-eastern European countries and EU is carried out in integration with the forest product trade, to be first or the local pride, is an important driver in the south-eastern European countries to keep money at home is another important link with the positive perception in the use of the forest biomass.
   The paper recognised a significant number of potential groups of obstacles for using the forest biomass; economic limitations more favourable price of the forest biomass energy in relation to fossil fuels, financial limitations as a serious obstacle for each form of the renewable energy, social limitations are very specific for each form of the renewable energy, human resource limitations since most local governments do not have sufficient human potential, limitations due to transparency are a very frequent problem, primarily depends on the democratic power, technical limitations mostly belong to the fact that most of the equipment for using renewable energy sources and the increase in energetic efficiency from the import, has not been produced on the local level.

AB  - Genomic time series data generated by evolve-and-resequence (E&R) experiments offer a powerful window into the mechanisms that drive evolution. However, standard population genetic inference procedures do not account for sampling serially over time, and new methods are needed to make full use of modern experimental evolution data. To address this problem, we develop a Gaussian process approximation to the multi-locus Wright-Fisher process with selection over a time course of tens of generations. The mean and covariance structure of the Gaussian process are obtained by computing the corresponding moments in discrete-time Wright-Fisher models conditioned on the presence of a linked selected site. This enables our method to account for the effects of linkage and selection, both along the genome and across sampled time points, in an approximate but principled manner. We first use simulated data to demonstrate the power of our method to correctly detect, locate and estimate the fitness of a selected allele from among several linked sites. We study how this power changes for different values of selection strength, initial haplotypic diversity, population size, sampling frequency, experimental duration, number of replicates, and sequencing coverage depth. In addition to providing quantitative estimates of selection parameters from experimental evolution data, our model can be used by practitioners to design E&R experiments with requisite power. We also explore how our likelihood-based approach can be used to infer other model parameters, including effective population size and recombination rate. Then, we apply our method to analyze genome-wide data from a real E&R experiment designed to study the adaptation of D. melanogaster to a new laboratory environment with alternating cold and hot temperatures.

AB  - During the machining process the tools for pressure and injection molding have to keep an optimal working temperature. This temperature depends on the workpiece material and allows a safe, efficient and precise machining process. The compact and very expensive steel molds are penetrated with deep hole drilling bores that are combined to form mold temperature control circuits. Today the structure of these circuits are designed manually. Here, a new automatic layout system for mold temperature control strategies is introduced which uses a multi-objective fitness function. The circuits are encoded via a polyline approach. The complex optimization problem is solved using a variation of the evolution strategy. The evolutionary approach as well as first results of the system will be discussed.

AB  - The number of bacterial cells is currently recognized as the most important parameter for the efficacy and quality of finished probiotic or live biotherapeutic products (LBP). Cell enumeration is generally performed by culture-dependent methodologies like plate count (PC). These techniques are able to reveal the number of viable cells able to replicate and generate a colony. However, they are limited by their dependence on the combination of culture conditions (e.g. nutrients, temperature) selected for cell recovery. Additionally, they do not provide information on the heterogeneity of a bacterial culture, namely they do not detect the cells in a viable but not cultivable (VBNC) status. Flow-cytometry (FC) is a culture-independent methodology having the potential to enumerate selectively live and damaged or dead cells. FC relies on the use of specific probes for different cell targets (e.g. membrane, enzymes) to unveil information on the cell structure and physiological statuses within a bacterial population. In this context, we monitored three batches of freeze-dried Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) during a 3 year of storage at different conditions of temperature and relative humidity, according to ICH guidelines, by means of PC and FC. The Arrhenius model was applied to assess the suitability of the model to predict the mortality of probiotic cells in finished products. The higher destruction rate (k) obtained by PC data compared to FC data suggests a faster reduction of cultivability compared to membrane integrity, probably representing a dynamic shift of the bacterial population into a VBNC/dormant status during storage time. Interestingly, this mechanistic approach works both for PC and FC methodologies increasing the chances to monitor biological phenomenon within a mathematical modelling. The combined use of PC and FC shed lights on the true bacterial potency within a closed system like a finished product and the complexity of its heterogeneity.

AB  - Microbial consortia may harbour an array of resistance mechanisms that facilitate survival under harsh conditions, including antifreeze and ice-nucleation proteins. Antifreeze proteins lower freezing points as well as inhibit the growth of large, potentially damaging ice crystals from small ice embryos. In contrast, ice-nucleation proteins prevent supercooling and allow ice formation at high, sub-zero temperatures. Psychrophiles and psychrotolerant microbes are typically sought in extremely cold environments. However, given that geography is unlikely to present an insurmountable barrier to microbial dispersal, we reasoned that species with low-temperature adaptations should also be present, although rare, in more temperate environments. In consequence, the challenge then becomes one of selecting for rare microbes present in a larger community. Following the introductory commentary, we demonstrate that both freeze-thaw survival and ice-affinity selection can be used to identify microbes, which demonstrate low-temperature resistance, from enrichments derived from temperate environments. Selection resulted in a drastic decrease in cell abundance and diversity, allowing the isolation of a subset of resistant microbes. Depending on the origin of the consortia, these resistant microbes demonstrated cross-tolerance to osmotic stress, or a high proportion of antifreeze and/or ice-nucleation protein activities. Both types of ice-associating proteins presumably facilitate microbial survival at low temperatures. These proteins, as well as molecules that maintain osmotic balance, are also of commercial interest, with applications in the food, energy and medical industries. In addition, the resistant phenotypes described here provide a glimpse into the breadth of strategies microbes use to survive and thrive at low temperatures.

AB  - Increased frequency of extreme weather events has seriously affected forestry operations in south-eastern Europe. A precondition for effective artificial restoration of disturbed forest stands is site-adapted forest reproductive material (FRM). Common garden experiments (provenance trials) may assist in selecting such FRM. The main objective of this study was to establish among-provenance variation pattern using data from a beech provenance trial. Usefulness of the results in selecting seed sources for restoration of European beech stands is discussed. The trial was set up in 2007, at a slope of Medvednica mount facing north-west at 730-750 m above sea level. Plant heights were measured and survival scored in 2008 and 2015. Height increments were calculated and processed to determine variance components due to various effects. Highly significant provenance-by-block interaction was revealed, indicating strong microsite effects on provenance performances. Therefore, corrections were made and provenance mean height increments recalculated. Provenance mean height increment multiplied with survival was used as a measure of a provenance's adaptedness. Regression tree (RT) analysis was used to determine the pattern of among-provenance variations. A set of provenance dusters was grown using climatic variables related to the provenance stands of origin as criteria. All analyzed effects were significant (provenance: F=2.07, p<0.05; block: F=5.07, p<0.05; provenance by block interaction: F=7.32, p<0.001). Data corrections reduced the interaction effect, thereby increasing reliability of calculated provenance adaptedness indices (AI). Provenances were grouped into 4 clusters due to elevation, mean July temperature and summer heat-to-moisture index (SHM). Cluster 4, containing provenances from the highest altitudes (>750m), had the highest mean AI (143.9 +/- 8.4 cm). The lowest mean AI(106.7 +/- 14.8 cm) had cluster 1, containing provenances from lower altitudes with lower mean July temperatures (<= 1.8.4 degrees C). Provenances originating from lower elevations with higher mean July temperatures (>18.4 degrees C) were further divided into two clusters due to the SHM variable. Cluster 2 had the second highest mean AI (141.2 +/- 1.5 cm) and contained provenances from relatively wetter habitats (SHM <= 48.2). Cluster 3, containing provenances from relatively arid habitats (SHM>48.2), had significantly lower mean AI (116.8 +/- 8.6 cm). Established among-provenance variation pattern might be used as a tool in selecting seed sources for artificial restoration of beech stands at mount Medvednica. It is advisable to use FRM from higher altitudes and/or from slightly lower altitudes (up to 150 m lower than a restoring site) but featured with warmer and drier conditions compared to the trial. Generally, provenance trials should be utilized as a valuable decision tool in restoring disturbed forest stands but may also be misleading if not well designed and analyzed.

AB  - Sex determination in Australian agamid lizards shows a complex framework of different mechanisms, varying even among closely related taxa. It is clear that discrete classification of these species as either having genetic (GSD) or environmental sex determination (ESD) does not agree with empirical data. Although many species in this group show temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), recent evidence suggests additional genetic or epigenetic effects. A proposed model explaining the adaptive significance and evolution of TSD in short-lived agamids predicts that selection will favor temperature-biased sex ratios in species with intense male-male competition. Here, we use experimental incubation at (near) constant temperatures to test whether the sex of Australian painted dragons (Ctenophorus pictus) is influenced by temperature, building on previous research yet to have reached an agreement regarding the role of temperature in this species. In this study, incubation temperature and parental identity affected hatchling sex suggesting that environment and genetics may work in concert to determine sex in this species. Although our results are consistent with TSD, our data cannot rule out a temperature-by-sex effect on egg or hatchling mortality. However, our findings together with the observed differences of sex determination systems in closely related species within this genus may provide novel opportunities to address fundamental questions in the evolution of sex determination systems.

AB  - Aim The treeline is an obvious ecotone between forest and tundra ecosystems. Climatic warming is expected to lead to the treeline advancing, although in many cases this has not been observed. This is most likely because other factors can also influence treeline dynamics, notably land use and herbivory in European treelines. In this study, the roles of climate and herbivory as determinants for change in stem number, growth and mortality responses of treeline ecotone trees were investigated.
   Location Thirty-six sites along a 1,000 km latitudinal gradient in the Scandes Mountains in Norway (60-69 degrees N).
   Methods We recorded changes in stem numbers and height, and mortality between 2008 and 2012. A partial least-squares regression analysis (PLS) was carried out to find the relative importance of groups of variables representing climate, herbivory, site and tree properties for explaining the variation in these three response variables. We also fitted general additive models for each response with selected variables from the PLS analysis.
   Results We found an increase in number of stems and tree height for short and medium tall trees. The climatic variables explained the greatest proportion of the variation of the change in stem numbers, while tree height growth and mortality were best predicted by the growth stage of the tree and climate.
   Conclusions Our study shows that climate explains more of the variance in treeline performance than herbivory, tree properties or latitude. Relatively weak explanatory power of all variables suggests high context dependency of treeline dynamics between sites. It seems that at large scales, variables known to be important in regulating treeline dynamics within sites are poor predictors of treeline change in the short term.

AB  - Fish stocks vary in abundance, and assessments show that exploitation has a large effect on stock size fluctuations. The effect of the physical environment on stock fluctuations is not well understood. In this paper, the main purpose is to shed light on the relationship between the temperature in surrounding water-masses and the fluctuations in spawning stock biomass and recruitment to herring stocks in the North Atlantic. A feature that may indicate the influence of external factors is the coherence or common pattern in the fluctuations in the abundance of herring stocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Time series of normalized spawning stock size were compared between five herring stocks in the North Atlantic Ocean. Common patterns in stock biomass were found between several of the stocks. A significant relationship was found between recruitment and temperature for Norwegian spring spawners only. North Sea herring, Icelandic summer spawners, and herring in the Bay of Fundy also had a pattern of enhanced recruitment at higher temperatures. Although it is found that herring stocks inhabiting warmer waters have a higher stock-recruitment relationship than the stocks inhabiting colder regions, it is believed that the temperature is a proxy for other environmental factors influencing the survival of larvae and hence the level of recruitment.

AB  - We determined the influence of fruit maturity on the killing effectiveness of electron beam irradiation using model foods systems resembling melons. The model systems consisted of mixtures of 100 g/l of unflavored gelatin and sugars at three ratios (fructose : glucose : sucrose) and levels designated as early ripe, ER, 3.0 g/l, 1.5:1.5:0; moderately ripe, MR, 5.5 g/l, 1: 1: 1.0 and ripe, R, 8.0 g/l, 0.5:0.5:2.0. The model systems were inoculated with the surrogate Escherichia coli K-12 MG 1655, irradiated at 1.0 kGy using a 2.0 MeV Van de Graaf accelerator, and stored at 4 degrees C for 4 days. Both non-irradiated gelatin systems and non-sugar systems served as controls. Independent of irradiation, the surrogate population increased slightly in the ripe systems while it decreased in the ER systems. The effect of storage temperature on the surrogate's ability to recover was tested using MR samples (irradiated and non-irradiated) stored at 10 and 20 degrees C for 4 days. A non-sugar system served as control. At these two temperatures, the populations recovered back to their initial numbers after 48h of storage. Generation times increased with fruit maturity level (1.3-1.6h) and population counts ranged from -0.6 to 1.0log(10) CFU/ml for ER and MR systems after 60 h of storage at 20 degrees C, respectively. The number of injured populations was 0.5 log(10) CFU/ml. To prevent recovery of bacteria populations after electron beam irradiation treatments at 1.0 kGy, storage at low temperature (4 degrees C) is recommended.

AB  - Nowadays, there are various methods of optimisation works that have been explored by many researchers to find the appropriate processing parameters setting of injection moulding process. From the previous researches, it was reported that the optimisation work improved the moulded part quality. Apart from quality, the productivity in the injection moulding process also plays an important role. Therefore, some of the researchers have introduced the conformal cooling channels which have been proven to improve the quality and productivity of the moulded part. However, the application of optimisation work to determine an appropriate processing parameters setting in previous researches are only focusing on the conventional straight-drilled cooling channels and the application in conformal cooling channels are still lacking. In this study, the application of optimisation work to improve warpage of the front panel housing part with Milled Groove Square Shape (MGSS) conformal cooling channels has been explored. By selecting cooling time, cooling temperature, packing pressure and melt temperature as the variables, design of experiment (DOE) has been constructed by using the central composite design (CCD) approach. By performing Response Surface Methodology (RSM) optimisation approach, warpage of the moulded part has been optimised. Based on the results warpage has optimised by 46.5%. The finding shows that the application of optimisation work on the conformal cooling channels offers the best outcome.

AB  - Viable cells of Candida guilliermondii were immobilized by inclusion into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel using the freezing-thawing method. Entrapment experiments were planned according to a 2(3) full factorial design, using the PVA concentration (80, 100, and 120 g L-1), the freezing temperature (-10, -15, and -20 degrees C), and the number of freezing-thawing cycles (one, three, and five) as the independent variables, integrated with three additional tests to estimate the errors. The effectiveness of the immobilization procedure was checked in Erlenmeyer flasks as the pellet capability to catalyze the xylose-to-xylitol bioconversion of a medium based on sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate. To this purpose, the yield of xylitol on consumed xylose, xylitol volumetric productivity, and cell retention yield were selected as the response variables. Cell pellets were then used to perform the same bioconversion in a stirred tank reactor operated at 400 rpm, 30 degrees C, and 1.04 vvm air flowrate. At the end of fermentation, a maximum xylitol concentration of 28.7 g L-1, a xylitol yield on consumed xylose of 0.49 g g(-1) and a xylitol volumetric productivity of 0.24 g L-1 h(-1) were obtained.

AB  - This paper describes the selection, design and experimental validation of a gas-solid trickle flow adsorber for post-combustion CO2 capture using a supported amine sorbents (Lewatit (R) VP OC 1065). The experimental work presented here summarizes over 300 h of operating experience, which is equivalent to approximately 350 adsorption desorption cycles. We measured the effect of process parameters like gas velocity, solid flux and CO2 inlet concentration on adsorber performance in terms of the capture efficiency, productivity and working capacity. The performance of the trickle flow adsorber was adequately described by a 1-D plug-flow model. This model was used to design an adsorber to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by a 500 MWe coal fired power plant. Model predictions have indicated that the trickle flow adsorber outperforms the scrubber in the conventional MEA based process in terms of productivity; 1.1 compared to 0.6 mol/m(3)/s in the MEA based process. Finally, the energy demand of the lab scale capture facility was measured. The energy associated with heating of the sorbent particles and desorption was 141 kJ/mol or 3.2 GJ/t at a working capacity of 1.2 mol/kg. At worldng capacities of 2.7 mol/kg the heat demand was reduced to values below 2 GJ/t. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary In Hymenoptera, some species have two reproduction modes, that is, arrhenotokous and thelytokous parthenogenesis. Although arrhenotoky is common, the thelytoky is not rare. Thelytoky in Hymenopteran species has several causes and is generally induced by bacteria. Here, we examined a thelytokous Chalcidoidea parasitoid, Diglyphus wani, which was recently reported to be a dominant parasitoid attacking agromyzid leafminers. In this study, we aimed to combine multiple methods to explore whether endosymbionts induce thelytokous D. wani. Our findings revealed that the thelytoky of D. wani was not to be associated with the actual presence of the endosymbionts. Thus, Diglyphus wani is the second reported eulophid parasitoid for which thelytoky is not linked with the presence of endosymbionts. In Hymenoptera parasitoids, the reproductive mode is arrhenotoky, while a few species reproduce by thelytoky. The thelytoky of Hymenoptera parasitoids is generally genetically determined by the parasitoids themselves or induced by bacteria, including Wolbachia, Cardinium, and Rickettsia. Diglyphus wani (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a recently reported thelytokous species is a main parasitoid attacking agromyzid leafminers. To assess whether endosymbionts induce thelytoky in D. wani, we performed universal PCR detection and sequenced the V3-V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA gene. In addition, bacteria were removed through high-temperature and antibiotic treatments, and the localized bacteria were detected using FISH. Based on general PCR detection, Wolbachia, Cardinium, Rickettsia, Arsenophonus, Spiroplasma, and Microsporidia were absent in laboratory and field individuals of thelytokous D. wani. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the dominant endosymbionts in thelytokous D. wani were not reproductive manipulators. High-temperature and antibiotic treatment for five consecutive generations cannot reverse the thelytokous pattern of D. wani, and no male offspring were produced. Moreover, no bacterial spots were found in the ovaries of D. wani. Thus, it is considered that the thelytoky of D. wani does not result in the presence of endosymbionts. This species is thus the second reported eulophid parasitoid whose thelytoky appears not to be associated with endosymbionts.

AB  - Changes in biodiversity at all levels from molecules to ecosystems are often linked to climate change, which is widely represented univariately by temperature. A global environmental driving mechanism of biodiversity dynamics is thus implied by the strong correlation between temperature proxies and diversity patterns in a wide variety of fauna and flora. Yet climate consists of many interacting variables. Species probably respond to the entire climate system as opposed to its individual facets. Here, we examine ecological and morphological traits of 12 633 individuals of two species of planktonic foraminifera with similar ecologies but contrasting evolutionary outcomes. Our results show that morphological and ecological changes are correlated to the interactions between multiple environmental factors. Models including interactions between climate variables explain at least twice as much variation in size, shape and abundance changes as models assuming that climate parameters operate independently. No dominant climatic driver can be identified: temperature alone explains remarkably little variation through our highly resolved temporal sequences, implying that a multivariate approach is required to understand evolutionary response to abiotic forcing. Our results caution against the use of a 'silver bullet' environmental parameter to represent global climate while studying evolutionary responses to abiotic change, and show that more comprehensive reconstruction of palaeobiological dynamics requires multiple biotic and abiotic dimensions.

KW  - COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH
AB  - Concrete usually undergoes stringent quality controls during its fabrication in a batching plant or when made in situ. However, there are several conditions in the construction site that may affect concrete quality and operations. Reduction in compressive strength, increment in costs of concrete fabrication and low productivity are among the consequences of adverse jobsite conditions. In this study, construction site conditions including crew experience, compaction method, mixing time, curing humidity, and curing temperature were selected as variables to conduct a full 2(5) factorial experimental design for quantifying their effect on concrete. Cylindrical concrete samples were fabricated and evaluated under each factor combination. Concrete compressive strength as a quality metric, costs, and production rates were measured as the experimental responses. Significant affecting factors and their effects on concrete were identified through the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and used to predict concrete compressive strength, cost, and production effects. A multi-objective optimization problem based on compromised solutions was formulated to maximize both concrete quality and production rates, and to minimize operation costs. The results show that high curing humidity and temperature have a positive effect on compressive strength while high mixing times increases concrete cost and reduces productivity. The proposed optimization model provides construction managers with a tool that allows finding in-situ construction conditions to reach desired goals. Further, understanding the possible impacts of these site conditions on concrete allows taking preventive actions.

AB  - Economist Dr. E.F. Schumacher posited the concept of "Intermediate Technology" in his 1973 book Small is Beautiful, catalyzing the explosion of the appropriate technology (AT) movement. But how does one gauge the "appropriateness" of a technology? Quantitative assessment of AT can benefit sustainable community development (SCD) practitioners by way of decision-support and risk mitigation. The following research constructs a generalizable metric for quantitative assessment of AT, and develops a systematic process for its deployment. Forty-nine independent, emergent indicators of appropriateness were identified from a literature meta-analysis. The most prevalent indicators were as follows: community input, affordability, autonomy, transferability, community control, scalability, local availability of raw materials, and adaptability. Using these, a quantitative assessment tool was developed, called the Appropriate Technology Assessment Tool (ATAT). ATAT employs multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to rank AT alternatives. In this way, inputs are aggregated using a weightedsum method, giving the composite Appropriateness Index, (AI(i)). Using VBA coding, the author built ATAT via a simple form populated by the identified indicators. The form automates all necessary calculations, facilitating empirically rigorous quantitative assessment of AT by non-technical SCD workers. AT is only as appropriate as beneficiaries deem. A participatory research approach requires community stakeholders to rank preferred criteria for AT, and rate alternatives against the chosen criteria. This approach makes the tool customizable to local conditions. Using the Mini-Delphi Method, stakeholder opinions translate to ATAT inputs. A local case in the Westwood neighborhood of Denver, Colorado is examined to test ATAT efficacy and process viability. Prior to this research, University of Colorado graduate students partnered with local 501(c)3 Revision International to reduce winter heating costs in Westwood using a solar furnace that locals dubbed "EZ Heat". ATAT quantified the appropriateness of EZ Heat as AI(i) = 4.2. This score lends empirical support to the AT's a priori deterministic selection. ATAT is designed to be free and accessible via Internet, and the author is investigating the potential of a mobile application. SCD and other community development practitioners often work in remote areas, and a mobile ATAT application will make the tool more useful. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is highly exothermic and reactors are operated with a hot spot in the range of 100 degrees C above the desired operating temperature, which can affect selectivity considerably and can also reduce the catalyst life. Nitrogen-diluted air is a common feed gas but by replacing the nitrogen for a gas with a substantially higher heat capacity, the heat evolution may be more efficiently controlled. In this work, we have studied the potential of propane as a substitute for nitrogen. According to a simple reactor model using current commercial conditions as a "base" case, substituting propane for nitrogen could increase productivity by as much as 50%. Furthermore, propane would be safer to use because the gas mixture would be further away from the flammable region versus current operation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The comprehensive exploitation of geothermal fields has an impact on the productivity of the reservoirs. To realize sustainable steam production, changes in the rock temperature need to be predicted and controlled. A coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) model employing COMSOL Multiphysics was proposed to study the characteristics of heat transfer, fluid flow, and solid deformation at the Lahendong geothermal field, in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. The numerical results were compared with analytical and measured data in order to validate the numerical simulation. Based on the results, the predicted temperatures of the production wells showed significant decrease with the production time. In addition, a reduction in the reservoir temperature leads to lower specific gross electrical power within the production well, which should significantly reduce the sustainability of the power plant.

AB  - Reproductive behavior of Opistognathus rosenblatti (Perciformes: Opistognathidae) in captivity. The Blue Spotted Jawfish O. rosenblatti, is an endemic species from the Gulf of California, included in the local list of protected species. With few biological reports, this species is appreciated in the aquarium industry due to its coloration and digging behaviour, and has a considerable value. With the aim to generate valuable biological information, eight fishes were caught at Loreto Natural Marine Protected Area. Captured fishes were juveniles, and just three of them were kept in an aquarium conditioned with gravel, pieces of shells and coral as substrata. Temperature and photoperiod conditions were stable, and they were supplied with a variety of live and inert feeds. Fishes reached maturity in eight months, according to literature reports, displaying mature male courtship coloration and upward movements in the water column. Fishes spawned several times over more than two years in captivity. Presences of egg masses, or some evidence of egg shell or larvae, were registered in 50 occasions. Male took care of eggs in his shelter, but never in his mouth. Egg masses had an average of 3 592 eggs, with a hatching rate close to 99%. Eggs were apparently rounded having three diameter measurements with significant differences (1.17mm mean higher diameter, SD=0.054; 1.13mm mean lower diameter, 0.058; 0.99mm mean height, 0.045; n=125). Most of corion eggs had four, rarely six filaments; with a single oil drop (0.30mm mean diameter, 0.021, n=59). Incubation lasted 10.4 days (9-14), depending on water temperature (21.0-25.3 degrees C). Egg hatching occurred after darkness, emerging newly hatched larvae of 4.51mm mean notochord length (0.082, n=30), with reserves exhausted, eyes pigmented and mouth opened, ready to eat. This study represents the first report on this species courtship displaying, spawning and some basic characteristics of eggs masses and larvae in captivity. Also, their flexibility and adaptability of individual behaviour to particular environment conditions, lead to consider worth their commercial culture, as already occur with other species of this family.

AB  - Fisherian sex-ratio theory predicts sexual species should have a balanced primary sex ratio. However, organisms with environmental sex determination (ESD) are particularly vulnerable to experiencing skewed sex ratios when environmental conditions vary. Theoretical work has modeled sex-ratio dynamics for animals with ESD with regard to 2 traits predicted to be responsive to sex-ratio selection: 1) maternal oviposition behavior and 2) sensitivity of embryonic sex determination to environmental conditions, and much research has since focused on how these traits influence offspring sex ratios. However, relatively few studies have provided estimates of univariate quantitative genetic parameters for these 2 traits, and the existence of phenotypic or genetic covariances among these traits has not been assessed. Here, we leverage studies on 3 species of reptiles (2 turtle species and a lizard) with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) to assess phenotypic covariances between measures of maternal oviposition behavior and thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway. These studies quantified maternal behaviors that relate to nest temperature and sex ratio of offspring incubated under controlled conditions. A positive covariance between these traits would enhance the efficiency of sex-ratio selection when primary sex ratio is unbalanced. However, we detected no such covariance between measures of these categories of traits in the 3 study species. These results suggest that maternal oviposition behavior and thermal sensitivity of sex determination in embryos might evolve independently. Such information is critical to understand how animals with TSD will respond to rapidly changing environments that induce sex-ratio selection.

AB  - The Mexican tetra Astyanax mexicanus presents two contrasting morphs, a widely distributed surface morph and a cave-adapted morph. These cave-adapted morphs have evolved independently from two different lineages (i.e. 'old' and 'new' lineages); therefore, this model system gives a unique opportunity to explore parallel adaptive evolution in biological traits. The present study corresponds to the first morphological description of the Astyanax mexicanus maturation process of the spermatozoa and oocytes, using thermal and hormonal stimuli to promote spermatogenesis and oogenesis, considering surface and cave morphs from both lineages. We corroborate the relevance of thermal and hormonal stimuli to promote gamete maturation. The hormone Ovaprim (GnRHa + Domperidone) is an effective promoter of ovarian development, maturation end in oocytes and spawning in Astyanax mexicanus. The sperm morphology of Astyanax mexicanus includes the sperm head, the midpiece, and tail or flagellum. We found differences in the spermatozoan total length between environments (F = 9.929, P = 0.05) and linages (F = 49.86, P = 0.005). The oocytes showed a spherical conformation with a mean diameter of 822.4 +/- 194.1 mu m for the surface populations, and 604.6 +/- 38.3 mu m for the cave populations. The oocyte chorion presents ridges and grooves that are arranged radially towards the micropyle. A plug in the micropyle zone was observed after fertilization, confirmed by the outer membrane of the chorion, which provides some weak adhesiveness to the substrate. We observed differences in chorion thickness between the contrasting environmental conditions. This is the first morphological characterization of the Sotanos Vazquez, Escondido and Tigre, which previous to this study were only known from speleological expeditions, with no previous biological information available.

Ocean margin deoxygenation favored the preservation of organic matter in shelf sediments and is considered to reflect a Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (TOAE). Higher-level global drivers controlled temperature fluctuations, sea level evolution, oceanic circulation patterns, marine primary productivity, and stable carbon isotope excursions. Lower-level factors, controlled by individual basin bathymetry and paleogeography, operated on local to regional scale and here regulated organic matter accumulation. Accordingly, the T-OAE has been described as global event with a strong regional character. During the Toarcian, preferentially organic matter-lean sediments have been deposited at the northern Gondwana paleomargin. Enhanced connectivity to the Tethys Ocean and low marine primary productivity are considered to have been major factors preventing the formation of oxygen-deficient conditions and organic matter preservation. We here report on early Toarcian sediments from the Chaabet El Attaris Section (Tunisia), located at the northern Gondwana paleomargin that episodically became enriched in organic matter. Bio- and chemostratigraphy both confirm that organic matter-rich sediments preferentially formed during the T-OAE but also predate the T-OAE. Sedimentological and micropaleontological characterization in concert with bulk, molecular and stable isotope geochemical investigations reveal that accumulation of marine organic matter occurred under anoxic, but not under euxinic, conditions. Limitation in the supply of reactive iron regulated organic matter sulfurization indicating that during most of the depositional history the levels of free H2S in bottom waters were rather low but limited to the sediment pore water. We conclude that the chemocline was either situated within the sediment or close to the sediment water interface. Spatiotemporally-restricted occurrence of organic matter enriched sediments and anoxic pore waters was promoted by restriction in water column ventilation in a local graben structure.

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata is an insect pest that can cause a substantial reduction of the potato harvest if left uncontrolled. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a warmer climate on the Colorado potato beetle in Europe, since temperature influences the beetles' activity and development from egg to adult, and thereby the potential distribution. The study focuses in particular on the potential northward spread in the Scandinavian countries. In this region, the current climate is not warm enough to sustain the completed development of one generation in all years, and the region does not host a permanent population. Temperature data for 1961-2050 from 4 regional climate models and gridded observed data for 1961-1990 (reference period) were used for model calculations. We simulated the earliest timing of completed development of the first and second generations of the Colorado potato beetle, and assessed the geographical and inter-annual variation in the number of generations per year. The model simulations indicated a shift in the northern limit for establishment of a permanent Colorado potato beetle population by 2020-2050 in comparison with 1961-1990. In particular, the model showed a substantial increase in the frequency of years in which the temperature requirement for development of one generation was fulfilled in the transient zone, i.e. the southern part of Scandinavia. In addition, 2 generations per year may occur more frequently at the current distribution border at 55 degrees N, increasing the risk of northward migration to the Scandinavian countries.

AB  - To discover whether the beneficial effects observed when Drosophila C virus (DCVc) infects Drosophila larvae should be considered as a specific case or, as a general rule, the DCVc-Drosophila association was studied in different environments (3 host-populations, 2 temperatures, 2 viral dose). We measured pre-adult mortality, developmental time and number of ovarioles per fly. In all experiments, and, in all contaminated populations, DCVc could be considered, either a parasite since it increased pre-adult mortality, or a symbiont since it decreased developmental time and increased mean number of ovarioles. The viral dose necessary for the appearance of beneficial effects varied with population, temperature and life-cycle parameters. A sufficient number of viral particles appears necessary at a specific point in the host life-cycle for a beneficial DCVc effect on the host. DCVc does not affect the variance of any of these parameters. The observed changes in DCVc-contaminated populations were thus not a response to the selection pressure of DCVc. Two arguments support the association as an example of the ''cohabitation-without-struggle model'' and will be discussed.

AB  - Octopus mimus is an important cephalopod species in the coastal zone of Peru and Chile that is exposed to temperature variations from time to time due to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes when surface temperatures can reach 24 degrees C, 6 degrees C above typical temperatures in their habitat. The relationships between temperature and food availability are important factors that determine the recruitment of juveniles into the O. mimus population. The present study was to evaluate the relationship between thermoregulatory behavior and the age of paralarvae (summer population) to determine whether changes in this behavior occur during internal yolk consumption, making larvae more vulnerable to environmental temperature change. Oxygen consumption of paralarvae when 1-4 d old was determined to establish if respiration could be used to monitor the physiological changes that occur during yolk consumption. Horizontal thermal selection (17-30 degrees C), critical thermal maxima (CTMax), minima (CTMin), and oxygen consumption experiments were conducted with fasting paralarvae 1-4 d old at 20 degrees C. Preferred temperatures were dependent on the age of O. mimus paralarvae. One day old paralarvae selected a temperature 1.1 degrees C (23.4 degrees C) higher than 2 - 4 d old paralarvae (22.3 degrees C). The CTMax of paralarvae increased with age with values of 31.9 +/- 1.1 degrees C in 1-d-olds and 33.4 +/- 0.3 to 4-d-olds. CTMin also changed with age with low values in 2-d-old paralarvae (9.1 +/- 1.3 degrees C) and 11.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C in 4-d-old animals. The temperature tolerance range of paralarvae was age-dependent (TTD=difference between CTMax and CTMin) with higher values in 2 and 3 d old paralarvae (25-26 degrees C) as compared to 1 d old (23.1 degrees C) and 4 d old animals (22.7 degrees C). Oxygen consumption was not affected by the age of paralarvae, suggesting that mechanisms exist that compensate their metabloism until at least 4 d of age. The temperature tolerance range of a planktonic paralarvae of octopus species is presented for the first time. This range was dependent on the age of paralarvae, and so rendered the paralarvae more vunerable to a combination of high temperature and food deprivation during first days of life. Results in the present study provide evidence that O. mimus could be under ecological pressure if a climate change causes increased or decreased temperatures into their distribution range.

AB  - Zircons from 14 compositionally variable granitic rocks were examined in detail using CL image-guided micro-analysis to unravel the complex magmatic history above the southward retreating Hellenic subduction zone system in the Aegean Sea. Previously published U-Pb ages document an episodic crystallisation history from 17 to 11 Ma, with peraluminous (S-type) granitic rocks systematically older than closely associated metaluminous (I-type) granitic rocks. Zircon O- and Hf isotopic data, combined with trace element compositions, are highly variable within and between individual samples, indicative of open-system behaviour involving mantle-derived melts and evolved supracrustal sources. Pronounced compositional and thermal fluctuations highlight the role of magma mixing and mingling, in accord with field observations, and incremental emplacement of distinct melt batches coupled with variable degrees of crustal assimilation. In the course of partial fusion, more fertile supracrustal sources dominated in the earlier stages of Aegean Miocene magmatism, consistent with systematically older crystallisation ages of peraluminous granitic rocks. Differences between zircon saturation and crystallisation temperatures (deduced from zircon Ti concentrations), along with multimodal crystallisation age spectra for individual plutons, highlight the complex and highly variable physico-compositional and thermal evolution of silicic magma systems. The transfer of heat and juvenile melts from the mantle varied probably in response to episodic rollback of the subducting lithospheric slab, as suggested by punctuated crystallisation age spectra within and among individual granitic plutons.

AB  - During the course of the last century, populations of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. have undergone dramatic declines in abundance across their biogeographic range, leading to debate about the relative roles of climatic warming and overfishing in driving these changes. In this chapter, we describe the geographic distributions of this important predator of North Atlantic ecosystems and document extensive evidence for limitations of spatial movement and local adaptation from population genetic markers and electronic tagging. Taken together, this evidence demonstrates that knowledge of spatial population ecology is critical for evaluating the effects of climate change and commercial harvesting. To explore the possible effects of climate change on cod, we first describe thermal influences on individual physiology, growth, activity and maturation. We then evaluate evidence that temperature has influenced population-level processes including direct effects on recruitment through enhanced growth and activity, and indirect effects through changes to larval food resources. Although thermal regimes clearly define the biogeographic range of the species, and strongly influence many aspects of cod biology, the evidence that population declines across the North Atlantic are strongly linked to fishing activity is now overwhelming. Although there is considerable concern about low spawning stock biomasses, high levels of fishing activity continues in many areas. Even with reduced fishing effort, the potential for recovery from low abundance may be compromised by unfavourable climate and Allee effects. Current stock assessment and management approaches are reviewed, alongside newly advocated methods for monitoring stock status and recovery. However, it remains uncertain whether the rebuilding of cod to historic population sizes and demographic structures will be possible in a warmer North Atlantic.

AB  - Heat is a growing concern in cities around the word, especially in the face of climate change. Because buildings are an important component of the built environment vis-a-vis both energy use and heat resiliency in cities, we explored their climate mitigation and adaptation potential. Specifically, we investigated how design decisions interact with regard to three heat-related factors-namely, energy use/CO2 emissions, passive survivability, and heat rejection to the urban climate. We selected an archetypical building as our test case, created various design permutations, and used whole-building simulations to analyze their performance. Our simulations show that permutations of the building with a smaller carbon footprint also emit less heat to ambient air and had a better passive survivability. However, we also noted potential trade-offs (e.g., where ventilation is inadequate, increasing insulation levels for energy efficiency may hurt passive survivability). Based on our findings, we argue that, at least at a policy level, it is imperative to take advantage of the synergies, and their collective benefits. Moreover, building regulations or incentive programs should look beyond energy as the sole performance metric of interest and consider passive survivability as well as thermal interactions with urban climate.

AB  - Bacterial contamination of extended porcine semen has been associated with deleterious effects on both semen quality and sow fertility. Retrospective. prospective and in vitro studies were performed to delineate the prevalence and behavior of certain bacterial contaminants in extended semen. and antimicrobial pharmacodynamics in various semen diluents. Retrospective review of extended semen samples Submitted from North American boar studs for microbiological screening at the University of Pennsylvania Reference Andrology Laboratory in 2005 and 2006 yielded bacteriospermia prevalence rates of 17% (144/832) and 26% (256/984). respectively. In a prospective study of regional boar Studs, of 91 extended semen samples tested over I-y, 29% were positive for bacteriospermia. Retrospective and prospective studies both showed that the preponderance of contaminant positive samples occurred during the fall months (P < 0.05). To better Understand behavior of select contaminant bacteria, generation intervals were determined for Serratia marcescens (SM) and Achromobacter xylosoxidans (AX) at 16. 22 and 37 degrees C. Generation times were temperature-dependent, with intervals decreasing two- to four-fold as incubation temperature increased. Growth patterns for SM, AX and Burkholderia cepacia were evaluated in various semen diluents. The different diluents exhibited constant or episodic patterns of growth within and among bacteria throughout the 5-d test period. Kill-time kinetics at 37 degrees C of several genera of bacteria in four semen diluents containing amoxicillin, gentamicin, tylosin, and lincomycin/spectinomycin (single drug or combination) ranged from 75 to over 360 min, and was highly dependent (P < 0.05) upon both type of bacteria and semen diluent.

AB  - The functional response between ingestion rate and food concentration was determined for each larval stage of Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Artemia franciscana nauplii were supplied at 2,4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 per milliliter. The nauplii were counted by sight using a Pasteur pipette and transferred to Petri dishes containing 40 ml of brackish water (12 parts per thousand) lying on the top of black plastic. One larva at each stage was individually placed into each Petri dish containing different food density. After 24 h, each larva was removed from the Petri dish and the leftover nauplii were counted. The amount consumed was determined by the difference between the initial and final number of nauplii. Ingestion rate (I) increased as food density (P) increased and was defined by the model I=I-m(1-e(-kP)). The results suggest four levels of ingestion during larval development. The first level includes stages II, III and IV, with average maximum consumption of about 40 nauplii/day; the second level includes stages V and VI, with consumption of approximately 55 nauplii/day; the third level includes stages VII and VIII, with consumption of 80-100 nauplii/day. The fourth level includes stages IX, X and XI, in which the high values for maximum ingestion (Im) exceed the load capacity of the medium. The low values for constant k (that may correspond to the adaptability of the food to prey characteristics, such as, size, mobility, etc.) obtained for stages IX, X and XI indicated that Artemia is not an adequate prey and there is necessity of a supplementary diet.

AB  - The benthic life stage (polyp or scyphistoma) of the bloom-forming jellyfish, Aurelia aurita (Linnaeus, 1759), also known as the moon jellyfish, contributes to the seasonal occurrence and abundance of medusa blooms via asexual reproduction. A. aurita is widely distributed in coastal areas in northern Europe, and one of the most studied jellyfish species. While the physiology of the visible medusa is largely understood, understanding of the physiology of the perennial benthic life-stage is scarce. To measure the physiological tolerance of A. aurita, the scyphistoma's temperature sensitivity across its distributional range was investigated. Respiration rates of polyps from three northern European locations exposed to 11 temperatures between 2 and 22 degrees C were measured. There was a significant difference in respiration rate among the three polyp populations, which may reflect on differences in their thermal tolerance window. A critical temperature was reached at 14 degrees C with the metabolic rate decreasing below and above that temperature. This pattern was less pronounced in the Norwegian population but polyps were able to survive, at least temporarily, those temperatures exceeding their natural range. While polyps collected from northern Norway, with a narrow environmental thermal window, displayed a low baseline metabolism with a Q(10) value of 1.2, polyps from southern England and Scotland had Q(10) values of 1.6 and 2.5, respectively. Differences in polyps' respiration rates across their distributional range suggest that populations have evolved adaptations to local environmental thermal conditions.

AB  - Eco-physiological and physiological characteristics are used to study native rhizobial species for their ecological and physiological adaptability to different conditions. This study aimed to assess the eco-physiological and physiological characteristics of cowpea-nodulating rhizobia isolated from major production areas of Ethiopia. Twenty-eight isolates were isolated from cowpea root nodules and evaluated for different eco-physiological and physiological characteristics. All tested isolates grew within a temperature range of 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C. All isolates were able to grow at pH values of between 6.0 and 8.5, with optimal growth at pH around neutral. All isolates were tolerant of NaCl concentration ranging from 0.1% to 1%. The growth of isolates decreased as the salt concentration increased. The tested isolates were able to grow on different carbon sources, such as glucose (100%), fructose (100%) glycerol (100%), mannose (96.43%), lactose (96.43%), galactose (85.71%), arabinose (60.71%) and maltose (46.43%) showing that the majority of tested rhizobia were able to use a broad range of carbohydrates as sole carbon sources. Similarly, the isolates were able to grow on L-lysine (89.29%), L-arginine (92.86%), tyrosine (82.14%), L-tryptophan (89.29%), L-asparagine (78.57%), methionine (75%) and glutamate (85.71%) as a source of amino acids. The tested isolates showed a wide diversity for their tolerance to different eco-physiological conditions (temperature, pH and salt concentration) and had the ability to utilize a large variety of carbon and nitrogen sources. The variation and diversity of tolerance to different ecological conditions and utilization of different nutrients would provide them an ecological advantage and enhance their chance for survival.

AB  - The populations of the copepod species Calanits finmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus were investigated in Disko Bay during a 14-month period in 1996-1997. The three species were predominant in the copepod community. The biomass reached a maximum at the beginning of June (127 mg C m(-3)). From the end of July until the end of April the following year, the biomass was <1-6 mg C m-3. All three species showed seasonal ontogenetic migration. The spring ascent for all three species was just prior to or in association with the break-up of sea ice and the development of the spring bloom, whereas descent occurred over a larger time span during summer. The main overwintering stages were CV for C. finmarchicus, CIV and CV for C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus. Peak abundance of juvenile copepodites, representing the new generation, was in August for C. finmarchicus, in July for C. glacialis and in May/June for C. hyperboreus. From the timing of reproduction and the population development, the life cycles were deduced to be 1 year for C. finmarchicus and at least 2 years for C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus. Secondary production and potential grazing impact of the Calanus community were estimated by two methods based on specific egg-production rates and temperature-dependent production. The Calanus community was not able to control the primary producers during the spring bloom but probably did during postbloom. The estimates also indicated that grazing on ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates contributes as an essential food source in the post-bloom period.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of a strain of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xap), resistant to streptomycin sulphate, in common bean leaflets placed on the sod surface and buried at a depth of 10 and 15 cm. Four assays were carried out from November 1998 to December 2000 in Bandeirantes (Paran, Brazil). The leaflets were collected every 15 days, crushed and the dilution-plated on a semi-selective medium. Under mild temperatures and low rainfall, Xap survived for 65 to 180 days in the leaflets on the sod surface, and for 30 to 120 days in those incorporated in the soil, regardless of the depth. When higher rainfall and temperatures occurred, the survival was from 45 to 60 days in the leaflets on the sod surface and from 30 to 45 days in those buried 10 or 15 cm deep.

AB  - Diet composition can affect body temperatures selected by lizards in a thermal gradient (SBT) but there is very little evidence to Support a similar effect due to fasting. The latter could represent a means of energy conservation during periods of low food availability. This study investigated the impact of short-term food deprivation (5 days) on diurnal thermal preferences of male (n = 10) and non-reproductive female (n = 22) Anolis carolensis using a repeated measures design. Mean SBT varied significantly over the 4 h measurement period, and was higher for males than females, overall. A small but significant change in SBT was detected between the two feeding treatments, with food deprivation leading to a mean decrease ranging from 0.43 +/- 0.55 to 0.72 +/- 0.46 degreesC (at different times of day) in females and from 0.61 +/- 0.71 to 2.13 +/- 0.76 degreesC in males. Previous studies may have failed to detect such subtle trends due to a lack of statistical power arising from small sample sizes. An explanation of these differences is they represent a feeding status dependent trade-off for maintenance of energy balance versus optimal food assimilation. However, (1) the estimated energy saving, and (2) the impact on food assimilation appear rather negligible even assuming that the observed decrease in SBT produces a similar lowering of field body temperature in the wild.

AB  - This application paper concerns the modeling and control of an innovative welding process, namely, the Consumable Double-Electrode Gas Metal Arc Welding. This innovative process can dramatically increase welding productivity and reduce weld distortion. It has demonstrated the feasibility to double the travel speed for automatic welding but requires controls to realize its unique advantages. To reach this goal, the bypass voltage and base metal current were selected as process outputs to be controlled. The bypass current and main wire feed speed were selected as the inputs and the control system was reduced to two single-input-single-output (SISO) subsystems for convenient implementation and design. Physical analysis and derivation show that these subsystems can be approximated as first-order model systems but their parameters depend on manufacturing conditions. Hence, they were described using first-order interval models whose parameters are unknown but bounded by known intervals. Step response experiments were conducted with selected range of manufacturing conditions to identify a few models for each of the subsystems. These models were then used to derive two interval models. To increase the stability margin, the intervals identified were artificially enlarged. Finally, a prediction-based interval model control algorithm was used to control the resultant interval models and closed-loop control experiments verified the effectiveness of the developed control system.
   Note to Practitioners-Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is the most widely used arc welding process. However, its current melting the wire is the same as the current heating the base metal. Increasing the melting speed for higher productivity proportionally increases the base metal heat input resulting in increased distortion. To resolve this problem, the authors proposed a simple way to modify the GMAW process such that the base metal current is independent from the melting current. The melting speed can thus be increased, while the base metal heat input and resultant distortion are still controlled at given desirable levels. This modified process, referred to as the double-electrode GMAW or DE-GMAW, has been proved to be capable of doubling the travel speed for automobile welding. However, it is more complex than GMAW and requires appropriate controls to achieve its claimed advantages. This paper is devoted to the modeling and control of this innovative process.

T2  - BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE

AB  - The killifish Rivulus marmoratus, mangrove rivulus, represents the one of the two potentially truly ''mangrove dependent'' fish species in western Atlantic mangrove ecosystems. The distribution of this species closely parallels the range of red mangroves. These plants and fish exhibit parallel ecological and physiological tolerances to the wide ranges of tropical temperatures and salinities, as well as substrate and hydrological conditions of mangrove habitats. The mangrove rivulus, R. marmoratus, is, as well, the only truly marine representative of a speciose genus of otherwise freshwater fish species. Many of the biological specializations of this species characterize the specific challenges to survival in mangrove forest conditions. As recent studies report, this fish species, once considered ''rare,'' has been shown to be very abundant in specific substrate microhabitats of the mangal. Among the unique specializations of this fish are amphibious emersion from water, survival in moist detrital substrate during periods of low water or drought, and reproduction through internal self-fertilization producing homozygous clones. The autecology of this species provides fascinating insights and generates a wealth of questions regarding evolution of specific adaptations for distribution, dispersal, colonization, population genetics and the interrelationships between adaptation and specialization. The Indian River Lagoon (IRL) represents both the site of rediscovery of the fish as well as the northern frontier of the species distribution range, habitat, and ecosystem. This suggests close interrelationships and parallels in the parameters to which the species has adapted, perhaps representing a commonage, of ecological association. These aspects are discussed with respect to details and insight needed to develop strategies for the management of unique communities and ecosystems, especially along their natural distributional borders. The topic raises such questions as: Are some ''exotic species'' actually examples of newly arrived colonizers, representing dynamic biotic responses to climate change and/or anthropogenic habitat modification?

AB  - The strains of Caenorhabditis elegans displaying low (LT) and high (HT1, HT2, and HT3) thermotolerance were obtained from the wild-type N2 strain by artificial selection for thermostability of locomotion and by natural selection in laboratory for thermotolerance of fertility under tolerable environmental temperature elevation. All these strains are new genetic variants that emerged during the experiment. The worms of strains HT2 and HT3 displayed an elevated upper temperature limit for reproduction (from 26 to 27.5 degrees C), thermostability of locomotion at 36 degrees C, and survival at 37 degrees C as compared with the strain N2. The results have demonstrated that adaptation of C. elegans to high tmeperatures is an appropriate laboratory model for studying the mechanisms involved in the evolution of thermotolerance of poikilothermic Metazoa.

AB  - Sperm cryopreservation of red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus) is essentially unexplored, although many species of the Lutjanidae family are considered to be high-value commercial species. The objective of this study was to develop a species-specific cryopreservation protocol for red snapper (L. argentimaculatus) sperm by optimizing cryoprotectants and cooling rates in the cryopreservation procedure. Tell cryoprotectants at four concentrations and two freezing protocols were examined ill two separate experiments. In the first experiment, toxicity studies of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, propylene glycol (PG), ethylene glycol (EG), formamide, methanol, ethanol, sucrose, trehalose, and dimethylacetamide (DMA) on sperm motility were performed. Semen diluted 1: 1 in Ringer solution were exposed to cryoprotectants at four final concentrations of 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% for periods of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, and 120 min at room temperature (25 degrees C). The cryoprotectants and concentrations that showed the least toxic effect oil sperm motility were selected for cryopreservation trials. In the second experiment, selected cryoprotectants were then assessed for freezing capacity of sperm as follows: DMSO 5% and 10%, PG 5% and 10%, EG 5% and 10%, ethanol 5%, and methanol 5%. Semen was diluted 1:1 in Ringer solution and equilibrated with selected cryoprotectants for 10 min at room temperature. Sperm were frozen in a controlled-rate programmable freezer at four cooling rates of 3, 5, 10, and 12 degrees C/min from all initial temperature of 25 degrees C to final temperatures of -40 or -80 degrees C before plunging into liquid nitrogen. Sperm equilibrated in 10% DMSO and cooled at a rate of 10 degrees C/min to a final temperature of -80 degrees C had the highest motility (91.1 +/- 2.2%) and viability (92.7 +/- 2.3%) after thawing. The fertilization rate of frozen-thawed sperm (72.4 +/- 2.4%) was not different (P > 0.05) from that of fresh sperm (75.5 +/- 2.4%). This study apparently represents the first reported attempt for cryopreservation of L. argentimaculatus sperm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) involves the conversion of biomass to energy, producing CO2 which is sequestered, transported and then permanently stored in a suitable geological formation. Thus, a negative flow of CO2 from the atmosphere to the subsurface is established. The potential of BECCS to remove CO2 from the atmosphere (in addition to generating energy) makes it an attractive approach to help achieving the ambitious global warming targets of COP 21. BECCS has a range of variables such as the type of biomass resource, the conversion technology, the CO(2)capture process used and storage options. Each of the pathways to connect these options has its own environmental, economic and social impacts. This study attempts to integrate these impacts into a three pillar sustainability framework (3PSF) approach. As an example, the 3PSF approach is applied to bioenergy from organic waste collected from municipal solid waste (MSW). Global and Australian potentials for using municipal solid waste as resource for bioenergy and coupling it with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), was investigated. Two BECCS systems, municipal solid waste incineration with carbon capture and storage (MSW-CCS) and landfill gas combusted in gas turbine with carbon capture and storage (LFG-CCS) were modelled. In the case of business-asusual scenarios with no emission policy in place, the cost of electricity from both BECCS options is higher than for unmitigated coal power generation. However, introducing renewable energy certificate or negative emission refunding schemes has a significant impact on the economic viability of these technologies. Environmental impact assessments show that in the MSW-CCS model, for each kg of wet MSW incinerated around 0.7 kg CO2, eq is removed from the atmosphere.
   BECCS has the potential to be a valuable step towards a low-carbon energy system. However, if planned unsustainably it could compromise the natural ecosystem and social equity. The importance of the presented study is in its holistic approach to assessing the sustainability of different BECCS routes and providing a comprehensive adaptive management system that enables decision-makers to plan BECCS options in a transparent and timely manner.

AB  - Water temperature, as one of the important water environment impact factors, has a significant impact on the survival and development of aquatic organisms. We selected water temperature data (1959-2017) from four key hydrological stations in the Yangtze River: Cuntan, Yichang, Hankou, and Datong. We analyzed the characteristics and variability of the Yangtze River hydrothermal regime by the Mann-Kendall method, wavelet analysis, and by the IHA-RVA method to analyze hydrothermal regime variations of the Yangtze River, and the response mechanisms of fish to variations in hydrothermal regimes were explored. The results show that (1) The annual average water temperature of the Yangtze River is warming, and Cuntan Station, Yichang Station, Hankou Station, and Datong Station have a sudden increase in temperature in 2002, 1995, 2003, and 2004, and the periodicity analysis demonstrates that Cuntan, Yichang, and Datong stations all have main periods of 24~32 years; (2) The overall variations of 32 hydrothermal indicators at Cuntan Station and Yichang Station reached 65% and 61%, which are close to the height variation; (3) With the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the stagnant cooling effect caused the arrival date of the upper reproduction water temperature of "The four major fish species " to be delayed by about 23 days, and the stagnant heat effect caused the arrival date of the Chinese sturgeon reproduction upper limit water temperature to be delayed by about 30 days.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of adaptation to spatio-temporal environmental variation is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. This issue also has important implications for anticipating biological responses to contemporary climate warming and determining the processes by which invasive species are able to spread rapidly across broad geographic ranges. Here, we compare data from a historical study of latitudinal variation in photoperiodic response among Japanese and U. S. populations of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus with contemporary data obtained using comparable methods. Our results demonstrated rapid adaptive evolution of the photoperiodic response during invasion and range expansion across similar to 15 degrees of latitude in the United States. In contrast to the photoperiodic response, size-based morphological traits implicated in climatic adaptation in a wide range of other insects did not show evidence of adaptive variation in Ae. albopictus across either the U. S. (invasive) or Japanese (native) range. These results show that photoperiodism has been an important adaptation to climatic variation across the U. S. range of Ae. albopictus and, in conjunction with previous studies, strongly implicate the photoperiodic control of seasonal development as a critical evolutionary response to ongoing contemporary climate change. These results also emphasize that photoperiodism warrants increased attention in studies of the evolution of invasive species.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions in Lebanon mainly come from energy activities, which are responsible for 85% of all CO2 emissions. The CO2-emissions from energy use in manufacturing industries and construction represent 24% of the total emissions of the energy sector. Lebanese manufacturers' accounted for 39.15 million gigajoules of fuel consumption for heat and power generation in 1994, including both fuel used directly and fuel burned remotely to generate electricity used in the sector. In addition to being processed by combustion, CO2 is generated in calcining of carbonates in the manufacture of cement, iron and glass. Electricity, the most expensive form of energy, represented 25.87% of all fuel used for heat and power. Residual fuel oil and diesel, which are used mainly in direct combustion processes, represent 26.85 and 26.55% of all energy use by industry, respectively. Scenarios for future energy use and CO2 emissions are developed for the industrial sector in Lebanon. The development of the baseline scenario relied on available data on major plants' outputs, and on reported amounts of fuels used by the industrial sector as a whole. Energy use in industry and the corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Lebanon are projected in baseline scenarios that reflect technologies, activities and practices that are likely to evolve from the base year 1994 to year 2040, Mitigation work targets a 15% of CO2 emissions from the baseline scenario by year 2005 and a 20-30% reduction of CO2 emissions by year 2040. The mitigation options selected for analysis are screened on the basis of GHG emissions and expert judgement on the viability of their wide-scale implementation and economic benefits. Using macroeconomic assessment and energy price assumptions, the final estimates of potential GHG emissions and reduction costs of various mitigation scenarios are calculated. The results show that the use of efficient electric motors, efficient boilers and furnaces with fuel switching from fuel oil to natural gas has the largest impact on GHG emissions at a levelized annual cost that ranges from -20 to -5 US$/tonne of CO2 reduced. The negative costs are indicative of direct savings obtained in energy cost for those mitigation options. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The ladybird beetle Stethorus gilvifrons is a native predator of spider mites in the Mediterranean region that could be mass-reared and released to control spider mite populations on crop plants. The aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that brine shrimp cysts can improve diets for mass rearing of S. gilvifrons in the absence of prey, i.e., spider mites. The diet treatments included brine shrimp cysts alone (D1), brine shrimp cysts plus a vitamin B complex (D2), brine shrimp cysts plus date palm pollen (D3), or brine shrimp cysts plus date palm pollen and Mediterranean flour moth eggs (D4). The results revealed that only two diets, D3 and D4, supported predator development to the adult stage and reproduction. The predator reproductive rate and life table estimates indicated that D4 was superior. In conclusion, only a mixed diet of brine shrimp cysts, date palm pollen, and flour moth eggs is suitable for mass rearing S. gilvifrons. Stethorus gilvifrons is an acarophagous coccinellid distributed in the Mediterranean region and could potentially be mass-reared for the augmentative biological control of Tetranychus turkestani and related species on crop plants. The hypothesis that brine shrimp Artemia franciscana cysts can improve diets for rearing of S. gilvifrons was tested in laboratory experiments. The diet treatments included A. franciscana cysts (D1), A. franciscana cysts plus a vitamin B complex (D2), A. franciscana cysts plus date palm pollen (D3), and A. franciscana cysts plus date palm pollen and Ephestia kuehniella eggs (D4). The results indicated that D1 did not support immature development. D2 supported egg-larval development but not pupal-adult development. Both D3 and D4 supported development to the adult stage and reproduction. However, D4 was the most effective diet, determined by observations of S. gilvifrons oviposition behavior and fecundity. A life table analysis corroborated these results; an intrinsic rate of increase, net and gross reproductive rates, and mean generation time were best for S. gilvifrons fed D4 rather than D3. A mixed diet composed of A. franciscana cysts, date palm pollen, and E. kuehniella eggs can be used to mass rear S. gilvifrons.

AB  - P>Adaptive trait introgression is increasingly recognized as common. However, it is unclear whether adaptive genetic exchanges typically affect only a single trait, or instead affect multiple aspects of the phenotype. Here, we examine introgression of abiotic tolerance traits between two hybridizing North American sunflower species, Helianthus annuus and Helianthus debilis.
   In two common gardens in the hybrid range, we measured 10 ecophysiological, phenological, and architectural traits for parents and their natural and artificial hybrids, and examined how fitness covaried with trait values.
   Eight of the 10 traits showed patterns consistent with introgression from H. debilis into H. annuus, and suggested that H. debilis-like traits allowing rapid growth and reproduction before summer heat and drought have been favored in the hybrid range. Natural selection currently favors BC1 hybrids with H. debilis-like branching traits.
   We demonstrate that introgression has altered multiple aspects of the H. annuus phenotype in an adaptive manner, has affected traits relevant to both biotic and abiotic environments, and may have aided expansion of the H. annuus range into central Texas, USA.

AB  - Spatially-explicit individual-based simulation models provide a valuable tool for exploring complex ecological and evolutionary processes that are not easily empirically measured. Here, we present modifications of a spatially-explicit individual-based simulation model (CDMetaPOP) to accommodate a two-species system and simulations involving interspecific hybridization. We first describe how a hybrid (H) index is used to distinguish individuals of interspecific descent from those of either parental species. User-defined thresholds provide flexibility in the degree of admixture tolerated for classifying 'pure' individuals. We then detail relationships further informed by the H index, including individual growth, temperature-based fitness and selection, and mate preference behavior. Empirically derived species- and system-specific information can be incorporated into these relationships, for example, to produce differential growth among hybrids and parental species. Lastly, we demonstrate an application of this simulation framework by exploring the relative effects of temperature-based selection, mate preference behavior, and hybrid fitness on the rate and spatial extent of sympatric hybridization between two native riverine fish species, bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), in the upper Skagit River system (United States and Canada). Results from this demonstration provide guidance for future empirical studies of bull trout, a federally threatened species. Understanding factors that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of hybridization, as well as the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon, is of increasing importance given shifting species ranges due to large-scale landscape modification and a changing global climate. Our framework can be used to study a wide range of hybridization dynamics in any terrestrial or aquatic system, including comparisons of distinct environmental conditions or potential management responses.

AB  - Plant diversity, like that of most other taxonomic groups, peaks in the tropics, where climatic conditions are warm and wet, and it declines toward the temperate and polar zones as conditions become colder and drier, with more seasonally variable temperatures. Climate and evolutionary history are often considered competing explanations for the latitudinal gradient, but they are linked by the evolutionarily conserved environmental adaptations of species and the history of Earth's climate system. The tropical conservatism hypothesis (TCH) invokes niche conservatism, climatic limitations on establishment and survival, and paleoclimatic history to explain the latitudinal diversity gradient. Here, we use latitudinal distributions for over 12,500 woody angiosperm species, a fossil-calibrated supertree, and null modeling to test predictions of the TCH. Regional assemblages in the northern and southern temperate zones are less phylogenetically diverse than expected based on their species richness, because temperate taxa are clustered into relatively few clades. Moreover, lineages with temperate affinities are generally younger and nested within older, more tropical lineages. As predicted by the TCH, the vast majority of temperate lineages have arisen since global cooling began at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (34 Mya). By linking physiological tolerances of species to evolutionary and biogeographic processes, phylogenetic niche conservatism may provide a theoretical framework for a generalized explanation for Earth's predominant pattern of biodiversity.

AB  - Some fishes. including bluegills Lepomis macrochirus, have highest critical swimming speeds at their preferred temperatures; however, it is not known why fishes select temperatures that are optimal for performance. This paper examines the relationship between selected temperatures and critical swimming speeds for bluegills to test the hypothesis that fishes select temperatures in response to available power. A rationale is presented that available power is a useful short-term measure of fitness among intraspecific competitors, that Fry's scope for activity is a measure of available power, and that critical swimming speed is a function of Fry's scope for activity and can be used as a measure of available power. Results of this study supported the hypothesis by demonstrating that for each acclimation temperature, critical swimming speeds of bluegills were highest at preferred temperatures, and decreased at other temperatures with frequency of time spent at those temperatures, although the exact nature of the relationship has yet to be determined. These results supported the concept that fishes select temperatures on the basis of available power and have implications for quantifying and predicting the energetic cost of exposure of fish to sublethal temperatures.

AB  - Ecological differentiation of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, and another drosophilid, Zaprionus tuberculatus, in "Evolution Canyon," Mount Carmel, Israel, is well established. The fitness complex of D. melanogaster includes oviposition temperature preferences, tolerance to high temperature, drought stress and starvation, and different longevity patterns. This remarkable differentiation has evolved despite small interslope distances (only 100-400 m). within easy dispersal distance. The differences between populations are those expected from genetic adaptation to local microclimates. How such differentiation could evolve and be maintained despite the likelihood of genetic exchange between populations is a challenging question. We hypothesized that interslope microclimatic differences caused strong differential selection for stress tolerance, accompanied by behavioral differentiation (habitat choice and reduced migration rate), reinforced by sexual isolation. Here we report highly significant mate choice by flies from different slopes of the canyon, with preference for sexual partners originating from the same slope. No preferences were found when the sexual partners belonged to different isofemale lines from the same slope.

AB  - Identifying the key climatic parameters controlling a tree species' growth in a given environment can improve our understanding of the species' adaptability to climate change. However, this can be significantly affected by the detection and analytical methodologies used, at least for water-limited ecosystems. To address this issue, we tested together for the first time the five key methods widely applied for detecting climatic drivers of tree growth. The test was applied on the growth dynamics of Pinus pinea L. (the last ca. 130 years) and for evaluating its climatic sensitivity (the last ca. 60 years), under contrasting climatic conditions, from sites in Italy and Greece. As predictors, we selected a high number of seasonal, annual, and multi-annual climate integration periods (626 variables in total for precipitation and SPEI) through running correlation analysis. Methods that retain low-frequency variability and persistence of past climatic signals in radial growth (ABD, RCS, and raw BAI) revealed that long-term precipitation accumulated over 3-6 years was the key driver for P. pinea growth in the wettest sites. These signals probably appeared because of the cumulative effects of past years' rainfall in determining water table levels. They would have been missed if low-frequency climate and growth variability were not considered, how it happens using standardized BAI and TRW. In the driest site, productivity was low and explained by 1-2 years precipitation signals, suggesting that mostly moisture stored in topsoil from more recent rainfall sustained P. pinea growth, a typical shallow-rooted species. Thus, the loss in root contact with the declining water table may explain the higher vulnerability to drought stress at its dry-end distribution range, particularly under low precipitation. A further drop in water table levels, driven by global warming, will most likely increase such vulnerability. Hence, conservation efforts will require maintaining a stable water table, prohibiting groundwater overexploitation at P. pinea habitats. Reducing competition from other deeper rooted tree species, better adapted to drought and fire, may further benefit the species' conservation status.

AB  - In this study, an inductive heat treatment-filling system for milk pasteurization was designed and constructed. To identify the design parameters of the system, basic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and lethality (reduction of a target pathogen during heating or thermal destruction of microorganisms) analyses were carried out simultaneously. In this context, the temperature-time combination of heated milk related to pipe design was taken into consideration. Induction calculations were made to provide the necessary heating for the selected flow rate and pipe construction material and diameter. Required frequency, power, and optimum coil design for the system were identified and validated. In the study, analyses were made for three different temperatures (90, 120, 150 degrees C) with different designs (straight pipe, flow breaker blades on the surface, central shaft) to define the required pipe length to obtain milk temperature (85 degrees C). Pipe dimensions were evaluated by CFD design and the shortest pipe length was 540 mm for the pipe having surface modification at 150 degrees C. However, for simplicity and applicability, a straight pipe at 90 degrees C constant surface temperature was selected for prototyping. From lethality calculations, 80 degrees C outlet temperature for 2700 mm pipe length was found to be sufficient and these parameters were considered for calculating induction parameters such as coil design and induction power. Experimental validation showed that heat balance was achieved compared to CFD calculations for the given system in steady condition; however, 130 s is required for reaching steady condition and this gap can be considered as come-up time. Although heat provided by induction was sufficient to heat milk to the desired temperature at the given pipe length, time was needed to heat the pipe to 90 degrees C with 25 degrees C milk passing inside at 1 L/s capacity.

AB  - Temperature is an important factor in affecting population dynamics and diffusion distribution of organisms. Alien species can successfully invade and colonize to various temperature environments, and one of important reasons is that alien species have a strong resistance to stress temperature. Recently, researchers have focused on the mechanisms of temperature sensing to determine the sensing and regulation mechanisms of temperature adaptation. The transient receptor potential (TRP) is one of the key components of an organism's temperature perception system. TRP plays important roles in perceiving temperature, such as avoiding high temperature, low temperature and choosing the optimum temperature. To assess high temperature sensation and the heat resistance role of the TRP gene, we used 3' and 5' rapid-amplification of cDNA ends to isolate the full-length cDNA sequence of the TRP gene from Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) MEAM1 (Middle East Asia Minor 1), examined the mRNA expression profile under various temperature conditions, and identified the heat tolerance function. This is the first study to characterize the TRP gene of invasive B. tabaci MEAM1 (MEAM1 BtTRP). The full-length cDNA of MEAM1 BtTRP was 3871 bp, and the open reading frames of BtTRP was 3501 bp, encoding 1166 amino acids. Additionally, the BtTRP mRNA expression level was significantly increased at 35 degrees C. Furthermore, compared with control treatments, the survival rate of B. tabaci MEAM1 adults was significantly decreased under high temperature stress conditions after feeding with dsRNA BtTRP. Collectively, these results showed that MEAM1 BtTRP is a key element in sensing high temperature and plays an essential role in B. tabaci MEAM1 heat tolerance ability. Our data improved our understanding of the mechanism of temperature sensation in B. tabaci MEAM1 at the molecular level and could contribute to the understanding of the thermal biology of B. tabaci MEAM1 within the context of global climate change.

AB  - Thermal and microstructural evolution during hot rolling of low carbon steel in a continuous six stand mill are simulated with a two-dimensional finite difference model. The cross-sectional area of the strip is divided into small elements of equal volume in order to evaluate heat conduction within it. It is assumed that the heat transfer coefficients at the surface of the strip change as the strip is on air, or is being descaled or deformed. Results from the microstructural modelling indicate that the austenite is able to recrystallize dynamically when the conditions within the roil-gap are propitious. The model also allows for the occurrence of metadynamic and static recrystallization, once the material leaves the gap, and for grain growth after their completion. The thermal portion of the model is validated with measurements conducted on the mill being simulated, Although it is not possible to do the same with the microstructural portion, inclusion of their kinetics has allowed the reproduction of rolling loads during actual production.

AB  - Hurricanes are powerful, energetic storms that can be fueled by warm ocean waters, while simultaneously driving transport and mixing under their path. Wind-driven mixing is an important mechanism for generating internal waves, and hurricanes are capable of generating particularly high levels of mixing. The internal waves in turn allow diapycnal mixing in the ocean, accelerating heat transfer from the near surface to deeper waters. This plays a role in global thermohaline circulation, affecting heat transfer and therefore density properties throughout the oceans. However, while the importance of internal waves is well established, direct measurements of hurricane-generated internal waves over the shelf and slope regions are scarce. As a result, the mechanisms for the generation of these waves by storms are poorly understood. Here we examine the high frequency response and generation of internal waves by Hurricane Ivan as it travelled over the continental shelf edge and slope in the Gulf of Mexico. Velocity data were collected as part of the Naval Research Laboratory's Shelf Energetics and Exchange Dynamics (SEED) experiment. Moorings consisted of Trawl Resistant Bottom Mounts (TRBMs) in the form of a dome-shaped pod known as a Barny due to its barnacle-like shape. The Barnies housed ADCPs and wave/tide gauges, and during the hurricane were subject to extreme current conditions. In particular, over the shelf where water depths are 60 - 90m and surface waves reached significant wave heights of at least 20 m, bottom currents generated by these waves were over 2 m s(-1). Despite these extreme conditions, which set the nearby National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy 42040 adrift, the Barnies proved themselves to be robust, and continued to measure water velocity and pressure both during and after the hurricane's presence in the region. This was the first test of the instrumentation setup under these extreme conditions, and their survival allowed a unique suite of measurements to be made which would not have otherwise been possible.
   Two distinct responses were observed over the shallow shelf edge (similar to 90 m) and the deep slope (similar to 500 - 1000 m). During the forcing stage of the hurricane over the shelf edge, internal wave motions were found to be three-dimensional, and after the passage of the hurricane velocity fluctuations became primarily horizontal and lasted about 3 days. Over the slope, inertial (f) and super-inertial waves with frequencies of 2f, 3f, 4f and higher were excited by the hurricane. These super-inertial waves persisted for 2-4 days while near-inertial waves lasted more than a week. The super-inertial fluctuations were found near bottom over the slope (500 - 1000 m) where kinetic energy levels were at least 25 times larger than the kinetic energy level during calm weather, indicating that turbulent dissipation rates and eddy diffusivities increased by two orders of magnitude. The storm-generated super-inertial motions have the potential to enhance mixing in the deeper part of the thermocline. The storm-generated super-inertial motions lead to mixing both along and across isopycnals, acting as a potential vector for warmer waters to reach the deep ocean.

AB  - Adipose tissue function changes with development. In the newborn, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is essential for ensuring effective adaptation to the extrauterine environment, and its growth during gestation is largely dependent on glucose supply from the mother to the fetus. The amount, location and type of adipose tissue deposited can also determine fetal glucose homeostasis. Adipose tissue first appears at around mid-gestation. Total adipose mass then increases through late gestation, when it comprises a mixture of white and brown adipocytes. BAT possesses a unique uncoupling protein, UCP1, which is responsible for the rapid generation of large amounts of heat at birth. Then, during postnatal life some, but not all, depots are replaced by white fat. This process can be utilised to investigate the physiological conversion of brown to white fat, and how it is re-programmed by nutritional changes in pre- and postnatal environments. A reduction in early BAT deposition may perpetuate through the life cycle, thereby suppressing energy expenditure and ultimately promoting obesity. Normal fat development profiles in the offspring are modified by changes in maternal diet at defined stages of pregnancy, ultimately leading to adverse long-term outcomes. For example, excess macrophage accumulation and the onset of insulin resistance occur in an adipose tissue depot-specific manner in offspring born to mothers fed a suboptimal diet from early to mid-gestation. In conclusion, the growth of the different fetal adipose tissue depots varies according to maternal diet and, if challenged in later life, this can contribute to insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis.

AB  - Spatial autocorrelation is a correlation between the values of a single variable, considering their geographical locations. This concept has successfully been used for multi-site generation of daily precipitation data (Khalili et al. in J Hydrometeorol 8(3):396-412, 2007). This paper presents an extension of this approach. It aims firstly to obtain an accurate reproduction of the spatial intermittence property in synthetic precipitation amounts, and then to extend the multi-site approach to the generation of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature and solar radiation data. Monthly spatial exponential functions have been developed for each weather station according to the spatial dependence of the occurrence processes over the watershed, in order to fulfill the spatial intermittence condition in the synthetic time series of precipitation amounts. As was the case for the precipitation processes, the multi-site generation of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature and solar radiation data is realized using spatially autocorrelated random numbers. These random numbers are incorporated into the weakly stationary generating process, as with the Richardson weather generator, and with no modifications made. Suitable spatial autocorrelations of random numbers allow the reproduction of the observed daily spatial autocorrelations and monthly interstation correlations. The Peribonca River Basin watershed is used to test the performance of the proposed approaches. Results indicate that the spatial exponential functions succeeded in reproducing an accurate spatial intermittence in the synthetic precipitation amounts. The multi-site generation approach was successfully applied for the weather data, which were adequately generated, while maintaining efficient daily spatial autocorrelations and monthly interstation correlations.

AB  - In September 1993, a colony of Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera:Coccinellidae) was imported from France into Greece. In 1994, insectary-reared adults were released in II citrus orchards in four citrus-growing areas of Greece. Between May 19 and June 8, 1994, H. axyridis was recovered from a total of seven localities in three of these areas. This species was established on orange, mandarin and sour orange trees heavily infested with Toxoptera aurantii, Aphis spiraecola and A. gossypii; its absence from the remaining four localities may have been the result of low prey densities. Twenty-three days after the initial releases, H. axyridis larvae comprised 57.9% and 83.3%, respectively, of the aphidophagous coccinellid larval populations in two localities (on Chios Island). In samples taken at Leonidion 43 days after the introduction release, both adult and larval populations of H. axyridis represented approximately one-third of aphidophagous coccinellid adults and larvae found, whereas the indigenous Adalia bipunctata comprised about one-half of the population. In cages placed outside the Athens laboratory, H. axyridis completed four overlapping generations annually; average longevities of 56.2, 66.8, 78.9 and 102.2 days, respectively, were recorded for the successive generations. Adults of the 3rd and 4th generations overwintered, giving rise to the following year's Ist generation. Oviposition began in April and emergence of Ist generation adults occurred in mid-May. The egg-laying activity of the females throughout the warm period of the year indicates that H. axyridis does not diapause in summer. From December until March, small aggregations (2-4 individuals) were observed within the cages at protected sites.

AB  - Most animals advertise their unprofitability to potential predators via conspicuous signals. Whether the strength of this aposematic signal indicates the quality and quantity of chemical defenses in animals is controversial. Here, we investigated the relationship between the conspicuousness of an aposematic signal and toxicity, which likely depends, at least in part, on dietary sources, in the newt Cynops pyrrhogaster. Our results indicate that the magnitude of the aposematic signal was not correlated with the amount of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 6-epi TTX of wild individuals among populations. Using atoxic newts, reared from eggs, we compared the ability to accumulate TTX from diets between mainland and island populations. Newts of a mainland population that exhibited a less conspicuous signal accumulated more TTX than did equivalent newts of an insular population that displayed a more conspicuous signal; this was unrelated to variation in the toxicity of wild individuals of these two populations. We also found toxicity of wild newts changed over approximately one generation (10 years) in both populations. These results indirectly suggest that environmental variance, such as fluctuations in TTX resources in nature, may obscure differences in the ability of wild newts to accumulate TTX, and that this variation may be responsible for a lack of correlation between the strength of a newt's signal and its toxicity in the wild. These results imply that toxicity of wild individuals likely is a phenotypic trait largely dependent on environmental conditions.

AB  - Background and objective Hypothermia is a common problem especially in preterm neonates and has been associated with increased neonatal mortality and morbidities. The objective of our study was to look into the distribution of admission temperature among VLBW neonates getting admitted to the NICU, association of admission temperatures to selected neonatal morbidities/mortality, and to evaluate for modifiable factors contributing to hypothermia. Methods Infants with birth weight between 500 and 1499 g and gestation >= 25 weeks without major congenital malformations delivered between October 2017 and March 2020 who were admitted directly from the delivery room to the NICU were included in the study. Data were collected prospectively on perinatal/birth characteristics to look for their association with admission hypothermia, and to look into the association of admission temperature with selected neonatal morbidities/mortality. Results There were a total of 538 neonates with the mean birth weight of 1206 +/- 271 g included in the study. Mean admission temperature was 35.8 +/- 1.3 degrees C. Low delivery room temperature was the most important contributor to admission hypothermia. Also, 3.3% of neonates were hyperthermic at admission to NICU, all of them having been delivered to mothers with intrapartum pyrexia. On adjusted analysis, we found that low admission temperature significantly increased therisk of adverse composite neonatal outcomes with admission temperature < 34.5 degrees C having 42% increased risk of the adverse outcome when compared to normothermic neonates. Conclusion Admission hypothermia remains a common problem in preterm neonates which is significantly associated with adverse neonatal outcome.

AB  - Sewage treatment plants are designed to purify wastewaters for given parameters, but their microbiological effectiveness is often poor without addition of a specific treatment (disinfection, filtration, etc.). Large amounts of enteric bacteria are thus released into the environment, in rivers and seawater. Is their subsequent survival in these hostile environments influenced by their previous stay in wastewaters? In order to assess this potential adaptation, we studied the behavior of E. coli, S. typhimurium and S. manhattan in seawater microcosms, with and without a previous 24 to 72 h stay in raw and treated wastewaters. The seawater and wastewater media were 0.22 pm filtered and autoclaved. The protocol followed is outlined in Fig. 1. At each step, bacteria were harvested by filtration and re-suspended in the following medium. All microcosms were maintained at 20 degrees C, in the dark. Seven experiments were carried out, testing seven different wastewaters. The survival of the inoculated bacteria in seawater during 6 days was monitored by plate counts on trypticsoy agar and by acridine orange epifluorescence counts (Hobble et al., 1977). In two experiments, the bacterial enzymatic activity was assessed before and after the stay in seawater, using APIZYM kits. S. typhimurium's survival in seawater was increased when cells had previously spent 24 h in raw wastewaters, and 24 and 48 h in treated wastewaters (Fig. 3). The culturable count was about 2 log units higher after 6 days. The same phenomenon was observed for S. manhattan tested in two raw wastewaters (Fig. 4). For this strain, with a concentrated inoculum (7 x 10(6)/ml), survival was quite the same, with or without a previous stay in raw sewage. An adaptation of E. coli while in wastewater to subsequent seawater stress seemed less obvious (Fig. 5). While monitoring the behavior of enteric bacteria in seawater with different previous conditions, we assessed the ratio of culturable cells in the total population. Thus, loss of culturability of tested strains was smaller when bacteria had been put in wastewaters before seawater (Table 1). This could show that the level of cellular metabolism maintained was higher in this case. This hypothesis was confirmed by studying the enzymatic activity of S. typhimurium before and after 6 days in seawater (Fig. 6). A previous stay in sewage could preserve or even induce some enzymatic activity which was then maintained during the entire exposition to seawater. This suggests an active metabolism enabling new protein synthesis. In this study, we showed that Enterobacteriaceae could adapt to seawater stress during their stay in sewage and sewage treatment plants. The actual mechanism is not yet clear. It could be osmoprotection, modification of cellular metabolism, or another. Very few studies have dealt with this topic. Munro et al. (1987, 1989) observed that a previous culture in a saline medium or on a mixed wastewater/seawater agar could allow better E. coli survival in seawater. The osmoregulation mechanisms induced by high osmolarity are probably set up during this phase. This hypothesis cannot explain our results, since the wastewaters we used had very low osmolarity. It seems that adaptation to drastic conditions occurs during the stay in wastewater (lower temperature, lack of easily assimilated substrates, etc.) allowing fdr better survival in more drastic seawater conditions. This conclusion may be of great importance in assessing the sanitary quality of coastal areas used for bathing and shellfishing activities.

AB  - Remarkably diverse bacteria have been observed as biofilm aggregates on the surface of deep-sea invertebrates that support the growth of hosts through chemosynthetic carbon fixation. Growing evidence also indicates that community-wide interactions, and especially cooperation among symbionts, contribute to overall community productivity. Here, metagenome-guided meta-transcriptomic and metabolic analyses were conducted to investigate the taxonomic composition, functions, and potential interactions of symbionts dwelling on the seta of Shinkaia crosnieri lobsters in a methane cold seep. Methylococcales and Thiotrichales dominated the community, followed by the Cam pylobacteriales, Nitrosococcales, Havobacteriales, and Chitinophagales Metabolic interactions may be common among the episymbionts since many separate taxon genomes encoded complementary genes within metabolic pathways. Specifically, Thiotrichales could contribute to detoxification of hydroxylamine that is a metabolic by-product of Methylococcales. Further, Nitrosococcales may rely on methanol leaked from Methylococcales cells that efficiently oxidize methane. Elemental sulfur may also serve as a community good that enhances sulfur utilization that benefits the overall community, as evidenced by confocal Raman microscopy. Stable intermediates may connect symbiont metabolic activities in cyclical oxic-hypoxic fluctuating environments, which then enhance overall community functioning. This hypothesis was partially confirmed via in situ experiments. These results highlight the importance of microbe-microbe interactions in symbiosis and deep-sea adaptation.
   IMPORTANCE Symbioses between chemosynthetic bacteria and marine invertebrates are common in deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems and are considered critical foundations for deep-sea colonization. Episymbiotic microorganisms tend to form condensed biofilms that may facilitate metabolite sharing among biofilm populations. However, the prevalence of metabolic interactions among deep-sea episymbionts and their contributions to deep-sea adaptations are not well understood due to sampling and cultivation difficulties associated with deep-sea environments. Here, we investigated metabolic interactions among the episymbionts of Shinkaia crosnieri, a dominant chemosynthetic ecosystem lobster species in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Meta-omits characterizations were conducted alongside in situ experiments to validate interaction hypotheses. Furthermore, imaging analysis was conducted, including electron microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and confocal Raman microscopy (CRM), to provide direct evidence of metabolic interactions. The results support the Black Queen Hypothesis, wherein leaked public goods are shared among cohabitating microorganisms to enhance the overall adaptability of the community via cooperation.

AB  - Tilapia is the common. name applied to three genera of fish in the family Cichlidae: Oreochromis, Sarotherodon, and Tilapia. The species that are most important for aquaculture are in the genus Oreochromis, including the Nile tilapia, O. niloticus, the Mozambique tilapia, O. mossambicus, the blue tilapia, O. aureus, and O. urolepis hornorum. Fish farmers are now growing many strains of these parent species along with many hybrid strains. Native to Africa and the Middle East, these species have become the second most common farm raised food fish in the world.
   In the 1960s and 1970s tilapia culture was aimed at the production of food for local consumption, utilizing primarily extensive or semiintensive culture methods with minimal inputs of fertilizer or feeds. However, tilapia culture has expanded rapidly during the last decade as a result of technological advances associated with the intensification of culture practices. These include the development of new strains and hybrids, monosex male culture, formulated diets, a variety of semiintensive and intensive cult-Lire systems (e.g., ponds, cages, tanks, and raceways) and the utilization of greenhouses, geothermal, or industrial waste heat and advanced water treatment methods. Marketing programs have also nurtured a growing demand for tilapia in domestic and international markets. Annual worldwide production of cultured tilapia was less than 200,000 metric tons (mt) in 1984 and increased to 1,100,000 nit in 1999.
   In the Americas, the increased production of farmed tilapia is due in large part to their adaptability to a diverse array of production systems. These include subsistence level, extensive pond culture in the Eastern Caribbean, integrated animal-fish culture in Guatemala and Panama, semiintensive pond culture in Honduras, intensive pond culture in Colombia, Costa-Rica and Jamaica, semiintensive cage culture in several countries, intensive flowthrough tank and raceway culture in the U.S., and a variety of highly intensive indoor recirculating tank cult-Lire in the U.S. In addition, there is increasing production of tilapia in shrimp ponds in Ecuador to ameliorate shrimp disease problems. In this article, representatives of various systems are compared with respect to technological approaches and constraints.
   Poor management of tilapia genetic resources is causing a loss of productivity, and research in genetics and selective breeding will be needed to improve production efficiency, fillet yields, and environmental tolerance. Continuing nutritional studies will also be needed to increase efficiency and profitability. With intensification, infectious diseases have become more serious, and fish health management through biosecurity procedures, environmental manipulation, reduction of stress, nutrition, genetics, and the use of prophylactic therapeutics will be essential. Increasing waste production will require novel methods for integrating tilapia culture with the production of other valuable crops to maximize nutrient recovery and minimize pollution. Market development and quality control will be critical to ensure market growth.

AB  - The difficulties of the phenomenological analysis of the weak s-component and the need for a comparison with the astrophysical picture are discussed. New results of s-process calculations in massive stars during both core He and shell C burning are presented. They are obtained after adopting an updated nuclear network, which includes the deviation from the 1/v trends of neutron capture cross sections, as well as an extrapolation of beta decay rates to the high temperatures characterizing carbon burning. For a complete discussion of the branching at Kr-85, we additionally present a new measurement of the ''Rb neutron capture cross section. The reproduction of the weak component by successive stellar generations is investigated through a global check which takes into account the interference of the main component in the atomic mass range from Fe to Sr. Consequently, the results of s-processing in low-mass stars during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase are also considered, starting from the same set of revised nuclear parameters. A satisfactory match of the solar s-abundances is reached, where the problem of the Kr-86 overproduction by the main component is overcome by varying the [sigma(n, gamma)] of Kr-84, Kr-85, Kr-86 inside their present uncertainties, and by considering an additional contribution to [sigma(n,gamma)](Kr-86] at low temperature by direct captures or undetected resonances. A detailed analysis of the neutron flow at branchings and at bottleneck points is performed, stressing the analogies and differences between the phenomenological and astrophysical picture.

AB  - Studies were conducted to investigate the non-specific immune responses and disease-resistance of juvenile turbot Scophthalmus maximus, cultured at four different salinities (8, 20, 32 and 40). Three concentrations (3.75x10(7), 3.75x10(8) and 3.75x10(9) CFU/ml) of Vibrio anguillarum suspension were employed at each salinity to determine the 4-day LD(50). The serum lysozyme activity, the alternative complement pathway activity (ACH50) and the phagocytosis percentage of head kidney in turbot were tested at 24, 48 and 72 h post-challenge of V. anguillarum (1.1x10(8) CFU/ml, 0.1 ml), respectively, to evaluate the non-specific immune responses at the selected rearing salinities. Fish reared at salinity 20 had the lowest mortality, namely, the highest 4-day LD(50) value (8.88 +/- 0.17). Besides, the lysozyme activity, ACH50 and the phagocytosis of turbot were the highest at the salinity 20, but with the lowest at the salinity 40 treatment regardless of sampling time. In addition, the non-specific immune activities kept increasing within 72 h post-challenge of V. anguillarum, except that the lysozyme activity increased from 24 to 48 h, and then decreased from 48 to 72 h at 40 significantly. These results together indicate that rearing in intermediate salinity (20) was able to enhance the immunity and disease-resistance of turbot.

AB  - Evidence derived from in vivo and in vitro laboratory experiments, controlled human exposure studies, and epidemiological studies on mortality and morbidity point to a positive correlation between acid aerosol inhalation and lung impairment. The lung has two important lines of defense against acid aerosols: ii neutralization by oral or nasal airway ammonia and 2) buffering by mucus lining of the airway. A mathematical model is developed to study the growth and endogenous ammonia neutralization of sulfate-containing aerosol particles in the human respiratory tract. It is shown that an accurate prediction of the luminal ammonia concentration and relative humidity in each generation is essential for quantifying the degree of neutralization of the acidic particles. The model predicts substantial growth and neutralization for small particles 1<0.1 mu m), whereas larger particles (>1.0 mu m) experience negligible neutralization. The predicted neutralization of intermediate-sized particles depends on the parameter values used in the model. Water supersaturations that occur in the respiratory tract when ambient conditions are cool and humid cause rapid particle growth and consequently enhance neutralization. Thus the neutralization depends on the particle size as well as on ambient conditions. but experimental investigations have reported a wide range of neutralizations (6, 17, 27).
   Many authors have developed theoretical models to predict heat and water vapor transport in the lumen (11). Models have also been developed for the growth of hygroscopic particles in the human airways (2, 7). Cocks and McElroy (3) studied the growth and neutralization of sulfuric acid aerosols at 1,000 and 100 mu g/m(3) under constant ammonia concentrations of 500 and 50 ppb and a relative humidity of 99.5%-conditions similar to those inhuman airways
   A Lagrangian approach has been used to simulate the simultaneous growth and neutralization of an acid aerosol as a function of its position in the respiratory airways. Heat, water, and ammonia transport were considered between the submucosal tissue, mucus, lumen, and suspended particles. In MODELING, we describe the governing equations and the simplifying assumptions. We report the numerical method used, modeling results, and sensitivity analysis in METHODS AND MODEL PREDICTIONS and finally present our discussion and conclusions.

AB  - The enigmatic middle Eocene climatic optimum (MECO) is a transient (similar to 500 kyr) warming event that significantly interrupted at similar to 40 Ma the long-term cooling through the middle and late Eocene, eventually resulting in establishment of permanent Antarctic ice-sheet. This event is still poorly known and data on the biotic response are so far scarce Here we present a detailed planktonic foraminiferal analysis of the MECO Interval from a marginal basin of the central-western Tethys (Alano section, northeastern Italy). The expanded and continuous Alano section provides an excellent record of this event and offers an appealing opportunity to better understand the role of climate upon calcareous plankton evolution A sapropel-like interval, characterized by excursions in both the carbon and oxygen bulk-carbonate Isotope records, represents the lithological expression of the post-MECO event in the study area and follows the 6180 negative shift, Interpreted as representing the MECO warming.
   High-resolution quantitative analysis performed on both >38 mu m and >63 mu m fractions reveals pronounced and complex changes in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages indicating a strong environmental perturbation that parallels the variations of the stable isotope curves corresponding to the MECO and post-MECO Intervals These changes consist primarily in a marked increase in abundance of the relatively eutrophic subbotinids and of the small, low-oxygen tolerant Streptochilus. Chiloguembelina and Pseudohastigerina At the same time, the arrival of the abundant opportunist eutrophic Jenkinsina and Pseudoglobigerinella bolivariana, typical species of very high-productivity areas, also occurs. The pronounced shift from oligotrophic to more eutrophic, opportunist, low-oxygen tolerant planktonic foraminiferal assemblages suggests increased nutrient input and surface ocean productivity in response to the environmental perturbation associated with the MECO. Particularly critical environmental conditions have been reached during the deposition of the sapropel-like beds as testified by the presence of common giant and/or odd morphotypes. This is Interpreted as evidence of transient alteration in the ocean chemistry.
   The enhanced surface water productivity inferred by planktonic foraminiferal assemblages at the onset of the event should have resulted in heavier delta C-13 values. The recorded lightening of the carbon stable isotope preceding the maximum warmth therefore represents a robust indication that it derives principally by a conspicuous increase of pCO(2). The increased productivity of surface waters, also supported by geochemical data, may have acted as mechanism for pCO(2) reduction and returned the climate system to the general Eocene cooling trend. The oxygen-depleted deep waters and the organic carbon burial following the peak of the MECO event represent the local response to the MECO warming and suggest that high sequestration of organic matter, if representing a widespread response to this event, might have contributed to the decrease of pCO(2) as well. Though the true mechanisms are still obscure, several lines of evidence indicate a potential pressure on planktonic foraminiferal evolution during the MECO event including permanent changes besides transient and ecologically controlled variations.

CP  - Symposium on Design and Reliability of Solders and Solder Interconnections, at the TMS Annual Meeting
AB  - The solder ball flip chip or so called C-4 connection was introduced by IBM nearly three decades ago as an alternative to manual wire bonding whose productivity and reliability were not acceptable at that time. A very large field data base indicates that flip-chip interconnections have been the most reliable die interconnection scheme in the industry since their inception. The technology is flexible, having been utilized with various types of chip carriers. Several unique technology features such as chip-level hermiticity and modifications made to enhance reliability as the technology evolved are discussed. The potential loss of integrity of flip-chip solder joints due to fatigue failure is an issue that has received considerable attention Fatigue failure can result if thermally-induced strains within a joint generated by the mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between die and chip carrier become too great. Thus, the influence of design and material parameters to reduce strain and dissipate stress are discussed as well. The so-called Modified Coffin-Manson (C-M) relationship provides the capability of predicting field life times based on standard laboratory tests. The basis of the C-M relationship is described and also modifications made to address creep, a common occurrence in solder applications. Flip-chip solder joint technology is sufficiently extendible to satisfy anticipated future I/O requirements. To meet these requirements the reliability impact of chip underfill, a recent development, is also discussed.

AB  - The effects of temperature and absence of a host plant on the population dynamics of the sheath nematode, Hemicycliophora conida, were studied under glasshouse conditions. Regarding temperature, population dynamics of H. conida on tomato 'Moneymaker' were monitored weekly over a period of 12 weeks. In the first experiment, with an average temperature of 21.4 degrees C. population growth of H. conida continuously increased over time from an initial density of 106 nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1) to a final density of 820 nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1), resulting in a reproduction rate of 7.7. The time required to complete one generation was 6.5 weeks or 598 temperature degree days at 8 degrees C base temperature (TDD8). A second experiment showed that the development of IL conida on tomato was faster at 22.1 degrees C than at 19.0 degrees C. At 22.1 degrees C, one generation was completed after 6 weeks (= 588 TDD8) compared to 8 weeks (=634 TDD8) at 19.0 degrees C. The higher temperature also resulted in a higher reproduction rate (93 at 22.1 degrees C vs 7.8 at 19.0 degrees C). In the absence of a host plant, the population density of H. conida decreased over time. However, this natural decline was less pronounced than for the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla. In the first experiment, the population density of H. conida decreased within 18 weeks by 89.5%, while M. hapla was already no longer detectable 12 weeks after inoculation. In the second experiment. H. conida decreased by 98.2% within 16 weeks compared to 99.98% for M. hapla.

AB  - Rocky intertidal invertebrates live in heterogeneous habitats characterized by steel) gradients in wave activity, tidal flux, temperature, food quality and food availability. These environmental factors impact metabolic activity via changes in energy input and stress-induced Iteration of energetic demands. For keystone species, small environmentally induced shifts in metabolic activity may lead to disproportionately large impacts on community structure via changes in growth or survival of these key species. Here we use biochemical indicators to assess how natural differences in wave exposure, temperature and food availability may affect metabolic activity of mussels, barnacles, whelks and sea stars living at rocky intertidal sites with different physical and oceanographic characteristics. We show that oxygen consumption rate is correlated with the activity of key metabolic enzymes (e.g., citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase) for some intertidal species, and concentrations of these enzymes in certain tissues are lower for starved individvials than for those that are well fed. We also show that the ratio of RNA to DNA (an index of protein synthetic capacity) is highly variable in nature and correlates with short-term changes in food availability. We also observed striking patterns in enzyme activity and RNA/DNA in nature, which are related to differences in rocky intertidal community structure. Differences among species and habitats are most pronounced in summer and are linked to high nearshore productivity at sites favored by suspension feeders and to exposure to stressful low-tide air temperatures in areas of low wave splash. These studies illustrate the great promise of using biochemical indicators to test ecological models, which predict changes in community structure along environmental gradients. Our results also suggest that biochemical indices must be carefully validated with laboratory studies, so that the indicator selected is likely to respond to the environmental variables of interest.

AB  - Municipal wastewater has been applied as a fertilizer to coniferous forest in northern Sweden with the additional aims to purify the wastewater and reduce the treatment costs. This practice has the potential to introduce pathogenic microorganisms from the applied wastewater or sludge to the environment, with a subsequent risk of transmission to exposed humans or animals. Seasonality and climatological conditions, in particular low temperature, humidity and low sun intensity will furthermore affect the persistence of pathogens in the forest in northern Scandinavia and may therefore enhance the survival and thereby the exposure risk. The survival of two pathogens (Salmonella senftenberg and Campylobacter coli) and four fecal indicator organisms; bacteria strains (E. coli and E. fecalis) and bacteriophages (S. typhimurium phage 28 B and phi x174), used here as viral models, was evaluated in microcosms (60 Litre terrariums) with two vegetation regimes (characterized as moss and lichen) at selected temperatures (+3 degrees C to +27 degrees C) and artificial light exposure (light and dark). Salmonella persisted in high numbers after 35 days in the vegetation, indicating a potential risk for further transmission. Neither the vegetation regime nor temperature or light exposure as independent factors governed the reduction of the indicator bacteria and the bacteriophages. The persistence of the indicator organisms was generally best supported in the moss vegetation at low temperature in the dark, where the time for a 90% reduction (T-90) was in the range from 8 days (E. coli) to 31 days (Salmonella phage). The die-off characteristics found in this study provide baseline values for further validations in the field and verify that the purification and reuse of municipal wastewater in coniferous forest could potentially be responsible for transmission of fecal pathogens to humans and animals.

AB  - Thermotolerant microorganisms are beneficial to the fermentation industry because they reduce the need for cooling and offer other operational advantages. Previously, we obtained a thermally adapted Gluconobacter frateurii strain by experimental evolution. In the present study, we found only a single G insertion in the adapted strain, which causes a frameshift in a gene encoding a putative drug transporter. A mutant derivative strain with the single G insertion in the transporter gene (Wild-G) was constructed from the wild-type strain and showed increased thermotolerance. We found that the thermotolerant strains accumulated substantial intracellular trehalose and manifested a defect in sorbose assimilation, suggesting that the transporter is partly involved in trehalose efflux and sorbose uptake and that the defect in the transporter can improve thermotolerance. The.otsAB strain, constructed by elimination of the trehalose synthesis gene in the wild type, showed no trehalose production but, unexpectedly, much better growth than the adapted strain at high temperatures. The.otsAB mutant produced more acetate as the final metabolite than the wild-type strain did. We hypothesized that trehalose does not contribute to thermotolerance directly; rather, a metabolic change including increased carbon flux to the pentose phosphate pathway may be the key factor. The NADPH/NADP(+) ratio was higher in strain Wild-G, and much higher in the Delta otsAB strain, than in the wild-type strain. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were lower in the thermotolerant strains. We propose that the defect of the transporter causes the metabolic flux to generate more NADPH, which may enhance thermotolerance in G. frateurii.
   IMPORTANCE The biorefinery industry has to ensure that microorganisms are robust and retain their viability and function at high temperatures. Here we show that Gluconobacter frateurii, an industrially important member of the acetic acid bacteria, exhibited enhanced thermotolerance through the reduction of trehalose excretion after thermal adaptation. Although intracellular trehalose may play a key role in thermotolerance, the molecular mechanisms of action of trehalose in thermotolerance are a matter of debate. Our mutated strain that was defective in trehalose synthase genes, producing no trehalose but a larger amount of acetic acid as the end metabolite instead, unexpectedly showed higher thermotolerance than the wild type. Our adapted and mutated thermotolerant strains showed increased NADPH/NADP(+) ratios and reductions in ROS levels. We concluded that in G. frateurii, trehalose does not contribute to thermotolerance directly; rather, the metabolic change increases the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio to enhance thermotolerance.

AB  - Gas recovery from the natural gas hydrate (NGH) deposits is a current topic of interest. Apart from the conventional thermal stimulation, depressurisation and chemical injection methods, the guest molecular replacement method in hydrates offers dual advantage such as retention of their structural stability, and as a sink for carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the molecular exchangeability shows significant variance and the mechanism is also incomprehensible. This study is aimed at probing the stability of gas (CH4 & CO2) hydrates in the presence of CO2/CH4, N-2 and their mixtures at low-pressure (similar to 1.0 MPa) conditions. The selected experimental conditions help gain insight into the guest-guest exchange. Evaluation of gas pressure during the dissociation process indicates the presence of mixed hydrates. The micro-Raman investigations elucidate the occurrence of mixed hydrate seed crystals, encasing both CH4/CO2 molecules of initial hydrates, and also the molecules from the injected gas. The characteristic signatures of CH4 & CO2 molecules in hydrate systems broadly agree with the literature data, while that of N-2 pointedly closer to the gas phase signature, indicating its role as a help-gas to promote replacement/rearrangement of guests in hydrate lattice.

AB  - Key message Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) provenance variation was assessed in a multisite test based on traits of economic and ecological relevance in France. While climatic drivers generated genetic clines at a range-wide scale, provenance variation in France was mainly shaped by past silvicultural regimes. We developed a multitrait approach to facilitate decision-making for seed sourcing. A set of provenance clusters is proposed, supporting recommendations for plantation programmes. Context Among broadleaves, sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is likely to spread in the context of current climate change and is increasingly planted in France. Seed sourcing is of the utmost importance for ensuring plantation success and adaptation. The selection of appropriate seed sources is highly challenging when the future climate conditions of plantation areas are uncertain. Aims We aimed at identifying drivers of provenance variation in Q. petraea and to build provenance clusters based on traits of adaptive and economic value, to ultimately support decision-making in seed sourcing. Methods We analysed a multisite provenance test established 30 years ago and comprising a large collection of Q. petraea provenances by performing phenotypic assessments of survival, growth, phenology, and stem-quality traits. We analysed climate-trait correlations at a range-wide scale and used multivariate statistics [multivariate mixed models, principal component analysis (PCA)] and classification methods [hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), K-means method] to generate an overall clustering of french provenances. Results Provenance effects were highly significant regardless of the trait considered, whereas interaction effects between provenance and other experimental sources of variation were minor compared to provenance and environmental variance. There was limited variation between provenances collected in the same forest in comparison to origins of different forests. We found sharp temperature-driven genetic clines for growth and phenology-related traits at a range-wide scale. The multitrait classification approach grouped the French provenances into 11 clusters, with the members of each cluster having similar trait values. Overall, the cluster composition of provenances poorly matched the provenance regions identified on ecological grounds, but rather mirrored the silvicultural regimes implemented in the source stands in the past. Conclusions Two of the provenance clusters (comprising a total of 34 provenances) were identified as potentially useful sources of reproductive material. We recommend mixing seeds of different provenances from a given cluster to ensure the maintenance of diversity and to enhance adaptability to future climatic conditions.

AB  - The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a heat-sensitive plant species in which excessive abscission of reproductive organs occur during hot weather. This results in 'split sets' 2 and yield reductions, and, in extreme heat stress, plant produce few or no pods. We evaluated 74 bean genotypes in terms of leaf heat-tolerance (HT) and leaf heat-acclimation potential (HAP), as expressed by heat killing-time (HKT), the time in minutes needed to cause 50% ion leakage from leaf tissue heat stressed at 50-degrees-C. Leaf HT is defined as the leaf HKT of plants without prior conditioning at 37-degrees-C day/night temperature and leaf HAP as the change in leaf HT following exposure of the plant at 37-degrees-C day/night for 24 h. Among 74 bean genotypes examined, leaf HT ranged from 5 to 30 min HKT, whereas leaf HAP ranged from 35 to 130 min HKT. Positive significant correlations were observed between leaf HAP and post-stress performance in plant dry-weight, pod set, pod weight and yield among bean genotypes. However, correlations were not significant between leaf HT and post-stress performance.
   A relationship between heat resistance - consisting of the combination Of HT and HAP - and heat injury is proposed. Interpretation of the differential amounts of heat injury among genotypes having different HAP, is discussed. We view leaf HT and leaf HAP as two distinguishable phenomena. We suggest that, in breeding programs. HAP may be the more important of the two, and should be evaluated as a selection criterion for improving crop performance in high-temperature environments.

AB  - We compared the habitat selection (temperature and dissolved oxygen) of striped bass (STB) Morone saxatilis and hybrid striped bass (HSB; palmetto bass [male white bass M chrysops x female striped bass]) in Claytor Lake, Virginia. Striped bass (n = 28) and HSB (n = 33) were implanted with temperature-sensitive radio tags and tracked biweekly for a period of 19 months to record position and habitat use. Striped bass averaged 715 mm total length (range 533-940) whereas HSB averaged 547 mm total length (range 460-659). Habitat separation was most apparent in the warm season months of June through August. During this period, when deoxygenation of the metalimnion and hypolimnion was not limiting, STB and HSB segregated according to apparent temperature preferences, with HSB selecting warmer temperatures. As deoxygenation progressed, HSB and especially STB were forced into warmer strata than preferred. Results from this study suggest that if favorable dissolved oxygen levels are maintained, STB and HSB will vertically segregate during summer stratification. Temperature selection and qualitative observations of fish mortality in summer indicated that adult HSB would be less vulnerable than adult STB to a temperature-dissolved oxygen squeeze in summer and its detrimental effects.

AB  - Climate change affects the sustainability of farming systems by downgrading soil fertility and diminishing crop yields. Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals aims to achieve key performance indicators to convert effectually currently degraded agroecosystems into smart, climate-resilient, and profitable farming systems. The introduction of alternative crops could equilibrate the negative impact of increased temperatures and water scarcity to ensure sufficient farm profitability. Alternative crops such as quinoa, teff, tritordeum, camelina, nigella, chia, and sweet potato show a high acclimatization potential to various conditions and could be components of novel re-designed agroecosystems, satisfying the goals the EU Green Deal for reduced chemical input use by 2030. In certain occasions, they adapt even better than conventional or traditional crops and could be integrated in crop rotations, demonstrating multiple uses that would benefit farmers. This review aimed to (i) evaluate seven alternative crops based on their potential contribution to climate change mitigation, in compliance with the EU (European Union) Green Deal objectives and the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) of the UN (United Nations), and (ii) examine the factors that would determine their successful integration in the Mediterranean Basin. These limiting factors for crop establishment included (i) soil properties (soil texture, pH value, salinity, and sodicity), (ii) environmental parameters (temperature, altitude, latitude, photoperiod), and (iii) crop performance and dynamics regarding water demands, fertilization needs, light, and heat requirements. All proposed crops were found to be adaptable to the Mediterranean climate characteristics and promising for the implementation of the goals of EU and UN.

AB  - Gametogenic development and response to conditioning procedures of six samples of oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) collected in the Bassin d'Arcachon, each cultivated at a different production site along the Atlantic coast of France were compared simultaneously from December 1998 to July 1999. Oysters were conditioned with and without food (fed oysters and unfed oysters, respectively). Samples at northern production sites (Baie des Veys, Aber Benoit, and Baden) initiated gonadal development and spawning about one month earlier than those at southern production sites (Bouin, La Tremblade, and Arcachon). Three conditioning experiments (December 1998 to February 1999, February to April 1999, and April to June 1999) favored Baie des Veys and Aber Benoit oysters, because these resulted in higher body component indices and higher proportions of mature oocytes in the three conditionings that produced more gametes than the other samples in all experiments. Unfed oysters from Baie des Veys and Aber Benoit produced viable gametes and larvae in all the experiments. No significant difference was observed in larval culture (growth and mortality) among samples, of both fed and unfed animals. Differences in the timing of gametogenesis and response to conditioning among northern and southern samples seem adaptive and non-genetic in nature, since all oysters were collected from the same population in the bay at Arcachon. Nutrient recycling seems to have been an important regulating factor for gametogenesis in the northern samples. The occurrence of oysters in different locales having differences in the timing of gametogenesis and response to conditioning has implications for spat production in hatcheries.

AB  - Many open questions and unresolved issues surround the topic of bias correction (BC) in climate change impact studies (CCIS). One question relates to the contribution of downscaling of climate change scenarios on the uncertainties in results obtained using impact models for agriculture. In particular, for large area or regional agricultural impact assessments, the question of bias correction is of high relevance. Relatively few studies exist looking at the quantification of the impacts of BC methods in general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) data on results of such impact studies. Here, we quantify the impact of different BC methods on temperature (T) and precipitation (P) from different CORDEX GCM-RCM combinations, and how the debiased T&P signal may propagate through agricultural impact models. Specifically, we estimate the impact of BC on (i) an empirical P- and fuzzy rule-based algorithm to estimate the crop planting date, and (ii) a mechanistic T&P-based approach to quantify the crop suitability index (CSI) for the main staple crops in West Africa (i.e. groundnut, maize, pearl millet, sorghum). Both approaches serve as a proxy for more complex process-based ecophysiological crop models. Depending on the choice of the BC method, the uncertainties in the assessment of the CSI can be more than twice as high compared to the uncertainties from the GCM-RCM model selection. Comparing the estimated CSI values with observed harvest area, it is found that BC generally improves the performance for models with low hit rates (< 30-35%), but decreases the performance for models with relatively high hit rates (> 35%). Such consequences can also be expected for process-based crop models, which are developed to operate on field-scale but are driven by coarser scale RCMs. It is concluded that such agriculturally oriented climate impact models as investigated here should be interpreted with great caution if applied without BC or relying on a single BC approach only. Rather, we suggest to include different BC approaches in the generation of climate projections for CCIS and quantify their uncertainties following a super-ensemble probabilistic assessment.

AB  - Wetlands cover approximately 6% of the Earth's surface. They are frequently found at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and are strongly dependent on the water cycle. For this reason, wetlands are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Mangroves and floodplain ecosystems are some of the most important environments for the Amazonian population, as a source of proteins and income, and are thus the types of wetlands chosen for this review. Some of the main consequences that can be predicted from climate change for wetlands are modifications in hydrological regimes, which can cause intense droughts or inundations. A possible reduction in rainfall can cause a decrease of the areas of mangroves and floodplains, with a consequent decline in their species numbers. Conversely, an increase in rainfall would probably cause the substitution of plant species, which would not be able to survive under new conditions for a long period. An elevation in water temperature on the floodplains would cause an increase in frequency and duration of hypoxic or anoxic episodes, which might further lead to a reduction in growth rates or the reproductive success of many species. In mangroves, an increase in water temperature would influence the sea level, causing losses of these environments through coastal erosion processes. Therefore, climate change will likely cause the loss of, or reduction in, Amazonian wetlands and will challenge the adaptability of species, composition and distribution, which will probably have consequences for the human population that depend on them.

AB  - Biomineral matrix formation and molecular recognition are two important processes associated with eggshell biomineralization. To understand these two processes, a major intracrystailine peptide pelovaterin, was isolated from turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) eggshell and its tertiary and quaternary structures were established. The global fold of pelovaterin is similar to that of human beta-defensins but has a large hydrophobic core and a short hydrophilic N-terminal segment, which is not preserved in defensins. Pelovaterin exhibits strong antimicrobial activity against two pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, and stabilizes a thin film of metastable vaterite. We show that pelovaterin self-aggregates in the form of micellar nanospheres and the aggregation in solution is entropy-driven. It is suggested that the micellar aggregation of pelovaterin is responsible for the induction and stabilization of the metastable phase by altering the interfacial energy. The results demonstrate the adaptability of an extracellular matrix protein to perform multiple tasks: polymorph discrimination and protection of the contents of the egg against bacteria invasion.

AB  - Background Under the threat of climate change populations can disperse, acclimatise or evolve in order to avoid fitness loss. In light of this, it is important to understand neutral gene flow patterns as a measure of dispersal potential, but also adaptive genetic variation as a measure of evolutionary potential. In order to assess genetic variation and how this relates to environment in the honeycomb worm (Sabellaria alveolata(L.)), a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out RAD sequencing using individuals from along its complete latitudinal range. Patterns of neutral population genetic structure were compared to larval dispersal as predicted by ocean circulation modelling, and outlier analyses and genotype-environment association tests were used to attempt to identify loci under selection in relation to local temperature data. Results We genotyped 482 filtered SNPs, from 68 individuals across nine sites, 27 of which were identified as outliers using BAYESCAN and ARLEQUIN. All outlier loci were potentially under balancing selection, despite previous evidence of local adaptation in the system. Limited gene flow was observed among reef-sites (F-ST = 0.28 +/- 0.10), in line with the low dispersal potential identified by the larval dispersal models. The North Atlantic reef emerged as a distinct population and this was linked to high local larval retention and the effect of the North Atlantic Current on dispersal. Conclusions As an isolated population, with limited potential for natural genetic or demographic augmentation from other reefs, the North Atlantic site warrants conservation attention in order to preserve not only this species, but above all the crucial functional ecological roles that are associated with their bioconstructions. Our study highlights the utility of using seascape genomics to identify populations of conservation concern.

AB  - Salmon life histories are finely tuned to local environmental conditions, which are intimately linked to climate. We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i. e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.

AB  - Mating is crucial for females that reproduce exclusively sexually and should influence their investment into reproduction. Although reproductive adjustments in response to mate quality have been tested in a wide range of species, the effect of exposure to males and mating per se has seldom been studied. Compensatory mechanisms against the absence of mating may evolve more frequently in viviparous females, which pay higher direct costs of reproduction, due to gestation, than oviparous females. To test the existence of such mechanisms in a viviparous species, we experimentally manipulated the mating opportunity of viviparous female lizard, Lacerta (Zootoca) vivipara. We assessed the effect of mating on ovulation, postpartum body condition and parturition date, as well as on changes in locomotor performances and body temperatures during the breeding cycle. Female lizards ovulated spontaneously and mating had no influence on litter size, locomotor impairment or on selected body temperature. However, offspring production induced a more pronounced locomotor impairment and physical burden than the production of undeveloped eggs. Postpartum body condition and parturition dates were not different among females. This result suggests that gestation length is not determined by an embryonic signal. In the common lizard, viviparity is not associated with facultative ovulation and a control of litter size after ovulation, in response to the absence of mating. J. Exp. Zool. 315:458-464, 2011.

AB  - A new, high efficient comprehensive utilization technology with non-pollution, low energy consumption, and strong feedstock adaptability is investigated with the view to developing an efficient smelting process of vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite by non-BF route. It includes three major steps in this process: selective chlorination of the concentrates for extraction vanadium using industrial chloride wastes, direct reduction for producing DRI at medium temperature, and separation of hot metal from slag at elevated temperature. In this paper, it focuses on the extraction of vanadium from vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite by selective chlorination. The mechanisms of selective chlorination for extracting vanadium is discussed from the view of thermodynamics analyses and it is found that the reasonable temperature is over the temperature range of 900K similar to 1300K if chlorine potential (logp(Cl2)) and oxygen potential (logp(O2)) are controlled at a certain region (hatched region A). Furthermore, some preliminary experimental are conducted and the results show that it is possible to extract vanadium from vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite by selective chlorination and extraction ratio can reach up to 30% under 1100K after 2 hours calcination.

AB  - As climate change accelerates and habitats free from anthropogenic impacts diminish, populations are forced to migrate or to adapt quickly. Evolutionary rescue (ER) is a phenomenon, in which a population is able to avoid extinction through adaptation. ER is considered to be more likely at slower rates of environmental change. However, the effects of correlated characters on evolutionary rescue are seldom explored yet correlated characters could play a major role in ER. We tested how evolutionary background in different fluctuating environments and the rate of environmental change affect the probability of ER by exposing populations of the bacteria Serratia marcescens to two different rates of steady temperature increase. As suggested by theory, slower environmental change allowed populations to grow more effectively even at extreme temperatures, but at the expense of long-term survival at extreme conditions due to correlated selection. Our results indicate important gap of knowledge on the effects of correlated selection during the environmental change and on evolutionary rescue at differently changing environments.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hot summer climatic conditions (compared to winter) on the libido, semen quality traits, level of serum testosterone hormone and some physiological and body measurements of Egyptian Suffolk rams. A parameter for the tolerance of the rams to adverse hot climatic conditions, designated as the tunica dartos index (TDI), was estimated as the multiplication of the percentage change in scrotal length and that of the percentage difference between rectal temperature and scrotal skin temperature. The relationships between the TDI and semen characteristics were also estimated. The results showed that in summer, the reaction time, pH, percentage dead and abnormal spermatozoa, acrosomal damage and temperatures of rectum, body skin and scrotal skin and scrotal length were significantly higher, while sperm motility, sperm concentration, scrotal circumference and testis length were significantly lower than in winter. The correlation coefficient (r) values estimated between the TDI and each of the semen pH, ejaculate volume, sperm motility and sperm cell concentration were positive, and those estimated between the TDI and each of the reaction time, dead and abnormal spermatozoa and acrosomal damage were negative. The best values of libido (low reaction time), semen pH, semen motility percentage, sperm cell concentration and testosterone level were recorded with a high TDI level (7.5 and more), while those of percentage of dead spermatozoa, sperm abnormalities and acrosomal damage were recorded with a low TDI level (less than 4.5). It can be concluded that the TDI correlates well with the reproductive ability of the ram and can be a reliable parameter to indicate the tolerance of rams to hot subtropical conditions in Egypt.

AB  - Black bass Micropterus spp. live-release tournaments are a popular activity in North America. Efforts continue to further increase survival and enhance welfare of fish released from competitive angling events. Recently, some tournaments have adopted a new weigh-in format in which black bass are weighed immediately (hanging from a scale in air) and released at the capture location. More conventional tournaments involve retaining black bass in a live well and delivering them to a central location to be weighed (wet or dry weigh-in). We used biologgers that measured swimming activity, depth selection, and water temperature selection to examine how different weigh-in formats alter postrelease behavior of Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu and Largemouth Bass M. salmoides. All fish showed a significant decrease in swimming activity as time progressed during the 10-min monitoring period, regardless of the weigh-in format. Swimming activity remained elevated (i.e., hyperactivity) for a longer period of time for black bass that were retained in live wells compared to those that were subjected to the catch, weigh, and release weigh-in format and the control (fish that were caught and immediately released without air exposure). Swimming activity of black bass tended to decrease as they achieved greater depths with cooler water temperatures. For both species, the water temperature selected postrelease was influenced by the weigh-in format. Black bass that were dry weighed and wet weighed spent more time in warmer water temperatures than fish in the control group or fish that were caught, weighed, and released. This study suggests that to reduce behavioral alterations associated with wet or dry weigh-ins, tournament organizations need to carefully select the weigh-in location, allowing easy access to refuge (i.e., habitat complexity similar to that of the capture location) having the cooler water temperatures commonly associated with deeper water. These results also suggest that catch, weigh, and release formats could be beneficial for black bass during periods of the year with elevated water temperature.

AB  - Tolerance of climatic stressors is an important predictor of the current distribution of insect species, their potential to invade new environments, and their responses to rapid climate change. Cold stress causes acute injury to nerves and muscles, and here we tested the hypothesis that low temperature causes sublethal deficits in locomotor behaviors that are dependent on neuromuscular function. To do so, we applied a previously developed assay, the rapid iterative negative geotaxis (RING) assay, to investigate behavioral consequences of cold stress in Drosophila melanogaster. The RING assay allows for rapid assessment of negative geotaxis behavior by quantifying climbing height and willingness to climb after cold stress. We exposed flies to cold stress at 0 degrees C and assessed the extent to which duration of cold stress, recovery time, and cold acclimation influenced climbing performance. There was a clear dose-response relationship between cold exposure and performance deficits, with climbing height and willingness decreasing as cold exposure increased from 2 to 24hr. Following cold exposure of an intermediate duration (12hr), climbing height and willingness gradually improved as recovery time increased from 4 to 72hr but flies never fully recovered. Finally, cold acclimation improved overall climbing height and willingness in both untreated and cold-stressed flies but did not prevent a reduction in climbing performance. Thus, cold stress causes deficits in locomotor and behavior that are dependent on the dose of cold exposure and persist long after the stress subsides. These results likely have implications for the ecological and evolutionary responses of insect populations to thermally variable environments.
   RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
   Cold stress elicits dose-dependent deficits in locomotor performance and behavior that are not prevented by cold acclimation or alleviated by prolonged recovery from cold stress.

AB  - Relict leopard frog (Rana [Lithobates] onca) tadpoles were obtained shortly after hatching at Gosner stage 25 and raised in aquaria maintained at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Development was arrested in the 15 degrees C group, and survivorship declined to 64% after 191 days. However, 80% of the surviving larvae remained alive after the temperature was increased to 25 degrees C. Of these, 96% reached metamorphosis. Survivorship of the 20, 25 and 30 degrees C acclimation groups was 82, 94 and 66%, respectively, whereas none survived at 35 degrees C. Time to metamorphosis was significantly shorter for the 25 degrees C group (67 +/- 1 days), followed by the 30 degrees C (98 +/- 2 days) and 20 degrees C (264 +/- 7 days) groups. A linear 66 cm thermal gradient was used to identify temperature ranges selected by tadpoles in the different acclimation groups. Five 10 degrees C gradients (10-20, 15-25, 20-30, 25-35 and 30-40 degrees C) were used, and time spent in the cooler, middle and warmer thirds of the gradient was compared for 10 individuals from each acclimation group. In the coolest gradient, tadpoles from all acclimation groups selected the warmer third (> 17 degrees C) of the gradient. In the warmer gradients, tadpoles from the 20 and 25 degrees C acclimation groups selected temperatures <29 degrees C, while those from the 30 degrees C acclimation group selected temperatures <33 degrees C. Maximal burst speed for all groups was greater at experimental temperatures of 25 than 15 degrees C. Efforts to reintroduce this species to its historical range should select habitats where water temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees C are available during the post-hatching period.

AB  - We investigate whether the observed zircon age distribution of continental crust (CC) is produced by real crustal growth episodes or is only an artifact of preservation. In connection with the second alternative of this question, other authors proposed that there was little episodicity in the production of new CC and that modeling corroborates this opinion. We conclude that a combination of the two answers might be possible. In matters of modeling, however, we ascertain that a dynamic modeling of the convection-differentiation system of the mantle reveals the high probability of magmatic episodes. We solve the full set of balance equations in a 3-D spherical-shell mantle. The heat-producing elements are redistributed by chemical differentiation. A realistic solidus model of mantle peridotite is essential for an applicable model. The solidus depends not only on depth but also on the volatile concentration. Furthermore, we introduced realistic profiles of Gruneisen parameter, viscosity, adiabatic temperature, thermal expansivity, and specific heat. Our model automatically produces lithospheric plates and growing continents. Regarding number, size, form, distribution, and surface velocity of the continents, no constraints have been prescribed. Regions of the input parameter space (Ra, sigma(y), k, f(3)) that are favorable with respect to geophysical quantities show simultaneously not only episodicity of CC growth but also a reproduction of the observed zircon-age maxima referring to the instants of time. We also obtain Archean events for ages greater than 3000 Ma that are not or scarcely visible in the observed zircon ages. Sinusoidal parts of the evolution curve of qob, Ur, and E-kin are superposed with a monotonous decrease. The volumetrically averaged mantle temperature, T-mean, however, decreases smoothly and slowly, nearly without pronounced variations. Therefore, we can dismiss catastrophic mechanisms that simultaneously incorporate the whole mantle.

AB  - 1. Kielder Reservoir regulates the Rivers North Tyne and Tyne. It provides a regular supply of water for downstream users, supports abstractions for a major water transfer scheme and provides hydroelectric power (HEP). Kielder's release regime typically alternates between a 1.3 m(3) s(-1) compensation flow and 10(-15) m(3) s(-1) HEP releases of between 3 and 7 days in duration. Occasionally releases of up to 30 m(3) s(-1) are made for the purpose of encouraging fish runs, for recreational events or to help in water quality management. The impacts of this release regime on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta) habitat at four sites on the North Tyne are assessed and alternative regimes, designed to minimize impacts, are presented.
   2. There is no evidence that the compensation flow results in extreme loss of instream habitat. A discharge of 1.3 m(3) s(-1) ensures that water is maintained over most of the channel area at sites representative of upper, middle and lower sections of the North Tyne. This discharge lies above breaks in slope of respective site discharge versus wetted area curves; thus, disproportionate increases in discharge would be needed to increase wetted area. Simulations using the Physical Habitat Simulation System (PHABSIM) suggest that the compensation now provides between 50% and 90% of the maximum possible weighted usable area (WUA) for juvenile (0 +) salmonids.
   3. During HEP releases, juvenile salmonid habitat (WUA) apparently falls to between 20 and 40% of site maxima. Newly emerged juvenile fish (March and April) are most affected by HEP releases because they are relatively small (25 mm in length) and water temperatures are relatively low at this time of year. During March and April, critical near-bed displacement velocities for newly emerged fish may be exceeded across large parts (80%) of sites up to 8 km downstream from Kielder Reservoir; fish would either be displaced downstream or forced to relocate to flow refuge areas.
   4. The availability of Atlantic salmon spawning habitat (WUA) at a key site is limited by the compensation flow; 1.3 m(3) s(-1) provides approximately one third of the habitat available at the optimum discharge (4 m(3) s(-1)). At this site, a discharge of approximately 2 m(3) s(-1) is needed to ensure most of the bed is inundated by water. Regulation has reduced the duration of flows exceeding 2 m(3) s(-1) from 90 to 60% of the spawning season.
   5. Simulations suggest that when discharge drops from 30 m(3) s(-1) to the compensation flow, up to 60% of the optimum spawning habitat available at the former discharge may be left stranded (dry). This could potentially lead to egg or alevin mortality.
   6. PHABSIM simulations suggest that increasing the compensation flow to 4 m(3) s(-1) during the spawning period (November and December) is likely to increase the availability of suitable spawning habitat. Also, increasing the compensation flow to 2 m(3) s(-1) during the incubation period (January through March) would minimize redd stranding. Reductions in the number of HEP releases in March and April would limit the extent to which newly emerged fish are exposed to velocities that potentially displace them. Such changes to the Kielder release regime may have implications for water resource management. While it is important that the biological instream flow requirements of the North Tyne are incorporated into the Kielder operating policy, these should be integrated along with the need for channel maintenance flows, downstream water supply abstractions and HEP generation, as well as for transfers of water to other catchments.

AB  - Screening tomato genotypes in terms of compounds that affect fruit quality in post-harvest period is an important task for breeders. It is important for selection of genotypes that are characterized by desirable traits, such as prolonged shelf life, the possibility of prolonged storing and fruit firmness and theirs including in breeding programs. Content of beta-carotene, total acid and dry matter have been investigated in tomato fruits in post harvest period for ten tomato genotypes. The fruits have been picked 65 days after anthesis and kept for 60 days. During this time, the samples have been evaluated six times. On the basis of one-way and two-way ANOVA, group comparisons have been performed, by complex contrast comparisons. Regression analysis has been performed for each genotype and calculation of homogeneity of slope coefficients. According to the regression ANOVA concerning beta-carotene content, the results are not significant for any genotype. There was significant total acid content decrease over time for two genotypes (Korona x L-10 F1 i Korona x L-12 F2). In rin genotypes, significant dry matter content decrease over time was found for parents and offspring generations (L -10 9.457, Korona x L-10 F1 31.946 and Korona x L-10 F2 20.074).

AB  - The high ground temperature is a prominent problem in the construction of deep buried long tunnels. Based on the analysis of high ground temperature in existing tunnels, the influence of high ground temperature on tunnel construction was divided into three situations, namely the harm to human body, effects on labor productivity and accident rate increasing. Then the high temperature heat sources during the tunnel construction were researched. The high ground temperature evolution law of famous tunnel in the history was studied by using comparative analysis method, also the reason of ground temperature anomalies and the heat transfer type of rock mass was obtained. Based on the geothermal gradient formula and the reliability theory, the risk probability model of high ground temperature was obtained in the deep buried long tunnel construction. The results show that the method can predict the high ground temperature in deep buried tunnel accurately.

AB  - Multi-state outbreaks of salmonellosis due to the consumption of contaminated fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) have recently occurred in the United States. This study investigated the survival of a five-serovar (serotype) Salmonella cocktail artificially inoculated onto tomato and packing line surfaces when held at various temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations over 28 days. Packinghouse surfaces included stainless steel, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), sponge rollers, conveyor belts, and unfinished oak wood surfaces. Packinghouse climates were generated to simulate conditions in Florida during late spring (30 degrees C/80% RH) and fall/winter (20 degrees C/60% RH) months. Additionally, survival of Salmonella on tomatoes in standard ripening room conditions (20 degrees C/90% RH) was evaluated. Recovery of inocula was by a vigorous shake/hand rub method. After 28 days, Salmonella populations remained detectable on tomato surfaces regardless of environmental conditions. Inoculated Salmonella populations tested at spring conditions declined to undetectable levels on all packing line materials by day 11, with the exception of the unfinished oak, which reached undetectable levels by day 21. In contrast, inoculated Salmonella populations tested at fall/winter conditions declined to undetectable levels on sponge rollers and conveyor belts by day 7 and day 21, respectively. Stainless steel, PVC, and wood surfaces supported the survival of detectable populations of Salmonella over the 28-day sampling period. 1 Results of this study demonstrate the potential for Salmonella to persist on tomato and packing line surfaces under common environmental conditions.

AB  - Iodine is a microelement which occurs in natural water in different concentrations dependent on water type, origin and total dissolved solids concentration. The objects of research were natural geothermal water. In this paper, the fitness of the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method for iodine determination in water with higher temperatures was tested and selected methodological problems were discussed. Basic method parameters (precision, accuracy, linearity, uncertainty) were determined. Calculated statistical parameters of the validated method fulfil the assumed criteria. The received results (correlation coefficient equal to 0.999) show that the linearity of the ICP-MS method is good. The accuracy was expressed as recovery (R) and according to the literature is at an acceptable level. The results of precision assessments (RSD) also correspond to the literature data.

AB  - The effects of heating rate (HR) on the performance of two-phase (batch followed by fed-batch) high cell-density cultivations (HCDC) of E. coli DH5 alpha for the production of plasmid DNA (pDNA) were investigated. Optimal temperatures for the HCDC, as selected from shake flask experiments at constant temperatures between 30 and 45 degrees C, were 35 degrees C for biomass accumulation in the batch phase and 42 degrees C for inducing pDNA replication during the fed-batch. In HCDC the temperature was increased at HR of 0.025, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.25 degrees C/min and the performance of the cultivations were compared to a HCDC run at constant temperature (35 degrees C). Compared to constant 35 degrees C, heat-induced HCDC accumulated up to 50% less biomass within the same cultivation time and acetate and glucose accumulated to high concentrations. The overall specific productivity (Q(P)) and average pDNA yield (Y-p/x) in HCDC at 35 degrees C were 0.22 +/- 0.02 mg/g h and 5.3 +/- 0.00 mg/g, respectively. Such parameters were maximum at a HR of 0.05 degrees C/min, reaching 0.56 +/- 0.06 mg/g h and 9.3 +/- 0.6 mg/g, respectively. At HR above 0.5 degrees C/min, Y-p/x remained relatively constant, whereas Q(P) tended to decrease. The supercolied pDNA fraction remained around 80% at all HR. Bioreactors were equipped with a capacitance/conductivity probe. In all cases biomass concentration correlated closely with the capacitance signal and acetate and glucose accumulation was accompanied by an increase in the conductivity signal. Thus, it was possible to calculate acetate and biomass concentrations, as well as mu, from online capacitance and conductivity signals using estimators. Altogether, in this study it was shown that it is possible to maximize pDNA productivity by choosing an appropriate HR and that relevant parameters can be estimated by capacitance/conductivity signals, which are useful for better process control and development.

AB  - As one of China's new generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, FengYun-3D (FY-3D) provides critical data for forest fire detection. Most of the existing related methods identify fire points by comparing the spatial features and setting thresholds empirically. However, they ignore temporal features that are associated with forest fires. Besides, they are difficult to generalize to multiple areas with different environmental characteristics. A novel method based on FY-3D combining the genetic algorithm and brightness temperature change detection is proposed in this work to improve these problems. After analyzing the spatial features of the FY-3D data, it adaptively detects potential fire points based on these features using the genetic algorithm, then filters the points with contextual information. To address the false alarms resulting from the confusing spectral characteristics between fire pixels and conventional hotspots, temporal information is introduced and the "MIR change rate" based on the multitemporal brightness temperature change is further proposed. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several fire events occurring in different areas are used for testing. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Anomalies/Fire products (MYD14) is chosen as the validation data to assess the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. A comparison of results demonstrates that the algorithm can identify fire points effectively and obtain a higher accuracy than the previous FY-3D algorithm.

AB  - A new design of direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) using roughened-surface flow channel for enhancement of heat transfer was proposed for increasing the pure water productivity in saline water desalination. The roughened surface was fabricated using siphonic-blasting with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) sand grains and arc spraying for Ni film coating. Experimental study has demonstrated its feasibility and up to 37% of performance enhancement was obtained for the experimental system. A mathematical model considering heat and mass transfer mechanisms has been developed and incorporated with experimental data for evolving a correlation for a heat transfer coefficient correction factor. The correlation is expressed as relative roughness and can be used for predicting the heat transfer coefficient for roughened-surface channels. Considering the tradeoff between the flux enhancements at the expense of energy consumption, an optimized level of roughness can be determined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, composting has increasingly been promoted as a reliable method for sanitizing Faecal Sludge (FS) from onsite sanitation systems, particularly where there are opportunities to use the recovered nutrients in agriculture. However, there remain gaps in our understanding of the fate of infectious faecal pathogens during composting, particularly in tropical climates. This study investigated the influence of different locally available bulking agents on the inactivation efficiency of composting by tracking the fate of four key indicator organisms (E. roll, Salmonella spp., Enterococci spp., and viable helminth eggs). Dewatered FS was mixed with different bulking agents - i.e. Sawdust (SD), Coffee husks (CH) and Brewery waste (BW). Compost piles of FS:SD, FS:CH, and FS:BW in a volumetric ratio of 1:2 were set-up in duplicate (3 m(3) each), composted on a pilot scale and monitored weekly for the survival of pathogen indicators for a period of 15 weeks. The study findings suggest that the different bulking agents have a statistically significant (p < 0.05) effect on the temperature evolution and survival of pathogen indicators in compost. CH was the most suitable bulking agent for composting with FS as piles containing CH exhibited higher pathogen inactivation efficiency and shorter inactivation periods of 6 weeks compared to 8 weeks for SD and BW piles. Time-temperature was the most important factor responsible for pathogen inactivation. However, other mechanisms such as indigenous microbial and toxic by-products such as NH4+-N also played an important role in the inactivation of pathogens. The results suggest that co-composting of FS with a sawdust, coffee husk or brewery waste for 8 weeks with thermophilic temperatures of about 48-60 degrees C sustained in the composting piles for more than 38 days, using 7 days turning frequency, is sufficient to ensure complete sanitization of FS before reuse in agriculture.

AB  - Phenological shifts vary within and among insect species and locations based on exposure and sensitivity to climate change. Shifts in environmental conditions and seasonal constraints along elevation and latitudinal gradients can select for differences in temperature sensitivity that generate differential phenological shifts. I examine the phenological implications of observed variation in developmental traits. Coupling physiological and ecological insight to link the environmental sensitivity of development to phenology and fitness offers promise in understanding variable phenological responses to climate change and their community and ecosystem implications. A key challenge in establishing these linkages is extrapolating controlled, laboratory experiments to temporally variable, natural environments. New lab and field experiments that incorporate realistic environmental variation are needed to test the extrapolations. Establishing the linkages can aid understanding and anticipating impacts of climate change on insects.

AB  - Forest disturbance (or land-cover change) and climatic variability are commonly recognised as two major drivers interactively influencing hydrology in forested watersheds. Future climate changes and corresponding changes in forest type and distribution are expected to generate changes in rainfall runoff that pose a threat to river catchments. It is therefore important to understand how future climate changes will effect average rainfall distribution and temperature and what effect this will have upon forest types across Japan. Recent deforestation of the present-day coniferous forest and expected increases in evergreen forest are shown to influence runoff processes and, therefore, to influence future runoff conditions. We strongly recommend that variations in forest type be considered in future plans to ameliorate projected climate changes. This will help to improve water retention and storage capacities, enhance the flood protection function of forests, and improve human health. We qualitatively assessed future changes in runoff including the effects of variation in forest type across Japan. Four general circulation models (GCMs) were selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble to provide the driving fields: the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC), the Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-GCM), the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model (HadGEM), and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) climate model. The simulations consisted of an ensemble including multiple physics configurations and different reference concentration pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5), the results of which have produced monthly data sets for the whole of Japan. The impacts of future climate changes on forest type in Japan are based on the balance amongst changes in rainfall distribution, temperature and hydrological factors. Methods for assessing the impact of such changes include the Catchment Simulator modelling frameworks based on the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO) model, which was expanded to estimate discharge by incorporating the effects of forest-type transition across the whole of Japan. The results indicated that, by the 2090s, annual runoff will increase above present-day values. Increases in annual variation in runoff by the 2090s was predicted to be around 14.1% when using the MRI-GCM data and 44.4% when using the HadGEM data. Analysis by long-term projection showed the largest increases in runoff in the 2090s were related to the type of forest, such as evergreen. Increased runoff can have negative effects on both society and the environment, including increased flooding events, worsened water quality, habitat destruction and changes to the forest moisture-retaining function. Prediction of the impacts of future climate change on water generation is crucial for effective environmental planning and management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drosophila melanogaster larvae are used to examine habitat choice behavior and its effect on a component of preadult fitness (pupal survivorship). We established strains of flies by collecting pupae from two microhabitats from an orchard. Strain differences in pupation site choice (on versus off fruit) persisted in a field-like laboratory assay without artificial selection. To produce heterogeneous environments, air temperature and soil water content were varied in these assays. A habitat suitability difference measure was used to determine for each environment, which microhabitat (on or off fruit) resulted in greater pupal survivorship. We found 1) that habitat choice behavior had both plastic and heritable components, 2) that strain-by-environment interactions influenced habitat choice behavior and pupal survivorship and, 3) a significant positive correlation between habitat suitability and larval habitat choice behavior.

AB  - The transient analyses of the thermoelastic contact problem are performed for carbon-carbon composite multidisk brakes subject to mechanical and frictionally excited thermal loads. The finite element method, based on the coupled theory in which displacement and temperature fields are mutually affected, is applied for the numerical simulations. In the present study, to improve the accuracy of computations and stabilize the algorithm, the implicit transient scheme is used for the thermoelastic analysis. The law of action and reaction, Signorini's law of contact, Coulomb's law of friction, and Archard's law of wear are applied to be valid locally at each point for friction surfaces. The computation results are obtained for the antiskid brake conditions and presented for the transient evolution of contact pressure, temperature on each friction surface between the bodies, and thermoelastic deformations. It is also found that the high thermal stresses due to considerable temperature difference during the landing process occur in multidisk brakes.

When exposed to an Nd-YAG laser operating at a wavelength of 1064 rtm in pulsed or permanent modes, the. surrogate changes color, which allows one to determine the borderline parameters of radiation causing thermal necrosis and to select the optimal conditions of laser surgery. The sensitivity of the live tissue surrogate to the working power range is close to;hat of live tissue containing blood.

AB  - Current research proposes and investigates a novel small-scale solar-driven sustainable combined desalination, heating and power (CDHP) system for a house in cold remote locations and hill stations. Latent heat storage integrated evacuated tube solar collector, organic Rankine's cycle, active solar still and water heater are main subsystems of the proposed system to generate power, potable water and hot water simultaneously. Therminol66 and eco-friendly organic substance (n-butane) are selected as working fluids for the collector system and organic Rankine's cycle, respectively. Heating oil flow is divided after vapor generator to get best temperature glide and hence exergetic performance. The system is assessed based on multi-objective functions like power output, heating output, water productivity, component irreversibility, subsystems and overall system energy and exergy efficiencies, economic and environmental criterion. Generator temperature, condenser temperature, preheater mass fraction and pinch point temperature difference cases are selected decision variables for the parametric studies. The CDHP system energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, cost rate and CO2 reduction are obtained as 17.89%, 3.915%, 1784 $/yr and 10.806 tonnes, respectively, at mean operating conditions. Furthermore, the maximum exergy efficiency of organic Rankine's cycle is found as 57.46% at optimum generator temperature of 119 degrees C for 50% preheater mass fraction. Overall, the current CDHP system is recommended to produce power, potable water and hot water to meet energy demands, especially at cold remote locations.

AB  - Adaptation is a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. We need to evaluate the relative potential of adaptation strategies, and to develop effective adaptation strategies to cope with climate risk. Here, we apply a super-ensemble-based probabilistic projection system (SuperEPPS) to project maize productivity and evapotranspiration (ET) over growing period during 2050s in the North China Plain, and to examine the relative contributions of adaptation options. Based on a large number of simulation outputs from the super-ensemble-based projection, our results show that without adaptation maize yield could decrease averagely by 13.2-19.1%, and ET during growing period could decrease by 15.6-21.8% during 2050s, relative to 1961-1990. In comparison with the experiment without adaptation, using high-temperature sensitive varieties, maize yield could averagely increase by 1.0-6.0%, 9.9-15.2%, and 4.1-5.6%, by adopting adaptation options of early planting, fixing variety growing duration, and late planting, respectively. ET could averagely increase by 1.9-4.4%, 1.9-3.7%, and -2.9% to -0.7%. respectively. In contrast, using high-temperature tolerant varieties, maize yield could averagely increase by -2.4% to -1.4%, 34.7-45.6%. and 5.7-6.1%, respectively. ET could averagely increase by 0.7-0.9%, 9.4-11.6%, and -0.4% to 0.2%, respectively. The spatial patterns show that the relative contributions of adaptation options can be geographically quite different, depending on the climate and variety properties. The biggest benefits will result from the development of new crop varieties that are high-temperature tolerant and have high thermal requirements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present an overview of 27 years of experience of domestication and farming of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in Sweden. The domestication process included an evaluation of suitable strains for farming, a breeding programme and the study of the biological and behavioural characteristics of the species. Traits of three different Arctic charr populations differing in ecology and appearance were compared during initial 2-year trials under farming conditions. The best-performing population with respect to the growth rate and the lowest frequency of early sexual maturation was a piscivore form and this became the foundation for a breeding programme intended to select for an Arctic charr strain suitable for farming. After 23 years and 7 generations, our selective breeding has resulted in a fast-growing, late-maturing strain much appreciated by farmers. The biological and behavioural characteristics studied included annual and diel locomotor activity, feeding, social and thermal behaviour. Applying our findings in these areas has greatly improved both profits and conditions for the fish. Other investigations have focused on the application and further evaluation of the results from research in practical farming trials, such as evaluation of growth at different farms with different temperature conditions, optimal time and stocking density for start-feeding and evaluation of different feeding schedules. In Sweden, Arctic charr is mainly farmed in net pens situated in nutritionally depleted and extremely unproductive water reservoirs formed by damming rivers to create electric power. Judicious farming of Arctic charr in such reservoirs can restore their nutritional and productivity state to that which existed before regulation. Site selection criteria for Arctic charr farming in such waters have been developed. The development of intensive farming of Arctic charr in Sweden is discussed together with current limitations and future possibilities.

AB  - Magma fluxes in the Earth's crust play an important role in regulating the relationship between the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, the chemical evolution of magmatic systems, and the distribution of geothermal energy and mineral resources on our planet. Therefore, quantifying magma productivity and the rate of magma transfer within the crust can provide valuable insights to characterize the long-term behavior of volcanic systems and to unveil the link between the physical and chemical evolution of magmatic systems and their potential to generate resources. We performed thermal modeling to compute the temperature evolution of crustal magmatic intrusions with different final volumes assembled over a variety of timescales (i.e., at different magma fluxes). Using these results, we calculated synthetic populations of zircon ages assuming the number of zircons crystallizing in a given time period is directly proportional to the volume of magma at temperature within the zircon crystallization range. The statistical analysis of the calculated populations of zircon ages shows that the mode, median, and standard deviation of the populations varies coherently as function of the rate of magma injection and final volume of the crustal intrusions. Therefore, the statistical properties of the population of zircon ages can add useful constraints to quantify the rate of magma injection and the final volume of magmatic intrusions. Here, we explore the effect of different ranges of zircon saturation temperature, intrusion geometry, and wall rock temperature on the calculated distributions of zircon ages. Additionally, we determine the effect of undersampling on the variability of mode, median, and standards deviation of calculated populations of zircon ages to estimate the minimum number of zircon analyses necessary to obtain meaningful estimates of magma flux and final intrusion volume.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are compounds with a minimum of two six-atom aromatic fused rings. PACs arise from incomplete combustion or thermal decomposition of organic matter and are ubiquitous in the environment. Within PACs, carcinogenicity is generally regarded to be the most important public health concern. However, toxicity in other systems (reproductive and developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity) has also been reported. Despite the large number of PACs identified in the environment, research attention to understand exposure and health effects of PACs has focused on a relatively limited subset, namely polycydic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the PACs with only carbon and hydrogen atoms. To triage the rest of the vast number of PACs for more resource-intensive testing, we developed a data-driven approach to contextualize hazard characterization of PACs, by leveraging the available data from various data streams (in silico toxicity, in vitro activity, structural fingerprints, and in vivo data availability). The PACs were clustered on the basis of their in silico toxicity profiles containing predictions from 8 different categories (carcinogenicity, cardiotoxicity, developmental toxicity, genotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and urinary toxicity). We found that PACs with the same parent structure (e.g., fluorene) could have diverse in silico toxicity profiles. In contrast, PACs with similar substituted groups (e.g., alkylated-PAHs) or heterocyclics (e.g., N-PACs) with varying ring sizes could have similar in silico toxicity profiles, suggesting that these groups are better candidates for toxicity read-across analysis. The dusters/regions associated with certain in silico toxicity, in vitro activity, and structural fingerprints were identified. We found that genotoxicity/carcinogenicity (in silico toxicity) and xenobiotic homeostasis and stress response (in vitro activity), respectively, dominate the toxicity/activity variation seen in the PACs. The "hot spots" with enriched toxicity/activity in conjunction with availability of in vivo carcinogenicity data revealed regions of either data-poor (hydroxylated-PAHs) or data-rich (unsubstituted, parent PAHs) PACs. These regions offer potential targets for prioritization of further in vivo assessment and for chemical read-across efforts. The analysis results are searchable through an interactive web application (https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/pacs_tabIeau), allowing for alternative hypothesis generation.

AB  - The genus Zamia (Zamiaceae: Cycadales) exhibits its greatest diversity in Colombia and is highly threatened by habitat loss, extraction for ornamental plant trade, and mining, among other factors. One of the most important considerations for the effective conservation of Zamia is its highly specialized reproductive biology. Despite the importance of pollination for the populations' viability, no studies have examined the pollination process of cycads in Colombia. Herein, we describe the pollination process of Zamia incognita A. Lindstr. & Idarraga, in a natural population. Exclusion experiments were performed by selectively excluding wind, beetles, both, or neither, which demonstrated that Pharaxonotha beetles are effective pollinators of Zamia incognita and that wind does not play any role as pollen vector. By following beetles marked with fluorescent dyes and directly observing beetle movements on and into female cones and micropyles, we confirmed that Pharaxonotha sp. is the effective pollinator of Z. incognita. The beetles traveled a maximum dispersal distance from a male to female cone of nearly 22 m and a minimum distance of 5 m. We found Pharaxonotha beetles in male cones, where they complete their life cycle. Cones produce heat in a circadian pattern associated with the elongation of the cones and pollen shedding. The increase in cones' temperature appears to play an important role in beetle attraction. We suggest that pollination droplets on the micropyles would be a reward to pollinators. We also discuss the relationship of this Zamia species with other insects, which have important consequences for the conservation of web interactions.

AB  - Background: Chlorella is one of the few microalgae employed for human consumption. It typically has a high protein content, but it can also accumulate high amounts of lipids or carbohydrates under stress conditions and, for this reason, it is of interest in the production of biofuels. High production costs and energy consumption are associated with its cultivation. This work describes a strategy to reduce costs and environmental impact of Chlorella biomass production for food, biofuels and other applications.
   Results: The growth of four Chlorella strains, selected after a laboratory screening, was investigated outdoors in a low-cost 0.25 m(2) GWP-II photobioreactor. The capacity of the selected strains to grow at high temperature was tested. On the basis of these results, in the nitrogen starvation trials the culture was cooled only when the temperature exceeded 40 degrees C to allow for significant energy savings, and performed in a seawater-based medium to reduce the freshwater footprint. Under nutrient sufficiency, strain CH2 was the most productive. In all the strains, nitrogen starvation strongly reduced productivity, depressed protein and induced accumulation of carbohydrate (about 50%) in strains F&M-M49 and IAM C-212, and lipid (40 - 45%) in strains PROD1 and CH2. Starved cultures achieved high storage product productivities: 0.12 g L-1 d(-1) of lipids for CH2 and 0.19 g L-1 d(-1) of carbohydrates for F&M-M49. When extrapolated to large-scale in central Italy, CH2 showed a potential productivity of 41 t ha(-1) y(-1) for biomass, 16 t ha(-1) y(-1) for protein and 11 t ha(-1) y(-1) for lipid under nutrient sufficiency, and 8 t ha(-1) y(-1) for lipid under nitrogen starvation.
   Conclusions: The environmental and economic sustainability of Chlorella production was enhanced by growing the organisms in a seawater-based medium, so as not to compete with crops for freshwater, and at high temperatures, so as to reduce energy consumption for cooling. All the four selected strains are good candidates for food or biofuels production in lands unsuitable for conventional agriculture. Chlorella strain CH2 has the potential for more than 80 tonnes of biomass, 32 tonnes of protein and 22 tonnes of lipid per year under favourable climates.

AB  - Phenotypic variance is attributed to genetic and non-genetic factors, and only the former are presumed to be inherited and thus suitable for the action of selection. Although increasing amounts of data suggest that non-genetic variability may be inherited, we have limited empirical data in animals. Here, we performed an artificial selection experiment using Drosophila melanogaster inbred lines. We quantified the response to selection for a decrease in chill coma recovery time and an increase in starvation resistance. We observed a weak response to selection in the inbred and outbred lines, with variability across lines. At the end of the selection process, differential expression was detected for some genes associated with epigenetics, the piRNA pathway and canalization functions. As the selection process can disturb the canalization process and increase the phenotypic variance of developmental traits, we also investigated possible effects of the selection process on the number of scutellar bristles, fluctuating asymmetry levels and fitness estimates. These results suggest that, contrary to what was shown in plants, selection of non-genetic variability is not straightforward in Drosophila and appears to be strongly genotype dependent.

AB  - Identification of loci under divergent selection is a key step in understanding the evolutionary process because those loci are responsible for the genetic variations that affect fitness in different environments. Understanding how environmental forces give rise to adaptive genetic variation is a challenge in pest control. Here, we performed an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome scan in populations of the bamboo locust, Ceracris kiangsu, to search for candidate loci that are influenced by selection along an environmental gradient in southern China. In outlier locus detection, loci that demonstrate significantly higher or lower among-population genetic differentiation than expected under neutrality are identified as outliers. We used several outlier detection methods to study the features of C. kiangsu, including method DFDIST, BayeScan, and logistic regression. A total of 97 outlier loci were detected in the C. kiangsu genome with very high statistical supports. Moreover, the results suggested that divergent selection arising from environmental variation has been driven by differences in temperature, precipitation, humidity and sunshine. These findings illustrate that divergent selection and potential local adaptation are prevalent in locusts despite seemingly high levels of gene flow. Thus, we propose that native environments in each population may induce divergent natural selection.

AB  - For species without parental care, such as sea turtles, nest site selection is particularly important for embryo development, hatchling survival and, ultimately, reproductive success. We conducted an 8-year (2012-2019) capture-mark-recapture study of the re-nesting behaviour of loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta to identify both inter- and intra-beach patterns of nest site selection. Our study site, Maio Island in the archipelago of Cabo Verde, hosts one of the largest loggerhead turtle nesting colonies globally. Of 1,060 females analysed, 77% laid repeated clutches within 15 km of their previous nesting sites both between and within nesting seasons. This site fidelity was particularly high (64-71%) for turtles nesting on the east coast of Maio Island. In two areas of the island (north-west and south-east) individual nesting zone consistency was extremely low (10-25%). In all cases extra-zone re-nesting events mainly occurred on the east coast. We also found that females avoided re-nesting near the shoreline, which is particularly relevant in the context of rising sea levels. Overall, loggerhead turtles nesting in Maio Island are philopatric but are using a bet-edging strategy to distribute nests amongst several beaches, choosing the safest area within each beach to maximize their reproductive success. This study highlights the priority sites for protection on Maio Island and could help to optimize capture-mark-recapture programmes. The data reveal the potential for adaptive responses to projected sea level rises.

AB  - How genomic selection enables species to adapt to divergent environments is a fundamental question in ecology and evolution. We investigated the genomic signatures of local adaptation in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) along a natural salinity gradient, ranging from 35% in the North Sea to 7% within the Baltic Sea. By utilizing a 12K SNPchip, we simultaneously assessed neutral and adaptive genetic divergence across the Atlantic cod genome. Combining outlier analyses with a landscape genomic approach, we identified a set of directionally selected loci that are strongly correlated with habitat differences in salinity, oxygen, and temperature. Our results show that discrete regions within the Atlantic cod genome are subject to directional selection and associated with adaptation to the local environmental conditions in the Baltic-and the North Sea, indicating divergence hitchhiking and the presence of genomic islands of divergence. We report a suite of outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms within or closely located to genes associated with osmoregulation, as well as genes known to play important roles in the hydration and development of oocytes. These genes are likely to have key functions within a general osmoregulatory framework and are important for the survival of eggs and larvae, contributing to the buildup of reproductive isolation between the low-salinity adapted Baltic cod and the adjacent cod populations. Hence, our data suggest that adaptive responses to the environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea may contribute to a strong and effective reproductive barrier, and that Baltic cod can be viewed as an example of ongoing speciation.

AB  - The variation of the magnetoelastic resonance frequency as a function of the temperature is investigated for sensing purposes in two samples with different properties. It is observed that maximum sensitivity is reached when biasing the sample close to the anisotropy field. A compensation field is also found at which the resonance frequency is insensitive to temperature changes. It is demonstrated that the observed behavior is determined mainly by the temperature dependence of the anisotropy constants of the samples. The results suggest the viability of remote temperature monitoring even trough opaque barriers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to describe kinetic differences between isothermal and anisothermal fermentations, a study using an automatic device for monitoring fermentation was conducted. Isothermal alcoholic fermentations were compared with anisothermal fermentations reaching the same final temperature. In most cases, the rate at the end of the fermentation was faster under anisothermal conditions. This phenomenon appeared to be influenced by several parameters, particularly the assimilable nitrogen content of the must. However, in some cases, the fermentation rate decreased dramatically after the activation was noticed because of the adverse effect of loss of cell viability. Some practical consequences of these observations are discussed.

AB  - An objective of the Pittsburgh Air Quality Study was to determine the major sources Of PM2.5 in the Pittsburgh region. Daily 24-hour averaged filter-based data were collected for 13 months, starting in July 2001, including sulfate and nitrate data from IC analysis, trace element data from ICP-MS analysis, and organic and elemental carbon from the thermal optical transmittance (TOT) method and the NIOSH thermal evolution protocol. These data were used in two source-receptor models, Unmix and PMF. Unmix, which is limited to a maximum number of seven factors, resolved six source factors, including crustal material, a regional transport factor, secondary nitrate, an iron, zinc and manganese factor, specialty steel production and processing, and cadmium. PMF, which has no limit to the number of factors, apportioned the PM2.5 mass into ten factors, including crustal material, secondary sulfate, primary OC and EC, secondary nitrate, an iron, zinc and manganese factor, specialty steel production and processing, cadmium, selenium, lead, and a gallium-rich factor. The Unmix and PMF common factors agree reasonably well, both in composition and contributions to PM2.5. To further identify and apportion the sources Of PM2.5, specific OC compounds that are known markers of some sources were added to the PMF analysis. The results were similar to the original solution, except that the primary OC and EC factor split into two factors. One factor was associated with vehicles as identified by the hopanes, PAH's, and other OC compounds. The other factor had strong correlations with the OC and EC ambient data as well as wood smoke markers such as levoglucosan, syringols, and resin acids.

AB  - This review is dedicated to the comparison of the facts obtained and the proposed hypotheses, to the critical analysis of the situation arisen, and to the estimation of key propositions of the concept developed. The main point is that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) participate directly in expression, variability, selection and evolution of different quantitative characters. Genetic and selection data are considered, and hypotheses of random fixation, marker effect and direct participation of MGE patterns in expression and selection of quantitative characters are discussed. The consequences of temperature treatment are considered and hypotheses of masked selection and temperature induction of transpositions are discussed. The marker effects are shown to be non-sufficient to explain the properties of quantitative character radius incompletes system. The MGE patterns are important components of genetical system of determination of a quantitative character. MGEs modify, enhance the expression of neighbouring polygenes. Temperature effects could be explained by the influence of stress temperature treatment through the system of heat shock response on the capacity of MGEs to transcribe and transpose. The system of diversed MGE patterns in drosophila chromosomes could be believed to be universal genomic system of <<soft>> modification of the polygenic control of any limiting quantitative characters.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to understand the immune response induced by different forms of the probiont Lactobacillus rhamnosus JCM 1136 in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and to clarify the carry over effect after withdrawal of the probiotic diet. A prebiotic-based diet was formulated, which served as the control diet, and to it the selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was incorporated in one of the three forms: (1) heat-killed, (2) live-sprayed or (3) freeze-dried. A rearing trial was conducted in triplicate with juvenile rainbow trout (average 126 g), which were fed on the control and three other diets containing the respective forms of the probionts, two times daily until the satiation level for a period of 30 days, following which the test diets were withdrawn and control diet was fed up to 45 days. Sampling was done at 10, 20, 30 and 45 days for gut microflora composition and the non-specific humoral and cellular immune responses of the fish. The viable forms (live spray or freeze-dried) were found to induce better phagocytic activity and complement activity compared to that of the non-viable heat-killed form. The plasma immunoglobulin level showed an increasing trend in the fish groups that received the viable probiont, but the trend did not exist towards the end of the study. Upon withdrawal of the probiotic diets, the LAB disappeared from the intestine and the elevated immune parameters returned to the prefed level. This study elucidates that probiont viability could probably influence the immune responses they induce. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aggression and courtship behavior were examined of wild Drosophila melanogaster flies isolated from two contrasting microclimates found at Evolution Canyon in Mt. Carmel, Israel: an African-like dry tropical Slope (AS) and a European-like humid temperate Slope (ES), separated by 250 meters. Studies were carried out to ask whether behavioral differences existed between the two populations obtained from opposite slopes with divergent microclimates in Israel. First, we measured and compared intraslope aggression between same sex fly pairings collected from the same slope. Both male and female flies displayed similar fighting abilities from both slopes. ES males, however, from the humid biome, showed a tendency to lunge more per aggressive encounter, compared with AS males from the dry biome. Next, we tested interslope aggression by pairing flies from opposite slopes. ES males displayed higher numbers of lunges, and won more fights against their AS opponents. We also observed enhanced courtship performances in ES compared to AS males. The fighting and courtship superiority seen in ES males could reinforce fitness and pre-mating reproductive isolation mechanisms that underlie incipient sympatric speciation. This may support an evolutionary advantage of adaptively divergent fruit fly aggression phenotypes from different environments.

AB  - The organism and somatic cells thermoresistance was studied on larvae of first generation tilapia obtained from females exposed to low temperature (20-22-degrees-C) at the age of 15-30 days. IT was established that gonads of 15-30-day aged females contained primary sex cells and gonia. The exposure to low temperature resulted in a partial (14.8%) death of females and survived ones lost a part of sex cells, The offspring from these females had an increased organism thermoresistance at both considered stages of development (2 and 15-20 days after emergence). The revealed method of targeted modulation of organism thermoresistance is interesting both for the analysis of microevolutionary mechanisms and for the applied pisciculture.

AB  - While conducting a study of home range and habitat use of the eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos) in Southern Ontario, we observed both mating and nesting behaviors for this species. Here we describe the active excavation of oviposition sites by H. platirhinos; mating behavior, including multiple copulations of a single female with five males; and philopatry to specific nest sites by multiple individuals in successive years. As our study site is close to the northern limit of this species' range, nest sites may need to be carefully selected to provide a thermal regime warm enough to incubate the eggs. Mean nest temperatures in the field ranged from 23.4 to 26.1 C, while incubation periods ranged from 49 to 63 d.

AB  - Altitudinal gradients are among the most powerful 'natural experiments' for testing ecological and evolutionary responses of biota to geophysical influences, such as low temperature. However, there are two categories of environmental changes with altitude: those physically tied to meters above sea level, such as atmospheric pressure, temperature and clear-sky turbidity; and those that are not generally altitude specific, such as moisture, hours of sunshine, wind, season length, geology and even human land use. The confounding of the first category by the latter has introduced confusion in the scientific literature on altitude phenomena.

AB  - The future supplies and usage of glycerol are expected to increase as biodiesel plants increase production, and the output will greatly outpace demand. Biodiesel production has already had a significant impact on the price of refined glycerol. A major concern of glycerol producers is the reduced price of glycerol resulting from the increased production of biodiesel. Some alternative uses for this glycerol that have been investigated are substrates for fermentation process or the production of biosurfactants, fatty acids, biopolymers, and others products. This work had as objective to evaluate two strains of Xanthomonas sp isolate from Brazil for xanthan gum in orbital agitator, analizing the apparent viscosity of aqueous solutions and selecting viscosity. The experiments of xanthan gum production were realized in orbital agitator with 120 rpm agitation, for cells production, and 180rpm, for biopolymer production, under a 28 degrees C temperature. The rheology of the fermentation broth was analyzed by apparent viscosity and the polymer was recovered with ethanol (1:3, v/v). After its recovery, the productivity evaluation was performed. The productivity were 0.157 and 0.363 gL(-1) for C1 and 0.186 and 0.363 gL(-1) for C9 to media glycerol or glycerol and sucrose, respectively. The viscosity analysis was performed for aqueous solutions 3%, at 25 degrees C, the best apparent viscosity was obtained using gum synthesized with glycerol and sucrose (50:50) at 25 degrees C, 143 mPa.s(-1) from Xanthomonas sp C1

AB  - An integrated batch annealing furnace simulator with the capability of predicting spatial and temporal evolution of temperature, microstructure and mechanical properties of the coils during the batch annealing operation has been developed. The prediction capability of this integrated simulator has been extensively validated with data collected from several industrial batch annealing operations. In this article, the problems in controlling a batch annealing operation via conventional temperature based control strategy has been highlighted. These problems call be effectively resolved by using the integrated simulator. Furthermore, the utility of this simulator has been illustrated by a case study on optimization of coil dimensions for maximization of furnace productivity.

AB  - Previous global analyses projected shifts in species distributions and maximum fisheries catch potential across ocean basins by 2050 under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B. However, these studies did not account for the effects of changes in ocean biogeochemistry and phytoplankton community structure that affect fish and invertebrate distribution and productivity. This paper uses a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model that incorporates these factors to project distribution and maximum catch potential of 120 species of exploited demersal fish and invertebrates in the Northeast Atlantic. Using projections from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model (ESM2.1) under the SRES A1B, we project an average rate of distribution-centroid shift of 52 km decade(-1) northwards and 5.1 m decade(-1) deeper from 2005 to 2050. Ocean acidification and reduction in oxygen content reduce growth performance, increase the rate of range shift, and lower the estimated catch potentials (10-year average of 2050 relative to 2005) by 20-30% relative to simulations without considering these factors. Consideration of phytoplankton community structure may further reduce projected catch potentials by similar to 10%. These results highlight the sensitivity of marine ecosystems to biogeochemical changes and the need to incorporate likely hypotheses of their biological and ecological effects in assessing climate change impacts.

AB  - The most frequent cause of salmonelloses are food poisonings. However, many studies prove the occurrence and possibility of survival of rods of the genus Salmonella in lakes. The bacteria are often isolated from water sources, which act as a bacterial reservoir. Rods of Salmonella are constantly released to the environment, which results in infections of people and animals. In comparison with other microorganisms, bacteria of the genus Salmonella are characterized by a high survival rate in water environments, particularly in waters of highly eutrophicated lakes. Temperature, the shortage of nutrients, osmotic stress and light has the most negative effect on their survival. Due to its common accessibility, water is an environment which plays an essential role in spread of diseases. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of selected temperatures on the survival rate of bacilli Salmonella Enteritidis, and the dynamics of quantitative changes of the bacteria in time in bathing waters used for recreation, tested under laboratory conditions. As well as to determine the dynamic of quantitative changes of the bacteria in time under laboratory conditions. The samples for the study were collected from a lake in the Bydgoszcz district. In the conducted experiment it was indicated that Salmonella Enteritidis survived longer in water at 4 degrees C (51 days), as compared with 20 degrees C (39 days). In the present study the elimination rate of bacteria population, according to the analysis of regression, amounted to 0.16 log daily at 4 degrees C, whereas at 20 degrees C it assumed a value of 0.15 log daily. Consequently, it may be concluded that a lower temperature has a more stabilizing effect on rods of the genus Salmonella.

AB  - The survival of mantle geochemical heterogeneities depends on the relative values of the residence times of individual elements in the mantle and of the scale-dependent mixing rate imposed by convection. Major and trace element data on fresh glasses from the PETDB data base were compiled to extract statistics on MORB compositions. It was found that the log-normal distribution provides an adequate description of the data. New means, modes, and standard deviations have been calculated after correction for crystal fractionation to 8% MgO. The residence times of the incompatible lithophile elements in the mantle were calculated as ratios of the mean mantle (Bulk Silicate Earth minus the continental crust) composition to fluxes of elements into the oceanic crust. They vary within a rather narrow range (4-9 Gy) and the larger uncertainties on U, Th, Ba, K, and Rb come from those on the continental crust composition. The mantle is therefore not at geochemical steady-state and the effect of its primordial composition on models of modern mantle geochemistry is still strong. Up to 50% of incompatible lithophile elements may never have been extracted into the oceanic crust, which expands a conclusion reached previously for Ar-40. The residence time of heat in the mantle is indistinguishable from those of the incompatible lithophile elements implying that 50% of the Earth's primordial heat may still be buried at depth. This simple observation relieves the heat/helium paradox, which was used as an argument in favor of a conductive boundary layer at intermediate depth in the mantle. The balance between buoyancy flux and dissipation provides frame-independent estimates of the rates of mixing by mantle convection: Primordial geochemical anomalies with initial length scales comparable to mantle depths of plate lengths may be marginally visible at the scale of mantle melting underneath mid-ocean ridges (approximate to 50 km), but may show strongly in hot spot basalts and even more so in melt inclusions. A theory of residence time distributions of tracers in a convecting mantle with recycling of the oceanic crust is presented. It demonstrates that up to 50% primordial material may be present in the mantle, but scattered throughout as small (< 10 km) domains, strongly sheared and refolded, and interbedded with younger recycled material.

AB  - Multiple layers of GaN/AlN quantum dot (QD) ensembles were grown by the Stranski-Krastanov method on Si(111) using molecular beam epitaxy. During the subsequent cooling from growth temperature, the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the Si substrate and GaN/AlN film containing the vertically stacked QDs leads to an additional biaxial tensile stress of 20-30 kbar in the III-nitride film. We have selectively modified the thermal stress in the QD layers by etching a cross-hatched pattern into the as-grown sample using inductively coupled Cl-2/Ar plasma reactive ion etching. The results show that a suitable choice of stripe width from similar to 2 to 10 mu m and orientation along [11-20] and [1-100] can create regions of in-plane uniaxial stress that enable a selective and local control of the polarized luminescence from ensembles of QDs which were probed with cathodoluminescence. Experimental results indicate that the polarization anisotropy vanishes at high temperatures (similar to 300 K) with an increasing e-h pair excitation for the QDs, while the anisotropy decreases more slowly with excitation at low temperatures (similar to 46 K). A theoretical modelling of the effect of carrier filling on the polarization anisotropy and the excitonic transition energy was performed, as based on three-dimensional self-consistent solutions of the Schrodinger and Poisson equations using the 6x6 k.p and effective-mass methods for calculations of the e-h wavefunctions and electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels for varying levels of state filling. We attribute carrier filling and a thermal excitation of holes into higher energy QD hole states during e-h pair excitation to account for the observed gradual decrease in the polarization anisotropy with an increasing e-h pair excitation density at T = 300 K.

AB  - 1. Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists from the time of Charles Elton in the 1920s. The discovery of large population fluctuations in undisturbed ecosystems challenged the idea that pristine nature was in a state of balance. The 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) across the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska is a classic cycle, recognized by fur traders for more than 300years.
   2. Since the 1930s, ecologists have investigated the mechanisms that might cause these cycles. Proposed causal mechanisms have varied from sunspots to food supplies, parasites, diseases, predation and social behaviour. Both the birth rate and the death rate change dramatically over the cycle. Social behaviour was eliminated as a possible cause because snowshoe hares are not territorial and do not commit infanticide.
   3. Since the 1960s, large-scale manipulative experiments have been used to discover the major limiting factors. Food supply and predation quickly became recognized as potential key factors causing the cycle. Experiments adding food and restricting predator access to field populations have been decisive in pinpointing predation as the key mechanism causing these fluctuations.
   4. The immediate cause of death of most snowshoe hares is predation by a variety of predators, including the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis Kerr). The collapse in the reproductive rate is not due to food shortage as was originally thought, but is a result of chronic stress from predator chases.
   5. Five major issues remain unresolved. First, what is the nature of the predator-induced memory that results in the prolonged low phase of the cycle? Second, why do hare cycles form a travelling wave, starting in the centre of the boreal forest in Saskatchewan and travelling across western Canada and Alaska? Third, why does the amplitude of the cycle vary greatly from one cycle to the next in the same area? Fourth, do the same mechanisms of population limitation apply to snowshoe hares in eastern North American or in similar ecosystems across Siberia? Finally, what effect will climatic warming have on all the above issues? The answers to these questions remain for future generations of biologists to determine.

AB  - Temperature has profound effects on biological efficiency of parasitoid wasps. In the present study, effects of seven constant temperatures (12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 +/- 0.5 degrees C) on the pre-adult development of Trichogramma brassicae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) were investigated on Sitotroga cerealella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Temperature effects on the emergence rate and sex ratio were also determined. The development rate of T. brassicae was described using two linear and twenty non-linear functions and critical bioclimatic temperatures (i.e., T-min, T-opt, T-max and k) were estimated. Efficiency of models was assessed by different criteria (i.e., R-2, R-adj(2), SSE, AIC, AICc, BIC and zi). Rate of development increased from 12 to 30 degrees C but decreased at two higher temperatures (i.e., 32 and 35 degrees C). At all thermal regimes a higher number of female individuals was emerged than males (1.81, 2.23, 2.03, 1.44, 1.78 and 1.78 female: male, respectively). At 12 degrees C, the lowest rate of parasitoid emergence (9%) was observed. The lower threshold predicted by the two linear models were 8.13 (Ordinary regression method) and 8.36 degrees C (Ikemoto method). These models predicted the thermal constant for pre-adult development as 181 and 177 DD, respectively. The estimates of optimum temperature ranged from 30 to 32 degrees C with an upper threshold between 36 and 41 degrees C, depending on which model was used. Based on both biological and statistical goodness-of-fit criteria, the non-linear model of Lactin-1 had the best described the experimental data. The information herein highlighted the higher performance of T. brassicae at tropical conditions and can be helpful to predict possible effects of temperature on developmental rate, select the best period of time for inundative release and improve mass rearing protocols of this parasitoid wasp.

AB  - Sixteen batches of eggs collected immediately after spawning from five atipa (Hoplosternum littorale, (Hancock, 1828), Siluriformes, Callichthyidae) nests have been incubated at temperatures ranging from 22.5 to 32 degrees C. After a growing period of 8 months allowing all the fishes to express totally all secondary sexual characteristics, the sex of 9756 fishes was determined. The sexing criteria based on the color and length of the first ray of the pectoral fins are very reliable, and may lead to an error for only 0.3% of the fishes. For the 16 batches, the male sex ratio (ratio between the number of males and the total number of fishes) varies from 46.4 to 98.5% and is always greater than 50% with one exception. An overall analysis of the results shows no marked correlation (r(2) = 0.312) between the proportions of males and the thermic conditions during incubation of eggs. But within each set of eggs from the same nest, this ratio systematically increases with increasing temperatures. The very low probability (0.0015) of such an event in the 15 batches of eggs from four independent nests suggests both a strong influence of the incubation temperature on the final proportion of males, and an important parental effect on the thermosensitivity of the offspring. The analysis shows clearly that a differential mortality between the sexes cannot account for the shifts towards such high proportions of males in the sex ratios. Thermosensitivity would be expressed early in this species, in the 3 days following spawning. The validity of these experimental results with regard to the natural environment as well as the potential adaptative advantage of such a mechanism for the species are discussed.

AB  - In freshwater zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread predator-avoidance behavior that is induced by kairomones released from fish. Thereby zooplankton reduces predation by fish by staying in deep and dark colder strata during daytime and migrating into warmer layers during night, and thus experiences diel alterations in temperature. Constantly lower temperatures have been shown to increase the relative abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in Daphnia sp. Furthermore, a low dietary supply of the omega 3-PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been shown to limit the induction of DVM in Daphnia magna and the performance of D. magna under fluctuating temperatures, as experienced during DVM. In nature DVM of D. magna in response to fish is accompanied by the presence of fish-borne kairomone and diel fluctuations of depth dependent-parameters like temperature, food, and oxygen supply. Here we investigated the effect of factors, which are differing between Daphnia that perform DVM and those which do not. We selected to examine the effect of changing temperature and light conditions and of the presence/absence of fish kairomones on D. magna. For this purpose, we conducted a full factorial experimental design in which we grew D. magna under constantly warm temperatures in a diel light-dark regime or under alternating temperatures in darkness crossed with the presence or absence of fish kairomones. We analyzed the fatty acid composition of mature animals and of their offspring in each treatment. Simulation of the light and temperature regime of migrating animals in presence of the fish kairomone resulted in an increased relative allocation of the omega 3-PUFA EPA, from adult animals to their offspring, manifesting as decreased EPA concentrations in mothers and increased EPA concentrations in their offspring in response to simulated DVM (mothers). Additionally, EPA concentrations in the offspring were affected by the interaction of simulated DVM and the fish cue. The presence of the fish kairomone alone increased the EPA concentration in the offspring, that was not experiencing simulated DVM. These findings lead to the conclusion that the temperature and light regime associated with DVM alone, as well as in combination with the DVM-inducing fish kairomones, alter the allocation of fatty acids to the offspring in a manner, which is beneficial for the offspring under the decreased average temperatures, which migrating animals are exposed to. A low dietary supply of omega 3-PUFAs may constrain D. magna's amplitude of DVM, but our results suggest that the next generation of animals may be capable of regaining the full DVM amplitude due to the effect of the fish kairomone and the experienced temperature fluctuations (and darkness) on tissue fatty acid composition. These findings suggest that fatty acid limitation in DVM performing Daphnia may be more severe for the maternal than for the offspring generation.

T2  - HEREDITY
LA  - English
AB  - Geographic and environmental isolations of islands and the mainland offer excellent opportunity to investigate colonization and survival dynamics of island populations. We inferred and compared evolutionary processes and the demographic history of Rhododendron tsusiophyllum, in the Izu Islands and the much larger island Honshu, treated here as the mainland, using thousands of nuclear SNPs obtained by ddRAD-seq from eight populations of R. tsusiophyllum and three populations of R. tschonoskii as an outgroup. Phylogenetic relationships and their habitats suggest that R. tsusiophyllum had evolved and migrated from cold north to warm south regions. We detected clear genetic divergence among populations in three regions of Honshu and the Izu Islands, suggesting restricted migration between them due to isolated habitats on mountains even in the mainland. The three regions have different changes in effective population size, especially, genetic diversity and population size of the Izu Islands are small compared to the others. Further, habitats of populations in the Izu Islands are warmer than those in Honshu, suggesting that they have undergone adaptive evolution. Our study provides evidences of montane rather than insular isolation on genetic divergence, survival of populations and significance of adaptive evolution for island populations with small population size and low genetic diversity, despite close proximity to mainland populations.

AB  - Bacterial adaption to the multiple stressed environments of high-altitude niches in the Himalayas is intriguing and is of considerable interest to biotechnologists. Previously, we studied the culturable and unculturable metagenome microbial diversity from glacial and kettle lakes in the Western Himalayas. In this study, we explored the adaptive strategies of a unique Himalayan eurypsychrophile Iodobacter sp. PCH194, which can synthesize polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and violacein pigment. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis of Iodobacter sp. PCH194 (4.58 Mb chromosome and three plasmids) revealed genetic traits associated with adaptive strategies for cold/freeze, nutritional fluctuation, defense against UV, acidic pH, and the kettle lake's competitive environment. Differential proteome analysis suggested the adaptive role of chaperones, ribonucleases, secretion systems, and antifreeze proteins under cold stress. Antifreeze activity inhibiting the ice recrystallization at -9 degrees C demonstrated the bacterium's survival at subzero temperature. The bacterium stores carbon in the form of PHB under stress conditions responding to nutritional fluctuations. However, violacein pigment protects the cells from UV radiation. Concisely, genomic, proteomic, and physiological studies revealed the multiple adaptive strategies of Himalayan Iodobacter to survive the high-altitude stresses.

TI  - Crack mitigation in Laser Powder Bed Fusion processed Hastelloy X using a combined numerical-experimental approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
LA  - English
AB  - Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique associated with large thermal gradients and thermal strains resulting from the inherent nature of the process. Due to the non-equilibrium solidification conditions, certain alloys suffer from thermally induced micro-cracking, which hinders their exploitation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards the processing of a defect-free nickel-based superalloy, Hastelloy X, by means of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). A combined experimental and numerical approach was used in order to evaluate the influence of the laser beam intensity distribution and melt track overlap on the temperature evolution, solidification behavior and crack formation. The use of a laser beam with narrow diameter and Gaussian beam intensity distribution leads to keyhole mode melting and a steep cooling rate, whereas a large diameter beam with top-hat intensity distribution leads to the formation of wide and shallow conduction mode melt pools, with a lower cooling rate and consequently a coarser sub-grain microstructure. The decrease of hatch spacing did not show a significant change in the local thermal history within a melt pool when a Gaussian beam was used. On the other hand, with the laser with the top-hat beam profile was used, an overall increase in the temperature of the layer and significantly lower cooling rates were observed. As a result, by decreasing the hatch spacing to 125 mu m, micro-crack free Hastelloy X material was produced by LPBF for the first time, using a commercially available powder, simply by optimizing the scanning strategy and without modification of the chemical composition of the alloy. The material in the as-build condition exhibited a higher yield tensile strength (500 +/- 17 MPa) than conventionally produced Hastelloy X (340 MPa), with elongation of 31.5 +/- 3.0%.

AB  - Bacterial populations in long-term stationary-phase (LTSP) laboratory cultures can provide insights into physiological and genetic adaptations to low-energy conditions and population dynamics in natural environments. While overall population density remains stable, these communities are very dynamic and are characterized by the rapid emergence and succession of distinct mutants expressing the growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype, which can reflect an increased capacity to withstand energy limitations and environmental stress. Here, we characterize the metabolic heat signatures and growth dynamics of GASP mutants within an evolving population using isothermal calorimetry. We aged Escherichia coli in anaerobic batch cultures over 20 days inside an isothermal nanocalorimeter and observed distinct heat events related to the emergence of three mutant populations expressing the GASP phenotype after 1.5, 3, and 7 days. Given the heat produced by each population, the maximum number of GASP mutant cells was calculated, revealing abundances of similar to 2.5 x 107, similar to 7.5 x 10(6), and similar to 9.9 x 10(6) cells in the populations, respectively. These data indicate that mutants capable of expressing the GASP phenotype can be acquired during the exponential growth phase and subsequently expressed in LTSP culture.
   IMPORTANCE The present study is innovative in that we have identified previously unknown growth dynamics related to the temporal expression of the growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype that allow mutants in long-term stationary-phase cultures to capitalize on the decrease of energy over prolonged incubation periods. By remaining in an active, but growth-limited, metabolic state similar to that observed in GASP cells grown in vitro, natural microbial communities might be able to prevail over much longer time scales. We believe this report to be a remarkable methodological and conceptual breakthrough in the study of the long-term survival and evolution of bacteria.

AB  - Maintaining the provision of multiple forest ecosystem services requires to take into consideration forest sensitivity and adaptability to a changing environment. In this context, dynamic models are indispensable to assess the combined effects of management and climate change on forest dynamics. We evaluated the importance of implementing different approaches for simulating forest management in the climate-sensitive gap model ForClim and compared its outputs with forest inventory data at multiple sites across the European Alps. The model was then used to study forest dynamics in representative silver fir-European beech stands in the Dinaric Mountains (Slovenia) under current management and different climate scenarios. On average, ForClim accurately predicted the development of basal area and stem numbers, but the type of harvesting algorithm used and the information for stand initialization are key elements that must be defined carefully. Empirical harvesting functions that rigorously impose the number and size of stems to remove fail to reproduce stand dynamics when growth is just slightly under- or overestimated, and thus should be substituted by analytical thinning algorithms that are based on stochastic distribution functions. Long-term simulations revealed that both management and climate change negatively impact conifer growth and regeneration. Under current climate, most of the simulated stands were dominated by European beech at the end of the simulation (i.e., 2150 AD), due to the decline of silver fir and Norway spruce caused mainly by harvesting. This trend was amplified under climate change as growth of European beech was favored by higher temperatures, in contrast to drought-induced growth reductions in both conifers. This forest development scenario is highly undesired by local managers who aim at preserving conifers with high economic value. Overall, our results suggest that maintaining a considerable share of conifers in these forests may not be feasible under climate change, especially at lower elevations where foresters should consider alternative management strategies.

AB  - Disruption to migration is a growing problem for conservation and restoration of animal populations. Anthropogenic barriers along migration paths can delay or prolong migrations, which may result in a mismatch with migration-timing adaptations. To understand the interaction of dams (as barriers along a migration path), seasonally changing environmental conditions, timing of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) downstream migration, and ultimate migration success, we used 10 years of river temperature and discharge data as a template upon which we simulated downstream movement of salmon. Atlantic salmon is a cool-water species whose downstream migrating smolts must complete migration before river temperatures become too warm. We found that dams had a local effect on survival as well as a survival effect that was spatially and temporally removed from the encounter with the dam. While smolts are delayed by dams, temperatures downstream can reach lethal or near-lethal temperatures; as a result, the match between completion of migration and the window of appropriate migration conditions can be disrupted. The strength of this spatially and temporally removed effect is at least comparable to the local effects of dams in determining smolt migration success in the presence of dams. We also considered smolts from different tributaries, varying in distance from the river mouth, to assess the potential importance of locally adapted migration timing on the effect of barriers. Migration-initiation temperature affected modeled smolt survival differentially across tributaries, with the success of smolts from upstream tributaries being much more variable across years than that of smolts with a shorter distance to travel. As a whole, these results point to the importance of broadening our spatial and temporal view when managing migrating populations. We must consider not only how many individuals never make it across migration barriers, but also the spatially and temporally removed consequences of delays at the barriers for those individuals that successfully navigate them.

AB  - Neutron capture therapy (NCT) aims at destroying tumoral cells selectively labeled by (10)boron. B-10 has a very high cross section for thermal neutron capture, and the nuclear reaction leads to the production of an alpha-particle and a Li-7 recoil ion, which carry an energy of 1.47 and 0.85 MeV, respectively. The radiobiological advantages lie in the production of high-LET particles inside the cell, leading to a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the irradiation. Despite a first failure during the 50's in the U.S.A., the long survivals obtained by H. Hatanaka for high grade gliomas have led to a renewal of the research and of the clinical trials. Hatanaka's clinical results have been confirmed since then by those of Y. Mishima on melanoma. This paper focuses on the present status of the research and of the clinical trials of NCT, on the progress in boronated molecules and in neutron sources, and finally on the tumoral localization which could potentially benefit of this technique.

AB  - Seasonal dynamics of feeding activity, oil sac volume, gonad development, sex ratio and spawning periods in the two sibling species Calanus finmarchicus and C. hyperboreus, the key zooplankton copepod organisms throughout the northern Atlantic waters, were studied simultaneously in Malangen, northern Norway, during 1992. We were also tracing differences in surface and deep-dwelling components of these populations in terms of oil sac volume and gonad development during the time period when the G(1) is preparing for a subsequent generation (G(2)) Or hibernation. The main difference in the life cycle strategies of these species is the earlier maturation and spawning of C. hyperboreus. No feeding activity in either of the two species was found in February, but both commenced feeding in March, prior to the spring phytoplankton peak. The larger copepod, C. hyperboreus, had a more intensive energy deposition than C. finmarchicus. The period of active feeding was much shorter for the former species, only from March through July in copepodite stages CIV and CV, and even less in females - March and April. Basically, a similar pattern of seasonal changes in gonad length and lipids was observed in the two species. In June, oil sacs in the surface- and deep-dwelling specimens were about equal, during the rest of the year, lipids in the deep CVs exceeded those in the surface. We propose that as copepods accumulated sufficient lipid reserves, they started to descend, while others, containing less fat, stayed in the upper layers feeding. The mean length of the gonads in the surface-dwelling copepods was consistently less than in their deep counterparts from October to February, so that gonad development at the expense of accumulated reserves during resting stage was cofirmed. C. finmarchicus males were found in considerable numbers only in February and March, and were only occasionally found in the upper layers (0 100 m), while adult male C. hyperboreus were present from October to March, but were never found in the surface layers. The differences in life cycle timing among the two species are discussed in relation to tradeoffs with regard to foraging strategies, generation numbers, bioenergetics and predator avoidance.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to examine seasonal changes in seawater tolerance and growth performance of anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) held at the same temperature (8-degrees-C) during winter and summer. Charr (20-27 cm), previously reared in freshwater under natural photoperiod, were transferred either directly (DT) from freshwater to seawater (35 ppt), from freshwater to brackish water (20 ppt), or were gradually adapted (GT) to seawater over a period of 10 days. Control fish were held in freshwater. Feed intake and osmoregulatory ability were then monitored on three occasions during the following 59 days. Two experiments were carried out, one during winter (December-January) and the other during summer (June-July). In both experiments fish mortality was low. Plasma osmolalities recorded in fish transferred to seawater were within normal ranges, but osmolalities on day 10, were significantly lower in summer (313 mOsm/kg (DT), 328 mOsm/kg (GT)) than in winter (323 mOsm/kg (DT), 352 mOsm/kg (GT)). In winter, feed intake and growth rates were high in fish kept in fresh and brackish water, but charr transferred directly to seawater ate little and lost weight. Fish that were gradually adapted to seawater occupied an intermediate position. During summer the observed differences in feed intake were small and all fish had relatively high growth rates. These results suggest that Arctic charr display seasonal changes in feed intake and growth performance that parallel seasonal changes in hypoosmoregulatory capacity. The ability to survive and hypoosmoregulate in full strength seawater does not, however, seem to be a particularly good indicator of successful seawater adaptation with respect to the ability to display high rates of feed intake and growth. During winter, a gradual transfer to seawater appeared to lead to improved feeding and growth compared to direct transfer.

AB  - Wrinkle ridges are common landforms widely distributed in the lunar maria, Many young wrinkle ridges were found inside Mare Imbrium using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) high-resolution images. They represent very recent tectonic activity on the lunar surface. Determining their formation times and morphology is important in understanding the Moon's late evolution. The young ridges were mapped, and they have a winding and arched morphology. Based on their small scale and crisp appearance, crosscutting relations with very young small craters whose youth was concluded from spatial boulder densities within their ejecta blankets, these young wrinkle ridges were estimated to be as young as 10 or a few 10s of Ma, and may still be active today. The young ridges were mainly distributed in the inner region of Imbrium basin, which may suggest that the thermal and structural evolution of the inside area of Imbrium basin was protracted.

AB  - A drying experiment of litchi pulp was done with a self-built heat-pump drying system. A few commonly-used thin-layer drying models for foods were linearized and fitted with the drying experimental data to select a relatively optimal model of depicting the relationship between moisture ratio and drying time of the heat-pump drying of litchi pulp. It was found that the Page model is relatively optimal. The multivariate linear regression approach was employed to solve for the parameters of the Page model based on experimental data and an experimental verification was conducted; the verification results show that the predicted values of the Page model have a good fitness with the measured values and thus the Page model can predict more accurately the moisture ratio and drying rate of litchi pulp in a heat-pump drying process.

AB  - Watersheds in frozen ground have been influenced by climate change for centuries, particularly in the last two decades when permafrost degradation has accelerated and intensified. This degradation speeds up water transfer, increases soil moisture, improves agricultural productivity, and affects the ecological environment. It is important to evaluate the effects of these impacts on hydrology to develop sustainable water resources management in cold regions. This study evaluated changes in both winter air temperature and streamflow regime for a selected drainage basin at low latitude but high altitude following large scale permafrost degradation in the Tibetan Plateau. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to identify trends in both winter air temperature and streamflow. The results showed significant upward trends in winter flow but not summer runoff. The trend tests indicated that change points of winter streamflow and temperature occurred in 1985 and 1983, respectively. Comparison of winter flow duration for two 16-year periods (1976-1991 and 1992-2008) showed a significantly upward trend in winter streamflow. Increases in most winter flows varied from 16% to 24%, while the increase in low flows was much greater. There were reliable positive correlations between the October and November temperatures and the following monthly discharges. Both the temperature rise and discharge increase at start of the frost period can greatly increase drainage of subsurface water in February, when the maximum variability occurred. The total increases in winter flow are increasing as a function of time, with significant changes occurring since the early 1980s. However, it is yet unclear if the watershed has seen the full effects of the permafrost degradation over the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Drosophila suzukii is an injurious insect pest infesting soft fruit cultivations worldwide. In the recent years, it has spread in new territories, favored by its capability of adapting in new environments. Because of the severe reduction of the yields in cultivated fields, mainly due to the feeding and ovipositional activities, several studies were conducted on the side of the control strategies. However, the cost of the active ingredients, and the safeguard of the environmental and human health led scientists to introduce new tools for decision making. Among the latter, mathematical models play an important role, since their capability to summarize a pool of biological information such that the relations between the species and the external environment. The development and validation of mathematical models which faithfully describe the life cycle of ectotherms, as insects are, provide reliable tools to use in an integrated pest management framework. This work extends the application of a physiologically based model in the case study of D. suzukii, providing a validation in the case of an insect pest relevant in agriculture, and an accurate estimation of a set of biological parameters.
   The Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is a harmful insect pest for soft fruit cultivations. Even though its main hosts belong to the genera Prunus and Rubus, its high polyphagy and adaptability to new environments makes it a serious problem for farmers worldwide, who have reported several economic losses because of this pest. A wide series of proposals to control SWD are available and operate in line with the mechanisms of integrated pest management, demonstrating their high efficiency when applied at the opportune moment. This work aims to apply and validate a physiologically based model which summarises all the available information about D. suzukii biology, such as the relationship between environmental temperature and its development, fertility and mortality rates. The model provided, as a result, a description of a population of SWD females taking into consideration the multiple generations that occurred during the year. Simulations were then compared with field data collected in a three-year survey in two experimental fields located in the Sabina Romana area (Lazio, Italy). More specifically, D. suzukii males were monitored with traps in fields cultivated with mixed varieties of cherries and they were selected because of their clearer identification in comparison to females. Results showed a high level of reliability of simulations in representing the field data, highlighting at the same time that there is no discrepancy in simulating D. suzukii females in order to represent male populations.

AB  - We explored the growth response of Scots pine to temperature, precipitation, and drought focusing on eleven provenances from the IUFRO 1982 international provenance trial. At two macroclimatically different sites in Germany we measured chronologies of tree-ring widths and annual height increment. We estimated general climate/growth relationships and examined the growth response, based on tolerance indices of resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience, to the most severe drought event per site. Using multivariate benchmarking of provenance archetypes, we established a ranking of the individual provenances in terms of general performance. In addition to considerable differences in overall growth between provenances, growth metrics differed between sites which were mostly attributable to climate. Basal area increment depended mainly on water availability from May to July, whereas annual height growth was influenced by moisture deficit during May of the current year.
   The reaction to drought events was shown to depend on the timing and duration of the drought event. Differences between provenances in resistance were modest, but more pronounced for recovery and especially for resilience and relative resilience. The results indicate a better adaptation to drought of the provenance from Bosnia Herzegovina and of local German provenances compared to other provenances. We summarized the findings by aligning the eleven provenances between two multivariately defined archetypes, one of which represented best general performance defined by good overall growth, low climate sensitivity and high resilience to drought. This approach confirmed the superior performance of the local German populations. Provenances from France and Poland were ranked above average whereas northern provenances and that from Bosnia Herzegovina were found to be least suitable at the sites under investigation. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of considering provenance in the discussion about future adaptedness and adaptability of tree species under climate change scenarios.

AB  - A novel method was tested for improving tree breeding strategies that integrate quantitative and population genetics based on range-wide reciprocal transplant experiments. Five reciprocal common garden tests of Populus tremuloides were investigated including 6450 trees across western Canada focusing on adaptation traits and growth. Both genetic parameters and home-site transplant models were evaluated. We found a genetic trade-off between growth and early spring leaf flush and late fall senescence. Coefficients of phenotypic variation (CVp) of cell lysis (CL), a measure of freezing injury, shrank from 0.28 to 0.10 during acclimation in the fall, and the CVp slope versus the freezing temperature was significantly different from zero (R-2 = 0.33, p = .02). There was more between-population genetic variation in fall phenology than in spring leaf phenology. We suggest that P. tremuloides demonstrated a discrepancy between the ecological optimum and the physiological optimum minimum winter temperature. The sub-optimal growing condition of P. tremuloides is potentially caused by the warmer ecological optimum than the physiological optimum. Assisted migration and breeding of fast growers to reforest cooler plantation sites can improve productivity. Transferring the study populations to less than 4 degrees C of extreme minimum temperature appears safe for reforestation aligning with the historical recolonization direction of the species. This is equivalent to a 5-10 degrees latitudinal northward movement. Fall frost hardiness is an effective criterion for family selection in the range tested in this study.

AB  - 1. To test the hypothesis that rapid embryogenesis is an adaptation to cold climate, embryonic development time was measured in three oviparous species of Sceloporus that occur at different altitudes: S. woodi (lowland), S. virgatus (intermediate) and S. scalaris (high altitude).
   2. Total embryonic development time (TEDT), defined as the time between ovulation to hatching, was measured at the same constant temperature (30-degrees-C) in the laboratory. Mean TEDT was 61.6 days in S. woodi, 55.3 days in S. virgatus, and 45.6 days in S. scalaris.
   3. Embryo stages at oviposition, which provide a qualitative assessment of egg retention time, were noted for females ovipositing in laboratory aquaria. S. woodi exhibited brief egg retention, S. virgatus, intermediate egg retention, and S. scalaris, prolonged egg retention.
   4. There was an apparent negative correlation between TEDT and elevation, as well as between TEDT and egg retention time.
   5. The TEDT of S. jarrovi (56.6 days), a viviparous montane congener, was less than that of S. woodi, indicating that the developmental rate of S. jarrovi embryos was greater than that in a lowland species.
   6. Despite differences in thermal characteristics of environments at different elevations, minimum estimates of TEDT in the field for S. woodi, S. virgatus, and S. scalaris were similar.
   7. Measures of TEDT in these species of Sceloporus were consistent with the hypothesis that more rapid embryogenesis, like egg retention, acts to reduce the time it takes embryos to develop in cold climates. It is also hypothesized that more rapid development evolves in response to cold climate and is capable of lowering the threshold temperature at which viviparity evolves.

AB  - Under ongoing climate warming, both the degree and number of high-temperature events in summer may increase, and behavioural adaptation is an important ecological strategy employed by insects to cope with such events. The rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee, is a serious insect pest of rice fields in summer. Population outbreaks have become more frequent in the last ten years. In addition to adult migration, rice leaf folders are thought to have other thermal adaptations. Therefore, the behaviours of larval and adult rice leaf folders, such as leaf folding (making shelter) and habitat selection for pupae and eggs, were observed on rice plants under heat stress. The results showed that larval shelter-making velocities significantly decreased during or after four hours of heat exposure, and shelter size decreased as the temperature increased. Larvae preferred to pupate on young rice leaves at 27 degrees C and middle-aged leaves at 30 degrees C, but they strongly preferred older leaves when reared at 34 degrees C. Female moths generally preferred to oviposit on the top of young leaves, but they preferred the middle and lower leaves for egg deposition when exposed to 36 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, more eggs were distributed on the lower surfaces of rice leaves with an increase in heat stress. These behavioural responses of rice leaf folders to heat stress indicate that this pest has great potential to adapt to high temperatures; therefore, the possibility of a population outbreak will remain high despite global warming.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that climate change will have significant negative effects on agricultural productivity across many highly concentrated production regions. Much empirical analysis has begun to focus on both short- and long-run adaptation within these regions. US sorghum production has received relatively less attention than other commonly grown grains, such as corn and wheat, despite that it is one of the top five grains grown in the US and ranks in the top ten of all crops grown globally. We match farm-level yield outcomes with fine-scale gridded weather data to generate a panel of Kansas sorghum producers totaling 45,971 observations spread across 7,298 farms and thirty-eight years. Fixed effects regressions leverage substantial cross-sectional and temporal variation in yields and weather to estimate the effect of warming temperatures on yields. Results suggest that sorghum is quite sensitive to warming temperatures-as moderate increases of 2 degrees C in growing season temperatures lead to an average 24% reduction in yields-thereby raising doubts about its potential for offsetting climate change impacts relative to other crops. We also consider whether warming impacts can be lessened through growing season adjustments and find very little support for this form of adaptation. A cross-sectional identification approach that encapsulates additional forms of adaptation also finds limited adaptation potential for sorghum producers. As a possible upside, we find evidence that sorghum's ability to withstand extreme heat has decreased by 70% over time, suggesting that there might exist currently outdated production practices and/or seed varieties that could help offset warming impacts.

AB  - Among the activities of the laboratory of Floriculture of the National Agriculture Research Foundation (NAGREF) are the collection, conservation and study of native Mediterranean and Balkan species. These are materialized through the newly established Balkan Botanic Garden of Kroussia (BBGK), situated in the area of central Macedonia, Greece. In the nursery of the BBGK situated in Thermi, Thessaloniki, the mother plant material is preserved in pots receiving various treatments under various conditions (shade, substrate, irrigation, fertilization), which dependent on the needs of every species. Greenhouses serve as the main area of preserving, during winter, susceptible to cold mother plants as well as for the sexual and asexual propagation of them. In addition, growth and development of the propagated material takes place, having the control of the climate, fertilization and irrigation conducted automatically. The plants are transferred to the BBGK for ex situ preservation and further studying in adverse climatic conditions. Experimentation and field studies concerning the suitability of certain species for landscape uses as roof-garden and xeriscaping plants, according to their characteristics and adaptability to extreme environmental conditions (water stress) are conducted. Other uses of native plant material as dried material are also studied.

AB  - Transformer fault diagnosis is an indispensable part of normal operation of power equipment. Aiming at the problem that traditional gas chromatography and other methods take a long time to detect fault types, this paper proposes a laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF) technology, combined with differential mutation brainstorm optimization algorithm (DBSO) to optimize the ELM model to identify transformer fault diagnosis types. Four different transformer oils were selected as experimental samples, including thermal fault oil, electrical fault oil, local damp oil and crude oil. LIF technology was used to obtain different spectral images of four oil samples. Firstly, the obtained fluorescence spectra were pretreated by MSC and Normalize, and the dimensionality was reduced by PLS. Then, the data after dimension reduction are input into the ELM model for training, and the BSO algorithm and DBSO algorithm are used to optimize the parameters of ELM. Finally, the experiments show that the DBSO-ELM model preprocessed by MSC has the highest recognition accuracy, the goodness of fit (R2) is 1, and the mean square error (MSE) reaches 3.205e-31, which is higher than that of ELM model and BSO-ELM model. In the case of the same pre-processing, the fitness values based on the mean square error rate of the training set are lower than those of the other types of recognition algorithm models. Therefore, the MSC-PL S-DBSO-ELM model has the best recognition effect, which can be extended to transformer fault diagnosis and improve the accuracy and safety of power equipment detection.

AB  - Are viruses more biologically successful than cellular life? Here we examine many ways of gauging biological success, including numerical abundance, environmental tolerance, type biodiversity, reproductive potential, and widespread impact on other organisms. We especially focus on successful ability to evolutionarily adapt in the face of environmental change. Viruses are often challenged by dynamic environments, such as host immune function and evolved resistance as well as abiotic fluctuations in temperature, moisture, and other stressors that reduce virion stability. Despite these challenges, our experimental evolution studies show that viruses can often readily adapt, and novel virus emergence in humans and other hosts is increasingly problematic. We additionally consider whether viruses are advantaged in evolvability-the capacity to evolve-and in avoidance of extinction. On the basis of these different ways of gauging biological success, we conclude that viruses are the most successful inhabitants of the biosphere.

AB  - Since Darwin, evolutionary biologists have sought to understand the drivers and mechanisms of natural trait diversity. The field advances toward this goal with the discovery of phenotypes that vary in the wild, their relationship to ecology, and their underlying genes. Here, we established resistance to extreme low temperature in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae as an ecological and evolutionary model system. We found that C. briggsae strains of temperate origin were strikingly more cold-resistant than those isolated from tropical localities. Transcriptional profiling revealed expression patterns unique to the resistant temperate ecotype, including dozens of genes expressed at high levels even after multiple days of cold-induced physiological slowdown. Mutational analysis validated a role in cold resistance for seven such genes. These findings highlight a candidate case of robust, genetically complex adaptation in an emerging model nematode, and shed light on the mechanisms at play.

AB  - The sawfly, Cephalcia arvensis Panzer, is a pest of the Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) and has caused large outbreaks in Europe. The variability in the diapause length and the adaptability of the immature stages to a wide range of temperatures makes it difficult to predict the attacks and the phenology. In this paper, the effects of variable temperature regimes on both embryonic and larval development are studied in a natural environment. The experimental conditions covered the whole temperature range of the areas colonized by the pest. Several models were considered and their estimation were performed using the DEVAR software program applied to natural fluctuating temperatures. Before the application of DEVAR, its predictive power was tested using hypothetical data sets. The program was able to find parameter values leading to an excellent model fit. Four models were validated using data from three generations of natural populations of the pest. All models gave a good prediction for both embryos and larvae in all the years considered. The model can be usefully applied in population dynamics and in timing the application of both insecticides and entomopathogenic nematodes against the pest.

AB  - Climate change constitutes a major threat to agricultural production, food security, and natural resource management. Saudi Arabia is particularly susceptible to increasing temperatures and extreme climatic events, such as arid weather and drought. The purpose of this study is to assess farmers' beliefs and concerns as regards climate change. Extensive interviews were conducted with 164 farmers in the Jazan region. Results revealed that 89.6% of the farmers believed that climate change is due to human activities and 93.3% believed that it is because of natural change. Seventy-five percent of the farmers were concerned about insects and 73% about the prevalence of weeds on their farms. Findings of cluster analysis revealed that farmers who are more likely to believe in climate change are more in agreement with the role of extension services in capacity building. Farmers' beliefs about climate change were significantly influenced by membership of agricultural cooperatives, access to loans, use of extension services, age, farm size, and level of soil fertility. Access to loans was the only significant factor to explain the differences in farmers' concerns. These results suggest the need for capacity-building activities targeted at improving farmers' adaptability to manage climate variability.

AB  - Shirnkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) are viable alternatives for reducing plastic shrinkage cracking in concrete. The objective of the present paper is to study early age plastic shrinkage in restrained concrete elements, where three different SRAs have been used. The influence of the admixture is analyzed through the following measurements: capillary pressure, evaporation, temperature evolution, crack evolution and settlement. The tests for studying the cracking and deformation were made on two different configurations (i.e., restrained prisms with reduced cross-section and restrained panel), in a wind tunnel, with controlled wind temperature and velocity. The conclusions obtained indicate the viability of the use of this type of admixture and the usefulness of the test methods.

AB  - The duration of development of Catolaccus grandis (Burks) (parasitoid of the cotton boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman) was determined at seven constant temperatures. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to test the fit of temperature-dependent developmental rates to the poikilotherm and Logan models. The mean total developmental time of C. grandis was significantly shorter in males than in females. The females completed development in 38.2, 22.5, 18.7, 15.0, 13.3, and 11.8 d from egg to emergence at 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, and 33-degrees-C. Development in males required 32.2, 18.0, 15.3, 13.0, 11.8, and 11.1 d from egg to adult at the same respective temperatures. All individuals were unable to complete development at 36-degrees-C, but they developed successfully to the fifth instar at this temperature. No evidence of development was observed at 39-degrees-C. The three models tested fitted the data similarly well; however, the Logan 1 model is recommended over Logan 2 because of its simplicity. Developmental rates of the boll weevil and the native parasitoid Bracon mellitor Say are compared with those observed on C. grandis. Implications on the adaptability of C. grandis to the South Texas environment are discussed.

AB  - Atmospheric and room temperature plasma and adaptive evolution were combined to generate Escherichia coli mutants, which can simultaneously and efficiently utilize glucose and xylose to produce succinic acid in chemically defined medium under exclusively anaerobic condition. Compared to the parent strain BA305, a pflB, ldhA, ppc, and ptsG deletion strain overexpressing ATP-forming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (PEPCK), the sugar consumption rate and succinic acid productivity of mutant BA408 were significantly improved with a marked increase in the key enzyme activities. Subsequent anaerobic fermentation of BA408 with corn stalk hydrolysate produced a final succinic acid concentration of 23.1 g L-1 with a yield of 0.85 g g(-1) sugar mixture. The observed synthesis of succinic acid from the corn stalk hydrolysate showed a great potential usage of renewable biomass as a feedstock for an economical succinic acid production using E. coli.

AB  - The Holocene shows rapid climatic changes associated with alternating intervals of glacier advances and retreats. The coastal regions, where beach ridges constitute common preserved landforms, are highly sensitive to register such changes and bring light into past littoral environments. Excellent marine Argentinean Holocene deposits associated with the last climate optimum are preserved at the Rio de la Plata estuary (Argentina). In this beach ridge, fourteen detailed sedimentary logs were studied in order to generate an palaeoenvironmental model. The analysis of major hierarchy surfaces of the ridge was performed combined field work and Virtual-Outcrop analysis. The ridge presents internal clinoforms that subdivide it into eleven clinothems. The first two clino-thems correspond to the development of a sand ridge as a response to the erosion and reworking of previous aeolian Late Pleistocene sediments. Subsequently, a bioclastic ridge was amalgamated with the sand ridge (clinothems III to XI). Simultaneously, in a landward position, a lagoon and washover deposits were developed. Finally, after the stabilization of the beach ridge the continuous sea level fall generated the actual coastal plain deposits. Six 14C ages were obtained at the base of selected clinothems, dated between 5,240 +/- 110 cal BP and 3,900 +/- 90 cal BP; meaning that in 1,340 years the beach prograded 290 m. Stable isotope analyses (813C and 818O) allowed to infer that the temperature during the evolution of the ridge has two maximum values of 22.5 degrees C and a minimum of 18.5 degrees C. The salinity range between 32.53%o and 33.16%o, showing short variability. The sudden change in the composition of the ridge, from sandy to carbonate sediments, may be interpreted as a combined result of an increase of carbonate productivity along with a decrease of siliciclastic supply at the coast. This stage would have been developed approximately around 5ka B.P., in coincidence with the Holocene Cli-matic Optimum (as recorded in Argentina) when propitious climatic conditions may have led to the proliferation of large communities of warm and warm temperate benthic organisms. We stress that, the strong activity of the Brazilian current during the Mid-Holocene thermal maximum enabled excellent conditions for the development of a carbonate warm beach similar to that occurring at tropical and subtropical areas nowadays. This study provides an example of the strong changes occurred in coastal environments as a result of climate change, particularly in the context of global warming episodes which characterized interglacial periods of the Late Quaternary in eastern South America.

AB  - During the life cycle of fish the larval stages are the most interesting and variable. Teleost larvae undergo a daily increase in adaptability and many organs differentiate and become active. These processes are concerted and require an early neuro-immune-endocrine integration. In larvae communication among the nervous, endocrine and immune systems utilizes several known signal molecule families which could be different from those of the adult fish.
   The immune-neuroendocrine system was studied in several fish species, among which in particular the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), that is a species of great commercial interest, very important in aquaculture and thus highly studied. Indeed the immune system of this species is the best known among marine teleosts.
   In this review the data on main signal molecules of stress carried out on larvae of fish are considered and discussed.
   For sea bass active roles in the early immunological responses of some well-known molecules involved in the stress, such as ACTH, nitric oxide, CRF, HSP-70 and cortisol have been proposed. These molecules and/or their receptors are biologically active mainly in the gut before complete differentiation of gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), probably acting in an autocrine/paracrine way. An intriguing idea emerges from all results of these researches; the molecules involved in stress responses, expressed in the adult cells of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, during the larval life of fish are present in several other localizations, where they perform probably the same role. It may be hypothesized that the functions performed by hypothalamic-pituitary system are particularly important for the survival of the larva and therefore they comprises several other localizations of body. Indeed the larval stages of fish are very crucial phases that include many physiological changes and several possible stress both internal and environmental. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Gas hydrates are likely to become an important strategic resource with commercial development prospects. It is therefore of great significance to realize the long-term and efficient production of methane hydrate reservoirs. Previous studies have shown that the lithological characteristics of hydrate reservoirs have a significant impact on reservoir productivity by influencing the evolution of seepage parameters in the process of hydrate production. The porosity (Phi) and initial hydrate saturation (SH) affect the amount of hydrate decomposition and pressure transfer, and also indirectly affect the reservoir temperature field. The permeability (k) directly affects the rate of pressure-drop transmission and methane gas discharge. Due to the differences in seepage parameters caused by different reservoir lithology, a sandy hydrate reservoir (SHR) in Japan and a clayey silt hydrate reservoir (CHR) in China were found to have different gas production rates and the spatial evolution characteristics of the temperature and pressure fields varied in gas hydrate production tests. Therefore, to ensure the long-term and efficient production of the CHR in China, two models were established for a comparative analysis based on a numerical simulation. The two models were depressurizing models of the CHR of the W11 drilling site in the Shenhu Sea area of the South China Sea and the SHR of the AT1 drilling site in the Eastern Nankai Trough of Japan. Both models considered the heterogeneity of seepage parameters, and the TOUGH+HYDARATE (T+H) code was used in subsequent calculations. Four key results were obtained: (a) The order of the significance levels of the lithological parameters on productivity was k > SH > Phi in the CHR and SH > k > Phi in the SHR. (b) The heat conduction and heat convection in the CHR were weaker than in the SHR, which made it difficult to recover the low-temperature area caused by hydrate decomposition. (c) The exploitation of a high k hydrate reservoir should be given priority when the other initial conditions were the same in both the CHR and SHR. (d) The exploitation of both the CHR and SHR should not only rely on the hydrate content or seepage capacity to determine the reservoir exploitation potential, but the combined effect of the two parameters should be fully considered.

AB  - Studies on genetic diversity, adaptive potential and fitness of species have become a major tool in conservation biology. These studies require biological material containing a reliable source of DNA which can be extracted and analysed. Recently, non-invasive sampling has become the preferred sampling method of such biological material; particularly when studying endangered species. Elasmoid scales from teleost fish are an example of non-invasive samples from which DNA can successfully be extracted. This study compared different extraction protocols to find an optimal method for extracting DNA from teleost fish scales. This was done with the intent to use the protocol that yielded the highest quantity of DNA on dried, archived scales. The protocols tested in this study included (1) phenol/chloroform with a TNES-urea digestion buffer, (2) phenol/chloroform with an amniocyte digestion buffer and (3) Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit with variations in incubation times and temperatures of each protocol. While the phenol/chloroform with TNES-urea digestion buffer yielded significantly higher concentrations of DNA compared to the other protocols, all protocols followed in this study yielded sufficient quantities of DNA for further downstream applications. Therefore, while there are multiple viable options when selecting a DNA extraction protocol, each research project's individual needs, requirements and resources need to be carefully considered in order to choose the most effective protocol.

AB  - Coppertail skinks (Ctenotus taeniolatus) are medium-sized diurnal lizards that are widespread in eastern Australia. Field surveys on sandstone outcrops in the Sydney region showed that these animals use available rocks non-randomly: coppertails were found under large, sun-exposed rocks on deep soil. Choice trials in the laboratory documented selection of retreat sites that were warm, with substrate preferences shifting in a diel cycle. Lizards selected retreats with rock substrates during the day but with sandy substrates at night. Rocky retreats attain higher temperatures during daylight hours, but burrows in sand beneath rocks may provide greater protection against ingress by nocturnal predators. During fieldwork we rarely found lizards under rocks with either ants or centipedes, suggesting that coppertails may avoid these predatory invertebrates. Tongue-flick trials showed that the lizards could discriminate among common ant species based on chemosensory cues, but apparently could not detect centipede chemical cues. In experimental trials, the lizards did not avoid retreat sites scented by either ants or centipedes. Our data thus suggest that retreat-site selection in coppertails is driven by abiotic cues (rock size, sun exposure and substrate type) that may confer fitness benefits in terms of thermoregulation and predator avoidance, with biotic cues playing a less important role.

AB  - Cellular innovation is central to biological diversification, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood [1]. One potential source of new cellular traits is environmentally induced phenotypic variation, or phenotypic plasticity. The plasticity-first hypothesis [2-4] proposes that natural selection can improve upon an ancestrally plastic phenotype to produce a locally adaptive trait, but the role of plasticity for adaptive evolution is still unclear [5-10]. Here, we show that a structurally novel form of the heterocyst, the specialized nitrogen-fixing cell of the multicellular cyanobacterium Fischerella thermalis, has evolved multiple times from ancestrally plastic developmental variation during adaptation to high temperature. Heterocyst glycolipids (HGs) provide an extracellular gas diffusion barrier that protects oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase [11, 12], and cyanobacteria typically exhibit temperature-induced plasticity in HG composition that modulates heterocyst permeability [13, 14]. By contrast, high-temperature specialists of F. thermalis constitutively overproduce glycolipid isomers associated with high temperature to levels unattained by plastic strains. This results in a less-permeable heterocyst, which is advantageous at high temperature but deleterious at low temperature for both nitrogen fixation activity and fitness. Our study illustrates how the origin of a novel cellular phenotype by the genetic assimilation and adaptive refinement of a plastic trait can be a source of biological diversity and contribute to ecological specialization.

AB  - The post spawning behaviour of sea trout Salmo irutia was studied over a 2 year period in the river and estuary of the River Fowey, south-west England. Forty-five sea trout kelts were trapped immediately after spawning in December and intraperitoneally tagged with miniature acoustic transmitters. The subsequent emigration into coastal waters was monitored using acoustic receivers deployed throughout the river catchment. The levels of gill Na(+)K(+)ATPase activity in sea trout kelts sampled at the same time as the tagged fish were within the range of 2.5 to 4.5 mu mol Pi per mg protein per h indicating that the post-spawning fish were not physiologically adapted to salt water. The tagged kelts were resident in fresh water between 4 and 70 days before entering the estuary. Sixty two per cent of the tagged kelts subsequently migrated successfully into coastal waters, with a higher success rate for male fish (75%) than females (58%). There was a significant size related difference in the run-timing of the kelts with the larger fish moving more quickly into coastal waters after spawning than smaller fish. Seaward migration within fresh water was predominantly nocturnal and generally occurred in conjunction with increasing river discharge and rising water temperature. Migration through the estuary continued to be predominantly nocturnal and occurred during an ebbing tide. Residency within the estuary varied amongst individuals although it was invariably short, with most fish moving out into coastal waters within one to two tidal cycles. Five tagged kelts returned from the coastal zone and re-entered fresh water during April and June. Marine residence time varied between 89 and 145 days (mean 118 days) and the minimum estimated marine survival was c. 18%. One of these sea trout was subsequently recaptured after successfully spawning in the vicinity where it had been previously tagged demonstrating a degree of spawning site fidelity.

AB  - Aims Bacterial response to temperature changes can influence their pathogenicity to plants and humans. Changes in temperature can affect cellular and physiological responses in bacteria that can in turn affect the evolution and prevalence of antibiotic-resistance genes. Yet, how antibiotic-resistance genes influence microbial temperature response is poorly understood. Methods and Results We examined growth rates and physiological responses to temperature in two species-E. coli and Staph. epidermidis-after evolved resistance to 13 antibiotics. We found that evolved resistance results in species-, strain- and antibiotic-specific shifts in optimal temperature. When E. coli evolves resistance to nucleic acid and cell wall inhibitors, their optimal growth temperature decreases, and when Staph. epidermidis and E. coli evolve resistance to protein synthesis and their optimal temperature increases. Intriguingly, when Staph. epidermidis evolves resistance to Teicoplanin, fitness also increases in drug-free environments, independent of temperature response. Conclusion Our results highlight how the complexity of antibiotic resistance is amplified when considering physiological responses to temperature. Significance Bacteria continuously respond to changing temperatures-whether through increased body temperature during fever, climate change or other factors. It is crucial to understand the interactions between antibiotic resistance and temperature.

AB  - Classification methodology is widely used by plant breeders to group environments on the results of regional evaluation trials to assist selection among genotypes. To be effective, Multi-environment trial (MET) is a key point for breeders to test productivity and adaptability of crop varieties. With the development of science and technology in breeding, for METs at any stage of a breeding program, the breeder is dealing with a finite sample of environments that sample a relatively small subset of potential geographical and crop management conditions in a limited number of years. The general term 'envirotyping', used as a complement to the more familiar terms genotyping and phenotyping, is classifying the environments (location-year management combinations) within a MET to assess how they represent target population of environments. However, the planting environment is complex and varied. Therefore, on one hand, the challenges associated with conducting METs in a finite number of years to predict genotype-trait performance in the target population-environment are crucial. On the other hand, it is also very important to ensure the accuracy of MET and decrease the loss of seed promotion to have a good understanding of the type of the planting environment and make reasonable decision to set the station of METs.
   In the paper, we mainly study on a new spatial sampling method of multi-environment triallayout and take maize in Jilin province in China for example. According to characteristics of METs, the algorithm combined with spatially stratified sampling and spatial balanced random sampling, which set a reasonable scheme of spatial distribution of MET station for maize. The main steps are as follows: Firstly, we build an index system for the classification of maize environment with sufficiently detailed data such as weather, soil, DEM, road network, cultivated area, actively accumulated temperature, precipitation, the sunshine duration during the whole growing period and gradient. Secondly, we develop methods for identifying the optimal numbers of classes for the planting environment and use spatially stratified sampling model to calculate the minimum number of stations to meet the requirements. Finally, the method was applied to the spatial distribution of MET station for maize in Jilin province, and compute the optimal number of clusters for planting environment and METs stations number, which are 5 and 25, respectively. The result is roughly consistent with the existing MET station for maize with the sample precision of 94.5%, and have a certain reference significance for the layout of MET stations for maize in Jilin province.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The intestinal microbiota plays a vital role in the health of animals, and food is an important factor that influences the intestinal microbial community. During the winter months, waterbirds require certain foods to supply them with energy through the cold winter. Due to changes in the plant resources available to waterbirds, their intestinal bacteria will vary accordingly. In this study, we analysed the relationship between food composition and intestinal bacteria in hooded cranes (Grus monacha). We found that food resources from similar habitats were more similar, and the corresponding hooded crane intestinal bacteria were also more similar. The results show that the intestinal bacteria of hooded cranes had a certain adaptability to the type of food being consumed. This study contributes novel insights into the diet of hooded cranes in the winter months, allowing for improved protection and management strategies.
   As food is recognised as an important factor affecting the intestinal microbiota, seasonal changes in diet can influence the community composition. The hooded crane (Grus monacha) is an endangered migratory waterbird species, with some of the population wintering in the sallow lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain. Their food resources have changed seasonally, with a reduction resulting from wetland degradation. To cope with seasonal changes in food availability, hooded cranes must constantly adjust their foraging strategies to survive. We studied the effect of changes in diet on the intestinal bacterial diversity of hooded cranes at Shengjin Lake, using faecal microanalysis and high-throughput sequencing. The results show that the main foods of hooded cranes were Polygonum criopolitanum, Oryza sativa, and Carex spp., which were significantly related to the composition of the intestinal bacterial community. In addition, foods available from the similar habitats were more similar, and the corresponding hooded crane intestinal bacteria were also more similar. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus acidipiscis in January and March was significantly higher than in November. Our research shows that the intestinal bacteria of hooded cranes actively adapt to diet changes to overcome the negative impact of the reduction in food resources, which is vital to the survival of hooded cranes.

AB  - The impact of climate change on farms can be determined by factors such as local climatic changes, farm physical environment, the type of crops grown, and household socio-economic characteristics that limit or increase adaptability to climate change. The current study assesses the impacts of climate and socio-economic changes on smallholder farms in two districts of Ethiopia representing different agro-ecology in a major agricultural region. For this purpose, observed farm production data, simulated yield under climate change and socio-economic scenarios were used. The aim was to produce information that facilitates an understanding of the unequal economic implications of climate change on farms. To this end, the study applied the Tradeoff Analysis for Multi-Dimensional impact assessment (TOA-MD) economic simulation model in combination with the AquaCrop yield simulation model. The findings on climate change impact towards 2030 highlight the uneven implications of climate change on farms and the role that agro-ecology and future solo-economic development scenarios play in determining climate change impact. It is found that, under the climate projections we considered crops such as tef, barley and wheat are found to benefit from the projected climate change in cool regions. In warm regions, tef and wheat are projected to be negatively affected whereas maize would benefit. The proportion of farms that are negatively affected by climate change ranged between 51% and 78% in warm regions under different scenarios; in cool regions, the proportion of negatively affected farms ranged between 10% and 22%. The implications of climate change are found to vary under various socio-economic scenarios, in which positive socio-economic scenarios considerably reduced the proportion of negatively affected farms. The economic implications of climate change also found to differ among farms within agro-ecology because of differences in land allocation to various crops that have different sensitivity to climate change, and due to other farm differences. Thus, the study shows the importance of using farm and site-specific production and climate data to reveal variabilities in climate change impact. It also provides evidence on the relevance of accounting for agro-ecology and crop differences as well as consideration of potential socio-economic changes. Overall, the results suggest that appropriate agricultural interventions that recognize location and crop differences are essential to minimize climate change impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Spruce bark beetle outbreaks are common in Norway spruce forests following windstorm damage, due to ample availability of brood material. The realization of an outbreak depends on factors regulating the Ips typographus population dynamics, such as weather conditions and salvage cutting. In this study, we take an ecosystem modelling approach to analyse the influence of multiple environmental factors on the risk for I. typographus outbreaks. Model calculations of I. typographus phenology and population dynamics as a function of weather and brood tree availability were developed and implemented in the LPJ-GUESS ecosystem modelling framework. The model simulations were driven by gridded climate data covering Sweden with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees and a daily temporal resolution. Records on storm damage and I. typographus outbreak periods in Sweden for the period of 1960-2009 were used for model evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the model behaviour. The model simulations replicated the observed pattern in outbreak frequency, being more common in southern and central Sweden than in northern Sweden. A warmer climate allowing for more than one generation per year can increase the risk for attacks on living trees. The effect of countermeasures, aiming at either reduce the availability of brood material or the I. typographus population size, is dependent on a non-linear relation between I. typographus attack density and reproductive success. The sensitivity analysis indicated a major reduction in the risk of attacks on living trees by timely salvage cutting and cutting of infested trees. Knowledge uncertainties associated with attacks on standing trees, i.e. factors influencing tree defence capacity and I. typographus reproductive success, should be further addressed.

AB  - As one of the Holy Grail reactions in C1 chemistry, direct selective oxidation of methane to methanol under mild and non-harsh conditions remains a big challenge. Hydroperoxide (H2O2), as a primary oxidant, applied widely in the low-temperature direct selective conversion of methane to methanol. Moreover, the hydrogen and oxygen mixture gas achieves better reaction activity and higher methanol selectivity than H2O2 when using palladium-gold (Pd-Au) bimetallic nanoparticles as the catalyst. In this paper, we studied the key roles of the physical and chemical characteristics of Pd-Au nanoparticles in this direct selective oxidation reaction with hydrogen and oxygen as the oxidant at 50 degrees C. Au metal shows an indispensable role in direct methane to methanol process in this study. High methanol productivity and selectivity are achieved when Au of 0.5-2.5% is added into the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported Pd catalyst. Moreover, the loading amount of Pd-Au nanoparticles also affect the methane activation ability and the methanol selectivity obviously. Much more active and stable Pd-Au nanoparticles are generated in CNTs supported 2.5% Pd-2.5% Au nanoparticles catalyst than those in lower metal content catalysts. In addition, the Pd bivalent state is proved to be the most active content in the Pd-Au nanoparticles catalyst, achieving much higher methanol selectivity and productivity when compared to Pd metallic state. For further clarifying the physical and chemical characteristics of catalysts, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Hydrogen-Temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), and CO pulse adsorption measurement (CO-PULSE) analysis methods are also measured.

AB  - The direct conversion of methane to methanol in a stepwise process over copper-exchanged zeolites is currently one of the most-studied reactions. Despite these studies and the partial identification of the active species and reaction mechanism, it has not been possible to design the best material and determine the ideal process conditions for industrial implementation. This study shows how to design a significantly better performing material and the reaction parameters to enhance the methanol yield. This led to the highest methanol productivity to date, using a material that until recently was considered to be inactive, opening an original direction for the design of active materials. It is shown that the zeolite framework affects the structure and redox properties of copper species, formed during ion exchange and treatment procedures. In turn, these Cull-oxo species demonstrate different redox properties, which correlate with the methanol productivity and selectivity: high temperature of copper reduction leads to low activity in the reaction with methane, while low reduction temperature results in overoxidation of methanol to carbon monoxide and formate species. This relationship enables the prediction of the optimal operation temperature of copper exchanged zeolite, as illustrated for CuFAU, which had been considered to be inactive in methane conversion to methanol. Its multicyclic operation in the isothermal regime at 633 K and ambient pressure gave a stable methanol yield of 90 mu mol/g and 92% selectivity, while an increase in the copper loading and methane pressure resulted in the unprecedented yield of 360 mu mol/g.

AB  - Successful adaptation of agriculture to ongoing climate changes would help to maintain productivity growth and thereby reduce pressure to bring new lands into agriculture. In this paper we investigate the potential co-benefits of adaptation in terms of the avoided emissions from land use change. A model of global agricultural trade and land use, called SIMPLE, is utilized to link adaptation investments, yield growth rates, land conversion rates, and land use emissions. A scenario of global adaptation to offset negative yield impacts of temperature and precipitation changes to 2050, which requires a cumulative 225 billion USD of additional investment, results in 61 Mha less conversion of cropland and 15 Gt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) fewer emissions by 2050. Thus our estimates imply an annual mitigation co-benefit of 0 : 35 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) while spending $15 per tonne CO(2)e of avoided emissions. Uncertainty analysis is used to estimate a 5-95% confidence interval around these numbers of 0.25-0.43 Gt and $11-$22 per tonne CO(2)e. A scenario of adaptation focused only on Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, while less costly in aggregate, results in much smaller mitigation potentials and higher per tonne costs. These results indicate that although investing in the least developed areas may be most desirable for the main objectives of adaptation, it has little net effect on mitigation because production gains are offset by greater rates of land clearing in the benefited regions, which are relatively low yielding and land abundant. Adaptation investments in high yielding, land scarce regions such as Asia and North America are more effective for mitigation.
   To identify data needs, we conduct a sensitivity analysis using the Morris method (Morris 1991 Technometrics 33 161-74). The three most critical parameters for improving estimates of mitigation potential are (in descending order) the emissions factors for converting land to agriculture, the price elasticity of land supply with respect to land rents, and the elasticity of substitution between land and non-land inputs. For assessing the mitigation costs, the elasticity of productivity with respect to investments in research and development is also very important. Overall, this study finds that broad-based efforts to adapt agriculture to climate change have mitigation co-benefits that, even when forced to shoulder the entire expense of adaptation, are inexpensive relative to many activities whose main purpose is mitigation. These results therefore challenge the current approach of most climate financing portfolios, which support adaptation from funds completely separate from-and often much smaller than-mitigation ones.

AB  - Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis of a general relationship between sea temperature and recruitment of cod stocks across the North Atlantic, as well as between recruitment and the size of the spawning population. In the North Sea, cod year-class strength is inversely related to sea surface temperature during the first half of the year. This stock is currently at a low level, and the future trajectory of the stock biomass will be strongly influenced by recruitment levels. In the present study we investigate the possible use of observed and modelled sea surface temperature (SST) to increase the accuracy and/or time horizon of recruitment forecasts for this stock. We show that the statistical model developed for forecasting spring temperature has good skill (35% skill, with a standard error of 0.36degreesC) when predictions are made in late January. Within the frame of the current fish stock assessment working group we incorporate SST observations and January forecasts and simulate short-term recruitment projections. The resulting model accounts for a greater fraction of the variance in recruitment (42%) than that obtained without temperature (17%). In operational mode, the model allows forecasting 1.5 years in advance but the accuracy of predicted recruitment remains low. This example indicates that we have not yet reached a point where environmental information can be used with great benefit for the management of North Sea cod. However, a similar strategy may yield greater benefits if developed for other stocks for which environmental effects are better understood and/or account for a larger fraction of the variability in recruitment, for species with a shorter generation time and species for which recruitment forecast is critical to management (e.g. anchovy), and in areas where environmental prediction capabilities may be greater either in accuracy or in lead time.

AB  - The pine wood nematode (PWN; Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) is the causal agent of pine wilt disease, which results in severe ecological and economic losses in coniferous forests. During overwintering, PWNs undergo morphological and physiological changes to adapt to low temperature environments. Here, the physiological changes of the PWN populations sampled in the summer and winter were compared to analyze the role of low temperatures in their response. The PWN overwinters as third-stage dispersal juveniles, which showed significantly greater survival rates than summer populations (propagative forms) at sub-zero temperatures. The major biochemical compounds in the populations were analyzed by gas chromatography. Eight dominant fatty acids, with stearic acid being the most important, were identified from PWN propagative stage and third-stage dispersal stage. Compared with the propagative stage, the dispersal stage showed significant increases in the fatty acid content and the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Three carbohydrates, trehalose, glycerol and glucose, were detected in the PWN. Compared with the summer population, the levels of trehalose and glycerol increased significantly, while glucose decreased, in the winter population. The modifications in fatty acid composition and cryoprotectant levels, as elements of its changing physiology, play important roles in the overwintering success of the PWN.

AB  - Rolling bearings play an important role in the design of gear transmissions. For a successful process, the best type and size of the rolling bearings has to be defined in an early stage of development. However, high operational reliability and economic viability depends on durability, as well as on the frictional and temperature behavior of the rolling bearings. Practical methods to calculate the loss torque of rolling bearings according to the state of the art partly show significant differences among each other. In addition, the calculated loss torques frequently show high deviations compared to measured values in practice. Thus, comprehensive experimental investigations at the FZG bearing power loss test rig have been carried out in a collective FVA research project investigating the losses and temperatures of rolling bearings. In this paper, the principle of the FZG bearing power loss test rig is shown and selected results of the experimental investigations are compared to the calculation methods according to state of the art. Finally, measures for an improved estimation of the loss torque of rolling bearings are given.

AB  - Global warming could threaten over 400 species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) worldwide, including all species of sea turtle. During embryonic development, rising temperatures might lead to the overproduction of one sex and, in turn, could bias populations' sex ratios to an extent that threatens their persistence. If climate change predictions are correct, and biased sex ratios reduce population viability, species with TSD may go rapidly extinct unless adaptive mechanisms, whether behavioural, physiological or molecular, exist to buffer these temperature-driven effects. Here, we summarize the discovery of the TSD phenomenon and its still elusive evolutionary significance. We then review the molecular pathways underpinning TSD in model species, along with the hormonal mechanisms that interact with temperatures to determine an individual's sex. To illustrate evolutionary mechanisms that can affect sex determination, we focus on sea turtle biology, discussing both the adaptive potential of this threatened TSD taxon, and the risks associated with conservation mismanagement.

AB  - Different process parameters can alter the temperature during machining. Consequently, selecting process parameters that lead to a desirable cutting temperature would help to increase the tool life, decrease the tensile residual stress, and controls the microstructure evolution of the workpiece. An inverse computational methodology is proposed to design the process parameters for a specific cutting temperature. A physics-based analytical model is used to predict the temperature induced by cutting forces. The shear deformation and chip formation model is implemented to calculate machining forces as functions of process parameters, material properties, and etc. To calculate the temperature induced by the deformation in the shear zone, a moving point heat source approach is used. The proposed model uses an iterative non-linear regression to predict the cutting process parameters based on the desirable temperature which is assigned by the user. In order to achieve the cutting process parameters, an iterative gradient search is used to adaptively approach the specific temperature by the optimization of process parameters such that an inverse reasoning can be achieved. Experimental data are used to illustrate the implementation and validate the viability of the computational methodology.

AB  - We induced homozygous clones of amago salmon by gynogenetic chromosome manipulation. Mitotic gynogenesis diploid (mitotic-G2N) as first generation was produced by suppression of the first cleavage of the eggs inseminated with UV-irradiated sperm of rainbow trout by hydrostatic pressure shock. The yield of apparently normal gynogenetic embryos was 2.26% when the eggs were shocked at 650 kg/cm2 of hydrostatic pressure for 6 min at 5 h 30 min (approximately 68 h . degrees-C in cumulative temperature) after insemination. Homozygous evidence of gynogenetic juveniles was demonstrated by the segregation of Idh-3 and Pgm-1 loci. Five homozygous inbred strains were produced from the eggs of homozygous gynogenetic females by retaining the second polarbody, while outbred controls were produced for each strain by crossing with males of other strains. The clonal proof of these strains was demonstrated by the immunological acceptance of operculum allografts from inbred sisters. Similar survivals were shown among clones produced by mothers from identical strain. On the other hand, various survivals were seen between the clones using maternal parents from different strains. These results suggested that the line selection was a vital factor in clone production.

AB  - Many animals that live in northern climates enter a state of prolonged dormancy during winter. These animals possess a suite of physiological and behavioural adaptations that minimize threats to survival while overwintering. There are three major threats to overwintering survival: metabolic and respiratory acidosis, freezing, and predation. Selection of hibernation sites should minimize these threats. We monitored dissolved oxygen, water depth, and temperature at overwintering locations of Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii (Holbrook, 1838)) and at stations located haphazardly in six different habitat types over two winters in Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada. Water depth and dissolved oxygen in overwintering sites used by turtles were similar to those measured at haphazard stations. In contrast, estimated turtle body temperatures (similar to 0 degrees C) were significantly lower and less variable than water temperatures measured at haphazard stations. These data and those reported elsewhere suggest that there are two alternatives for selection of suitable hibernacula by anoxia tolerant turtles. In areas where there is periodic access to aerial oxygen, turtles select sites where ice cover may not be present for the entire winter, but in areas where ice cover restricts access to air, turtles select sites where water temperatures are close to 0 degrees C.

AB  - Background: Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the etiologic agent of bacterial coldwater disease in salmonids. Earlier research showed that a rifampicin-passaged strain of F. psychrophilum (CSF 259-93B. 17) caused no disease in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum) while inducing a protective immune response against challenge with the virulent CSF 259-93 strain. We hypothesized that rifampicin passage leads to an accumulation of genomic mutations that, by chance, reduce virulence. To assess the pattern of phenotypic and genotypic changes associated with passage, we examined proteomic, LPS and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences for two F. psychrophilum strains (CSF 259-93 and THC 02-90) that were passaged with and without rifampicin selection.
   Results: Rifampicin resistance was conveyed by expected mutations in rpoB, although affecting different DNA bases depending on the strain. One rifampicin-passaged CSF 259-93 strain (CR) was attenuated (4 % mortality) in challenged fish, but only accumulated eight nonsynonymous SNPs compared to the parent strain. A CSF 259-93 strain passaged without rifampicin (CN) accumulated five nonsynonymous SNPs and was partially attenuated (28 % mortality) compared to the parent strain (54.5 % mortality). In contrast, there were no significant change in fish mortalities among THC 02-90 wild-type and passaged strains, despite numerous SNPs accumulated during passage with (n = 174) and without rifampicin (n = 126). While only three missense SNPs were associated with attenuation, a Ser492Phe rpoB mutation in the CR strain may contribute to further attenuation. All strains except CR retained a gliding motility phenotype. Few proteomic differences were observed by 2D SDS-PAGE and there were no apparent changes in LPS between strains. Comparative methylome analysis of two strains (CR and TR) identified no shared methylation motifs for these two strains.
   Conclusion: Multiple genomic changes arose during passage experiments with rifampicin selection pressure. Consistent with our hypothesis, unique strain-specific mutations were detected for the fully attenuated (CR), partially attenuated (CN) and another fully attenuated strain (B17).

AB  - Background: Biological systems are rife with examples of pre-adaptations or exaptations. They range from the molecular scale - lens crystallins, which originated from metabolic enzymes - to the macroscopic scale, such as feathers used in flying, which originally served thermal insulation or waterproofing. An important class of exaptations are novel and useful traits with non-adaptive origins. Whether such origins could be frequent cannot be answered with individual examples, because it is a question about a biological system's potential for exaptation.
   We here take a step towards answering this question by analyzing central carbon metabolism, and novel traits that allow an organism to survive on novel sources of carbon and energy. We have previously applied flux balance analysis to this system and predicted the viability of 10(15) metabolic genotypes on each of ten different carbon sources.
   Results: We here use this exhaustive genotype-phenotype map to ask whether a central carbon metabolism that is viable on a given, focal carbon source C the equivalent of an adaptation in our framework - is usually or rarely viable on one or more other carbon sources C-new - a potential exaptation. We show that most metabolic genotypes harbor potential exaptations, that is, they are viable on one or more carbon sources C-new. The nature and number of these carbon sources depends on the focal carbon source C itself, and on the biochemical similarity between C and C-new. Moreover, metabolisms that show a higher biomass yield on C, and that are more complex, i.e., they harbor more metabolic reactions, are viable on a greater number of carbon sources C-new.
   Conclusions: A high potential for exaptation results from correlations between the phenotypes of different genotypes, and such correlations are frequent in central carbon metabolism. If they are similarly abundant in other metabolic or biological systems, innovations may frequently have non-adaptive ("exaptive") origins.

AB  - The Mokrsko-West deposit is unique among European Variscan gold deposits from the points of view of both the structure (an approx. 200 m thick complex of sheeted, several mm-thick, densely spaced quartz veins) and the economic viability (gold reserves of about 100 t). The deposit is hosted mainly by tonalite of the calc-alkaline Sazava tonalite suite (ca. 354 Ma) of the Central Bohemian Plutonic Complex. Mineralization is characterized by quartz-dominated gangue, no visible hydrothermal alteration, low sulfide content, high fineness native gold accompanied by maldonite, aurostibite, native bismuth and numerous Bi-Te-(S) phases. Five mineralogical stages are described in great detail. Arsenopyrite and chlorite thermometers, mineral phase stabilities and published isotope and fluid inclusion data are used to reconstruct the temperature and compositional evolution of the system. The role of liquid bismuth in the sequestration of gold is also discussed.
   The deposit shares the features of both orogenic gold (ORG) and intrusion-related gold (IRG) deposits. The IRG model is advocated by close spatial association between the ore zone and the tonalite host-intrusion, by the absence/scarcity of hydrothermal alteration, by the Au-Bi-Te-As elemental association and by marked thermal gradients from the early to late mineralization stages. The ORG model is advocated by an approx. 15-10 Ma gap between the intrusion of the tonalite-host and the ore formation, by isotope and geochemical evidence for a key role of metamorphic fluids in the mobilization and transfer of many elements/species (inclusive S and Au). The apparently ambiguous classification of the deposit can most probably be attributed to deposit formation at a depth of >= 9 km and to setting of the deposit at/inside a large-scale plutonic complex with multiple and prolonged tectonic and intrusive activity.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the mental health effects of high ambient temperatures and heat waves, determine whether heat-related morbidity and mortality are increased among people with known mental disorders and identify knowledge gaps to inform targeting of future research.
   Study design: Systematic literature review and narrative synthesis.
   Methods: A systematic review of published literature using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO without geographical or temporal limits was conducted. We included studies that explicitly linked high ambient temperatures and/or heat waves to mental health outcomes. Evidence was graded using a National Institute of Health framework.
   Results: A total of 35 studies were included in the review, among which 34 were observational studies and one was a case-control study. Six broad mental health outcome categories were identified: suicide and heat; bipolar disorder, mania and depression and heat; schizophrenia and heat; organic mental health outcomes and heat including dementia; alcohol and substance misuse and heat; and multiple mental health outcomes/mental health service usage and heat. The studies included were heterogeneous in terms of study design, population, setting, exposure measures, outcomes and location making meta-analysis unfeasible. Fifteen studies showed an increased suicide risk with heat (relative risk [RR] 1.014-1.37 per 1 degrees C, P < 0.05; r = 0.10-0.64, P < 0.05). Increased risks of mental health-related admissions and emergency department visits at higher temperatures were also found. No evidence of change in community care use was found. Evidence for the impact of heat on other mental health outcomes was mixed.
   Conclusions: High ambient temperatures have a range of mental health effects. The strongest evidence was found for increased suicide risk. Limited evidence was found for an increase in heat-related morbidity and mortality among people with known mental health problems. Knowledge gaps exist on the impact of high temperatures on many common mental health disorders. Mental health impacts should be incorporated into plans for the public health response to high temperatures, and as evidence evolves, psychological morbidity and mortality temperature thresholds should be incorporated into hot weather -warning systems.

AB  - The objectives were to select for resistance to carbofuran in a susceptible field population of Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), assess the progression of resistance, and characterize the inheritance and possible mechanism of resistance. Initial selection in the field resulted in over 99.9 % mortality of treated larvae but high resistance in the survivors. Subsequent laboratory selection at c.80 % mortality increased resistance to > 100-fold by the fourth generation. Low level cross-resistance to azinphos-methyl was also present. Resistance appeared to be inherited via a single, autosomal, incompletely dominant gene, resulting in decreased acetylcholinesterase sensitivity. A second Michigan population also appeared to exhibit reduced cholinesterase sensitivity. Resistance to carbofuran in a Colorado potato beetle population from Long Island, NY appears to involve primarily mixed-function oxidase enzymes. The history of insecticide use probably affects which primary resistance mechanism appears in response to carbofuran treatment.

AB  - Caribbean hard coral cover has decreased by more than 80% in the last 40 years. In response, active coral restoration has grown in popularity as a management tool to sustain degraded reefs. To date, the majority of coral outplanting has employed asexually propagated ramets derived from wild donor colonies. Unfortunately, this strategy is incapable of increasing genetic diversity and limits the adaptive potential of restored coral populations. Methods for sexual propagation in land-based systems offer increasing potential to enhance genetic diversity of target species. However, questions regarding coral performance once placed back into the dynamic marine environment must be considered. Thus, focused experiments to optimize the integration of land reared corals and novel genetic diversity are of immense value. For this reason, we designed a study using two Acropora cervicornis year classes produced in a land-based system and concurrently relocated to an inshore patch reef, a back reef, and placed in an ocean-based nursery (n = 80 sexually propagated colonies per location). A deliberate monitoring strategy measured growth and survival five times over a 480-day period. Major findings were 1) high survival rates (~ 73%) across all 160 outplanted colonies 2) significant differences in survival between outplanting locations and coral recruit year class, and 3) very high survival of sexually propagated corals relocated to the ocean-based nursery (~ 93% overall), with 40-fold greater growth than direct-outplanted colonies. Our study suggests that ex situ sexual coral propagation offers a tractable tool to meet the need for increased A. cervicornis genetic diversity. Lastly, we offer insight and considerations for managing the high input of novel genotypes into restoration systems and suggest further research to maximize the adaptive potential of coral populations.

AB  - The survival of selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with in vitro probiotic potential was studied during storage of cv. Halkidiki green olives previously subjected to inoculated Spanish-style fermentation. After fermentation olives were packed in polyethylene pouches, covered with freshly prepared brine (9%, w/v, NaCl), acidified with 2 parts per thousand (w/v) citric acid and 1.5 parts per thousand (w/v) ascorbic acid, and stored at 4 and 20 degrees C for 357 days. Four packing treatments were studied, namely olives previously fermented by (i) the indigenous microbiota (control); (ii) Lactobacillus pentosus B281; (iii) Lactobacillus plantarum B282; and (iv) a co-culture of both LAB strains. Microbiological analyses were performed on the olives in parallel with physicochemical changes (pH, titratable acidity, salt content, a(w) and colour) at the early (day 1), middle (day 197) and final stage (day 357) of storage, as well as sensory evaluation at the end of the storage. The survival of probiotic strains was confirmed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). LAB decreased throughout storage reaching a final population of ca. 3.5-4.0 log CFU/g and 4.5-5.0 log CFU/g at 4 and 20 degrees C, respectively. The pH values ranged between 3.90 and 4.61 during storage depending on packaging condition. PFGE analysis revealed that L. pentosus B281 and L. plantarum B282 showed a high survival rate with a recovery of 100 and 96%, respectively, at 4 degrees C, and less than 20% for both strains at 20 degrees C. Finally, in the packing treatment with a co-culture of both strains, L. pentosus dominated over L. plantarum throughout storage at both temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several statistical downscaling models have been developed in the past couple of decades to assess the hydrologic impacts of climate change by projecting the station-scale hydrological variables from large-scale atmospheric variables simulated by general circulation models (GCMs). This paper presents and compares different statistical downscaling models that use multiple linear regression (MLR), positive coefficient regression (PCR), stepwise regression (SR), and support vector machine (SVM) techniques for estimating monthly rainfall amounts in the state of Florida. Mean sea level pressure, air temperature, geopotential height, specific humidity, U wind, and V wind are used as the explanatory variables/predictors in the downscaling models. Data for these variables are obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis dataset and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) Coupled Global Climate Model, version 3 (CGCM3) GCM simulations. The principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy c-means clustering method (FCM) are used as part of downscaling model to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the clusters in the data, respectively. Evaluation of the performances of the models using different error and statistical measures indicates that the SVM-based model performed better than all the other models in reproducing most monthly rainfall statistics at 18 sites. Output from the third-generation CGCM3 GCM for the A1B scenario was used for future projections. For the projection period 2001-10, MLR was used to relate variables at the GCM and NCEP grid scales. Use of MLR in linking the predictor variables at the GCM and NCEP grid scales yielded better reproduction of monthly rainfall statistics at most of the stations (12 out of 18) compared to those by spatial interpolation technique used in earlier studies.

AB  - The next generation of wearable electronics for health monitoring, Internet-of-Things system, "interface-on-invisible," and green energy harvesting require electrically conductive material that is superiorly transparent, negligibly hysteretic, industrially feasible, and highly stretchable. The practical potential of ionic hydrogel is challenged with obvious hysteresis and a limited sensing range due to relative delamination and viscoelastic performance. Herein, a novel liquid conductor, termed as egg white liquid, is developed from self-liquidation of egg white hydrogel, and the liquid not only inherits the designed architecture from a hydrogel predecessor but also achieves comparable conductivity (20.4 S m(-1)) to the ionic hydrogel and ultrahigh transparency (up to 99.8%) . Moreover, the 3D-printed liquid-elastomer hybrid exhibits excellent conformability, remarkable sensitivity with negligible hysteresis (0.77%), and the capability of monitoring human motions and dynamic moduli is further demonstrated. The liquid nature inspires a gesture-controlled touchless user interface for front-end electronic systems. Furthermore, mechanical energy harvesting and pressure sensing are evidenced by exploiting this liquid conductor into a triboelectric nanogenerator. Notably, the as-prepared liquid via subsequent phase transition possessing superior transparency, ultralow hysteresis, economic benefit, and unique liquid phase may potentially fuel the development of a new class of wearable electronics, human-machine interface, and clean energy.

AB  - Despite the prevalence of high-stakes assessments-and the growing likelihood of heat exposure during such assessments-the effect of temperature on performance has not yet been studied in such settings. Using student-level administrative data for the largest public school district in the United States, I provide the first estimates of temperature's impact on high stakes exam performance and subsequent educational attainment. Hot temperature reduces performance by up to 13 percent of a standard deviation and leads to persistent impacts on high school graduation status, despite compensatory responses by teachers, who selectively upward manipulate grades after hotter exams.

AB  - For the deep geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste in argillaceous rocks, the heat production of the waste is an important driver for thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM)-coupled processes. These THM processes influence the properties and conditions of the near field that in many repository designs contains bentonite as a clay buffer. One task in the DECOVALEX-2015 (DEvelopment of COupled models and their VALidation against Experiments) project was the modelling of a heated bentonite column (Villar et al. in Long-term THM tests reports: THM cells for the HE-E test: update of results until February 2014. Deliverable-no: D2.2-7.3. CIEMAT Technical Report IEMAT/DMA/2G210/03/2014, 2014) in preparation for the in situ heater experiment HE-E at the underground rock laboratory Mont Terri. DECOVALEX is an international cooperative project that focuses on the development and validation of mathematical models for simulating such coupled processes associated with disposal in deep geological repositories. Eight modelling teams developed their own THM-coupled models for the bentonite column experiment, using six different simulation codes. Each of the teams individually calibrated the THM parameters for the bentonite material. The eight resulting parameter sets agree well and allow a satisfactory reproduction of the TH measurements by all models. The modelling results for the evolution of temperature and relative humidity over time at three sensors in the bentonite column are in good agreement between the teams and with the measured data. Also, changes of the temperature due to modifications of the insulation and the adjustment of the heating power during the course of the experiment are well reproduced. The models were thus able to reproduce the main physical processes of the experiment, both for vapour-dominated diffusion during the heating phase and combined liquid and vapour transport during a subsequent heating and hydration phase. Based on the parameter sets, the teams predict a penetration of the water infiltration front in the 48-cm column filled with bentonite pellets to a depth between 25 and 35 cm over the 15,000 h (i.e. over 20 months) of the hydration phase of the experiment.

AB  - A novel psychrotolerant Psychrobacillus strain PB01, isolated from an Antarctic iceberg, was comparatively analyzed with five related strains. The complete genome of strain PB01 consists of a single circular chromosome (4.3 Mb) and a plasmid (19 Kb). As potential low-temperature adaptation strategies, strain PB01 has four genes encoding cold-shock proteins, two genes encoding DEAD-box RNA helicases, and eight genes encoding transporters for glycine betaine, which can serve as a cryoprotectant, on the genome. The pan-genome structure of the six Psychrobacillus strains suggests that strain PB01 might have evolved to adapt to extreme environments by changing its genome content to gain higher capacity for DNA repair, translation, and membrane transport. Notably, strain PB01 possesses a complete TCA cycle consisting of eight enzymes as well as three additional Helicobacter pylori-type enzymes: ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase, succinyl-CoA/acetoacetyl-CoA transferase, and malate/ quinone oxidoreductase. The co-existence of the genes for TCA cycle enzymes has also been identified in the other five Psychrobacillus strains.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate selected physical, morphological and thermal properties of durum wheat grain. Additionally, the parameters of control grain (grown without fertilizers or a growth retardant) were compared with the grain from treatments with different combinations of nitrogen fertilizer and growth retardant. The grain of durum wheat grown without nitrogen fertilizer or growth retardant was characterized by the lowest values of thousand-kernel weight (47.24 g for the sample collected in 2015 and 45.70 g for the sample collected in 2016), bulk density (814 kg m(-3) -2015 and 745 kg m(-3) -2016), length (7.62 mm-2015 and 7.54 mm-2016), width (3.35 mm-2015 and 3.32 mm-2016) and shape factors (specific perimeter of object boundary, Danielsson coefficient). The highest values of thousand-kernel weight, bulk density and width of durum wheat grain harvested in both years of the study were determined in the samples collected in the treatment with a total nitrogen rate of 80 kg ha(-1) without the growth retardant. In the samples collected in 2015, the above combination produced grain with the greatest length, the highest specific perimeter of object boundary and the highest Danielsson coefficient. In 2016, these parameters were highest in grain from the treatment where a total nitrogen rate of 80 kg ha(-1) was combined with a growth retardant. Different combinations of nitrogen fertilization and the growth retardant did not affect the true density or the thermal properties of wheat grain. Statistically significant differences between the experimental groups were not observed.

AB  - Acute nociception is essential for survival by warning organisms against potential dan -gers, whereas tissue injury results in a nociceptive hypersensitivity state that is closely associated with debilitating disease conditions, such as chronic pain. Transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels expressed in nociceptors detect noxious thermal and chem-ical stimuli to initiate acute nociception. The existing hypersensitivity model suggests that under tissue injury and inflammation, the same Trp channels in nociceptors are sensitized through transcriptional and posttranslational modulation, leading to nocicep-tive hypersensitivity. Unexpectedly and different from this model, we find that in Dro-sophila larvae, acute heat nociception and tissue injury-induced hypersensitivity involve distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms. Specifically, TrpA1-D in peripheral sensory neurons mediates acute heat nociception, whereas TrpA1-C in a cluster of larval brain neurons transduces the heat stimulus under the allodynia state. As a result, interfering with synaptic transmission of these brain neurons or genetic targeting of TrpA1-C blocks heat allodynia but not acute heat nociception. TrpA1-C and TrpA1-D are two splicing variants of TrpA1 channels and are coexpressed in these brain neurons. We fur-ther show that Gq-phospholipase C signaling, downstream of the proalgesic neuropep-tide Tachykinin, differentially modulates these two TrpA1 isoforms in the brain neurons by selectively sensitizing heat responses of TrpA1-C but not TrpA1-D. Together, our studies provide evidence that nociception and noncaptive sensitization could be mediated by distinct sensory neurons and molecular sensors.

AB  - Aism: The purpose of this study was to investigate the inactivation kinetics of Staphylococcus aureus in a ham model system by high hydrostatic pressure at ambient (25 degrees C) and selected temperatures (45, 55 degrees C). Selective [Baird Parker (BP) agar] and nonselective [brain heart infusion (BHI) agar] growth media were used for enumeration in order to count viable and sublethally injured cells.
   Methods and Resutls: The micro-organism was exposed to a range of pressures (450, 500, 550, 600 MPa) at ambient temperature (25 degrees C) for up to 45 min. Additionally, the behaviour of the micro-organism was evaluated at mild temperatures in combination with high pressure treatment, namely: (i) 350, 400 and 450 MPa at 45 degrees C; and (ii) 350 and 400 MPa at 55 degrees C, for up to 12 min. Inactivation kinetics were calculated in terms of D-p and z(p) values. Survival curves of S. aureus at ambient temperature were mostly linear, whereas when temperature was applied, tailing was observed in most survival curves. The estimated D-p values and therefore the number of surviving cells, were substantially higher on the selective BP agar in the whole range of pressures applied, indicating that S. aureus showed greater recovery in the selective BP agar than the nonselective BHI agar. Samples pressurized at ambient temperature needed higher pressures (over 500 MPa) to achieve a reduction of the population of the pathogen more than 5 log CFU ml(-1). The same level of inactivation was achieved at lower pressure levels when mild heating was simultaneously applied. Indeed, more than 6 log CFU ml(-1) reductions were obtained at 400 MPa and 55 degrees C within the first 7 min of the process in BHI medium.
   Conclusion: Elevated temperatures allowed lower pressure levels and shorter processing times of pathogen inactivation than at room temperature. Greater recovery of the pathogen was observed in the selective (BP agar) medium, regardless of pressure and temperature applied.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The obtained kinetics could be employed by the industry in selecting optimum pressure/temperature processing conditions. Attention must be given to the selection of the enumeration medium, as the use of an inappropriate medium would lead to underestimation of the surviving cells, thus imposing a risk in the microbiological safety of the product.

AB  - Endangered freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera margaritifera reveal a complex life cycle with an obligate host-dependent phase. Only two species, Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout S. trutta, are important hosts in Europe, indicating a high degree of specialization. Whilst freshwater pearl mussels with their filtering activity can provide important ecosystem services and indirectly improve the habitat quality for their salmonid hosts, their direct effects on physiological stress, reduced swimming performance, and increased mortality at high rates of infestation all support a parasitic character of the mussel during its host-dependent phase. From an evolutionary perspective, both the much greater generation time of the parasite compared to the host, as well as the great distribution ranges of M. margaritifera and its hosts should favour local adaptation patterns. The variable suitability of different salmonid strains and species as hosts for M. margaritifera and the resulting differences in the performance of larvae during the host-dependent phase indicate that host-management strategies should focus on maintaining high quality hosts at a regional scale to avoid selection or genetic drift effects which could erode the genetic and evolutionary potential for adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - It is well-known that camelina oil, obtained from Camelina sativa seeds is rich in fatty acids, predominantly linolenic acid and is used successfully in pharmaceutical and cosmetic therapies. It is remarkable that this species has a great adaptability to environmental conditions, being able to cultivate it on agricultural parcels and polluted soils.
   The goal of this work is to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative differences of three types of camelina oils, obtained from varieties grown in Romania: GP 202-Spanish provenance, Camelia and Madalina, both Romanian provenance. The effect of soil fertilization on the quality of the seeds /oil obtained from 3 varieties of camelina was tested, the control being the unfertilized Camelina variety. The following parameters have been evaluated: seed moisture, cold oil extraction yield, certain physico-chemical oil indicators and percent quantitative composition of individual and total fatty acids. Remarkable is the total fatty acid content of the oil that varies between 75.87 g% for the unfertilized Madalina variant and 81 g% for the fertilized GP-202 variant. Taking in consideration the results for all the studied parameters, it can be concluded that the Mack Vinci variety is very similar to the other two, and fertilization contributes insignificantly to the improvement of the quality of the obtained oil.

AB  - The widely distributed snail species Theodoxus fluviatilis (Linneaus, 1758) is rather diverse in shell size and patterning. It has formed regional subgroups in northern Germany that appear separate in either fresh- or brackish water, yet, according to literature, are indistinguishable by morphology, anatomy or mtRNA markers. Tolerance towards challenging salinities, however, is distinct. The question as to whether the observed difference in salinity tolerance is a result of local adaptation or of phenotypic plasticity remains. In this study, physiological limits to salinity stress and tolerance shift abilities were compared between individuals from both subgroups in a salinity transfer experiment and acclimation regime followed by a survival analysis. Brackish water animals struggled in freshwater but performed much better than freshwater individuals when directly transferred into higher salinities. With acclimation to their challenging salinities, individuals of both subgroups achieved shifts in the slopes of their reaction norms and were able to survive salinity levels otherwise lethal to them. Even with this shift freshwater animals were not able reach the tolerance levels of brackish water individuals. The results indicate that phenotypic plasticity as well as genetic adaptation may determine osmotolerance in regional subgroups of T. fluviatilis.

AB  - Fractures have significantly impacted the preservation, enrichment, and productivity of shale gas in the Longmaxi Formation in the complex structural area of the southern Sichuan Basin. Based on outcrop, core, imaging logging, inclusion analysis, acoustic emission experiments, and burial and thermal evolution history data, the formation stage, evolution and preservation conditions of structural fractures were comprehensively studied. Shear fractures are the main features of tectonic origin and are characterized by small widths, wide spacing, and high filling degrees. The structural fractures of the Longmaxi Formation can be divided into three groups in terms of their formation stage. The first-stage fractures were formed in the middle-late period of the Yanshanian tectonic movement (86.2-68.5 Ma), when the palaeotectonic stress was 68.33-71.82 MPa; and the homogenization temperature of the fluid inclusions in the corresponding fracture fillings is 150-178 degrees C. The second-stage fractures were formed at the end of the Yanshanian -early Himalayan tectonic movement (68.5-35.2 Ma), when the palaeotectonic stress was 85.2-100.5 MPa; the homogenization temperature of the corresponding fluid inclusions is 123-148 degrees C. The third-stage tectonic fractures formed during the middle-late period of the Himalayan tectonic movement (35.2-0 Ma), when the palaeotectonic stress was 55.6-63.8 MPa; fillings are scarce in these fractures, but the measured homogenization temperature of the corresponding fluid inclusions is 90-110 degrees C. Shale gas preservation conditions were affected by the fracture formation stage, maximum horizontal crustal stress, fault scale, structural burial depth, formation pressure coefficient, etc. Three types of favourable preservation conditions were identified. The Type I target area is the low slope area in the middle of the syncline, which occurs more than 2.0 km from the fault. The research results have guiding significance for the evaluation of the preservation conditions of deep shale gas in the study area and similar areas.

AB  - In the European Union energy security have been driving the search for economically viable and environmentally sustainable renewable energy sources since the 90's. Energy crops could represent a good opportunity to combine the energy goals with the conservation of farmer incomes and the global climate change control. Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a perennial rhizomatous grass particularly attractive for energy production because of a high yield potential, a generally positive environmental impact and a good attitude to energy conversion. Long-term studies carried out in Central Italy confirmed its high production level, in both fertile and marginal lands (aboveground yields from 38 to 20 t ha(-1) year(-1)). In addition, the crop highlighted a high growth rate at the beginning of the growing season, progressively decreasing in summer when high temperature and low water availability occurred. Giant reed nutrient requirements were generally low and part of nutrient stocks were remobilized from the rhizome to the aboveground biomass over the spring, with the opposite flow occurring in autumn. From an environmental point of view giant reed showed a positive energy balance with a high-energy efficiency. Compared to other energy crops, giant reed showed the lowest GHG emissions per unit of energy and the best performance in terms of cost per ton of dry biomass or per unit of energy.
   To improve knowledge on giant reed and to favour the diffusion of energy crops in Italian cropping systems, further studies are needed to analyse the long-term effects of giant reed on soil fertility and the optimal soil management after its cultivation. In our researches the environmental impacts of giant reed and its production costs were referred to the production phase. Therefore, there is the need to extend the research activity to the whole energy chain and to identify the most sustainable conversion technologies (e.g. biogas, 2nd generation bioethanol, etc.) for the different environments.

AB  - Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) enter seawater earlier and smaller (0.2 g) than any other salmonid following a two-stage salinity tolerance process initiated around yolk-sac absorption and completed with seawater entry. For the first time, this two-stage ontogeny of salinity tolerance was characterized by either holding posthatch pink salmon in fresh water or transferring them to seawater every 2 weeks. A window of salinity tolerance around yolk-sac absorption was evidenced by a period of zero morbidity in seawater compared with 100% morbidity for newly hatched alevins and 25% morbidity for fry (similar to 0.2-0.3 g). Increased hypo-osmoregulatory ability at the time of yolk-sac absorption was indicated in fish held in fresh water under constant photoperiod (12 h light : 12 h dark) and temperature (5 degrees C) by a switch from catabolic to anabolic growth, increased gill Na+K+-ATPase activity and alpha-1b/alpha-1a isoform expression, and a plateau in whole-body water content, implying that pink salmon go through a form of smoltification. A large increase in whole-body [Na+] observed in fresh water at yolk-sac absorption may represent a unique strategy for maintaining water balance once fish enter seawater.

AB  - The freshwater water flea Daphnia magna is a planktonic animal belonging to the Cladocera. To evaluate differences between two D. magna strains (KIT and NIES) in terms of life parameters and fatty acid profiles, we examined several endpoints. In the D. magna KIT strain, the numbers of total and cumulative offspring were lower at 23 ? and higher at 14 ? than in the D. magna NIES strain. However, at 14 ?, the D. magna KIT strain showed an increased lifespan. Although the n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio was always decreased at a low temperature, the PUFA ratio in the KIT strain had a higher value on day 3 than the NIES strain, which gave it higher adaptability to low temperature. In addition, we identified the elongation of very long chain fatty acids (elovl) and fatty acid desaturase (fad) genes, which are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, in the genomes of both D. magna KIT and NIES. The Elovl and Fad genes in both D. magna strains were highly conserved, including tandem duplicated Elovl 1/7 genes. This study provides new information about the molecular basis for the difference in temperature sensitivity between two strains of D. magna.

AB  - Bacterial protein synthesis is an essential, conserved, and environmentally responsive process. Yet, many of its components and dependencies remain unidentified. To address this gap, we used quantitative synthetic genetic arrays to map functional relationships among >48,000 gene pairs in Escherichia coli under four culture conditions differing in temperature and nutrient availability. The resulting data provide global functional insights into the roles and associations of genes, pathways, and processes important for efficient translation, growth, and environmental adaptation. We predict and independently verify the requirement of unannotated genes for normal translation, including a previously unappreciated role of YhbY in 30S biogenesis. Dynamic changes in the patterns of genetic dependencies across the four growth conditions and data projections onto other species reveal overarching functional and evolutionary pressures impacting the translation system and bacterial fitness, underscoring the utility of systematic screens for investigating protein synthesis, adaptation, and evolution.

AB  - 1. Habitat selection is a complex process, which involves behavioural decisions guided by the multiple needs and constraints faced by individuals. Climate-induced changes in environmental conditions may alter those trade-offs and resulting habitat use patterns.
   2. In this study, we investigated the effect of sea temperature on habitat selection and habitat use of acoustically tagged Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) at the Norwegian Skagerrak coast.
   3. Significant relationships between ocean temperature and habitat selection and use were found. Under favourable sea temperature thresholds (< 16 degrees C), cod selected vegetated habitats, such as eelgrass and macroalgae beds, available in shallow areas. Selection for those habitats was especially high at night, when cod tended to ascend to shallower areas, presumably to feed. Selection and use of those habitats decreased significantly as temperature rose. Under increased sea surface temperature conditions, cod were absent from vegetated shallow habitats, both during the day and night, and selected instead non-vegetated rocky bottoms and sand habitats, available in deeper, colder areas.
   4. This study shows the dynamic nature of habitat selection and strongly suggests that cod in this region have to trade off food availability against favourable temperature conditions. Future increases in ocean temperature are expected to further influence the spatial behaviour of marine fish, potentially affecting individual fitness and population dynamics.

AB  - Gene duplication is a major evolutionary driving force for establishing new gene functions. However, very little is known about the involvement of the structural divergence of recent duplicated genes in local adaptation. We evaluated the nucleotide variation of recent duplicated pair copies of the hsp17 locus for small heat shock proteins, namely, the older copy hsp17a and the younger copy hsp17b. Forty wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) genotypes from 7 climatically divergent sites of "Evolution Canyon" I, Mount Carmel, Israel, were investigated for the sequence diversity of their hsp17 copies. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the hsp17 locus and found 150 SNPs of hsp17a and 135 SNPs of hsp17b in the coding region. Total amino acid substitutions were present at 43 positions of hsp17a and 35 positions of hsp17b among the 7 populations. The genetic divergence and haplotype diversity were significantly different among the populations. The diversity was also correlated with microclimatic interslope divergence factors in the canyon. The natural microclimatic selection appears to adaptively diversify the duplicated copies of hsp17 of wild barley between the opposite warmer and cooler slopes, suggesting that the recent duplication of stress-responsive genes were subjected to adaptive evolution. The gene duplication and the resulting functional divergence enable plants to have better fitness in local climate change.

AB  - Intelligent buildings need to be sustainable (i.e. sustain their performance for future generations), healthy and technologically up to date; meet regulatory demands; meet the needs of the occupants; and be flexible and adaptable enough to deal with change. Buildings will contain a variety of systems devised by many people, and yet the relationship between buildings and people can only work satisfactorily if there is integration between the supply- and demand-side stakeholders as well as between the occupants, the systems and the building. To achieve this, systems thinking is essential in planning, design and management, together with the ability to create and innovate while remaining practical (see Glossary). The ultimate objective should be simplicity rather than complexity. This requires not only technical ability but also the powers of interpretation, imagination and even intuition. Building Regulations can stifle creativity but are necessary to set a minimum level of expectation and obey health and safety requirements. However, we should aim at designing well above these conditions. After all, buildings form our architectural landscape and they, and the environment they generate, should uplift the soul and the spirit of those people within them as well as those who pass by them.
   The creation of shared visions, effective teams, clear structures and robust processes ensures that the intelligent building being constructed will demonstrate the purpose for which it was conceived. Times are changing as technology and society evolve, so there needs to be a long-term outlook by the team. Key innovation issues for intelligent buildings include sustainability (energy, water, waste and pollution), the use of information and communication technology, robotics, embedded sensor technology, smart-materials technology including nanotechnology, health in the workplace and social change.
   Smart materials in facades, for example, will provide sophisticated forms of feedback and high levels of control besides regulating thermal transmission. Eventually by coating and embedding materials with nanoparticles we will be able to specify material properties much more easily. Self-healing materials will revolutionize facades in the future. Pelletier and Bose (2010) describe how a concrete matrix embedded with capsules of sodium silicate healing agent can repair cracks by the sodium silicate from the ruptured capsules interacting with the calcium hydroxide in the concrete to form a gel that seals the cracks.
   However, innovation must be an enabler rather than an end in itself. Passive environmental design is equally important so that the energy demands are minimized by using natural means such as mass, orientation and building form to capture sunlight, fresh air and rain water.
   The intelligent buildings control markets are strong worldwide even after the gloomy economic period of 2009. The largest markets are in the USA, Asia, Middle East and Europe but some smaller countries are showing rapid growth. BSRIA Member e-News August 2009 shows that Scandinavia, Germany and Qatar spend most per capita on sophisticated intelligent controls. The increasing demand for sustainable, healthy and low-carbon intelligent buildings seems likely to sustain this dynamic market. Building management systems (BMSs) provide control and interoperability between the various systems servicing the building. Innovations such as internet-based, common, open communication standards and protocols increasingly make it more important to integrate the systems within intelligent buildings. This in turn will require an extended range of professional expertise that could force a cultural change.
   A key driver is the sustainability agenda. This article is about the actions and trends that are necessary to achieve a sustainable intelligent building. Such buildings need intelligent infrastructures and serve communities that demand new master planning approaches, and these will feature in a later special issue.

AB  - Global climate change may detrimentally affect future generations of numerous forest tree species, hampering their long-term sustainability if appropriate evolutionary responses remain lacking. To face these novel threats, conservation biologists are in need of a thorough understanding and identification of adaptive variation in key fitness traits. We here provide an elaborate synthesis of pre-existing and novel analyses of an association mapping, genecological and landscape genomic study integrating genotypic, environmental and phenotypic data to gain insights into the genetic basis of cold-hardiness adaptation in coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii). Data were collected across part of the natural range for a total of 643 individuals. A landscape genomic approach revealed 28 putative non-neutral genes, although a variance partitioning analysis indicated only moderate power of this gene set in explaining cold-hardiness-related phenotypic variation, and suggests many important genes await discovery. Integrating these results within the entire phenotypegenotype-environment spectrum allowed us to delineate the six most promising candidate genes under selection. By combining genomic, phenotypic and environmental data, this study attempts to gain insights in the genetic basis of key adaptations, which may ultimately aid forestry managers to establish resilient ecosystems in face of future climate change.

AB  - Glass vial laboratory bioassays were used to evaluate sensitivities of a laboratory strain and a malathion-resistant field strain of the parasitoid Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) to two pyrethroids, deltamethrin and cyfluthrin. Knockdown (24 h) and mortality (48 h) dose response data for the parasitoids were compared with those of laboratory and field strains of the parasitoid's host, the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). For both species, higher doses were required for mortality than for knockdown. LD50s for 48 h mortality for the field strain of A. calandrae were 0.36 mug/vial for deltamethrin and 1.52 mug/vial for cyfluthrin. The malathion-resistant field strain of A. calandrae was about 2-fold more resistant to the pyrethroids compared with the laboratory strain. LD50s for the field strain of S. oryzae were 0.51 mug/vial for deltamethrin and 1.51 mug/vial for cyfluthrin. There no significant differences in response of the laboratory and field strains of S. oryzae to the pyrethroids. Although they are not currently labelled for use as grain protectants, these pyrethroids offer several advantages over organophosphorothioates in controlling stored grain insects. However, resistance ratios in A. calandrae will have to be increased, probably through laboratory selection procedures, to allow this parasitoid to be used in a pest management program in combination with these compounds.

AB  - Tolerance to high and low temperature is an important breeding aim for Central and Northern Europe, where temperature fluctuations are predicted to increase. However, the extent to which genotypes differ in their response to the whole range of possible temperatures is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines with differing temperature optima for root growth would lead to superior hybrids. This hypothesis is based on the concept of 'marginal overdominance' in which the hybrid expresses higher relative fitness than its parents, summed over all situations. The elongation rates of axile and lateral roots of the reciprocal cross between two flint and two dent inbred lines were assessed at temperatures between 15 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Indeed, the cross between UH005 and UH250 with lateral root growth temperature optima at 34 degrees C and 28 degrees C, respectively, resulted in intermediate hybrids. At temperatures below and above 31 degrees C, the hybrids' root growth was comparable to the better parent, respectively, thereby increasing temperature tolerance of the hybrid compared with its parents. The implications of and reasons for this heterosis effect are discussed in the context of breeding for abiotic stress tolerance and of putatively underlying molecular mechanisms. This finding paves the way for more detailed investigations of this phenomenon in future studies.

AB  - Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively new joining technique and has many applications. In FSW, heat generated due to friction between FSW tool and work-piece material softens the material and allows the materials in work-pieces to be stirred and joined together. FSW allows the work-pieces to be joined without reaching the melting point of the material, thus resulting in better welds. However, a large amount of mechanical energy has to be consumed for FSW of high-strength, difficult-to-weld metals such as titanium alloys. Hence, new FSW methods should be investigated to reduce the required energy. In this study, an innovative electrically-enhanced friction stir welding (EEFSW) has been developed. Electric current is passed in welding coupons of Aluminum 6061 plates and its effect on welding process and welds are examined. The results indicate that, with the aid of electric current, improvement in welding speed and reduction in energy consumption is obtainable, which enhances the productivity and widens the range of applications of FSW. Weld properties are found to be affected by the introduced current as well.

AB  - Earth's carbon cycle maintains a stable climate and biosphere on geological timescales. Feedbacks regulate the size of the surface carbon reservoir, and on million-year timescales the carbon cycle must be in steady state. A major question about the early Earth is whether carbon was cycled through the surface reservoir more quickly or slowly than it is today. The answer to this question holds important implications for Earth's climate state, the size of the biosphere through time, and the expression of atmospheric biosignatures on Earth-like planets. Here, we examine total carbon inputs and outputs from the Earth's surface over time. We find stark disagreement between the canonical histories of carbon outgassing and carbon burial, with the former implying high rates of throughput on the early Earth and the latter suggesting sluggish carbon cycling. We consider solutions to this apparent paradox and conclude that the most likely resolution is that high organic burial efficiency in the Precambrian enabled substantial carbon burial despite limited biological productivity. We then consider this model in terms of Archean redox balance and find that in order to maintain atmospheric anoxia prior to the Great Oxidation Event, high burial efficiency likely needed to be accompanied by greater outgassing of reductants. Similar mechanisms likely govern carbon burial and redox balance on terrestrial exoplanets, suggesting that outgassing rates and the redox state of volcanic gases likely play a critical role in setting the tempo of planetary oxygenation.

AB  - Rearing temperature is correlated with the timing and speed of development in a wide range of poikiloterm animals that do not regulate their body temperature. However, exceptions exist, especially in species that live in environments with high temperature extremes or oscillations. Drosophila pachea is endemic to the Sonoran desert in Mexico, in which temperatures and temperature variations are extreme. We wondered if the developmental timing in D. pachea may be sensitive to differing rearing temperatures or if it remains constant. We determined the overall timing of the Drosophila pachea life-cycle at different temperatures. The duration of pupal development was similar at 25 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 32 degrees C, although the relative progress differed at particular stages. Thus, D. pachea may have evolved mechanisms to buffer temperature effects on developmental speed, potentially to ensure proper development and individual's fitness in desert climate conditions.

AB  - The evolution of species or ecotypes can occur gradually through neutral and adaptive genetic changes. To explore the influence of natural selection during early phases of divergence, morphological and ecological discontinuity and its adaptive significance were investigated in six pairs of alpine and independently evolved montane populations of Heliosperma pusillum s.l.; the latter are usually taxonomically recognised at the species rank in spite of their highly debatable taxonomic value. We tested whether environmental conditions - characterised by Landolt indicator values from vegetation surveys and temperature measurements - and morphology of alpine and montane populations differ discretely and in parallel across six population pairs. By reciprocal transplantation experiments in natural environments in two population pairs and in climate chambers for five population pairs we compared fitness of native versus non-native individuals. Alpine and montane populations differed in environmental conditions and morphology within each pair. Morphological differentiation occurred in parallel and correlated with environmental, but not with genetic distances. In both environments, native individuals had higher establishment success and plant size. Differentiation of the independently evolved montane populations is driven by natural selection and parallel, independent adaptation in response to drought, lower irradiance and higher, less fluctuating temperatures in montane populations. Our study system exemplifies rapid, parallel evolution leading to morphologically and ecologically strongly divergent, though fully interfertile, ecotypes.

AB  - The tight sandstone reservoir of Chang 6(3) Formation of Huaqing Area in Ordos Basin were divided into three types based on its different pore types: formation with intergranular pore type, dissolved-intercrystalline pore type and pore plus fracture type reservoirs, which were dominated by casting thin sections, scanning electron microscope(SEM), granularity image, high-pressure mercury injection, constant-rate mercury injection, nuclear magnetic resonance and real sandstone micro model experiment, and the porosity evolution path in each type were studied. The study shows that: The physical property, pore structure, and type of displacement in each reservoir type have obvious differences, which indicate that the reservoir classification evaluation which is based on pore assembly type has its own applicability in research region. Combined with parameters such as buried depth and temperature, the porosity evolution path has apparent control on pore structure. The porosity evolution of reservoirs with different pore types reveals the effect of increased and decreased porosity on the reservoir's quality. Pore structures have close relationship with productivity law.

AB  - A severe limitation to fully realize the dramatic potential for adaptation of RNA virus quasispecies may occur if mutations in vast regions of the sequence space of virus genomes lead to significant decreases in biological fitness. In this study the detection and selection by heat of thermostable variants from different foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) populations were attempted, in order to explore whether FMDV may generally accept a substantial increase in thermostability without compromising its infectivity. The results obtained with both uncloned and cloned populations of different serotypes, recovered from cytolytic or persistent infections and subjected to either very few passages or extensive passaging in cells, indicate that the presence of thermostable virus variants, even in small proportions, is not a general feature of FMDV quasispecies. This suggests that no substantial increase in the thermostability of FMDV may readily occur without a negative effect on viral function.

AB  - The Lower Cretaceous shales of Chagan Sag, Yingen-Ejinaqi Basin, are considered as the source rocks of hydrocarbons discovered in the sag. Borehole shales from the Lower Cretaceous were subjected to comprehensive geochemical study to evaluate the quality of source rock, to reconstruct the paleodepositional environment and to determine the controlling factors of organic matter enrichment. Content of present-day total organic carbon, and hydrogen index, averaging 1.4% and 259.2mg hydrocarbon/g total organic carbon, respectively reveal poor to fair quality of organic matter. Average value of vitrinite reflectance (Ro) of 1.0% indicates mature organic matter. Maceral composition and biomarker analysis provide evidence for a mixed aquatic and terrigeous organic matter input. Based on Sr/Cu, Sr/Ba, and gammacerane index, we propose that organic matter was deposited in closed hypersaline under hot and arid climate conditions. The ratios of V/(V+Ni), and pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph), as well as the presence of -carotene suggest a stratified water column with anoxic bottom water condition. Low to moderate productivity as a result of deficient nutrient supply, the excellent organic matter preservation condition under stratified anoxic water column and high sedimentary rate controlled the quality of source rock. In addition, influence of factors such as content of clay minerals on organic matter enrichment cannot be ignored.

AB  - Exergy analysis is powerful tool for process optimization and mechanism analysis. In this study, exergy analysis was performed for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fermentation process. More than 86% of input exergy was contributed by glucose. The exergy of biomass was about 64.66% of the total output exergy when the phosphate concentration was 4 g L-1. The exergy efficiencies of DHA (eta(DHA)) for the starting strains and the evolved strains under high oxygen concentration, low temperature, and two-factor conditions were also investigated. The eta(DHA) in the collected experimental data was not more than 20.9%. It was proved that there was a positive correlation between eta DHA and the biomass yield. It was indicated that adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) improved biomass yield which had the most important effect on enhancing eta DHA and DHA yield (or DHA productivity). It is necessary to improve eta DHA through process optimization and ALE in future.

AB  - The statistical methods Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Canonical Correspondence analysis (CCA) are used to determine the ecological preferences of dinoflagellate cyst species from the upper part of the Italian Singa section (2.8-2.2 Ma). Using DCA, gradients that have major influence on the species composition have been determined. By using existing environmental information for the Singa section based on planktic foraminifera, such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Productivity (SSP) and stable oxygen isotopes as well as the ecological information of extant dinoflagellate cysts, these gradients are interpreted in terms of temperature, inshore-offshore trends and evolutionary and other time-related gradients. Using CCA, the position of species optima in this dataset in relation to these temperature, inshore-offshore and evolutionary and other time related gradients are determined.
   For the studied period, the extinct species Melitasphaeridium pseudorecurvatum and Acritarch sp. B. are related to temperate to warm intervals. Amiculosphaera umbracula is related to the cooler older intervals whereas Nematosphaeropsis rigida is related to the warmer younger intervals.

AB  - Metallurgy includes the oldest branch of technology and science of the humanity. Starting with discovering of the first metals till the actual nanostructures and special alloyed materials, the evolution of the metallurgy is fascinating.
   The ferrous metallurgy had a fast evolution during time. The technical processes are in continuous changing, depending on humanity demands. The present article limits only to some milestones regarding the evolution of the thermal aggregates used for iron manufacturing. There are presented some processing technologies of iron ore in Europe, starting with the proto-metallurgy, when the used row material was the meteorite iron. At the beginning, human believed that everything must remain hidden in the basement. Also, the entire equipment was rudimentary, constructed by wood, burned clay or iron and had specific forms, seemingly a cavity. Later, humanity began to understand the iron ore importance, starting to use iron for many activities. Being such a big demand, there has been an evolution of the iron ore processing instruments that has reflected in materials, shape and techniques. The main objective was to ease people's work and to increase their productivity. The article has in view the primary extractive processes and the processing methods as puddling, forging or casting.
   In the context of Central European ferrous metallurgy, it is interesting to have a perspective view of the processes evolution, by comparing the rudimentary techniques with the modern ones, to understand better where we come from and where we are heading.

AB  - Bioconversion efficiency of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) by Clostridium butyricum is bottlenecked by its low tolerance to various stressors, especially glycerol as the substrate, 1,3-PD as the end product, and butyric acid as a by-product, which eventually decreases 1,3-PD yield. This study aimed at improving the tolerance and 1,3PD production capability of C. butyricum using random mutagenesis and evolutionary techniques. Mutagenesis of wild strain by atmospheric room temperature plasma (ARTP) provided the first population with maximum tolerance to 160 g/L glycerol, while microbial microdroplet culture system (MMC)-mediated adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) generated the second population with tolerance to 100 g/L 1,3-PD. Subsequently, genome shuffling of both populations yielded a final strain, GJH-418, which generated 60.12 g/L1,3-PD with a productivity of 1.72 g/L/h. The transcript analysis of the mutant and wild strains revealed the possible involvement of 8 genes in high tolerance and high 1,3-PD production through either up- or down-regulation.

AB  - Theories of the evolution of niche breadth usually depend. on the assumption that genotypes that are well adapted to exploit one habitat or resource are not well adapted to others. Such "trade-offs" are often apparent in interspecific comparisons, but have been harder to document at the within-population level. Selection experiments provide a promising. means for detecting within-population trade-offs: if selection for adaptation to one environment (e.g., diet, host, temperature) reproducibly lowers fitness in another, trade-offs are the likeliest explanation. Here, I describe strategies for using selection experiments to detect ecological trade-offs and-discuss some of the ambiguities that can arise in interpreting the results of such experiments. I also review two sets of studies that found evidence for trade-offs using selection experiments.

AB  - Many areas are experiencing increasing stream temperatures due to climate change, and some are experiencing reduced summer stream flows and water availability. Because dam building and pond formation by beaver can increase water storage, stream cooling, and riparian ecosystem resilience, beaver have been proposed as a potential climate adaption tool. Despite the large number of studies that have evaluated how beaver activity may affect hydrology and water temperature, few experimental studies have quantified these outcomes following beaver relocation. We evaluated changes in temperature and water storage following the relocation of 69 beaver into 13 headwater stream reaches of the Skykomish River watershed within the Snohomish River basin, Washington, USA. We evaluated how beaver dams affected surface and groundwater storage and stream temperature. Successful relocations created 243 m(3) of surface water storage per 100 m of stream in the first year following relocation. Dams raised water table elevations by up to 0.33 m and stored approximately 2.4 times as much groundwater as surface water per relocation reach. Stream reaches downstream of dams exhibited an average decrease of 2.3 degrees C during summer base-flow conditions. We also assessed how dam age, condition, maintenance frequency, and pond morphology influenced stream temperature at naturally colonized wetland complexes. Our findings demonstrate that dam building can increase water storage and reduce stream temperatures in the first year following successful beaver relocation. Fluvial and floodplain morphology of candidate reaches for relocation is an important consideration because it determines the type and magnitude of response. Relocation to reaches with existing small, abandoned ponds may address thermal criteria by conversion from warming to cooling reaches, whereas relocation within large, abandoned complexes or vacant habitat may result in greater water storage. Although beaver relocation can be an effective climate adaptation strategy to retain more stable hydrologic regimes and water quality in our study area, there appear to be regionally specific environmental and geomorphic factors that influence how beaver affect water storage and temperature. More research is needed to investigate how and why these regional differences affect water storage and stream temperature response in beaver-influenced systems.

AB  - We present numerical models of the thermochemical evolution of the mantle of Mars with particular attention paid to the effects of water. With a two-dimensional, anelastic, compressible convection algorithm in combination with a parameterized model of composition and thermoelastic properties, we consider how water in nominally anhydrous minerals may have influenced the melting and rheology of the martian mantle and how it may have been redistributed by melting, melt extraction, and convection over a period of 4 Gy. The strongest effect of water is found to be a marked increase in convective vigor due to the lower viscosity, which leads to faster cooling of the mantle but nonetheless enhances Melt production. Modeling results are compared with observations and independent inferences from spacecraft observations and martian meteorite analyses. Some models with radionuclide concentrations from Wanke and Dreibus (1994), but with initial mantle water concentrations between their estimate of 36 ppm by weight and 10 times this value, combined with similar to 50% degassing of crust-forming material, partly match observed crustal concentrations of K, Th, and water. In order to account for the observed chemical variation in crustal rocks, however, the formation and survival of ancient mantle heterogeneities appears to have been necessary. Water loss from the mantle since the end of the magma ocean stage has been minor. Elevated water contents notwithstanding, the depth variation of viscosity in the sub-lithospheric mantle of a given model is likely minor. Depths to the Curie temperature at the end of the Noachian range from similar to 40 to 60 km for magnetite and hematite in the models, and present-day total crustal thicknesses lie between 75 and 100 km. The depth to the brittle-ductile transition increases from values around 30 km in the early stages of the models to 170-240 km at present. An estimate of total core entropy renders the existence of a basal perovskite + ferropericlase layer unlikely. The absence of stable superplumes in all of our preferred models suggests that the volcanic provinces of Tharsis and Elysium were formed by a succession of more short-lived events, such as transient plumes, from specific regions at the core-mantle boundary.

AB  - We estimate the global rate of biogenic silica production in the ocean to be between 200 and 280 x 10(12) mol Si yr(-1). The upper limit is derived from information on the primary productivity of the oceans, the relative contribution of diatoms to primary production and diatom Si/C ratios. The lower limit is derived independently using a multi-compartment model of nutrient transport and biogenic particle flux, and field data on the balance between silica production and. dissolution in the upper ocean. Our upper limit is 30-50% lower than several previous estimates, due to new data indicating lower values for both the relative contribution of diatoms to primary productivity and their Si/C ratios. Globally, at least 50% of the silica produced by diatoms in the euphotic zone dissolves in the upper 100 m resulting in an estimated export of 100-140 x 10(12) mol Si yr(-1) to the deep ocean. Our estimates correspond to a global mean rate of biogenic silica production between 0.6 and 0.8 mol Si m(-2) yr(-1). Incubation experiments indicate that silica production rates exceed that mean by a factor of 3-12 in coastal areas and are 2-4 times less than the global average in the oligotrophic mid-ocean gyres. The mean silica production rate in waters overlying diatomaceous sediments (approximately 10-12% of the surface area of the oceans) is 0.7-1.2 mol Si m(-2) yr(-1). That rate is only slightly higher than the global average, indicating that the silica produced in those regions is only 10-25% of the global total. The estimated production of biogenic silica in surface waters of the mid-ocean gyres is approximately equal to that for all major areas of opal sediment accumulation combined. Regional comparison of silica production and accumulation rates suggests a strongly bimodal character in the efficiency of opal preservation in the sea. In waters overlying diatom-rich sediments 15-25% of the silica produced in the surface layer accumulates in the seabed, while virtually none of the silica produced in other areas is preserved. The global burial/production ratio of similar to 3% is a composite of those two very different systems. The mechanisms leading to more efficient opal preservation in regions of silica accumulation are presently unknown, but they have no simple relationship to primary productivity. Regional differences in opal preservation appear to be controlled by factors such as low surface temperature, selective grazing and aggregate formation, which diminish the rate of silica dissolution in surface waters and/or accelerate its transport to the seafloor.

AB  - Evolutionary transitions in sex-determining systems have occurred frequently yet understanding how they occur remains a major challenge. In reptiles, transitions from genetic to temperature-dependent sex determination can occur if the gene products that determine sex evolve thermal sensitivity, resulting in sex-reversed individuals. However, evidence of sex reversal is limited to oviparous reptiles. Here we used thermal experiments to test whether sex reversal is responsible for differences in sex determination in a viviparous reptile, Carinascincus ocellatus, a species with XY sex chromosomes and population-specific sex ratio response to temperature. We show that sex reversal is occurring and that its frequency is related to temperature. Sex reversal was unidirectional (phenotypic males with XX genotype) and observed in both high- and low-elevation populations. We propose that XX-biased genotypic sex ratios could produce either male- or female-biased phenotypic sex ratios as observed in low-elevation C. ocellatus under variable rates of XX sex reversal. We discuss reasons why sex reversal may not influence sex ratios at high elevation. Our results suggest that the mechanism responsible for evolutionary transitions from genotypic to temperature-dependent sex determination is more complex than can be explained by a single process such as sex reversal.

AB  - Dry clutches are widely used in automated manual transmissions. In order to obtain "good" clutch engagements a precise torque transmissibility estimation is crucial. In this paper, a temperature-dependent model of the torque transmissibility characteristic for dry dual clutches is proposed. Dynamic models of the clutches thermal evolutions are determined and linked to the characteristics of the mechanical components influencing the torque transmissibility. Numerical simulations obtained by considering a realistic powertrain model with a dry dual clutch transmission and a corresponding multivariable controller, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB  - Lack of natural disturbance in many forests in northeastern North America has resulted in increased canopy cover and a reduction of open-habitat patches. Crotalus horridus (Timber Rattlesnake) in this region depends upon open basking and gestation sites, and its populations have declined markedly. We evaluated the utility of mechanical tree removal to restore potential basking habitat for a highly imperiled Timber Rattlesnake population in New Hampshire. We used a before-after, control-impact study to test for the effects of tree removal on environmental temperature and Timber Rattlesnake and other wildlife use of 3 potential basking sites. Mean temperatures were significantly higher and more variable post-treatment, while minimum temperatures were relatively unaffected. The number of temperature readings within the span of selected body temperatures of gravid female Timber Rattlesnakes (25.2-31.7 degrees C) increased post-treatment. Using time-lapse cameras, we detected rattlesnakes during 5 days at post-treatment sites but on only 1 day at a control site. Detections of potential rattlesnake prey species did not change following treatment, and few potential rattlesnake predators were detected pre- or post-treatment. Our results suggest that tree removal around potential basking sites likely improves thermal habitat quality for Timber Rattlesnakes.

AB  - Bacteria have highly flexible pangenomes, which are thought to facilitate evolutionary responses to environmental change, but the impacts of environmental stress on pangenome evolution remain unclear. Using a landscape pangenomics approach, I demonstrate that environmental stress leads to consistent, continuous reduction in genome content along four environmental stress gradients (acidity, aridity, heat, salinity) in naturally occurring populations of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens (widespread soil-dwelling plant mutualists). Using gene-level network and duplication functional traits to predict accessory gene distributions across environments, genes predicted to be superfluous are more likely lost in high stress, while genes with multi-functional roles are more likely retained. Genes with higher probabilities of being lost with stress contain significantly higher proportions of codons under strong purifying and positive selection. Gene loss is widespread across the entire genome, with high gene-retention hotspots in close spatial proximity to core genes, suggesting Bradyrhizobium has evolved to cluster essential-function genes (accessory genes with multifunctional roles and core genes) in discrete genomic regions, which may stabilise viability during genomic decay. In conclusion, pangenome evolution through genome streamlining are important evolutionary responses to environmental change. This raises questions about impacts of genome streamlining on the adaptive capacity of bacterial populations facing rapid environmental change.

AB  - The aim of the study was the experimental verification of a proposed novel technology of energy and materials production, consisting of the following process steps: production of biogas from agricultural waste (distillery stillage), presumed utilization of biogas for electricity and heat production (cogeneration) in association with its use as a source of carbon dioxide for microalgae cultivation. The microalgal biomass can be hereafter processed to valuable products such as food and feed supplements. A part of the process wastewater can be utilized as a nitrogen source (ammonium ions) for microalgae cultivation, so the whole process is technologically closed. The tests were performed in a pilot-scale device. Optimization of biogas production from distillery stillage is described. The growth kinetics of microalgae Chlorella sp. consuming biogas or mixture of air and carbon dioxide in the concentration range of 2-20% (v/v) (simulating a flue gas from biogas incineration) in laboratory-scale photo-bioreactors are presented. It was proven that the raw biogas (even without the removal of hydrogen sulphide) could be used as a source of carbon dioxide for growth of microalgae. The growth rate of microalgae consuming biogas was the same as the growth rate of the culture grown on a mixture of air and food-grade carbon dioxide. Using biogas as a source of carbon dioxide has two main advantages: the biomass production costs are reduced and the produced biomass does not contain harmful compounds, which can occur in flue gases. The microalgal growth in bubbled cylinders was typically linear with time. The growth rate dependence on the diameter of the photobioreactor can be correlated using an empirical formula M = 2.2 D(-0.8) (valid for the linear bubbling velocities in the range of w = 0.1-0.3 cm/s), where M is the growth rate in g/L/h, and D is the photobioreactor diameter in mm. Processing of the fermenter wastewater was also quantified. Particularly the removal of ammonia via distillation of the previously alkalized digested sludge was investigated. The possible reuse of ammonia as a fertilizer or as a nitrogen source for microalgae cultivation was examined. About 10% of the distillate (free ammonia concentration up to 20 g/L) can be utilized. The process can be economically viable if a suitable photobioreactor is chosen and the electricity, microalgal biomass and the fertilizer production are valued. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Robustness in farm animals was defined by Knap as 'the ability to combine a high production potential with resilience to stressors, allowing for unproblematic expression of a high production potential in a wide variety of environmental conditions'. The importance of robustness-related traits in breeding objectives is progressively increasing towards the production of animals with a high production level in a wide range of climatic conditions and production systems, together with a high level of animal welfare. Current strategies to increase robustness include selection for 'functional traits', such as skeletal and cardiovascular integrity, disease resistance and mortality in various stages. It is also possible to use global evaluation of sensitivity to the environment (e. g. reaction norm analysis or canalization), but these techniques are difficult to implement in practice. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is the most important stress-responsive neuroendocrine system. Cortisol (or corticosterone) released by the adrenal cortices exerts a large range of effects on metabolism, the immune system, inflammatory processes and brain function, for example. Large individual variations have been described in the HPA axis activity with important physiopathological consequences. In terms of animal production, higher cortisol levels have negative effects on growth rate and feed efficiency and increase the fat/lean ratio of carcasses. On the contrary, cortisol has positive effects on traits related to robustness and adaptation. For instance, newborn survival was shown to be directly related to plasma cortisol levels at birth, resistance to bacteria and parasites are increased in animals selected for a higher HPA axis response to stress, and tolerance to heat stress is better in those animals that are able to mount a strong stress response. Intense selection for lean tissue growth during the last decades has concomitantly reduced cortisol production, which may be responsible for the negative effects of selection on piglet survival. One strategy to improve robustness is to select animals with higher HPA axis activity. Several sources of genetic polymorphism have been described in the HPA axis. Hormone production by the adrenal cortices under stimulation by adrenocorticotropin hormone is a major source of individual differences. Several candidate genes have been identified by genomic studies and are currently under investigation. Bioavailability of hormones as well as receptor and post-receptor mechanisms are also subject to individual variation. Integration of these different sources of genetic variability will allow the development of a model for marker-assisted selection to improve animal robustness without negative side effects on production traits.

AB  - The effect of temperature on Aeromonas hydrophila infection in goldfish, Carassius auratus, was studied using A. hydrophila strain A-3500. After comparison of four different infection methods. subcutaneous injection was selected. Different test temperatures were also tested and higher mortality was observed at 17 and 25degreesC during a 15-day period. SDS-PAGE analysis of outer membrane proteins prepared from A. hydrophila cultured at 10, 17, 25 and 32degreesC in formulated salt water showed different protein profiles. For example, a 40-kDa band was found only at 17 and 25degreesC. Phagocytic rates of A. hydrophila by goldfish macrophages at 10, 17. 25 and 32degreesC were 20.46 +/- 2.07. 16.15 +/- 1.39, 15.94 +/- 1.85 and 22.22 +/- 2.49%, respectively. The results indicated that temperature affects both the cell membrane structure of A. hydrophila and phagocytic activity of goldfish macrophages. resulting in varying fish mortality when infected at different temperatures.

AB  - Most dryland fanning systems depend an tillage to grow crops. There is overwhelming evidence that repeated tillage is destroying the soil resource base and causing adverse environmental impacts. Tillage degrades the fertility of soils, causes air and water pollution, intensifies drought stress, destroys wildlife habitat, wastes fuel energy, and contributes to global warming. Consequently, most tillage-based systems in a dryland environment are not sustainable in the long-term. Today, dryland farmers are expected to produce food in ever greater quantities. This is becoming more difficult to do in view of declining soil quality, most of which is caused by soil tillage. It is becoming well documented scientifically that continuous no-till is the most effective, and practical approach for restoring and improving soil quality which is vital for sustained food production and a healthy environment. With this way of farming crop, residues or other organic amendments are retained on the soil surface and sowing/fertilizing is done with minimal soil disturbance. Research and farmers' experience indicate that with continuous no-till soil organic matter increases, soil structure improves, soil erosion is controlled, and in time crop yields increase substantially from what they were under tillage management, due to improved water relations and nutrient availability. These changes help to promote a cleaner and healthier environment and a more sustainable agriculture. A major obstacle that farmers often face with change to continuous no-till is overcoming yield-limiting factors during the transition years, that is, the first years of no-till following a history of intensive conventional tillage. These factors are often poorly understood and may be biologically-driven. Some of the problems involve residue management and increased weed and disease infestations. Farmer experience seems to indicate that many problems during the transition are temporary and become less important as the no-till system matures and equilibrates. The judicious use of crop rotations, cover crops and same soil disturbance may help reduce agronomic risks during the transition years. Farmers switching to continuous no-till must often seek new knowledge and develop new skills and techniques in order to achieve success with this new and different way of farming. Answers to their questions are urgently needed to provide strategies far promoting no-till as a way to enhance agricultural sustainability for future generations.

AB  - Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1818) is an endemic fish of the Amazon and Orinoco basins, and it is the most economically important native species in Brazil being raised in five climatically distinct regions. In the face of current global warming, environmental variations in farm ponds represent additional challenges that may drive new adaptive regional genetic variations among broodstocks of tambaqui. In an experimental context based on the high-emission scenario of the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, we used two farmed tambaqui populations to test this hypothesis. RNA-seq transcriptome analysis was performed in the liver of juvenile tambaqui from northern (Balbina Experimental Station, Balbina, AM) and southeastern (Brumado Fish Farming, Mogi Mirim, SP) Brazilian regions kept for 30 days in artificial environmental rooms mimicking the current and extreme climate scenarios. Three Illumina MiSeq runs produced close to 120 million 500 bp paired-end reads; 191,139 contigs were assembled with N50 = 1595. 355 genes were differentially expressed for both populations in response to the extreme scenario. After enrichment analysis, each population presented a core set of genes to cope with climate change. Northern fish induced genes related to the cellular response to stress, activation of MAPK activity, response to unfolded protein, protein metabolism and cellular response to DNA damage stimuli. Genes biologically involved in regulating cell proliferation, protein stabilisation and protein ubiquitination for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system were downregulated. Genes associated with biological processes, including the cellular response to stress, MAPK cascade activation, homeostatic processes and positive regulation of immune responses were upregulated in southeastern fish. The downregulated genes were related to cytoskeleton organisation, energy metabolism, and the regulation of transcription and biological rhythms. Our findings reveal the signatures of promising candidate genes involved in the regional plasticity of each population of tambaqui in dealing with upcoming climate changes.

AB  - Squamate viviparity has evolved on several occasions, and probably independently within the genus Liolaemus itself. Hypotheses about the origin of reptilian viviparity emphasize the advantage of providing an adequate thermal environment for the embryo. At the same time, high latitudes and altitudes limit the availability of heat to perform vitellogenesis and gestation. The genus Liolaemus includes both oviparous and viviparous modes of reproduction, as well as reproductive cycles with great variations in the timing of the events. In the present work maximum juvenile size, sexual dimorphism, gonadal cycle and litter size of viviparous Liolaemus elongatus were studied. Female lizards may have annual or biennial cycles, but males reproduce annually in synchronization with the female cycle. Phenotypic plasticity may be one way that allows the species to cope with environmental constraints, and may be a reproductive adaptation that Liolaemus has evolved in response to the the cold climate in the highlands of southern South America.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) and ocean warming (OW) are predicted to drive changes to the distribution of species and the structure of biological communities globally. Differences in lifehistory, physical traits, and the phenotypic response of organisms will, however, mean that the effects of OA and OW will differ among species. Geographical differences in environmental characteristics across habitats will also influence the effects of OA and OW, thereby driving inter-population differences in phenotypic response as determined by local adaptations. While is it accepted that the response of species will vary globally, predicting the trends in response of species remains highly uncertain. We undertook a meta-analysis of key biological traits of 47 marine copepod species from 88 studies to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the effects of OA and OW on copepod population demographics. Data from OA and OW were analysed independently due to insufficient two-stressor studies. We found that the large disparity in the response of species to OA and OW is largely defined by their environmental history. Additionally, the response of copepod species to OW is related to their evolutionary history which has less influence on their response to OA. Therefore, our study identified that the response of copepods to OA is driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors in their habitats. Under OA alone, copepods from less variable environments may be more susceptible, but the effects of OA will only be strongly negative at extreme low pH (<7). On the other hand, the response to OW is deeply tied to their phylogeny, whereby closely related species share similar costs and trade-offs. However, the effects of near-future OW (+2 to 4 degrees C) seem mainly positive unless these temperatures exceed a species' thermal limit. Finally, our analysis revealed that OW has a greater influence on key copepod traits than OA. Overall, this study shows that attempting to draw global patterns in the response of species to climate change from a single species or habitat without consideration of environmental and evolutionary history could lead to inaccurate and misleading predictions with respect to the future of biological communities.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAccurate shelf-life dating of food products is crucial for consumers and industries. Therefore, in this study we applied a science-based approach for shelf-life assessment, including accelerated shelf-life testing (ASLT), acceptability testing and the screening of analytical attributes for fast shelf-life predictions. Shelf-stable strawberry juice was selected as a case study.
   RESULTSAmbient storage (20 degrees C) had no effect on the aroma-based acceptance of strawberry juice. The colour-based acceptability decreased during storage under ambient and accelerated (28-42 degrees C) conditions. The application of survival analysis showed that the colour-based shelf-life was reached in the early stages of storage (11weeks) and that the shelf-life was shortened at higher temperatures. None of the selected attributes (a(*) and E-* value, anthocyanin and ascorbic acid content) is an ideal analytical marker for shelf-life predictions in the investigated temperature range (20-42 degrees C). Nevertheless, an overall analytical cut-off value over the whole temperature range can be selected.
   CONCLUSIONSColour changes of strawberry juice during storage are shelf-life limiting. Combining ASLT with acceptability testing allowed to gain faster insight into the change in colour-based acceptability and to perform shelf-life predictions relying on scientific data. An analytical marker is a convenient tool for shelf-life predictions in the context of ASLT. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Pressure-driven membrane filtration is an essential part in the juice industry as a tool for clarification and concentration due to its low-temperature treatment, high selectivity, and lower energy consumption. However, membrane fouling compromises these benefits as fouling significantly reduces the membrane performance and durability, hence increasing the operating and maintenance costs. This paper reviews the recent advances related to membrane fouling in juice processing in the light of the growing interest towards sustainable processes characterized by high economic viability and low environmental impact. This review focuses on the characteristics of membrane fouling, factors affecting membrane fouling, and techniques used to mitigate membrane fouling. Future trends and challenges for the technology development to address membrane fouling in juice processing are also discussed.

AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the transcriptional response of four stress-related genes in three Oenococcus oeni strains after acclimation at two different temperatures. Gene expression was analyzed at time zero and after 48h acclimation at 18 and 21 degrees C. After the acclimation period cells were inoculated into sterile Pinot noir wine and MLF was followed for 25 days to investigate if different acclimation temperatures could influence cell survival and MLF performance. l-malic acid consumption, population survival, and transcriptional behavior were different upon the acclimation temperature. rmlB and hsp20 genes presented a considerable increase in their expression level when strains were acclimated at 18 degrees C particularly in the psychrotrophic strains UNQOe19 and UNQOe4 isolated from Patagonian Pinot noir wine in comparison with the control strain (ATCC 27310). The increase in rmlB and hsp20 expression could account for the better survival of these strains in Pinot noir in comparison with the control strain. In addition, Patagonian populations acclimated at 18 degrees C were able to consume a higher percentage of l-malic acid in comparison with cells acclimated at 21 degrees C. Our results suggest that gene expression analysis of cells acclimated at sub-optimal temperatures could benefit the selection of psychrotrophic strains aimed as starter cultures.

AB  - Beginning in the 19308, evolution became an experimental subject. New techniques, especially in Drosophila, made possible quantitative analysis Of natural populations. In addition to a large number of studies on many species, there were four major controversies that dominated much of the discussion and experimentation. Some of the arguments were quite heated. These controversies were: Wright vs Fisher Oil Wright's shifting-balance theory; dominance vs overdominance as an explanation of heterosis; the classical vs balance hypothesis for genetic variability; the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Curiously, most of these issues were not really resolved. Rather they were abandoned in favor of more tractable studies made possible by the new molecular methods.

AB  - Data on mean survival times for starvation tolerance and desiccation tolerance revealed significant differences for three Indian geographical populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana. The lack of differences between two successive generations of various isofemale lines of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana populations suggested that these physiological traits were genetically controlled. The north Indian populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana revealed significant higher desiccation tolerance while the southern populations revealed significantly higher survival tolerance. It can be argued that the south Indian populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana which lived in hot and humid environment throughout the year were poorly protected against desiccation but displayed higher starvation tolerance due to higher metabolic rate at increased ambient temperature. Thus, Indian geographical populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana revealed adaptively maintained genetic divergence for starvation and desiccation tolerance.

AB  - Global warming is killing corals; however, the effects of warming on population connectivity, a process fundamental to reef recovery, are largely unexplored. Using a high-resolution (as high as 200 m), empirically calibrated biophysical model of coral larval dispersal for the southern Great Barrier Reef, we show that the increased larval mortality and reduced competency duration under a 2 degrees C warming alter dispersal patterns, whereas projected changes in large-scale currents have limited effects. Overall, there was on average a 7% decrease in the distance larvae disperse (among-reef interquartile range (IQR), -10% to -4%), an 8% decrease in the number of connections into each reef (IQR, -11% to -3%) and a 20% increase in local retention (IQR, 0% to +49%). Collectively, these shifts imply that 2 degrees C of warming will reduce inter-reef connectivity, hampering recovery after disturbances and reducing the spread of warm-adapted genes. Such changes make protections more effective locally, but may require reducing spacing between protected areas.
   The authors develop a high-resolution model of coral larval dispersal for the southern Great Barrier Reef. They show that 2 degrees C of warming decreases larval dispersal distance and connectivity of reefs, hampering post-disturbance recovery and the potential spread of warm-adapted genes.

AB  - Detailed studies of the seasonal phenology and developmental biology of two eucalypt-feeding coreid species, Amorbus obscuricornis and Gelonus tasmanicus, were undertaken over three years in Tasmania. Both species are univoltine, their active season being from spring to autumn, with the adults being the overwintering stage. Adults of A. obscuricornis and G. tasmanicus emerge during spring to feed, mate and oviposit. Periods of peak copulatory activity and gravidity of females in both species correspond to times when the proportion of males to females is slightly male biased. Eggs of A. obscuricornis did not hatch at temperatures below 15 degrees C while the number of eggs of G. tasmanicus hatching at 13 degrees C remained high. The minimum developmental threshold temperature and number of degree-days (DD) required for hatching by eggs of A. obscuricornis and G. tasmanicus were estimated to be 11.8 and 10.8 degrees C and 147 and 136 DD, respectively. Embryonic developmental rates are considered to reflect differences in the evolved temperature preferences of each species. During spring and summer the nymphs develop through five instars to eclose in autumn just before overwintering. Second-instar mortality for both species was high, suggesting that the initiation of feeding may be a crucial developmental stage.

AB  - Insects inhabit extreme temperature environments and have evolved mechanisms to survive there. Small insects are especially susceptible to rapid changes in body temperature. Therefore, the rapid detection of environment and body temperature is important for their survival. Little, however, is known about the thermosensors that detect those temperatures. Using rapid thermosensitivity assays with temperature step gradients and a spatial learning paradigm (the heat-box) in which elevated temperature serves as the negative reinforcer, two thermosensors were identified and their behavioral functions assessed. A low-temperature thermosensor is located on the antenna, detects relatively low temperatures, and can detect spatial temperature gradients directly. Thus, the antennae can be used by Drosophila to quickly orient with respect to temperature cues. A high-temperature thermosensor of unknown location appears to have a roughly similar sensitivity to temperature differences as the low-temperature thermosensor (less than or equal to 3 degreesC) and is both necessary and sufficient for memory formation in the heat-box spatial learning paradigm. Therefore, the high-temperature thermosensor is important for remembering spatial positions in which dangerously high temperatures were encountered.

AB  - As a model for vertebrate long-term survival in oxygen-restricted environments, the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) can adapt at the biochemical level to survive in oxygen-free (anoxic) cold water ( < 10 degrees C). This impressive ability is enabled through a coordinated suppression of energy-expensive, nonessential, cell processes. This study explored the anoxia-responsive expression of several microRNA species (miR-1a, -133, -17, -107, -148a, -21, -103, -210, -20a, -365 and -29b) in adult turtles exposed to 5 h and 20 h anoxia (at 5 +/- 1 degrees C). Furthermore, since microRNA target binding is regularly defined only by microRNA-mRNA interactions at 37 degrees C, the possibility of unique low temperature-selective microRNA targeting interactions with mRNA was explored in this ectotherm. Approximately twice as many microRNA-mRNA interactions were predicted at 5 degrees C versus 37 degrees C with particular enrichment of mRNA targets involved in biological processes known to be part of the stress response. Hence, the results suggest that the influence of temperature should be considered for the prediction of microRNA targets (and their follow-up) in poikilothermic animals and that interacting effects of low body temperature and anoxia on microRNA expression could potentially be important to achieve the profound metabolic rate depression that characterizes turtle hibernation underwater during the winter.

AB  - Successful latitudinal expansions into temperate climates depend largely upon the evolution of novel adaptive traits or the presence of pre-adaptive or exapted mechanisms for survival in seasonal climates. Geographic comparisons of ancestral (pre-expansion) and derived (post-expansion) populations provide a useful framework for understanding the evolutionary conditions that facilitate geographic expansions. Using a common agricultural pest, the Colorado Potato Beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) as a model, we conducted a regional comparison of cold hardiness and overwintering success among ancestral (southern Mexico) and derived (Vermont and Kansas, USA) L. decemlineata populations. In order to determine if ancestral and derived beetle populations vary physiologically for cold hardiness, we compared supercooling points (SCPs) of three geographic populations of L. decemlineata. We also tested if ancestral and derived beetle populations differed in their overwintering behavior and success by performing an overwintering field experiment. Ancestral and derived populations did not express different physiological responses (i.e. SCPs) to freezing temperatures. However, ancestral and derived populations responded differently to the onset of winter conditions and displayed dissimilar overwintering behaviors. The majority of ancestral beetles failed to initiate diapause and dug upward within experimental mesocosms. Differences in overwintering behavior also resulted in significant variation in overwintering success as derived populations displayed higher overwintering survivorship when compared with ancestral populations. Given our results, it is evident that research exploring the interaction of the ecological factors and evolutionary processes is necessary to fully realize the dynamics of biological invasions.

AB  - Elevated plasma potassium levels (hyperkalemia), reduced plasma pH (acidosis), reduced blood oxygen content, and elevated temperatures are associated with species-specific rates of at-vessel and post-release mortality in elasmobranch fishes. The mechanism linking these physiological disturbances to mortality remains undetermined however, and we hypothesize that the proximate cause is reduced myocardial function. We measured changes in the functional properties of isolated ventricular myocardial strips from clearnose skate (Rostroraja eglanteria), smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), and sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) when subjected to the following stressors (both in isolation and in combination): hyperkalemia (7.4 mM K+), acidosis (from 7.9 to 7.1), and reduced oxygen (to 31% O-2 saturation) applied at temperatures 5 degrees C above and below holding temperatures. We selected these species based on phylogenetic distance, diverse routine activity levels, and their tolerance to capture and transport. Stressors had a few significant species-specific detrimental impacts on myocardial function (e.g., a 33-45% decrease in net force under acidosis + low O-2). Net force production of myocardial strips from clearnose skate and smooth dogfish approximately doubled following exposure to isoproterenol, demonstrating that these species possess beta-adrenergic receptors and that their stimulation could provide a mechanism for preservation of cardiac function during stress. Our results suggest that disruption of physiological homeostasis associated with capture may fatally impair cardiac function in some elasmobranch species, although research with more severe stressors is needed.

AB  - Phenolic compounds are validated to be the pharmacologically active phytochemicals in Cajanus cajan (Linn.) Millsp. leaves (CCLs) and the medicinal product (Tongluo Shenggu capsules, TSCs) thereof. For the first time, C. cajan cell suspension cultures (CCSCs) were established as an effective in vitro platform for the production of phenolic compounds. Callus was induced from C. cajan leaves by 2.0 mg/L 2,4-D, 5.0 mg/L alpha-NAA, and 0.1 mg/L Kn, and then subcultured on MS solid medium supplemented with 1.5 mg/L 2,4-D, 3.0 mg/L alpha-NAA, and 0.25 mg/L Kn. Culture conditions of a selected high-productive callus line (CCCL VII) were systematically optimized in terms of biomass productivity and phenolic yield, and eleven target compounds were identified and quantified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Under the optimal culture conditions (MS liquid medium, sucrose concentration 3.5 %, temperature 26 degrees C, inoculum size 3.0 %, and time 49 day), CCSCs produced the highest level of total phenolics (3462.99 mu g/g DW) along with the maximum biomass productivity (10.03 g/L), which was higher than the phenolic yield in field-grown CCLs (3288.81 mu g/g DW). Notably, CCSCs exhibited superiority in the content of the most valuable compound cajaninstilbene acid (2858.76 mu g/g DW) as compared with CCLs (2114.60 mu g/g DW). Also, CCSCs were discovered to be more abundant in genistin and genistein as against both CCLs and TSCs. This work concluded that CCSCs might be attractive alternative sources for the production of phenolic compounds with potential uses in pharmaceutical/nutraceutical industries.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The unique geography of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, USA has promoted a flora with exceptional endemism that may face high rates of extinction due to climate change. The Olympic Mountains provide an unparalleled opportunity to test predicted responses in topographically complex environments and inform conservation plans for threatened alpine taxa.
   METHODS: We estimated the potential impact of climate change for five endemic alpine plants of the Olympic Peninsula. We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to visualize changes in climate niche-space in the alpine zone and the exposure of the endemics to changing conditions. We then constructed climate and topographic-based Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to estimate changes in the distribution of habitat for each taxon.
   KEY RESULTS: The Olympic alpine zone will experience novel environmental conditions in the future, with a pronounced decrease in winter snow and an increase in growing-season moisture stress. When topography was taken into account, the losses were more dramatic than the impact of climate alone. Indeed, 85-99% of the suitable habitat will be lost for each of the five focal taxa by 2080, with thermal refugia remaining only on the highest peaks of the eastern Olympics.
   CONCLUSIONS:The Olympic alpine endemics are stranded on ever-shrinking habitat islands. Within a few, isolated thermal refugia, the distribution of micro-topography may be a critical factor in determining long-term survival.The Olympic Mountains and their alpine taxa are a model system for endemics worldwide, illustrating the biogeographic characteristics that underpin vulnerability to climate change.

AB  - We report the results of our three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulation of collapsing unmagnetized molecular cloud cores. We investigate the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disc and the clumps formed by disc fragmentation. Our simulation shows that disc fragmentation occurs in the early phase of circumstellar disc evolution and many clumps form. The clump can be represented by a polytrope sphere of index n similar to 3 and n greater than or similar to 4 at central temperature T-c less than or similar to 100 K and T-c greater than or similar to 100 K, respectively. We demonstrate, numerically and theoretically, that the maximum mass of the clump, beyond which it inevitably collapses, is similar to 0.03 M-circle dot. The entropy of the clump increases during its evolution, implying that evolution is chiefly determined by mass accretion from the disc rather than by radiative cooling. Although most of the clumps rapidly migrate inward and finally fall on to the protostar, a few clumps remain in the disc. The central density and temperature of the surviving clump rapidly increase and the clump undergoes a second collapse within 1000-2000 years after its formation. In our simulation, three second cores of masses 0.2 M-circle dot, 0.15 M-circle dot and 0.06 M-circle dot formed. These are protostars or brown dwarfs rather than protoplanets. For the clumps to survive as planetary-mass objects, the rapid mass accretion should be prevented by some mechanisms.

AB  - We examined the effects of acclimation temperature and two doses (2.5 and 25 mg kg(-1)) of a pyrogen (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) on behavioral thermoregulation in juvenile green iguanas. Overall means of body temperatures for the three-day trial periods were compared among three groups of animals acclimated at 15, 25, and 34 degreesC. The responses of each group of animals to the two dosages of LPS and a control saline injection were examined. Within each treatment block, animals either chose high body temperatures characteristic of a fever response or chose low body temperatures characteristic of a hypothermic response. Thermoregulation was influenced by interaction effects between and among, and independent effects of, acclimation temperature, dose of LPS, and day. In some treatment blocks, individual lizard mass positively correlated with mean individual body temperature. Mean mass of lizards that chose higher body temperatures within a treatment block was higher than the mean mass of lizards that chose lower body temperatures. From these results, we concluded that LPS may induce two different behavioral thermoregulatory responses: fever or hypothermia. The actual amplitude and direction of body temperature change appears to be affected by acclimation temperature and possibly by mass or energy reserves of the animal. If the energy reserves an not sufficient to sustain the higher rate of metabolism associated with the higher body temperatures of a hyperthermic or feverish state, the animal may resort to hypothermia.

AB  - We analyse the dynamical and thermal evolution of dark matter and the intracluster medium in hydrodynamical N-body simulations of galaxy clusters. Starting from a sample of 17 high-resolution objects, with virial mass ranging from 3 x 10(14) to 1.7 x 10(15) h(-1) M., we follow the build-up of the systems in dark matter and hot gas through the repeated merging of satellites along their merging history trees. We measure the self-bound mass fraction of subhaloes as a function of time after the merging, estimate the satellite mean orbital properties as a function of the mass ratio with the main cluster at merging time, and study the evolution of their internal velocity dispersion, gas temperature and entropy as the substructure is disrupted by various dynamical processes, eventually reaching thermodynamic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the main cluster. We model some relevant properties of subhalo orbits, as the time of the first pericentric and apocentric passages, and the typical distances and velocities at the corresponding times. This survival study can be used to interpret the dynamics of observed merging clusters; as an example, we apply our results to the system 1E0657-56. We show that, in the light of our results, the most likely interpretation of the data for this cluster points to the merger of a small group with mass M approximate to 1 x 10(13) h(-1) M. with a massive cluster with M approximate to 1.3 x 10(15) h(-1) M.

AB  - Physical and psychological stresses are widely accepted as triggers and / or modifiers of the clinical course of diverse gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. Growing experimental evidence from a variety of models such as immobilization, thermal injury or early maternal deprivation in laboratory animals uniformly supports the ability of stress to induce the development of gastric ulcers, altered gastrointestinal motility and ion secretion, and increased intestinal permeability leading to the passage of antigens to the lamina propria and bacterial translocation. Stress can also synergize with other pathogenic factors such as Helicobacter pylori, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or colitis-inducing chemicals to produce gastrointestinal disease. The brain-gut axis provides the anatomical basis through emotions and environmental influences modulate the gastrointestinal function through the regulation of gastrointestinal immune system and mucosal inflammation; in this sense, mucosal mast cells - at cellular level - and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) - at molecular level - seem to play a crucial role. On the other hand, an array of adaptive responses have been evolved in order to maintain the homeostasis and to ensure the survival of the individual. In the gut mucosa anti-inflammatory pathways counteract the deleterious effect of the stressful stimuli on the gastrointestinal homeostasis. In the present review we discuss the several experimental approaches used to mimic human stressful events or chronic stress in laboratory animals, the evidence of stress-induced gastrointestinal inflammation and dysfunction derived from them, and the involved cellular and molecular mechanisms that are being discovered during the last years.

AB  - Early-life-stage (ELS) toxicity tests were conducted to determine the effect of selected water temperatures on the toxicity of 4-nitrophenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). NOECs were determined for growth and mortality at selected time intervals and water temperatures of 7, 12, and 17-degrees-C. As tests progressed, NOECs leveled to constant time-independent values that were similar for tests at each temperature. In 4-nitrophenol tests, the time-independent NOEC values at 7, 12, and 17-degrees-C, respectively, were 1. 16, 1.20, and 1. 16 mg/L for growth and 3.40, 3.38, and 2.20 mg/L for mortality. For 2,4-dinitrophenol, time-independent NOEC values at 7, 12, and 17-degrees-C, respectively, were 1.07, 0.50, and 0.80 mg/L for growth and 1.30, 1.89, and 1.60 mg/L for mortality. Temperature did, however, affect the rate at which time-independent NOECs were reached. More time was required to reach time-independent NOECs as temperature decreased. For example, the time-independent NOEC in 4-nitrophenol tests at 17-degrees-C was reached in 14 d, whereas it required 42 d at 7-degrees-C. The effect of temperature on toxicity must be considered in hazard assessment protocols to assess risk accurately and protect aquatic organisms adequately. Chronic toxicity tests are necessary to assess risk because acute toxicity tests cannot provide the information necessary to predict the long-term effects of factors such as temperature in natural environments.

AB  - In this article, we study the possibility that Ceres has, or had in the past, a crust heavier than a pure or muddy ice mantle, in principle gravitationally unstable. Such a structure is not unusual in the Solar system: Callisto is an example. In this work, we test how the composition (i.e. the volumetric quantity of ice) and the size of the crust can affect its survival during thermo-physical evolution after differentiation. We have considered two different configurations: the first characterized by a dehydrated silicate core and a mantle made of pure ice, the second with a hydrated silicate core and a muddy mantle (ice with silicate impurities). In both cases, the crust is composed of a mixture of ice and silicates. These structures are constrained by a recent measurement of the mean density by Park et al. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which operates in such an unstable structure, could reverse all or part of the crust. The whole unstable crust (or part of it) can interact chemically with the underlying mantle and what is currently observed could be a partially/totally new crust. Our results suggest that, in the case of a pure ice mantle, the primordial crust has not survived until today, with a stability timespan always less than 3 Gyr. Conversely, in the case of a muddy mantle, with some 'favourable' conditions (low volumetric ice percentage in the crust and small crustal thickness), the primordial crust could be characterized by a stability timespan compatible with the lifetime of the Solar system.

AB  - Eastern forests of the US are valued both as a carbon sink and a wood resource. The amount of biomass that can be harvested sustainably from this biome for bioenergy without compromising the carbon sink is uncertain. Using past literature and previously validated models, we assessed four scenarios of biomass harvest in the eastern US: partial harvests of mixed hardwood forests, pine plantation management, short-rotation woody cropping systems, and forest residue removal. We also estimated the amount and location of abandoned agricultural lands in the eastern US that could be used for biomass production. Greater carbon storage was estimated to result from partial harvests and residue removals than from plantation management and short-rotation cropping. If woody feedstocks were cultivated with a combination of intensive management on abandoned lands and partial harvests of standing forest, we estimate that roughly 176 Tg biomass y(-1) (similar to 330,000 GWh or similar to 16 billion gallons of ethanol) could be produced sustainably from the temperate forest biome of the eastern US. This biomass could offset up to similar to 63 Tg C y(-1) that are emitted from fossil fuels used for heat and power generation while maintaining a terrestrial C sink of similar to 8 Tg C y(-1).

AB  - Driven by the search for high efficiency power generation with low CO2 emissions, several works in the last years investigated the integration of gas turbine cycles and high temperature fuel cells to arrange power plants with CO2 capture.
   One of the most promising configurations in a mid-term perspective relies on the use of Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) as "active CO2 concentrator" in natural gas combined cycles (NGCC). This work presents an assessment of the economic perspectives of the two most promising configurations, previously analyzed through detailed simulations carried out at Politecnico di Milano, discussing their potential for the long-term (2025+) technology portfolio of an electric utility.
   The fuel cell cathode side receives the gas turbine exhausts, in order to transfer CO2 from this stream to the anode side. While doing this, the MCFC requires about 20% of the total fuel input and contributes to the plant electric power output by a similar fraction. Downstream the MCFC is placed the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG); exhaust heat released to the cell effluents is recovered in the bottoming steam cycle.
   Two different approaches were considered for purification of the CO2-rich flow exiting the fuel cell anode: (i) a cryogenic process that separates CO2 from the residual combustible compounds, which are recycled back to the gas turbines, or (ii) an oxy-combustion of residual combustible species, followed by heat recovery, cooling and water separation by condensation. In all cases, purification yields a high purity CO2 stream, pumped to liquid form for storage.
   Both these plant configurations can capture up to 70-85% of CO2 with small or negligible efficiency penalties compared to a baseline NGCC while increasing remarkably the plant power output, thus yielding relevant advantages with respect to competitive CO2 capture technologies. Moreover, the relatively limited power output of the fuel cell section suggests a plausible mid-term feasibility of the proposed concept, by taking into account that largest existing MCFC plants built so far surpassed the 50 MWel size.
   After an introduction about MCFC technological status and economic outlook, this work analyzes the economic performances of the proposed plants in order to evaluate their economic viability, considering all plant components and adopting a detailed bottom-up approach to determine the component cost distribution and the total plant costs. The final effect on cost of electricity and CO2 capture cost are addressed, allowing to evidence whether and how this solution might be competitive in the future. It is shown that current MCFC costs do not allow an economic advantage with respect to 'traditional' carbon capture cycles (i.e., NGCC with ammines scrubbing); while the situation would change assuming more aggressive mid-term MCFC cost targets. The breakeven specific costs that MCFC should achieve to successfully compete on an economic basis results close to 1500 (sic)/kW(el) (in terms of Total Equipment Cost, TEC) for a cost of natural gas equal to 6.5 (sic)/GJ, increasing to 2000 (sic)e/kW(el) assuming NG cost of 9 (sic)/GJ.

AB  - The understanding of protein evolution depends on the ability to relate the impact of mutations on molecular traits to organismal fitness. Biological activity and robustness have been regarded as important features in shaping protein evolutionary landscapes. Conformational dynamics, which is essential for protein function, has received little attention in the context of evolutionary analyses. Here we employ NMR spectroscopy, the chief experimental tool to describe protein dynamics at atomic level in solution at room temperature, to study the intrinsic dynamic features of ametallo-beta-lactamase enzyme and three variants identified during a directed evolution experiment that led to an expanded substrate profile. We show that conformational dynamics in the catalytically relevant microsecond to millisecond timescale is optimized along the favored evolutionary trajectory. In addition, we observe that the effects of mutations on dynamics are epistatic. Mutation Gly262Ser introduces slow dynamics on several residues that surround the active site when introduced in the wild-type enzyme. Mutation Asn70Ser removes the slow dynamics observed for few residues of the wild-type enzyme, but increases the number of residues that undergo slow dynamics when introduced in the Gly262Ser mutant. These effects on dynamics correlate with the epistatic interaction between these two mutations on the bacterial phenotype. These findings indicate that conformational dynamics is an evolvable trait, and that proteins endowed with more dynamic active sites also display a larger potential for promoting evolution.

AB  - Herbicide-resistant weeds, especially those with resistance to multiple herbicides, represent a growing worldwide threat to agriculture and food security. Natural selection for resistant genotypes may act on standing genetic variation, or on a genetic and physiological background that is fundamentally altered because of stress responses to sublethal herbicide exposure. Stress-induced changes include DNA mutations, epigenetic alterations, transcriptional remodeling, and protein modifications, all of which can lead to herbicide resistance and a wide range of pleiotropic effects. Resistance selected in this manner is termed systemic acquired herbicide resistance, and the associated pleiotropic effects are manifested as a suite of constitutive transcriptional and post-translational changes related to biotic and abiotic stress adaptation, representing the evolutionary signature of selection. This phenotype is being investigated in two multiple herbicide-resistant populations of the hexaploid, self-pollinating weedy monocot Avena fatua that display such changes as well as constitutive reductions in certain heat shock proteins and their transcripts, which are well known as global regulators of diverse stress adaptation pathways. Herbicide-resistant populations of most weedy plant species exhibit pleiotropic effects, and their association with resistance genes presents a fertile area of investigation. This review proposes that more detailed studies of resistant A. fatua and other species through the lens of plant evolution under stress will inform improved resistant weed prevention and management strategies.

AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika causing major problems for public health, which requires new strategies for its control, like the use of entomopathogenic microorganisms. In this study, bacteria from various Amazonian environments were isolated and tested for their pathogenicity to A. aegypti larvae. Following thermal shock to select sporulated Bacillus spp., 77 bacterial strains were isolated. Molecular identification per 16S RNA sequences revealed that the assembled strains contained several species of the genus Bacillus and one species each of Brevibacillus, Klebsiella, Serratia, Achromobacter and Brevundimonas. Among the isolated Bacillus sp. strains, 19 showed larvicidal activity against A. aegypti. Two strains of Brevibacillus halotolerans also displayed larvicidal activity. For the first time, larvicidal activity against A. aegypti was identified for a strain of Brevibacillus halotolerans. Supernatant and pellet fractions of bacterial cultures were tested separately for larvicidal activities. Eight strains contained isolated fractions resulting in at least 50% mortality when tested at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. Further studies are needed to characterize the active larvicidal metabolites produced by these microorganisms and define their mechanisms of action.

AB  - Non-indigenous ascidians are of particular concern to aquaculture industry and, paradoxically, the activities associated with it represent an important way to translocate these species worldwide. In 2012 a non-indigenous ascidian was found covering the oyster crops in the Ebro Delta (Western Mediterranean). We have identified the ascidian genetically and morphologically as Didemnum vexillum Kott, 2002. This finding indicates that the species is currently expanding its distribution in the Mediterranean Sea, as it has recently been found in the eastern basin (Venice, Adriatic Sea). Introduced populations of D. vexillum are found in temperate and cold waters worldwide, and a successful establishment in the Mediterranean implies a remarkable capacity of adaptability to warm, subtropical conditions. We assessed the life cycle (growth and reproduction) of the ascidian at the studied site. The species has a marked seasonal cycle, with regression in the warmest months and reappearance during winter. In spring D. vexillum reaches its maximum abundance, followed by a peak in reproduction just before regression. This cycle is reversed with respect to the one observed in colder waters, highlighting a plastic biological cycle of this invader and an hitherto unknown ability to establish itself in warm waters. We also analysed the genetic structure of the population of the Ebro Delta and the one established in the Lagoon of Venice using COI sequence data. The low genetic diversity in our samples (three haplotypes) was consistent with what is observed in the introduced populations worldwide. It is likely that the ascidian was introduced with oyster stock from bivalve cultures in the Atlantic French coasts, where the same three haplotypes have been reported. The high boating activity in the Ebro Delta makes further human-mediated transport of the species highly likely, and nearby fishing grounds can be severely affected if invaded. It is urgent to implement measures to prevent the continuous expansion of this ascidian pest in the Mediterranean.

AB  - In many eutrophic lakes, ability to cope with filamentous cyanobacteria is crucial to Daphnia fitness, as the filaments can reduce food intake by interference with food-particle retention. Two basic mechanisms were proposed to explain food collection by Daphnia: mechanical sieving, in which filtering appendages act as sieves, and direct interception, in which appendages act as paddles and water does not pass through. As was recently suggested, both mechanisms may be active, and their relative importance is determined by the Reynolds number on filtering appendages. Mechanical sieving seems particularly sensitive to the interference from filamentous cyanobacteria, which can clog the meshes while passing through the filtering chamber. We therefore hypothesized that in the presence of filaments, Daphnia minimizes the interference with filtration by decreasing the Reynolds number on the filters and by thus reducing the relative importance of sieving. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responses of nine clones of the Daphnia longispina group to the presence of nontoxic, filamentous cyanobacteria. The presence of cyanobacteria triggered in Daphnia responses of both behavioral (descending to deep, cold waters) and morphological nature (decreased intersetal and intersetular distances in the filtering apparatus). Both responses led to a decrease in the Reynolds number on the filters. Moreover, the two responses were inversely correlated: individuals with larger meshes descended to colder strata than did those with smaller meshes. These modifications of phenotype are regarded as adaptive, since they allow for minimized filament-induced interference with the filtration process.

AB  - Two well-known proteins have been selected in order to produce bioplastics through injection molding: a soy protein isolate (SPI) and an egg white albumen concentrate (EW). Each of them has been thoroughly mixed with glycerol (40 wt %) and the blend then obtained have been characterized by means of rheological and thermomechanical techniques, which allowed the optimization of the processing moulding conditions (cylinder temperature, 60 degrees C-65 degrees C; mould temperature, 120 degrees C; post-injection pressure, 500-600 bars). Once bioplastics were obtained, their thermomechanical and tensile properties, as well as their water uptake capacity and transparency were evaluated. Bioplastics containing EW showed higher values in the elastic and loss moduli, E and E, from -30 degrees C to 130 degrees C, than the corresponding SPI bioplastic. However, they both showed qualitatively the same evolution with temperature, where E and E decreased up to a plateau at high temperatures. When examining their tensile and water uptake properties is found that SPI bioplastics are more ductile and present enhanced water uptake behavior over EW bioplastics, which on the other hand possess higher Young's modulus. SPI seems to provide tougher bioplastics, being an excellent option for potential superabsorbent applications, whereas EW would suit for those applications requiring higher mechanical properties.

AB  - Moisture sorption isotherms of chironji kernels were determined at 25, 35 and 45 degrees C over a water activity range of 0.11-0.93. Three sorption models i.e., Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Caurie were evaluated to find out their fitness to the sorption data. Thermodynamic properties of sorbed water were analyzed over the selected range of water activity and temperature. The result showed that the sorption isotherms reflected Type II BET sorption characteristics with a clear hysteresis at the temperatures. Of the three models, GAB and Caurie models were found superior predicting the sorption of chironji kernels over the entire range of water activity values. The monolayer moisture content values calculated by the best-fitted GAB and Caurie model for adsorption were 9.86 and 6.31%, 8.023 and 6.18%, 6.90 and 5.97% (db) and for desorption were 6.53 and 6.01%, 5.85 and 5.68%, 4.21 and 5.60% (db), respectively at 25, 35 and 45 degrees C. The value of isosteric heat decreased with increasing moisture content and approached the latent heat of pure water. Sorption entropy increased with increasing moisture content and decreased gradually with increase in moisture content. The spreading pressures, for both adsorption and desorption, increased with increasing water activity at the three selected temperatures.

AB  - Although high CO2 and warming could act interactively on marine phytoplankton, little is known about the molecular basis for this interaction on an evolutionary scale. Here we explored the adaptation to high CO2 in combination with warming in a model marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Whole-genome re-sequencing identifies, in comparison to populations grown under control conditions, a larger genetic diversity loss and a higher genetic differentiation in the populations adapted for 2 years to warming than in those adapted to high CO2. However, this diversity loss was less under high CO2 combined with warming, suggesting that the evolution driven by warming was constrained by high CO2. By integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and physiological data, we found that the underlying molecular basis for this constraint is associated with the expression of genes involved in some key metabolic pathways or biological processes, such as the glyoxylate pathway, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, and diel variability. Our results shed new light on the evolutionary responses of marine phytoplankton to multiple environmental changes in the context of global change and provide new insights into the molecular basis underpinning interactions among those multiple drivers.

AB  - Slab reheating is a very important step in steel product manufacturing. A small improvement in reheating efficiency can translate into big savings to steel mills in terms of fuel consumption and productivity. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been employed in conducting numerical simulations of the slab reheating furnace operation. However, a full industrial scale three-dimensional (3D) simulation of a slab reheating furnace, while comprehensive, is not an efficient way to conduct broad studies of the slab heating process. In this paper, a comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) numerical heat transfer model for slab reheating in a walking beam furnace was developed using the finite difference method. The 2D heat transfer model utilizes the heat transfer coefficients derived from a 3D reheating furnace CFD model which was validated by using mill instrumented slab trials. The 2D heat transfer model is capable of predicting slab temperature evolutions during the reheating processes based on the real time furnace conditions and steel physical properties.. The 2D model was validated by using mill instrumented slab trials and production data. Good agreement between the model predictions and production data was obtained.

AB  - Recent technological developments have facilitated intensified searches for genetic markers under selection in nonmodel species. Here, we present an approach for the identification of candidate gene variation in nonmodel organisms. We report on the characterization of 82 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and on the development of a specific genotyping assay for 30 SNPs in 18 candidate genes for growth and reproduction in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). These markers can be used for scanning natural populations for signatures of selection in both contemporary and archived historical samples, for example in retrospective studies assessing the effects of environmental changes, such as increasing temperatures, and selection imposed by high fishing pressure. Furthermore, these gene markers may be of interest to aquaculture, serving as a starting point for linking phenotypic traits important for productivity with genotypes and potentially be of use for marker-assisted selection in the future. This study demonstrates that the candidate gene approach is a valuable and targeted complement to the more random approach for discovering genetic variation in the genome and transcriptome applied through high throughput methods in nonmodel species.

AB  - Giant clams provide valuable functions to the coral reefs and traditional fisheries in the South China Sea (SCS), but many populations face escalating threats of overexploitation and habitat loss. To provide critical biodiversity data for development of protection and sustainable utilisation strategies, we examine the status of wild tridacnine population at Dongsha Atoll, the largest northernmost atoll of the SCS. This study also examines the genetic patterns of Tridacna maxima and Tridacna noae, based on partial mitochondrial COI gene sequences. We found four species at Dongsha Atoll with an overall density of 3.14 per 100 m(2). Over-harvesting may have depleted populations of T. squamosa and Hippopus hippopus, and they may no longer be reproductively viable. Populations of T. maxima and T. noae appear to be thriving and replenished by recruits, but species showed low levels of mitochondrial genetic diversity that could reduce its adaptability and may become further impacted by exploitation and global warming. Haplotype networks for T. maxima and T. noae showed strong significant population structuring consistent with contemporary geographic boundaries: Dongsha Atoll, Taiwan and Philippines-likely established by the intrusion of the Kuroshio Current. Given the contrasting species status and genetic diversity, conservation strategies need to be tailored to increase success of these efforts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The direct response of the tropical mixed layer to near-inertial waves (NIWs) has only rarely been observed. Here, we present upper-ocean turbulence data that provide evidence for a strongly elevated vertical diffusive heat flux across the base of the mixed layer in the presence of a NIW, thereby cooling the mixed layer at a rate of 244Wm(-2) over the 20h of continuous measurements. We investigate the seasonal cycle of strong NIW events and find that despite their local intermittent nature, they occur preferentially during boreal summer, presumably associated with the passage of atmospheric African Easterly Waves. We illustrate the impact of these rare but intense NIW induced mixing events on the mixed layer heat balance, highlight their contribution to the seasonal evolution of sea surface temperature, and discuss their potential impact on biological productivity in the tropical North Atlantic. How the tropical mixed layer of the ocean reacts to near-inertial waves has rarely been observed directly. Here, the authors present new data that shows strongly elevated vertical diffusive heat flux in the presence of near-inertial waves, causing a cooling of the mixed layer that is particularly strong in summer.

AB  - A major industrial problem in high-temperature liquid reaction systems is the attack of furnace components by chemically aggressive molten reactants. Freeze-lining technologies involving the deliberate formation of controlled frozen deposits are increasingly being applied to extend the range of liquid bath compositions and process temperatures that can be used; this has resulted in significant increases in process performance and productivity. It has been widely assumed that the interface between the stationary frozen layer and the agitated molten bath at steady state consists of the primary phase, which stays in contact with the bulk liquid at the liquidus temperature, T (liquidus). It has been shown in the current laboratory-based studies through the use of a cold finger technique that, at steady state and in selected ranges of process conditions and bath compositions, the phase assemblage present at the deposit/liquid interface is not that of the primary phase alone. The microstructural observations clearly demonstrate that the temperature of the deposit/liquid bath interface, T (f), can be lower than the liquidus temperature of the bulk liquid, T (liquidus). These observations point to a significant change in the mechanism and behavior of the systems. To explain this phenomenon, it is proposed that the steady-state thickness of freeze linings is not the result of equilibrium freezing but rather represents a state of dynamic equilibrium that is critically dependent on the relative rates of crystallization, mass, and heat transfer processes, occurring close to and at the deposit interface. The mechanisms taking place in the boundary liquid layer involve both partial crystallization/remelting and continuous removal of solids. This finding has important implications for the design of the high-temperature industrial reactors and selection of ranges of melt chemistries and conditions that can be used. This finding means that temperatures below the liquidus can be selected for some processes, resulting potentially in significant savings of energy and increases in throughput of pyrometallurgical reactors. The findings are generic and are not limited to the specific chemical systems reported in the article.

AB  - The hardness of zirconium oxide-based ceramic nanocomposites was correlated with the laser spectroscopic studies by analyzing the samples through nanosecond and femtosecond laser to see the viability of this technique as a fast and in situ for assessment of mechanical properties in nuclear industry. Zirconia incorporated with different vol% of multiwall carbon nanotubes were processed by the high frequency induction heated sintering. The composites were characterized by the nanosecond laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) with optimized delay time of 1, 2, and 3 mu s and 200 and 300 mJ energies generated by laser Nd:YAG (lambda = 1064 nm). The plasma temperature resulted by the ablation of different samples was estimated through intensity of selected zirconium lines using the Boltzmann plot method. The samples were mechanically characterized by the Vickers hardness test. The estimated plasma temperature and the ratio of Zr(II) with different intensities of Zr(I) emission lines show rather weak dependency and increase with surface hardness. The samples were scrutinized by the femtosecond laser micromachining through variation in depth and surface morphology of machined areas. It is found that deeper circular groove and enhanced erosion of disk shape by femtosecond laser machining are achieved for less hard materials and are in agreement with the LIBS analysis.

AB  - Past acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems on Mars have promise in their ability to have hosted life for billions of years. One method for analyzing these systems is to study analog environments on Earth. To assess the astrobiological potential of Martian acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems, the crater lake of the active Poas Volcano, Laguna Caliente, was sampled in 2013 and 2017. Laguna Caliente presents an extremely dynamic terrestrial environment with near-ambient to boiling temperatures, pH fluctuations from -0.87 to 1.5, a wide range of chemistries and redox potential, and frequent phreatic-to-phreatomagmatic eruptions. Samples of lake fluid, sulfur clumps, and lake bottom sediment underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic "shotgun" sequencing, which revealed this lake hosts an extremely low biodiversity of microorganisms dominated by Acidiphilium spp. Shotgun metagenomics of the samples suggests this community has numerous genetic adaptations that confer survival, including functional pathways to reduce the effects of toxic metals and numerous metabolic pathways utilizing a variety of simple and complex sugar molecules. The identification of these various metabolic pathways suggests adaptations related to carbon limited environments, fulfillment of high energy requirements, and survival in a hostile volcanic setting. The perseverance of life in Laguna Caliente indicates life on Mars could have thrived in analogous environments, stressing the need for the search for life in relict Martian acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems.

AB  - California grunion Leuresthes tenuis synchronize spawning with tidal cycles, so the embryos incubate in a terrestrial environment, delay hatching until cued by a specific environmental trigger, and may extend incubation for up to an additional four weeks. These adaptations, however, do not appear to alter the morphology or sequence of early developmental stages as compared to other Atherinomorph fishes in the Orders Beloniformes and Cyprinodontiformes. Embryonic development is described in a series of 30 stages based on morphology observed by light microscopy. Stages are placed in five periods: zygote and cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation and organogenesis, and hatching competence. Embryos from a southern population of L. tenuis in Los Angeles are compared with embryos found > 560 km north in San Francisco Bay. Northern L. tenuis embryos developed more slowly at several stages than southern embryos and reached hatching competence later, but both locations maintained synchrony with the tidal cycle for both spawning and hatching. The variation in rates of development and stage at hatching readiness are forms of developmental heterochrony that may be associated with evolutionary adaptation or morphological plasticity within this highly successful clade.

AB  - Vegetation is a key to improving and protecting a new tropical coral island terrestrial ecosystem. Because of their superior ability in adapting poor soil structure and fertility, conserving soil and water and improving the living environment, warm-season turfgrass are considered as important pioneer plants and frequently applied in vegetation construction on tropical coral islands. However, few studies had evaluated the growth of these turfgrass and how these turfgrass influence the soil microbial communities on tropical coral islands. In this study, we conducted a greenhouse experiment and assessed the performance, soil properties and rhizosphere bacterial communities of five typical warm-season turfgrasses species (i.e., Paspalum vaginatium, Paspalum notatum, Cynodon dactylon, Zoysia tenuifolia, and Stenotaphrum helferi) grown on tropical coral sand. Results showed that C. dactylon was superior in the adaptability and turf performance among the studied species, with a turf establishment time of 34 days and a turf quality score of 6.83. Richness of bacterial species and nitrifying bacteria in its rhizosphere soil planted with C. dactylon were also much higher than with other species. The speed of turf establishment was positively correlated with rhizosphere soil bacterial species richness. Our findings indicated that C. dactylon could be a potentially suitable candidate species for vegetation restoration and soil bacterial community conservation on tropical coral islands.

AB  - Many moths finish their long distance migration after consecutive nights, but little is known about migration duration and distance. This information is key to predicting migration pathways and understanding their evolution. Tethered flight experiments have shown that ovarian development of rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis [Guenee]) moths was accelerated and synchronized by flight in the first three nights, whereby most females were then matured for mating and reproduction. Thus, it was supposed that this moth might fly three nights to complete its migration. To test this hypothesis, 9 year's field data for C. medinalis was collected from Nanning, Guangxi Autonomous Region in China. Forward trajectories indicated that most moths arrived at suitable breeding areas after three nights' flight. Thus, for C. medinalis this migration duration and distance was a reasonable adaptation to the geographic distribution of suitable habitat. The development of female moth ovaries after three consecutive night flights appears to be a well-balanced survival strategy for this species to strike between migration and reproduction benefits. Hence, an optimum solution of migration-reproduction trade-offs in energy allocation evolved in response to the natural selection on migration route and physiological traits.

AB  - This review examines the current literature on the effects of future emissions and climate change on particulate matter (PM) and O-3 air quality and on the consequent health impacts, with a focus on Europe. There is considerable literature on the effects of climate change on O-3 but fewer studies on the effects of climate change on PM concentrations. Under the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th assessment report (AR5) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), background O-3 entering Europe is expected to decrease under most scenarios due to higher water vapour concentrations in a warmer climate. However, under the extreme pathway RCP8.5 higher (more than double) methane (CH4) abundances lead to increases in background O-3 that offset the O-3 decrease due to climate change especially for the 2100 period. Regionally, in polluted areas with high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), elevated surface temperatures and humidities yield increases in surface O-3 - termed the O-3 climate penalty - especially in southern Europe. The O-3 response is larger for metrics that represent the higher end of the O-3 distribution, such as daily maximum O-3. Future changes in PM concentrations due to climate change are much less certain, although several recent studies also suggest a PM climate penalty due to high temperatures and humidity and reduced precipitation in northern mid-latitude land regions in 2100.
   A larger number of studies have examined both future climate and emissions changes under the RCP scenarios. Under these pathways the impact of emission changes on air quality out to the 2050s will be larger than that due to climate change, because of large reductions in emissions of O-3 and PM pollutant precursor emissions and the more limited climate change response itself. Climate change will also affect climate extreme events such as heatwaves. Air pollution episodes are associated with stagnation events and sometimes heat waves. Air quality during the 2003 heatwave over Europe has been examined in numerous studies and mechanisms for enhancing O-3 have been identified.
   There are few studies on health effects associated with climate change impacts alone on air quality, but these report higher O-3-related health burdens in polluted populated regions and greater PM2.5 health burdens in these emission regions. Studies that examine the combined impacts of climate change and anthropogenic emissions change under the RCP scenarios report reductions in global and European premature O-3-respiratory related and PM mortalities arising from the large decreases in precursor emissions. Under RCP 8.5 the large increase in CH4 leads to global and European excess O-3-respiratory related mortalities in 2100. For future health effects, besides uncertainty in future O-3 and particularly PM concentrations, there is also uncertainty in risk estimates such as effect modification by temperature on pollutant-response relationships and potential future adaptation that would alter exposure risk.

AB  - Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide has resulted in scientific projections of changes in global temperatures, climate in general, and surface seawater chemistry. Although the consequences to ecosystems and communities of metazoans are only beginning to be revealed, a key to forecasting expected changes in animal communities is an understanding of species' vulnerability to a changing environment. For example, environmental stressors may affect a particular species by driving that organism outside a tolerance window, by altering the costs of metabolic processes under the new conditions, or by changing patterns of development and reproduction. Implicit in all these examples is the foundational understanding of physiological mechanisms and how a particular environmental driver (e.g., temperature and ocean acidification) will be transduced through the animal to alter tolerances and performance. In this review, we highlight examples of mechanisms, focusing on those underlying physiological plasticity, that operate in contemporary organisms as a means to consider physiological responses that are available to organisms in the future.

AB  - Chill tolerance plays a crucial role that allows insect species to adapt to cold environments. Two Chinese geographical populations (Laibin and Yangzhou populations) were selected to understand the chill resistance and evolutionary potential in the Ophraella communa, a biological control agent of the invasive common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia. Super-cooling point assays, knockdown tests under static low-temperature conditions and determination of glycerol content were studied. ANOVAs indicated significant differences regarding chill coma recovery time, super-cooling point, and glycerol content across populations and sexes. The narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) estimates of cold resistance based on a parental half-sibling breeding design ranged from 0.39 to 0.53, and the h(2) value was significantly higher in the Yangzhou population than in the Laibin population. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero for cold tolerance. The Yangzhou population of O. communa has a strong capability to quickly gain resistance to cold. We conclude that the O. communa beetle has a plasticity that can provide cold resistance in the changing climate conditions.

AB  - Todays, many optimisation approaches have been explored by many researchers to find the appropriate processing parameters setting for the injection moulding process. From the previous researches, it was reported that the optimisation work has improved the moulded part quality. In this study, the application of optimisation work to improve warpage of the front panel housing have been explored. By selecting cooling time, coolant temperature, packing pressure and melt temperature as the variable parameters, design of experiment (DOE) have been constructed by using the rotatable central composite design (CCD) approach. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was performed to obtain the mathematical model. This mathematical model then will be used in Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation method as a fitness function to determine the appropriate processing parameters setting which will optimise the warpage condition. Based on the results, Coolant temperature give the most significant contribution to the warpage condition and warpage have optimised by 40.5% after optimisation. The finding shows that the application of optimisation work offers the best quality of moulded part produced.

AB  - Superheated steam (SHS), produced by the addition of heat to saturated steam (SS) at the same pressure, has great advantages over conventional heat sterilization due to its high temperature and accelerated drying rate. We previously demonstrated that treatment with SHS at 200 degrees C for 10 sec inactivated Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes biofilm cells on the surface of stainless steel to below the detection limit. However, bacteria withstanding heat stress become more resistant to other stress conditions, and may be more virulent when consumed by a host. Herein, we studied the transcriptional regulation of genes important for stress resistance and virulence in Salmonella biofilms after SHS treatments. Genes encoding heat shock proteins and general stress resistance proteins showed transcriptional surges after 1 sec of SHS treatment at 200 degrees C, with parallel induction of stress-related regulator genes including rpoE, rpoS, and rpoH, Interestingly, Salmonella biofilm cells exposed to SHS showed decreased transcription of flagella and Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1) genes required for motility and invasion of host cells, respectively, whereas increased transcription of SPI-2 genes, important for bacterial survival and replication inside host cells, was detected. When the transcriptional response was compared between cells treated with SHS (200 degrees C) and SS (100 degrees C), SHS caused immediate changes in gene expression by shorter treatments. Understanding the status of Salmonella virulence and stress resistance induced by SHS treatments is important for wider application of SHS in controlling Salmonella biofilm formation during food production.

AB  - The distribution of soil invertebrates from different taxa and the adaptive potential of all three cold hardiness strategies in the cold climate of northeastern Asia are analyzed. The correlation between the resistance to low temperatures and the overwintering conditions in habitats of some species is studied. The mechanisms and degree of cold hardiness are shown generally to be unrelated to the taxonomic proximity. The effect of the resistance to low wintering temperatures on the habitat distribution and faunogenesis of soil invertebrates in permafrost regions is discussed.

AB  - In temperate regions low temperatures seem to be the most restrictive factor for survival of Drosophila natural populations, which depends on the capacity of one or more developmental stages to resist unfavourable winter conditions. In this study we have attempted to answer the question of how D. melanogaster overwinters under natural temperature conditions. Only adults overwintered and no diapause was observed in any developmental stage. Thus, developmental duration becomes a decisive component with respect to overwintering potential and, therefore, the preadult stages are unlikely to overwinter. Possible evolutionary steps in adaptation to cold regions are discussed.

AB  - IntroductionKangaroo mother care (KMC) is among the most cost-effective and easily accessible solutions for improving the survival and wellbeing of small newborns. In this study, we examined the barriers and facilitators to continuity of KMC at home following hospital discharge in rural Uganda. MethodsWe conducted this study in five districts in east-central Uganda, within six hospitals and at the community level. We used a qualitative approach, with two phases of data collection. Phase 1 comprised in-depth interviews with mothers who practiced KMC with their babies and caretakers who supported them and key informant interviews with health workers, district health office staff, community health workers, and traditional birth attendants. We then conducted group discussions with mothers of small newborns and their caretakers. We held 65 interviews and five group discussions with 133 respondents in total and used a thematic approach to data analysis. ResultsIn hospital, mothers were sensitized and taught KMC. They were expected to continue practicing it at home with regular returns to the hospital post-discharge. However, mothers practiced KMC for a shorter time at home than in the hospital. Reasons included being overburdened with competing domestic chores that did not allow time for KMC and a lack of community follow-up support by health workers. There were increased psycho-social challenges for mothers, alongside some dangerous practices like placing plastic cans of hot water near the baby to provide warmth. Respondents suggested various ways to improve the KMC experience at home, including the development of a peer-to-peer intervention led by mothers who had successfully done KMC and community follow-up of mothers by qualified health workers and community health workers. ConclusionDespite wide acceptance of KMC by health workers, challenges to effective implementation persist. Amid the global and national push to scale up KMC, potential difficulties to its adherence post-discharge in a rural, resource-limited setting remain. This study provides insights on KMC implementation and sustainability from the perspectives of key stakeholders, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to KMC that incorporates its adaptability to community settings and contexts.

AB  - In a study aiming to assess bacterial evolution in complex growth media, we evaluated the long-term adaptive response of Escherichia coli MC1000 in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Seven parallel populations were founded and followed over 150 days in sequential batch cultures under three different oxygen conditions (defined environments), and 19 evolved forms were isolated. The emergence of forms with enhanced fitness was evident in competition experiments of all evolved forms versus the ancestral strain. The evolved forms were then subjected to phenotypic and genomic analyses relative to the ancestor. Profound changes were found in their phenotypes as well as whole-genome sequences. Interestingly, considerable heterogeneity was found at the intrapopulational level. However, consistently occurring parallel adaptive responses were found across all populations. The evolved forms all contained a mutation in galR, a repressor of the galactose operon. Concomitantly, the new forms revealed enhanced growth on galactose as well as galactose-containing disaccharides. This response was likely driven by the LB medium.

AB  - Biomass of high-yielding strains of phototrophic microorganisms actively accumulating lipids is a promising non-traditional raw material for bioenergy including the production of biodiesel. In this study, we present results of searching for new strains of microalgae-producers of lipids from hot springs. Within the framework of research, the primary screening of water for the presence of lipid - accumulative microalgae was carried out with the help of qualitative reaction with lipid-specific dyes, as well as 5 axenic isolates of microalgae with stable growth were identified in the laboratory and their productivity and fatty acid composition were studied. The isolated strains were identified as Chlorella vulgaris sp-1, Ankistrodesmus sp-21, Scenedesmus obliquus sp-21, Chlorella pyrenoidosa sp-13 and Chlamydomonas sp-22. The obtained data showed that the isolated strains determined by biomass in the range 1.3 g/l to 1.81 g/l. As a result of the research, it was established that the highest content of lipids was observed in the strains Chlorella vulgaris sp-1 and Scenedesmus obliquus sp-21, which is 28.7 and 29.8% of the cell dry weight, respectively. The analysis of the fatty acid composition of the cells showed that the largest mass fraction of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids was found in strain Scenedesmus obliquus sp-21 - 61.9%. In the result, Scenedesmus obliquus sp-21 strain isolated from thermal sources was selected as a promising candidate for biodiesel production. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Climate-change global warming and changes in precipitation-will cause changes in tree growth rates, mortality rates, the distribution of tree species, competition, and species interactions. An implicit assumption in FVS is that site quality will remain the same as it was during the time period observations used to calibrate the component models were made and that the site quality will not be affected by climate change. This paper presents evidence of the impacts of climate change on forests and argues that FVS needs to be revised to account for these changes. The changes include modification of the growth, mortality, and regeneration establishment models, all of which need to account for changes in site quality and genetic adaptation. Criteria for modifying the model recognize that the model's applications and uses will not diminish and need to be supported. The new process, climate change, needs to be recognized by the model because it influences all of the processes FVS currently represents. Plans are being made to address this major task.

AB  - Cuvier's and Sowerby's beaked whales occur year-round in western Irish waters, yet remain some of the most poorly understood cetaceans in the area. Considering the importance of the area for anthropogenic activities and the sensitivity of beaked whales to noise, understanding their ecology is essential to minimise potential overlaps. To this end, fixed bottom-mounted autonomous acoustic recorders were deployed at 10 stations over four recording periods spanning from May 2015 to November 2016. Acoustic data were collected over 1934 cumulative days, for a total of 7942 h of recordings. To model the probability of presence of Cuvier's and Sowerby's beaked whales in the area as a function of oceanographic predictors, we used Generalised Additive Models, fitted with Generalised Estimating Equations to deal with temporal autocorrelation. To reflect prey availability, oceanographic variables acting as proxies of primary productivity and prey aggregation processes such as upwelling events and thermal fronts were selected. Our results demonstrated that oceanographic variables significantly contributed to the occurrence of Cuvier's and Sowerby's beaked whales (p-values between < 0.001 and < 0.05). The species showed similar preferences, with the exception of sdSST. The inclusion of a parameter accounting for the recorders location confirmed the existence of a latitudinal partitioning for those species in the area. This study provides a point of comparison for future research and represents an important step towards a better understanding of those elusive species.</p>

AB  - Feedback between life and its environment is ubiquitous but the strength of coupling and its global implications remain hotly debated. Abrupt changes in the abundance of life for small changes in forcing provide one indicator of regulation, for example, when vegetation-climate feedback collapses in the formation of a desert. Here we use a two-dimensional "Daisyworld" model with curvature to show that catastrophic collapse of life under gradual forcing provides a testable indicator of environmental feedback. When solar luminosity increases to a critical value, a desert forms across a wide band of the planet. The scale of collapse depends on the strength of feedback. The efficiency of temperature regulation is limited by mutation rate in an analogous manner to the limitation of adaptive fitness in evolutionary theories. The final state of the system emerging from single-site rules can be described by two global quantities: optimization of temperature regulation and maximization of diversity, which are mathematically analogous to energy and entropy in thermodynamics.

AB  - Edible lamb fat is an illustrious frying fat due to its good flavor and stability to oxidation. Fat deodorization is a vacuum-steam distillation process that is accomplished for removing the unwanted components such as free fatty acids and volatile compounds. The present work has studied the kinetics of lamb fat deodorization under different temperatures in a batch deodorization system. Variations of acid value (AV), peroxide value, p-Anisidine value, TOTOX value and total color difference were measured during the deodorization process. The Logarithmic, Wang and Singh, Henon et al., and linear models were fitted with obtained data using nonlinear regression method. Results indicated that the Logarithmic and Henon et al. models gave the best fitness respectively with AV and p-Anisidine value, based on the statistical criteria of correlation coefficient (R-2), reduced chi-square (chi(2)) and root mean square error (RMSE). Furthermore, the linear model was selected as the best model to describe the variations of TOTOX value and peroxide value during the deodorization process.

AB  - The role of phenotypic plasticity in the acclimation and adaptive potential of an organism to global change is not currently accounted for in prediction models. The high plasticity of marine fishes is mainly attributed to their early stages, during which morphological, structural and behavioural 'functions are particularly sensitive to environmental constraints. This developmental plasticity can determine later physiological performances and fitness, and may further affect population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. This review asks the essential question of what role early stages play in the ability of fish to later cope with the effects of global change, considering three key environmental factors (temperature, hypoxia and acidification). After having identified the carry-over effects of early exposure reported in the literature, we propose areas that we believe warrant the most urgent attention for further research to better understand the role of developmental plasticity in the responses of marine organisms to global change.

AB  - Many symbioses between bacteria and insects resulted from ancient infections followed by strict vertical transmission within host lineages. The strong bottlenecks under which this transmission occurs promote the neutral fixation of slightly deleterious mutations by genetic drift. As predicted by Muller's ratchet, this fixation will drive endosymbiotic bacteria through an irreversible dynamics of fitness loss. The chaperonin GroEL has been proposed as a compensatory mechanism whereby endosymbiotic bacteria of aphids persist. Here, we show that endosymbiotic bacteria of insects from two phylogenetically very distant bacterial phyla have fixed amino acid substitutions by positive selection in functionally important GroEL regions involved in either GroES/peptide binding or in the en bloc movement of the GroEL apical domain. These results, together with the high levels of constitutive expression of GroEL in these endosymbionts, provide valuable insights into the evolution of a molecular mechanism responsible for the maintenance of the symbiotic lifestyle.

AB  - The illumination environment is extremely important to the visual-related operation/interface design, due to its great effect on visual operation. Therefore, the influence of illumination environment factors, such as illumination and color temperature, on visual operation needs to be investigated deeply. In this study, five illumination environment levels, combined by illumination and color temperature, were selected to carry out ergonomic experiments. The screen brightness of high, medium and low was set, and the internal experiment of two-factor subjects was conducted based on the visual search task. Behavioral performance data and subjective evaluation data of 16 subjects were collected and analyzed. The results show that, in terms of response time, correct rate, and subjective evaluation, the main effects of illumination and screen brightness are significant.

AB  - Recently we proposed a simple statistical-mechanical model of interacting spins for studying evolutional process in biological system In our model, a configuration of spins and their interactions J represent a phenotype and genotype, respectively. The phenotype dynamics are given by a stochastic process with temperature T(S) under a fixed Hamiltonian with J Meanwhile, the evolution of J is also stochastic with temperature T(J) and follows mutations introduced into J and selection based on a fitness given by equilibrium spin configurations of a given set of target spins Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that frustration around the target spins is strongly suppressed for the interactions J evolved in the intermediate T(S) temperature region. The evolved J's give the funnel-like dynamics and show robustness to mutations. This model can be regarded as an extension of partial annealing model, in which the interactions between spins are dynamical variables with characteristic time scale widely separated from that of the spins We also discuss the partially annealed Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model by particularly paying attention to the frustration.

AB  - Question: Sampling biases influence the estimation of sex ratio in species with environmental sex determination (ESD). Are these biases the sole reason for the apparent sex ratio in such species?
   Methods: Over a 6-year period, we studied maturing painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) through mark and recapture in a complex of ponds in northern Virginia. To avoid the biases associated with the measurement of primary and adult sex ratios, we monitored individuals over multiple years and measured sex-specific capture and survival rates.
   Results: We observed a significant female bias that cannot be attributed to climatic variance or differential survival, capture, or age at maturity.
   Conclusions: The observed female bias cannot be explained by existing evolutionary models and is consistent with a lag in evolutionary response to the loss of male-producing environments resulting from human influences on vegetation cover.

AB  - The proportions of aggregated N substitutional defects, platelet intensities, and bulk N contents have been quantitatively determined in type Ia diamonds from the Argyle and Ellendale olivine lamproite pipes (Kimberley block of northwest Australia) and alluvial deposits in western and central Kalimantan (Indonesia) and Copeton (eastern Australia) using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy.
   The extent of conversion of A defects (a pair of substitutional N atoms) to the aggregated B form is a function of the temperature history, mantle residence time (t(MR)), and N concentration of diamond.  We have used Argyle eclogitic diamonds, which have well-constrained equilibration temperatures (average almost-equal-to 1255-degrees-C) and short mantle residency (0.4 Ga), together with experimental data to refine the values of the activation energy (E(a)) and Arrhenius constant (A) for the A --> B reaction.  We obtain E(a)/R = 8.16 +/- 0.13 x 10(4) K (E(a) = 7.03 eV) and ln(A/atomic ppm-1 s-1) = 13.51.  Kinetic modeling shows that the reaction is sensitive to time-averaged temperatures (designated T(NA)) in the range 1050-1300-degrees-C and that such temperatures are not necessarily equivalent to those determined by silicate inclusion geothermometry.
   The results show that the Ellendale eclogitic diamonds were resident in cool lithosphere and have not experienced the higher temperatures typical of Argyle diamonds.  Constraints from inclusion geothermometry indicate that Ellendale eclogitic diamonds must be younger than Argyle diamonds, and a Phanerozoic age is suggested.  Copeton diamonds comprise a yellow high-N group (> 500 ppm N) and a colorless low-N group (< 400 ppm N).  They are constrained to a series of moderate temperature isotherms (T(NA) almost-equal-to 1070-1145-degrees-C, for t(MR) = 1.6 Ga) and have an extent of N-defect conversion consistent with long-term mantle storage.  Remarkably, some of the Kalimantan alluvial and Ellendale peridotitic diamonds lie on the tightly constrained highest temperature (1145-degrees-C) Copeton isotherm, suggesting these diamonds may have had a common origin in ancient Gondwanaland lithosphere that has been dispersed by more recent tectonic processes.  A case is made for diamond survival in remnant subcontinental lithosphere underlying southeast Asian and eastern Australian microcontinental blocks that separated from the northeastern Gondwanaland margin during the Paleozoic.
   Inasmuch as the N-defect characteristics of diamond reflect a unique mantle thermal history, they may prove useful in provenance studies of alluvial diamonds, in paleotectonic reconstructions, and in deducing the thermal evolution of subcontinental lithosphere, when combined with data from inclusion and xenolith geothermometry.

AB  - Important findings from the second decade of the 21st century on the impact of environmental change on biological processes in the Antarctic were synthesised by 26 international experts. Ten key messages emerged that have stakeholder-relevance and/or a high impact for the scientific community. They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi) adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the degree of 'scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to global biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - In laboratory tests, young Chelydra serpentina and Trachemys scripta altered their distribution in the presence of a temperature gradient, Selection of temperatures in the gradient for hatchlings and yearlings showed that body temperatures (T(b)s) of C. serpentina were lower than T. scripta,but the difference was insignificant. Relatively low TbS could allow greater activity range and reduced metabolic maintenance cost for C. serpentina, which seldom leaves water. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Using a well-adapted Drosophila subobscura population (Avala, Serbia), a drastic experiment of inbreeding was carried out to assess whether the expected level of homozygosity could be reached or if other evolutionary forces affected the process. In general, no significant changes of inversion (or arrangement) frequencies were detected after 12 brother-sister mating generations. Furthermore, no significant differences were obtained between observed and expected (under the inbreeding model) karyotypic frequencies. Thus, these results seemed to indicate that the main evolutionary factor in the experiment was inbreeding. However, in the G(12) generation, complete chromosomal fixation was reached only in two out of the eight final inbred lines. In these lines, the chromosomal compositions were difficult to interpret, but they could be likely a consequence of adaptation to particular laboratory conditions (constant 18 degrees C, food, light period, etc.). Finally, in a second experiment, the inbred lines presented higher fertility at 18 degrees C than at 13 degrees C. Also, there was a significant line effect on fertility: inbred line number 6 (A(1), J(1), U(1) under bar+(2) under bar; U(1) under bar+(2) under bar+(6) under bar, E-8, and O (3) under bar (+(4) under bar+(7) under bar)) presented the highest values, which maybe the result of an adaptation to laboratory conditions. Thus, the results obtained in our experiments reflect the adaptive potential of D. subobscura inversions.

AB  - Analysis of the Windermere (England), Perca fluviatilis (1965-1997) and Esox lucius (1943-1997) fishery data indicates there have been substantial changes in sex ratios through time. In the case of perch, a 1976 perch disease outbreak substantially skewed the sex ratio in favor of females. It took over a decade for the fishery to recover to its pre-1976 state. In the case of pike, both catch and year-class data are female biased, but this bias has significantly weakened through time. This trend towards proportionately more males through time may reflect an effect of increasing spring temperatures or an evolutionary or phenotypic response to female-biased fishing pressure.

AB  - The oceans are absorbing additional carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and projected future CO2 levels and ocean acidification could have negative implications for many marine organisms, especially during early life stages. Cephalopods are ecologically important in marine ecosystems, yet the potential effects of increased partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in seawater on cephalopod reproduction and embryonic development are little studied. We allowed adult two-toned pygmy squid (Idiosepius pygmaeus) to breed in ambient control (similar to 445 mu atm; similar to 8.05 pH(T)) or elevated pCO(2) conditions (similar to 940 mu atm; similar to 7.78 pH(T)) and compared reproductive traits in adults and developmental characteristics of their eggs, which remained in control or elevated pCO(2) treatments until hatching. Breeding pairs at elevated pCO(2) produced clutches with 40% fewer eggs, vitelli that were 14% smaller directly after spawning, embryos that were 5% smaller upon hatching, and eggs with an 8% increase in late-stage egg swelling compared with pairs at control conditions. Elevated pCO(2) did not affect fertility, time to hatch, or hatching success. Eggs were laid 40% closer together in elevated pCO(2) compared with control conditions, indicating a possible effect of elevated pCO(2) on reproductive behaviour. These results show that elevated pCO(2) can adversely affect reproduction and embryonic development of the two-toned pygmy squid. As the potential for adaptation is influenced by reproductive success, testing the capacity for squid to adapt to future ocean conditions should be a priority for future research.

AB  - In Drosophila, female hydrocarbons are known to be involved in premating isolation between different species and pheromonal races. The role of male-specific hydrocarbon polymorphism is not as well documented. The dominant cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) in male D. melanogaster is usually 7-tricosene (7-T), with the exception of African populations, in which 7-pentacosene (7-P) is dominant. Here, we took advantage of a population from the Comoro Islands (Com), in which males fell on a continuum of low to high levels of 7-T, to perform temperature selection and selection on CHCs' profiles. We conducted several experiments on the selected Com males to study the plasticity of their CHCs in response to temperature shift, their role in resistance to desiccation and in sexual selection. We then compared the results obtained for selected lines to those from three common laboratory strains with different and homogenous hydrocarbon profiles: CS, Cot and Tai. Temperature selection modified the CHC profiles of the Com males in few generations of selection. We showed that the 7-P/7-T ratio depends on temperature with generally more 7-P at higher temperatures and observed a relationship between chain length and resistance to desiccation in both temperature- and phenotypically selected Com lines. There was partial sexual isolation between the flies with clear-cut phenotypes within the phenotypically selected lines and the laboratory strains. These results indicate that the dominant male pheromones are under environmental selection and may have played a role in reproductive isolation.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of probiotics prepared from Bacillus subtilis (strain C-3102-Calsporin (R); Calpis, Tokyo, Japan) as a dietary supplement on several reproductive aspects of female matrinxa(Brycon amazonicus), including hematological parameters, immunological characteristics and total lipid concentrations in muscle and liver tissue. The broodstock were kept in two ponds of 600 m2, at a density of 50 fish per pond, from March to November 2008. The fish were divided into two treatment groups: untreated control fish (T1), and fish fed with 10 g of probiotics per kg of ration (T2). Fish were fed a diet containing 32% crude protein (CP), 7% crude fat (CF), and 6.5% ether extract (EE) twice daily at a rate of 1% of the total biomass per day during the coldest months (May through August) and 3% during the warm season (March, April and September through November). During the reproductive period, 20 individuals from each treatment group were selected for the experiments; two doses of crude carp pituitary extract were given to females in 10-h intervals, and one dose was given to the males at the same time the females were given the second dose. A total of 20 fish were used for the hematological analyses. After anesthetization, blood samples were withdrawn by caudal puncture to determine the total number of cells, differential and total leukocyte counts, thrombocyte count, hematocrit, hemoglobin rate and plasma cortisol and glucose levels. The hematimetric index mean corpuscular volume (VCM) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MHCM) were calculated. Ten other matrinxas from the same groups were used to assess macrophage phagocytic activity and lipid levels. The results showed that females fed a probiotics-supplemented diet exhibited an increase in numbers of oocytes and, consequently, had higher rates of fertilization and hatching of larvae. Probiotic-treated fish also exhibited a significant increase in the phagocytic activity of macrophages, indicating an improvement in the immune system of breeders. Hematologic parameters were different in comparison to the time-zero group, and plasma cortisol and glucose levels were higher in the females. The total lipids levels in muscle and liver tissue were lower in B. amazonicus that received feed supplemented with probiotics.

AB  - Diapause is a common dormancy strategy exhibited by many species of invertebrates and insects to temporarily avoid seasonally recurring unfavourable conditions for their development, most usually in winter. Less frequently, a prolonged diapause lasting two or more years is described in species living in unpredictable environments where it is adaptive, but with significant costs. In this paper we examine the occurrence of prolonged diapause in the lycaenid butterfly Tomares ballus. Pupae of this species undergo an obligate diapause from mid-May to late January the following year. However, during our rearing experiments (from 2009 to 2016) the emergence of adults occurred sequentially and a fraction of the pupae remained in diapause for up to seven years. The annual percentage emergence after the first year of diapause was 45.6%, and only barely exceeded 50.0% in 2015. Remarkably, 12 pupae (11.4% of the initial brood) remained in diapause in their eighth year. The negative exponential equation fitted to the emergence data suggests that further emergences may occur within the next five years. Therefore, the potential for successful prolonged diapause of T. ballus pupae may be more than 10 years. The adaptive value of this strategy is discussed in relation to the effects of adverse and unpredictable weather during the flight period of the butterfly, intra-guild competition, parasitoids and changes in habitat quality. We suggest that this strategy may also be exhibited by other species of Mediterranean lycaenids.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is the primitive character state for most if not all traits. Insofar as developmental and physiological processes obey the laws of chemistry and physics, they will be sensitive to such environmental variables as temperature, nutrient supply, ionic environment, and the availability of various macro- and micronutrients. Depending on the effect this phenotypic plasticity has on fitness, evolution may proceed to select either for mechanisms that buffer or canalize the phenotype against relevant environmental variation or for a modified plastic response in which some ranges of the phenotypic variation are adaptive to particular environments. Phenotypic plasticity can be continuous, in which case it is called a reaction norm, or discontinuous, in which case it is called a polyphenism. Although the morphological discontinuity of some polyphenisms is produced by discrete developmental switches, most polyphenisms are due to discontinuities in the environment that induce only portions of what is in reality a continuous reaction norm. In insect polyphenisms, the environmental variable that induces the alternative phenotype is a token stimulus that serves as a predictor of, but is not itself, the environment to which the polyphenism is an adaptation. In all cases studied so far, the environmental stimulus alters the endocrine mechanism of metamorphosis by altering either the pattern of hormone secretion or the pattern of hormone sensitivity in different tissues. Such changes in the patterns of endocrine interactions result in the execution of alternative developmental pathways. The spatial and temporal compartmentalization of endocrine interactions has produced a developmental mechanism that enables substantial localized changes in morphology that remain well integrated into the structure and function of the organism.

AB  - Reproductive traits experience high levels of selection because of their direct ties to fitness, often resulting in rapid adaptive evolution. Much of the work in this area has focused on male reproductive traits. However, a more comprehensive understanding of female reproductive adaptations and their relationship to male characters is crucial to uncover the relative roles of sexual cooperation and conflict in driving co-evolutionary dynamics between the sexes. We focus on the physiology of a complex female reproductive adaptation in butterflies and moths: a stomach-like organ in the female reproductive tract called the bursa copulatrix that digests the male ejaculate (spermatophore). Little is known about how the bursa digests the spermatophore. We characterized bursa proteolytic capacity in relation to female state in the polyandrous butterfly Pieris rapae. We found that the virgin bursa exhibits extremely high levels of proteolytic activity. Furthermore, in virgin females, bursal proteolytic capacity increases with time since eclosion and ambient temperature, but is not sensitive to the pre-mating social environment. Post copulation, bursal proteolytic activity decreases rapidly before rebounding toward the end of a mating cycle, suggesting active female regulation of proteolysis and/or potential quenching of proteolysis by male ejaculate constituents. Using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we report identities for nine proteases actively transcribed by bursal tissue and/or expressed in the bursal lumen that may contribute to observed bursal proteolysis. We discuss how these dynamic physiological characteristics may function as female adaptations resulting from sexual conflict over female remating rate in this polyandrous butterfly.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to formulate and solve a last-mile distribution plan problem with concern for the quality of fruits and vegetables in cold chains.
   Design/methodology/approach - The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is extended based on the characteristics of fruit-and-vegetable cold chains. The properties of multiple perishable foods, continuing decline in quality, various requirements for quality levels and optimal temperature settings during vehicle transportation are considered in the VRPTW. The product quality level is defined by the estimation of residual shelf life, which changes with temperature, and is characterized by a stepped decrease during the transportation process as time goes on. A genetic algorithm (GA) is adapted to solve the problem because of its convincing ability to solve VRPTW-related problems. For this purpose, solution encoding, a fitness function and evolution operators are designed to deal with the complicated problem herein.
   Findings - A distribution plan including required fleet size, vehicle routing sequence and what quality level should be shipped out to account for the quality degradation during vehicle transportation is generated. The results indicate that the fulfillment of various requirements of different customers for various fruits and vegetables and quality levels can be ensured with cost considerations.
   Originality/value - This study presents a problem for last-mile delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables which considers multiple practical scenarios not studied previously. A solution algorithm based on a GA is developed to address this problem. The proposed model is easily applied to other types of perishable products.

AB  - The P-U characteristic curve of the photovoltaic (PV) cell is a single peak curve with only one maximum power point (MPP). However, the fluctuation of the irradiance level and ambient temperature will cause the drift of MPP. In the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm of PV systems, BP neural network (BPNN) has an unstable learning rate and poor performance, while the genetic algorithm (GA) tends to fall into local optimum. Therefore, a novel PV fuzzy MPPT algorithm based on an adaptive genetic simulated annealing-optimized BP neural network (AGSA-BPNN-FLC) is proposed in this paper. First, the adaptive GA is adopted to generate the corresponding population and increase the population diversity. Second, the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to the parent and offspring with a higher fitness value to improve the convergence rate of GA, and the optimal weight threshold of BPNN are updated by GA and SA algorithm. Third, the optimized BPNN is employed to predict the MPP voltage of PV cells. Finally, the fuzzy logical control (FLC) is used to eliminate local power oscillation and improve the robustness of the PV system. The proposed algorithm is applied and compared with GA-BPNN, simulated annealing-genetic (SA-GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO) and FLC algorithm under the condition that both the irradiance and temperature change. Simulation results indicate that the proposed MPPT algorithm is superior to the above-mentioned algorithms with efficiency, steady-state oscillation rate, tracking time and stability accuracy, and they have a good universality and robustness.

AB  - While it has been proposed in several taxa that the mitochondrial genome is associated with adaptive evolution to different climatic conditions, making links between mitochondrial haplotypes and organismal phenotypes remains a challenge. Mitonuclear discordance occurs in the small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus, with one mitochondrial haplogroup (HGI) more common in the cold climate region of China relative to another form (HGII) despite strong nuclear gene flow, providing a promising model to investigate climatic adaptation of mitochondrial genomes. We hypothesized that cold adaptation through HGI may be involved, and considered mitogenome evolution, population genetic analyses, and bioassays to test this hypothesis. In contrast to our hypothesis, chill-coma recovery tests and population genetic tests of selection both pointed to HGII being involved in cold adaptation. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HGII is nested within HGI, and has three nonsynonymous changes in ND2, ND5 and CYTB in comparison to HGI. These molecular changes likely increased mtDNA copy number, cold tolerance and fecundity of SBPH, particularly through a function-altering amino acid change involving M114T in ND2. Nuclear background also influenced fecundity and chill recovery (i.e., mitonuclear epistasis) and protein modelling indicates possible nuclear interactions for the two nonsynonymous changes in ND2 and CYTB. The high occurrence frequency of HGI in the cold climate region of China remains unexplained, but several possible reasons are discussed. Overall, our study points to a link between mtDNA variation and organismal-level evolution and suggests a possible role of mitonuclear interactions in maintaining mtDNA diversity.

AB  - Thermotoga maritima is a hyperthermophilic anaerobe that utilizes a vast network of ABC transporters to efficiently metabolize a variety of carbon sources to produce hydrogen. For unknown reasons, this organism does not metabolize glucose as readily as it does glucose di- and polysaccharides. The leading hypothesis implicates the thermolability of glucose at the physiological temperatures at which T. maritima lives. After a 25-day laboratory evolution, phenotypes were observed with growth rates up to 1.4 times higher than and glucose utilization rates exceeding 50% those of the wild type. Genome resequencing revealed mutations in evolved cultures related to glucose-responsive ABC transporters. The native glucose ABC transporter, GluEFK, has more abundant transcripts either as a result of gene duplication-amplification or through mutations to the operator sequence regulating this operon. Conversely, BglEFGKL, a transporter of beta-glucosides, is substantially downregulated due to a nonsense mutation to the solute binding protein or due to a deletion of the upstream promoter. Analysis of the ABC2 uptake porter families for carbohydrate and peptide transport revealed that the solute binding protein, often among the transcripts detected at the highest levels, is predominantly downregulated in the evolved cultures, while the membrane-spanning domain and nucleotide binding components are less varied. Similar trends were observed in evolved strains grown on glycerol, a substrate that is not dependent on ABC transporters. Therefore, improved growth on glucose is achieved through mutations favoring GluEFK expression over BglEFGKL, and in lieu of carbon catabolite repression, the ABC transporter network is modulated to achieve improved growth fitness.

AB  - How plant traits evolve along geographical and climatic gradients has recently received increased attention because of anticipated climate change and associated shifts in insect distribution, whether they are herbivores or predators. This issue is particularly relevant for traits related to growth and anti-herbivore defence of plants, because both sets of traits are closely tied to fitness, and because being sessile organisms, plants tend to experience strong local selection. Despite widespread recognition that the abiotic environment imposes selection on plant traits, how temperature and water availability independently select for allocation to growth and defence against herbivores is not well-resolved, and even more so, when considering under-ground herbivory and tritrophic interactions involving plant herbivores and their predators. To address heritable, climate-driven variation in root traits mediating tritrophic interactions, we performed a common garden experiment with four populations of common red fescue (Festuca rubra) encompassing the four corners of a precipitation by temperature gradient matrix. We found that plants originating from wetter and warmer conditions, in addition to producing more biomass, also produced a blend of volatile organic compounds more attractive for predatory nematodes of root insect herbivores. Moreover, across populations, variation in nematode attraction was mediated by balancing the emissions of attractive and repulsive volatile compounds. Our work builds towards better understanding how plant adaptation to climate interacts with adaptations to herbivores and their predators. A plain language summary is available for this article.

AB  - Various aspects of transformation and regeneration processes were examined in efforts to improve the efficiency of production of transgenic cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) proved to be a valuable tool in elucidating the timing and localization of transient gene expression and in visualizing conversion of transient events to stable transformation events. By day 4 after infection, there was maximal transient activity in the cells at the cut edge of Agrobacterium-infected cotyledon disks. We were able to visualize conversion of some of these events to stable transformation by day 8. The effects of Agrobacterium strains, acetosyringone, and temperature on stable transformation were also evaluated. Strain LBA4404 proved to be significantly better than EHA105. Acetosyringone increased significantly the stable transformation efficiency in cotton. Cocultivation at 21 degreesC, compared to 25 degreesC, consistently resulted in higher transformation frequencies. GFP expression in stably transformed callus was useful in studying the efficiency of selection during early stages of culture. We found that the survival of individual callus lines on selection medium was influenced by their original size and initial transgene expression status. Larger-size calluses and calluses expressing the transgene (GFP) had a higher rate of survival. Survival could be improved by an additional two-week culture on medium high in cytokinin and low in auxin before transfer to a medium to induce embryogenesis. However, this treatment delayed embryogenesis. Various other important aspects of the regeneration process are described and an overall scheme for producing transgenic cotton is presented.

The correlation between the resistance to low temperatures and the wintering conditions in habitats of some species is studied. The mechanisms and degree of cold hardiness are shown to generally be unrelated to the taxonomic proximity. The effect of the resistance to low wintering temperatures on the habitat distribution and faunogenesis of soil invertebrates in permafrost regions is discussed.

AB  - The in-die quenching is a key stage in the hot stamping volume production chain which determines the post-formed strength of lightweight alloy components, tool life, and hot stamping productivity. In this paper, the performance of in-die quenching, reflected by the quenching efficiency (the time of work-piece held within stamping dies) and die surface temperature during the simulated hot stamping process of AA6082, was experimentally and analytically investigated. A range of in-die quenching experiments were performed for different initial work-piece and die temperatures, quenching pressures, work-piece thickness, and die clearances, under hot stamping conditions. In addition, a one-dimensional (1D) closed-form heat transfer model was used to calculate the die surface temperature evolution that is difficult to obtain during practical manufacture situations. The results have shown that the in-die quenching efficiency can be significantly increased by decreasing the initial work-piece and die temperatures. Die clearances are required to be designed precisely to obtain sufficiently high quenching rates and satisfying post-formed strength for hot-stamped panel components. This study systematically considered an extensive variety of influencing factors on the in-die quenching performance, which can provide practical guides for stamping tool designers and manufacture systems for hot-stamping volume production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli AFP111, a facultative anaerobic strain, shows a very lowcell growth and succinic acid production rate in minimal medium during exclusively anaerobic fermentation. Therefore, atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) and adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) strategies were adopted to improve cell growth and succinic acid production under anaerobic conditions.
   RESULTS: A mutant, BER208, was obtained by ARTP and ALE used successively. When cultured in a 3 L stirred bioreactor, the specific growth rate of BER208 was increased 3.12-fold compared with AFP111. Also, it consumed 40 g L-1 glucose and produced 27.9 g L-1 succinic acid with a glucose utilization rate of 0.54 g L-1 h(-1) and succinic acid productivity of 0.38 g L-1 h(-1), which were 3.7-fold and 2.5-fold higher than those of the original strain. Further investigation showed that the activities of glucokinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) were increased 3.3-fold and 16-fold in the mutant compared with the original strain.
   CONCLUSION: The combined strategy of ARTP and ALE was an effective approach to obtain mutants with improved performance. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Colonisation can expose organisms to novel combinations of abiotic and biotic factors and drive adaptive divergence. Yet, studies investigating the interactive effects of multiple abiotic factors on the evolution of physiological traits remain rare. Here we examine the effects of low salinity, low temperature, and their interaction on the growth of three North American populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In north-temperate freshwater habitats, stickleback populations experience a combination of low salinity and low winter temperatures that are not experienced by the ancestral marine and anadromous populations. Here we show that both salinity and temperature, and their interaction, have stronger negative effects on marine and anadromous populations than a freshwater population. Freshwater stickleback showed only a similar to 20% reduction in specific growth rate when exposed to 4 degrees C, while marine and anadromous stickleback showed sharp declines (82% and 74% respectively) under these conditions. The modest decreases in growth in freshwater stickleback in fresh water in the cold strongly suggest that this population has the capacity for physiological compensation to offset the negative thermodynamic effects of low temperature on growth. These results are suggestive of adaptive evolution in response to the interactive effects of low salinity and low temperature during freshwater colonisation.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that a range of different stresses can increase mean lifespan. Here we investigated the effect of injuries and bacterial inoculation on mean lifespan in lines selected for increased longevity and their controls. The three lines from each selection regime were subjected to one of five treatments ranging from control, over perforating the cuticle with a sterile needle, to inoculating with peptidoglycan or one of two strains of live bacteria. The flies were subjected to the infection stress at two ages and the experiment was conducted on both males and females of replicate lines of each selection regime. The individual lines and sexes differed in response to the treatment. However, overall the sterile injury of young males resulted in prolonged mean lifespan from both selection regimes, whereas inoculating had no additional effect to stabbing with a sterile needle. In middle-aged males only treatment with peptidoglycan had a significant hormetic effect and this was only in longevity-selected flies. In females only one of the tested contrasts was significant and here the effect of the treatment was to reduce average lifespan. As could be expected, the results showed a significant interaction between the effects of sex and infection on survival.

AB  - A bubble-column slurry-reactor model has been developed for the hydrogenation of aqueous maleic acid (MAC) to tetrahydrofuran (THF). This particular reaction system has recent commercial relevance and represents a case where complex multistep catalytic hydrogenation reactions are conducted at high pressure (>15 MPa) and high temperature (>240degreesC). It also has additional complexities associated with the reaction chemistry, since the THF reaction product is volatile and the reaction is highly exothermic. The proposed model is derived using the mixing cell approach and incorporates the contributions of gas-liquid and liquid-solid mass transfer, intraparticle diffusion effects, product volatility, heat effects, and complex multistep reaction kinetics. The effect of gas and liquid velocities, catalyst loading, inlet maleic acid concentration, and temperature on the conversion, selectivity, temperature rise, and productivity of the desired products (THF and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)) is also discussed. Since the reaction step involving the hydrogenation of GBL to THF is relatively slow, severe operating conditions are necessary to achieve high THF selectivity. The distribution pattern of THF in the gas and liquid phases is also discussed. The model proposed could be useful for simulation of existing pilot- or industrial-scale reactors, as well as the design and scale-up of new reactors for this particular reaction or one that has similar characteristics.

AB  - Freeze-thaw stress has previously been shown to alter soil community structure and function. We sought to further investigate this stress on enriched microbial consortia with the aim of identifying microbes with ice-associating adaptations that facilitate survival. Enrichments were established to obtain culturable psychrotolerant microbes from soil samples from the latitudinal extremes of the Canadian Shield plateau. The resulting consortia were subjected to consecutive freeze-thaw cycles, and survivors were putatively identified by their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Even though the northerly site was exposed to longer, colder winters and large spring-time temperature fluctuations, the selective regime similarly affected both enriched consortia. Quantitative PCR and metagenomic sequencing were used to determine the frequency of a subset of the resistant microbes in the original enrichments. The metagenomes showed 22 initial genera, only 6 survived and these were not dominant prior to selection. When survivors were assayed for ice recrystallization inhibition and ice nucleation activities, over 60% had at least one of these properties. These phenotypes were not more prevalent in the northern enrichment, indicating that regarding these adaptations, the enrichment strategy yielded seemingly functionally similar consortia from each site.

AB  - The corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) is one of the most important pests of maize with worldwide distribution. The use of relatively resistant corn hybrids may lessen the harmful effects by this aphid; we therefore compared population growth parameters of R. maidis reared on six commonly grown maize hybrids in Iran, namely K3640/3X MO17, Simon, SC704, EXP1, VRE26XK18 and VRE27XK18. The experiments were carried out under conditions of 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% RH, and a photoperiod of 16L8D. The development time and survival of aphid nymphs differed significantly among the maize hybrids tested. We also observed significant differences in aphid fecundity, resulting in large variations in population growth parameters, such as the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-0), finite rate of increase (lambda) and doubling time (DT). The r(m) values were highest for aphids reared on maize hybrids EXP1 and VRE27XK18, lowest for aphids reared on hybrid K3640/3XMO17, and intermediate for aphids reared on hybrids VRE26XK18, SC704 and Simon. Consequently, these results may offer useful information for planning a comprehensive program for IPM of the corn leaf aphid in Iran.

AB  - In order to meet the rapidly increasing demand for energy supply, multiple wells have been used to improve the output productivity and performance of an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS). As the output performance of an EGS is affected by many factors, such as number and placement of wells, direction and magnitude of areal flow and flow rates, reservoir optimization is an important topic in EGS design. In this paper, a semi-analytical model is developed to study the heat extraction from a multiple-well (some for recharging and the others for production) geothermal reservoir, where fluid circulates in a single, planar hydraulic fracture with a constant hydraulic aperture. The effect of parallel areal flow across the well field is included in the analysis. The streamline function and velocity potential method used in the authors' previous work (Wu et al., 2013) is extended to the current problem. A comparison of the flow behaviour and temperature evolution in a given well layout with and without areal flow is carried out. The results show that the areal flow plays an important role in affecting the temperature distribution and thus the EGS output performance. Therefore, the well layout needs to be optimized when there exists areal flow.

AB  - Theory predicts that immigration can either enhance or impair the rate at which species and whole communities adapt to environmental change, depending on the traits of genotypes and species in the source pool relative to local conditions. These responses, in turn, will determine how well whole communities function in changing environments. We tested the effects of immigration and experimental warming on microbial communities during an 81-day field experiment. The effects of immigration depended on the warming treatment. In warmed communities, immigration was detrimental to community growth, whereas in ambient communities it was beneficial. This result is explained by colonists coming from a local species pool preadapted to ambient conditions. Loss of metabolic diversity, however, was buffered by immigration in both environments. Communities showed increasing local adaptation to temperature conditions during the experiment, and this was independent of whether they received immigration. Genotypes that comprised the communities were not locally adapted, however, indicating that community local adaptation can be independent of adaptation of component genotypes. Our results are consistent with a greater role for species interactions rather than adaptation of constituent species in determining local adaptation of whole communities and confirm that immigration can either enhance or impair community responses to environmental change depending on the environmental context.

AB  - The viable and non-viable fractions of the bacterial community in a 2347-year-old permafrost soil from Spitsbergen were subjected to a comprehensive investigation using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. LIVE/DEAD((R))BacLight(TM) staining revealed that 26% of the total number of bacterial cells were viable. Quantitatively, aerobic microcolonies, aerobic colony-forming units and culturable anaerobic bacteria comprised a minor fraction of the total number of viable bacteria, which underlines the necessity for alternative cultivation approaches in bacterial cryobiology. Sulfate reduction was detected at temperatures between -2 degrees C and 29 degrees C while methanogenesis was not detected. Bacterial diversity was high with 162 operational taxonomic units observed from 800 16S rDNA clone sequences. The 158 pure cultures isolated from the permafrost soil affiliated with 29 different bacterial genera, the majority of which have not previously been isolated from permafrost habitats. Most of the strains isolated were affiliated to the genera Cellulomonas and Arthrobacter and several of the pure cultures were closely related to bacteria reported from other cryohabitats. Characterization of viable bacterial communities in permafrost soils is important as it will enable identification of functionally important groups together with the as yet undescribed adaptations that bacteria have evolved for surviving subzero temperatures for millennia.

AB  - The potential and adaptive flexibility of population dynamic P-systems (PDP) to study population dynamics suggests that they may be suitable for modelling complex fluvial ecosystems, characterized by a composition of dynamic habitats with many variables that interact simultaneously. Using as a model a reservoir occupied by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, we designed a computational model based on P systems to study the population dynamics of larvae, in order to evaluate management actions to control or eradicate this invasive species. The population dynamics of this species was simulated under different scenarios ranging from the absence of water flow change to a weekly variation with different flow rates, to the actual hydrodynamic situation of an intermediate flow rate. Our results show that POP models can be very useful tools to model complex, partially desynchronized, processes that work in parallel. This allows the study of complex hydroecological processes such as the one presented, where reproductive cycles, temperature and water dynamics are involved in the desynchronization of the population dynamics both, within areas and among them.
   The results obtained may be useful in the management of other reservoirs with similar hydrodynamic situations in which the presence of this invasive species has been documented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Degradation of land and denudation of forest resources, instability in production, erosion of soil, and depletion of native fertility status necessitates a thorough understanding for sustainable agricultural development for conservation of natural resources for present and future generations. We studied the natural resource inventory of Luppi village, situated at eastern plateau of India using a Geographic Information System and satellite imagery (IRS IC LISS III satellite imagery) and Participatory Rural Appraisal Technique, a procedure for rapid acquisition of knowledge, development activity, and decision-making done with the involvement of rural people and household survey. A base map and resource map of the village were developed using GEOMATICA software. Toposequence based micro-level study revealed that there were four types of land situations: upper terraces locally called Tanr, Bahri (land close to homesteads), Baad (middle terraces), and Garha (lower terraces). Adverse bio-physical and socio-economic conditions and age-old, traditional, unscientific agricultural activities in the region act as deterrents for crop production and natural resource management. Based on the study, it can be concluded that priority should be given to long term strategies encompassing silviculture or silvi-pastoral system (cultivation of trees and pasture simultaneously) on upland, cultivation of short-duration, flash-flood tolerant, high-yielding rice variety for Aman (wet) season, and cold-tolerant rice variety for winter season in low land areas; social forestry in degraded land; agro-ecologically suited cropping systems with suitable variety choice for problem areas; and judicious nutrient management in homestead gardens that is ecologically suitable, socio-econornic ally acceptable, technologically sound, and environmentally sustainable.

AB  - Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is the latest application of next-generation sequencing protocols for the purposes of discovering and genotyping SNPs in a variety of crop species and populations. Unlike other high-density genotyping technologies which have mainly been applied to general interest "reference" genomes, the low cost of GBS makes it an attractive means of saturating mapping and breeding populations with a high density of SNP markers. One barrier to the widespread use of GBS has been the difficulty of the bioinformatics analysis as the approach is accompanied by a high number of erroneous SNP calls which are not easily diagnosed or corrected. In this study, we use a 384-plex GBS protocol to add 30,984 markers to an indica (IR64) x japonica (Azucena) mapping population consisting of 176 recombinant inbred lines of rice (Oryza sativa) and we release our imputation and error correction pipeline to address initial GBS data sparsity and error, and streamline the process of adding SNPs to RIL populations. Using the final imputed and corrected dataset of 30,984 markers, we were able to map recombination hot and cold spots and regions of segregation distortion across the genome with a high degree of accuracy, thus identifying regions of the genome containing putative sterility loci. We mapped QTL for leaf width and aluminum tolerance, and were able to identify additional QTL for both phenotypes when using the full set of 30,984 SNPs that were not identified using a subset of only 1,464 SNPs, including a previously unreported QTL for aluminum tolerance located directly within a recombination hotspot on chromosome 1. These results suggest that adding a high density of SNP markers to a mapping or breeding population through GBS has a great value for numerous applications in rice breeding and genetics research.

AB  - Wildfires are exorbitantly cataclysmic disasters that lead to the destruction of forest cover, wildlife, land resources, human assets, reduced soil fertility and global warming. Every year wildfires wreck havoc across the globe. Therefore, there is a need of an efficient and reliable system for real-time wildfire monitoring to dilute their disastrous effects. Internet of Things (IoT) has demonstrated remarkable evolution and has been successfully adopted in environmental monitoring domain. This paper proposes a collaborative IoT-Fog-Cloud framework based on soft computing techniques for real-time wildfire monitoring, prediction and forecasting. The framework includes proposals for classifying a forest terrain into its appropriate wildfire proneness class using fuzzy K-nearest-neighbor classifier by analyzing wildfire influent attributes and wildfire consequent attributes. Moreover, real-time emergency alert generation mechanism based on temporal mining has been proposed in event of adverse wildfire conditions. Estimation of future wildfire proneness levels of a forest terrain using Holt-Winter's forecasting model also forms an integral part of the proposed framework. Implementation results reveal that high values of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and precision averaging to 93.97%, 92.35%, 93.01% and 91.24% are attained for determination of wildfire proneness of a forest terrain. Low values of mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error (RMSE) averaging to 0.665, 2, 11.705 and 1.405, respectively, for real-time alert generation are registered, thereby increasing the utility of the proposed framework. Wildfire proneness forecasting also yields highly accurate results with low values of MAE, MSE and RMSE averaging to 0.166667, 0.25 and 0.492799, respectively.

AB  - I studied the egg-laying behavior of the frog Buergeria japonica in the coastal areas of Okinawa, Japan, to clarify whether females avoid high salinity areas to reduce egg mortality. I compared the distribution of oviposition sites to the salinity gradient and evaluated the physical cues used by females to select oviposition sites. Females selected oviposition sites above the high tide line at spring tide, where eggs would not be disturbed by incursion of seawater. Above this high tide line, females selected oviposition sites from which eggs would not be washed out or desiccate, by using cues such as water depth and substrate. Examination of conditions at two spatial scales helps to clarify the evolution of oviposition site selection.

AB  - The augmented exposure of both environment and human being to electromagnetic waves and the concomitant lack of an unequivocal knowledge about biological consequences of these radiations, raised public interest on electromagnetic pollution. In this context, the present study aims to evaluate the biological effects on zebrafish (ZF) embryos of 100 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure through a multidisciplinary protocol.
   Because of the shared synteny between human and ZF genomes that validated its use in biomedical research, toxicology and developmental biology studies, ZF was here selected as experimental model and a measurement protocol and biological analyses have been set up to clearly discriminate between RF-EMF biological and thermal effects.
   The results showed that a 100 MHz EMF was able to affect ZF embryonic development, from 24 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) in all the analyzed pathways. Particularly, at the 48 hpf stage, a reduced growth, an increased transcription of oxidative stress genes, the onset of apoptotic/autophagic processes and a modification in cholesterol metabolism were detected. ZF embryos faced stress induced by EMF radiation by triggering detoxification mechanisms and at 72 hpf they partially recovered from stress reaching the hatching time in a comparable way respect to the control group.
   Data here obtained showed unequivocally the in vivo effects of RF-EMF on an animal model, excluding thermal outcomes and thus represents the starting point for more comprehensive studies on dose response effects of electromagnetic fields radiations consequences.

AB  - The mineralogy of the oceanic basalt source region is examined by testing whether a peridotite mineralogy can yield observed whole-rock and olivine compositions from (1) the Hawaiian Islands, our type example of a mantle plume, and (2) the Siqueiros Transform, which provides primitive samples of normal mid-ocean ridge basalt. New olivine compositional data from phase 2 of the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP2) show that higher Ni-in-olivine at the Hawaiian Islands is due to higher temperatures (T) of melt generation and processing (by c. 300 degrees C) related to the Hawaiian mantle plume. Pm is low at high T, so parental Hawaiian basalts are enriched in NiO. When Hawaiian (picritic) parental magmas are transported to shallow depths, olivine precipitation occurs at lower temperatures, where D-Ni is high, leading to high Ni-in-olivine. Similarly, variations in Mn and Fe/Mn ratios in olivines are explained by contrasts in the temperatures of magma processing. Using the most mafic rocks to delimit Siqueiros and Hawaiian Co and Ni contents in parental magmas and mantle source compositions also shows that both suites can be derived from natural peridotites, but are inconsistent with partial melting of natural pyroxenites. Whole-rock compositions at Hawaii and Siqueiros are also matched by partial melting experiments conducted on peridotite bulk compositions. Hawaiian whole-rocks have elevated FeO contents compared with Siqueiros, which can be explained if Hawaiian parental magmas are generated from peridotite at 4-5 GPa, in contrast to pressures of slightly greater than 1 GPa for melt generation at Siqueiros; these pressures are consistent with olivine thermometry, as described in an earlier paper. SiO2-enriched Koolau compositions are reproduced if high-Fe Hawaiian parental magmas re-equilibrate at 1-1.5 GPa. Peridotite partial melts from experimental studies also reproduce the CaO and Al2O3 contents of Hawaiian (and Siqueiros) whole-rocks. Hawaiian magmas have TiO2 contents, however, that are enriched compared with melts from natural peridotites and magmas derived from the Siqueiros depleted mantle, and consequently may require an enriched source. TiO2 is not the only element that is enriched relative to melts of natural peridotites. Moderately incompatible elements, such as Ti, Zr, Hf, Gamma, and Eu, and compatible elements, such as Gamma b and Lu, are all enriched at the Hawaiian Islands. Such enrichments can be explained by adding 5-10% mid-ocean ridge basalt (crust) to depleted mantle; when the major element composition of such a mixture is recast into mineral components, the result is a fertile peridotite mineralogy.

AB  - Generation of granitic melt is believed to occur predominantly by melting through the breakdown of hydrous minerals. However, melting due to the influx of H2O has been recognized in anatectic amphibolite facies tonalitic grey gneisses, metagreywackes and low-Pmetapelites, and has consequently been proposed as an alternative mechanism for the generation of granitic melt. Melting induced by H2O addition is recognized from voluminous melt production at relatively low temperature, where hydrous minerals are stable and anhydrous minerals are preferentially consumed during melting. Mineral equilibrium modelling to determine theP-Tconditions, melt volumes, melting reactions and viable H2O sources reveals that the process is not restricted to specific compositions orP-Tconditions, although lower pressure and lithologies with a low hydrous mineral content are more favourable. Melting reactions in all lithologies primarily consume quartz and feldspars to yield 5-6 mol.% melt for each mol.% of H2O added.aH(2)Oremains constant at similar to 0.70 to 0.77 during progressive melting as long as alkali feldspar is present. Once alkali feldspar is exhausted, plagioclase becomes the main reactant, producing more tonalitic melt compositions with gradually higheraH(2)O. Our results demonstrate that, at the site of melting, melting is driven by diffusion of H2O into the target rock along chemical potential gradients, rather than the advective flow of a mechanically distinct water-rich fluid phase. Melting will initiate and proceed as long as a mu H2Ogradient exists between the H2O source and target lithology. Our calculations show that an ordinary magma, such as an I-type magma with typical H2O content, has a mu H2Ohigh enough to be a viable H2O source, allowing diffusive H2O-fluxed melting to produce melt proportions and fertility comparable to that of dehydration melting. However, high degrees of partial melting require a considerable amount of H2O, which necessitates a continuously advecting H2O source such as a magma conduit or melt-bearing shear zone. A magmatic H2O source at emplacement level will undergo a similar amount of crystallization as the melt fraction produced in the target rock such that there will be no net melt production. Considering that shear-zone hosted magma conduits are localized features, diffusive H2O-fluxed melting is likely to only be viable in a small fraction of the anatectic orogenic crust. Although it may play an important role in locally raising melt volumes and modifying magma chemistry through mingling and hybridization, it does not appear to, of itself, be able to generate significant volumes of granitic melt.

AB  - Cross-national research on health system performance can yield important findings for public policy purposes. We seek to further this research by examining the problem of selection bias, an important methodological issue that investigators initially should consider. Because of the logistical difficulties and enormous expense involved in collecting voluminous data from many countries, researchers often must rely on information contained in data sets of international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Under the circumstances, the comparisons that researchers can make will depend to a great extent on the availability and richness of data for certain measures. This situation raises the potential for selection or experimenter bias. We use multivariate statistics to group countries with similar characteristics, an approach that we believe will mitigate the problem. We perform a cluster analysis of 186 countries using principal components derived from 7 demographic variables and 27 mortality and burden of disease variables. Our analysis produced six clusters that we believe represent suitable groupings for comparative purposes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent efforts to project vegetation responses to climatic warming have emphasized the tight linkages between climate and vegetation distribution. Here we provide several examples indicating that the direct effects of climatic warming on boreal vegetation can be qualitatively different than the indirect effects mediated by climatic responses of herbivores. These herbivore-mediated vegetation responses to climatic warming will likely vary regionally. In southern Fennoscandia, we project that the climatically induced changes in animal populations should enhance the density of spruce at the expense of pine and broadleafed trees. In northern Fennoscandia we project reduced herbivory on broadleafed trees and increased herbivory on pine, leading to an increase in broadleafed trees and spruce and a reduction in pine. Climatic warming in interior Alaska may reduce herbivory on broadleafed trees and increase herbivory on evergreen spruce, thus reinforcing the impact of increased fire frequency.

AB  - Previously, we reported that subterranean Liriomyza trifolii pupae can be killed with solar radiation by covering the ground with transparent polyvinylchloride film after cropping of a leafy vegetable, Chrysanthemum coronarium? var. spatiosum. In order to quantify the conditions necessary to achieve effective control oft. trifolii in Osaka Prefecture, we investigated the mortality of pupae at selected temperature and duration combinations, as well as the soil temperatures attained under transparent polyvinylchloride film in a closed greenhouse at specific times of the year L. trifolii pupae were killed by exposure to either 44 degreesC for 24 h, 46 degreesC for 3 h or 48-54 degreesC for 30 min. Maximum temperatures of 48 degreesC or higher were attained from early April to mid October at a depth of 1-2 cm beneath the soil surface under transparent polyvinylchloride film in a closed greenhouse. Many L, trifolii pupate at 1-2 cm beneath the soil surface. Therefore, this control method for L, trifolii pupae is effective during the period from early April to mid October.

AB  - Temperature-based degree-day models describe insect seasonality and to predict key phenological events. We expand on the use of a temperature-based process defining timing of reproduction through the incorporation of female reproductive physiology for the invasive pentatomid species Halyomorpha halys, the brown marmorated stink bug. A five-stage ranking system based on ovary development was able to distinguish between the reproductive statuses of field-collected females. Application of this ranking method described aspects of H.halys' seasonality, overwintering biology, and phenology across geographic locations. Female H.halys were collected in the US from NJ, WV, NC, OR, and two sites in PA in 2006-2008 (Allentown, PA only) and 2012-2014. Results identify that H.halys enters reproductive diapause in temperate locations in the fall and that a delay occurs in developmental maturity after diapause termination in the spring. Modification of the Snyder method to identify biofix determined 12.7-hr photoperiod as the best fit to define initiation of reproduction in the spring. Applying the biofix, we demonstrated significant differences between locations for the rate at which the overwintering generation transition into reproductive status and the factors contributing to this difference require further study. For example, after including abiotic variables influencing development such as temperature and photoperiod (critical diapause cue), reproduction occurred earlier in OR and for an extended period in NJ. This data describe a method to investigate insect seasonality by incorporating physiological development across multiple regions that can clarify phenology for insects with overlapping generations.

AB  - We have studied the pattern of association between the season of conception and cytosolic low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase (ACP1) genetic polymorphism in 329 consecutively newborn infants from the population of Penne and 361 consecutively newborn infants from the population of Rome. In addition, 329 mothers were studied in the population of Penne. A concordant, highly significant association was observed in the two populations between ACP1 parameters and the season of conception of newborn infants. The total activity of ACP1 shows a minimum in infants conceived in January-February and a maximum in those conceived at the end of the solar year. Analysis of the joint mother-newborn ACP1 distribution in relation to the season of fertilisation has shown that among mothers carrying ACP1*A (the allele showing the lowest activity), the proportion of newborns carrying this allele is higher in those conceived in the first months of the year than in those conceived subsequently. Since ACP1 probably functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase and as a flavin mononucleotide phosphatase, low activity could enhance the metabolic rate and would be advantageous in a cold environment. The cycle of variation of ACP1 in infants follows the cycle of solar illumination. It is possible that individuals who have a genetic background allowing them to adapt easily and readily to seasonal demand are more successful in reproducing themselves. The population of zygotes conceived in a given season would therefore reproduce the pattern of gene combination more fit for that season.

AB  - There is great interest in modelling the export of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural fields because of ongoing challenges of eutrophication. However, the use of existing hydrochemistry models can be problematic in cold regions because models frequently employ incomplete or conceptually incorrect representations of the dominant cold regions hydrological processes and are overparameterized, often with insufficient data for validation. Here, a process-based N model, WINTRA, which is coupled to a physically based cold regions hydrological model, was expanded to simulate P and account for overwinter soil nutrient biochemical cycling. An inverse modelling approach, using this model with consideration of parameter equifinality, was applied to an intensively monitored agricultural basin in Manitoba, Canada, to help identify the main climate, soil, and anthropogenic controls on nutrient export. Consistent with observations, the model results suggest that snow water equivalent, melt rate, snow cover depletion rate, and contributing area for run-off generation determine the opportunity time and surface area for run-off-soil interaction. These physical controls have not been addressed in existing models. Results also show that the time lag between the start of snowmelt and the arrival of peak nutrient concentration in run-off increased with decreasing antecedent soil moisture content, highlighting potential implications of frozen soils on run-off processes and hydrochemistry. The simulations showed TDP concentration peaks generally arriving earlier than NO3 but also decreasing faster afterwards, which suggests a significant contribution of plant residue Total dissolved Phosphorus (TDP) to early snowmelt run-off. Antecedent fall tillage and fertilizer application increased TDP concentrations in spring snowmelt run-off but did not consistently affect NO3 run-off. In this case, the antecedent soil moisture content seemed to have had a dominant effect on overwinter soil N biogeochemical processes such as mineralization, which are often ignored in models. This work demonstrates both the need for better representation of cold regions processes in hydrochemical models and the model improvements that are possible if these are included.

AB  - Tuta absoluta is one of the most significant invasive pests affecting tomato plants worldwide. RT-qPCR has emerged as one of the most sensitive and accurate methods for detecting gene expression data. The screening of stable internal reference genes is the most critical step for studying the molecular mechanisms of environmental adaptability. The stable reference genes expressed in T. absoluta under specific experimental conditions have not yet been clarified. In this study, seven candidate reference genes (RPL27, RPS13, RPS15, EF1-alpha, TUB, TBP, and beta-actin) and their optimal numbers were evaluated under biotic (developmental stages and adult tissues) and abiotic (insecticide, temperature, and plant VOC) conditions using four software programs. Our results identified the following reference genes and numbers as optimal: three genes (EF1-alpha, RPS13, and RPL27) for different developmental stages (egg, larva, pupa, unmated adult), two genes (RPS13 and TBP) for adult tissues (antenna, head, thorax, abdomen, leg), two genes (TBP and RPS13) for insecticides (Bacillus thuringiensis, chlorpyrifos, abamectin-aminomethyl, and chlorantraniliprole), two genes (RPL27 and TUB) for temperature-induced stresses (0, 25, and 40 degrees C), and two genes (RPS13 and TUB) for VOC-induced stresses (nonanal, alpha-phellandrene, and tomato leaves). Our results provide a reference for selecting appropriate reference genes for further study of the functional genes of T. absoluta under different experimental conditions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilization (0, 40, 80, 120, 160 kg N ha(-1)) on changes in selected physical, thermal, and geometric parameters of camelina seeds. Samples 0 kg N ha(-1) and 40 kg N ha(-1) formed a homogenous group with lower values of 1,000 seed weight and differed significantly from the second homogeneous group of samples 80, 120, and 160 kg N ha(-1) with higher 1,000 seed weight. Nitrogen fertilization did not exert a significant effect on bulk density, true density, or porosity. Fertilization had no significant effect on the thermal properties of camelina seeds. Based on all linear dimensions and shape factors, samples 0 and 40 kg N ha(-1) formed one homogenous group and were significantly different from the remaining samples. Samples 0 and 40 kg N ha(-1) were characterized by the lowest values of linear dimensions, including length, width, surface area, profile specific perimeter, and convex perimeter, the lowest values of selected shape factors, including diameter range, standard deviation of all radii, Blair-Bliss coefficient, and Danielsson coefficient, as well as the highest values of the radius ratio and roundness. Practical Applications Nitrogen fertilization strongly influences the properties of camelina seeds. Camelina seeds subjected to 120 kg N ha(-1) were characterized by the highest dimensions, such as: length, width, surface area, and high values of 1,000 seed weight and they may be most desirable to be used in practice.

AB  - Diapause and non-diapause larvae of Plodia interpunctella from two selected lines, fast development (FDL) and slow development (SDL), reared at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C were tested for low temperature tolerance, supercooling ability and accumulation of cryoprotective compounds. Exposure to -20 degrees C was fatal for both diapause and non-diapause larvae. Diapause larvae, particularly those reared at 20 degrees C, were more tolerant to - 10 degrees C than non-diapause larvae. Their higher survival under increased exposure periods indicates that the chilling tolerance in P. interpunctella is associated with diapause. Rearing temperatures did not affect the supercooling capacity of the larvae, since the supercooling points (SCPs) of the diapause and non-diapause larvae reared at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C did not differ; mean SCPs ranged from - 12 degrees C to -15 degrees C. Trehalose was the major cryoprotective compound synthesized by the larvae. Photoperiod and temperature affected the accumulation of trehalose as diapause larvae reared at 20 degrees C (LD 12 : 12) had significantly higher concentrations of trehalose than non-diapause larvae at 20 degrees C and diapause and non-diapause larvae at 25 degrees C. Low temperature (5 degrees C) exposure for 30 days enhanced the supercooling ability of diapause larvae reared at 20 degrees C by decreasing the SCP to ca. -22 degrees C. The results suggest that diapause larvae can overwinter successfully in a supercooled state. Acclimation did not increase trehalose concentration. This leads to the conclusion that the regulation of supercooling in P. interpunctella is independent of trehalose concentration. Diapause and non-diapause larvae from the two selection lines did not differ in SCP, concentration of cryoprotectants, or rate of survival at low temperature.

AB  - Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors affecting biological processes of mosquitoes, including their interactions with viruses. In these studies, we show independent effects of rearing temperature on the immature aquatic stages and holding temperature on the adult terrestrial stage in terms of alterations in adult survival and progression of dengue-1 virus infection in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus. Our studies show that adult survival was determined by adult-holding temperature, regardless of rearing conditions of the immature stages. In contrast, spread of virus throughout the body of the mosquito, a pre-requisite for transmission, was reduced when the immature stages were reared in cool conditions. These results show that immature-rearing temperature selectively modified mosquito traits that influence competency for viruses, and they further our understanding of the nature of temperature effects on interactions between mosquitoes and virus pathogens and risk of disease transmission.

We hypothesized that variability in survival and fecundity, driven by climate variability at different points in the life cycle, scales up from local populations to drive regional characteristics of population cycling and spatial synchronization.
   Location Forest in the US Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region.
   Methods We tested hypotheses linking variation in vital rates of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus), a declining species that displays decadal population cycles, to temperature and precipitation anomalies and land use intensity, using rate estimates from multiple locations in eastern North America. We used climatedemographic linkages to simulate spatially explicit population dynamics from 1982 to 2069, evaluated predictions against monitoring data and assessed predicted population dynamics under future climate projections.
   Results Nest success and winter survival were linked to temperature and precipitation anomalies, and demographic models explained important spatiotemporal characteristics of cycling and synchrony in monitoring data. The climate-driven vital rates were necessary for cycling and synchrony in models, even though the four included climate variables were not individually periodic. Cycling and synchrony were stronger at more northerly latitudes, but this transition occurred abruptly, reflecting regional variation in winter conditions. Forecasts suggested climate-driven cycling through mid-century, followed by desynchronization and dampening.
   Main conclusions Climate variability can drive spatio-temporal variation in demographic rates, and population cycling can result from these relationships. Pathways linking climate to broad-scale population dynamics involve responses of vital rates to several climate variables at different times of year and may be more complex than direct responses to known modes of climate variability. The wide-ranging impact of climate change on the demographics of northerly adapted species has the potential to degrade patterns of population synchrony and cycling.

AB  - We have used an experimentally based strategy to address molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation in Fundulus heteroclitus. In an attempt to falsify the hypothesis that selection is a major driving force in the maintenance of genetic diversity, we employed a multidisciplinary approach including allelic isozyme and mtDNA phylogeography, kinetic analyses of allelic isozymes, analysis of variation in coding and regulatory DNA sequences, metabolic biochemistry, organismal physiology, and selection experiments. Observed differences in gene structure and expression led us to make testable predictions about differences in metabolic flux, whole organism performance, and differential survival between allotypes. We have shown that variation in the lactate dehydrogenase-B (Ldh-B) protein results in differences in physiological function and is correlated with differences in survival at high temperatures. Recent work has investigated the role of variation in Ldh-B expression. There are differences in the levels of Ldh-B protein, mRNA, and transcription rate. We have addressed the mechanisms responsible for differences in transcription rate by a combination of sequence comparison; DNase I footprinting, and functional analyses both in vitro and in vivo. We have shown that variation in the regulatory sequence of Ldh-B is responsible for the differences in transcription rate between populations and that the patterns of variation are inconsistent with a neutral model of molecular evolution. This functional differentiation, coupled with departures from neutral expectations, suggests that natural selection has acted on the regulation of Ldh-B. This article illustrates the value of a multidisciplinary approach in addressing problems in gene structure, expression, and evolutionary adaptation. J. Exp. Zool. 282:71-94, 1998.

AB  - Immune function is likely to be a critical determinant of an organism's fitness, yet most natural animal and plant populations exhibit tremendous genetic variation for immune traits. Accumulating evidence suggests that environmental heterogeneity may retard the long-term efficiency of natural selection and even maintain polymorphism, provided alternative host genotypes are favoured under different environmental conditions. 'Environment' in this context refers to abiotic factors such as ambient temperature or availability of nutrient resources, genetic diversity of pathogens or competing physiological demands on the host. These factors are generally controlled in laboratory experiments measuring immune performance, but variation in them is likely to be very important in the evolution of resistance to infection. Here, we review some of the literature emphasizing the complexity of natural selection on immunity. Our aim is to describe how environmental and genetic heterogeneities, often excluded from experimentation as 'noise', may determine the evolutionary potential of populations or the potential for interacting species to coevolve.

AB  - Development of thermostable phytases through biotechnology is a key issue in food and feed industry. Phytases ought to be stable at elevated temperatures since it has to withstand feed and food processing steps. Thermostable catalysts have been an area of extensive research since long and several studies have focused on understanding the critical structural features contributing to their stability curve. Recently, the explosion of high resolution structure and availability of sequence information of stable phytases have enforced the researchers to implement similar strategies successfully to bring together these desirable traits into a single enzyme. Nature has tailored unique stabilizing features in diverse classes of phytase, understanding these critical elements and using a single or combination of potential in vitro evolutionary strategies would help phytase to reach the fitness peak in near future. Here we review some recent studies on structural elements contributing to thermostability in phytases of different microbial sources and to summarize the beneficial effect of diverse criterion taken up to generate optimized phytase.

AB  - Recent climate studies have predicted a future with longer, more intense, and more frequent heat events. Evolving challenges presented by this paradigm necessitate an assessment of current efforts to warn for extreme heat events. NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) issue Excessive Heat Watch, Excessive Heat Warning, and Heat Advisory products as conditions warrant. In the fall of 2013 the NWS conducted an internal assessment with its WFOs to 1) document variations in the usage of heat-based watch, warning, and advisory hazard messages (products) across the country; 2) learn about the degree to which locally developed criteria are applied to forecaster decision-making processes in issuing these products; and 3) gather ideas for enhancing communication of expected excessive heat events in general. Survey responses indicate that WFOs selectively use one or a combination of products, and that various methodologies are used to develop criteria for issuing heat products. Given that forecasters use meteorological and nonmeteorological factors when deciding to issue heat products, forecaster judgment is a crucial element of the warning process. Results also revealed partner confusion due to inconsistent heat product issuance criteria. Suggestions were made for eliminating or revising existing products and policies, or creating new products, policies, or issuance criteria. Results of the survey led the NWS to investigate approaches for achieving higher levels of consistency in heat product issuance criteria, and to engage health partners to examine how heat product issuance criteria could incorporate the known health impacts of heat exposure.

AB  - Freezing and dehydration are two common food preservation processes, which, in part, function through the modification of the aqueous environment within the food. In both processes, the mobile aqueous phase becomes more concentrated either as freezing progresses, and more ice is formed, or as dehydration progresses, and more water is removed. The roles of concentration and temperature in the evolution of the various stresses experienced by frozen and dehydrated systems are compared, and the additional influence of the presence of ice in frozen systems is examined. The mechanisms of the stresses, the results of the stress, and means to minimize these effects are discussed. Factors considered include osmotic stress, ionic strength effects, volumetric stresses, the influence of phase changes, and the roles of non-ionic and polymeric solutes. These factors are discussed both in terms of model systems, and in terms of a variety of food systems preserved by freezing or by dehydration, and the maintenance of viability in biological systems subjected to freezing or dehydration stresses.

AB  - 4-Hydroxyderricin is a heat labile bioactive chalcone isolated from the plant Angelica keiskei. It received attention due to its antibiotic potency against several strains of bacteria including pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. Despite these promising pharmacological properties, the exact mode of action or the biological targets are still unknown. Here we report the synthesis and the application of a 4-hydroxyderricin probe for activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) in S. aureus. Due to the heat sensitivity of the natural product we utilize a chemical tool for the mild and selective enrichment of labile probe-protein conjugates and report seryl-tRNA synthetase (STS) to be covalently modified by our probe. This modification results in inhibition of the amino acylation of tRNAs catalyzed by S. aureus STS which is an essential enzymatic pathway for bacterial viability.

AB  - Despite considerable advances in recent years for the focal treatment of localized prostate cancer, high recurrence rates and detrimental side effects are still a cause for concern. In this review, we compare current focal therapies to a potentially novel approach for the treatment of early onset prostate cancer: low temperature plasma. The rapidly evolving plasma technology has the potential to deliver a wide range of promising medical applications via the delivery of plasma-induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Studies assessing the effect of low temperature plasma on cell lines and xenografts have demonstrated DNA damage leading to apoptosis and reduction in cell viability. However, there have been no studies on prostate cancer, which is an obvious candidate for this novel therapy. We present here the potential of low temperature plasma as a focal therapy for prostate cancer.

AB  - Objective. To analyze the feeding behavior of 50 Peltocephalus dumerilianus hatchlings (Testudines Podocnemididae) under different temperature conditions in laboratory. Materials and methods. The individuals for this experiment were obtained by incubation in the laboratory. They were divided randomly into 5 groups. Temperature trials were conducted for 2 months with 3 repetitions per week, using electric heaters. Temperatures were recorded continuously using a digital thermometer -10 to + 60 degrees C (+/- 0.1 degrees C). Temperatures were increased 0.25 degrees C every 10 minutes until reaching the selected temperature, which was then maintained for 60 minutes for each test. The temperatures selected for tests, were 26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 34 degrees C, 38 degrees C, with an ambient temperature of 26.8 degrees C. We evaluated: feeding duration (in minutes), consumption (in volume), the time which turtles began agonistic behavior, and two characteristic displays: biting and disputes over food. Results. In general all parameters were significant, the higher the temperature the longer the time of ingestion; the lower the temperature the lower the consumption volume; the lower the temperature the greater the time to initiation of agonistic behavior, demonstrating an inverse relationship. Conclusions. There was a direct relationship between environmental temperature and feeding processes. Temperature was also related to basic aspects of behavior during agonistic displays.

AB  - It is difficult to establish an accurate mechanism model for prediction incinerator temperatures due to the comprehensive complexity of the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration process. In this paper, feature variables of incineration temperature are selected by combining with mutual information (MI), genetic algorithms (GAs) and stochastic configuration networks (SCNs), and the SCN-based incinerator temperature model is obtained simultaneously. Firstly, filter feature selection is realized by calculating the MI value between each feature variable and the incinerator temperature from historical data. Secondly, the fitness function of GAs is defined by the root mean square error of the incinerator temperature obtained by training SCNs, and features obtained by MI methods are searched iteratively to complete the wrapper feature selection, where the SCN-based incinerator temperature prediction model is obtained. Finally, the proposed model is verified by MSW incinerator temperature historical data. The results show that the SCN-based prediction model using the hybrid selection method can better predict the change trend of incinerator temperature, which proves that the SCNs has great development potential in the field of prediction modeling.

AB  - We studied the thermophilic response to feeding of a typical desert adapted anuran from the Monte Desert. Our aim was to evaluate thermal changes in the selected body temperature of adult frogs of Pleurodema nebulosum, and measure the intestinal passage time, and food digestion. Our results show that after feeding, they selected higher micro-environmental temperatures similar to + 2 degrees C than frogs that remained starved. Pleurodema nebulosum would present a postprandial thermophilic response. The time of retention of food in the digestive tract was thermo-dependent, being lower in those individuals who were incubated at high temperatures (25 degrees C) compared to those subjected to lower temperatures (20 degrees C). Although we did not detect effects of temperature on digestive efficiency, the mass of faecal material indicates an increase at temperatures closer to the selected ones, suggesting that the defecation rate is influenced by temperature. Laiuoperinae frogs are characterized by explosive breeding behavior and fast growing rate. The digestive efficiency is essential for acquiring energy necessary for growth, reproduction and refuge-seeking, among others. In this framework, the differential selection of temperatures between moments of fasting and feeding allows the frogs to maintain a high digestive efficiency, maximizing the absorption of nutrients.

AB  - Although temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) has been a 'hot topic' for well over 30 years, the discovery of TSD in viviparous taxa is recent. Viviparity and TSD was regarded unlikely on theoretical grounds as viviparity allows for high stable developmental temperatures through maternal basking. However, pregnant squamates of many species choose different body temperatures from non-pregnant females and males, and we now know that differential temperature selection by viviparous species with TSD allows for the production of sons or daughters. Three species of squamate reptiles (all are skinks) are now know to exhibit TSD. The physiological mechanism by which viviparous reptiles control the sex of their offspring is not understood, but exposure to different operational sex ratios in the adult population is a factor in some species. The functional role of sex steroid hormones in egg yolk and how the hormones are manipulated in utero is still an area requiring detailed investigation. Fast maturing squamate reptiles provide an excellent, but as yet underutilized, model system for studying the adaptive significance of TSD, and the occurrence of TSD in viviparous species requires substantially more work on a phylogenetically diverse range of species.

AB  - Global climate change poses a serious threat to the future health of coral reef ecosystems. This calls for management strategies that are focused on maximizing the evolutionary potential of coral reefs. Fundamental to this is an accurate understanding of the spatial genetic structure in dominant reef-building coral species. In this study, we apply a genotyping- by-sequencing approach to investigate genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity, gene flow, and local adaptation in a reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, across 10 degrees of latitude and a transition from temperate to tropical waters. We identified strong patterns of differentiation and reduced genetic diversity in high-latitude populations. In addition, genome-wide scans for selection identified a number of outlier loci putatively under directional selection with homology to proteins previously known to be involved in heat tolerance in corals and associated with processes such as photoprotection, protein degradation, and immunity. This study provides genomic evidence for both restricted gene flow and local adaptation in a widely distributed coral species, and highlights the potential vulnerability of leading-edge populations to rapid environmental change as they are locally adapted, reproductively isolated, and have reduced levels of genetic diversity.

AB  - In the face of climate change, populations have two survival options - they can remain in situ and tolerate the new climatic conditions ("stay"), or they can move to track their climatic niches ("go"). For sessile and small-stature organisms like alpine plants, staying requires broad climatic tolerances, realized niche shifts due to changing biotic interactions, acclimation through plasticity, or rapid genetic adaptation. Going, in contrast, requires good dispersal and colonization capacities. Neither the magnitude of climate change experienced locally nor the capacities required for staying/going in response to climate change are constant across landscapes, and both aspects may be strongly affected by local microclimatic variation associated with topographic complexity. We combine ideas from population and community ecology to discuss the effects of topographic complexity in the landscape on the immediate "stay" or "go" opportunities of local populations and communities, and on the selective pressures that may have shaped the stay or go capacities of the species occupying contrasting landscapes. We demonstrate, using example landscapes of different topographical complexity, how species' thermal niches could be distributed across these landscapes, and how these, in turn, may affect many population and community ecological processes that are related to adaptation or dispersal. Focusing on treeless alpine or Arctic landscapes, where temperature is expected to be a strong determinant, our theorethical framework leads to the hypothesis that populations and communities of topographically complex (rough and patchy) landscapes should be both more resistant and more resilient to climate change than those of topographically simple (flat and homogeneous) landscapes. Our theorethical framework further points to how meta-community dynamics such as mass effects in topographically complex landscapes and extinction lags in simple landscapes, may mask and delay the long-term outcomes of these landscape differences under rapidly changing climates.

AB  - The unique geography of the Indian subcontinent has provided diverse natural environments for a variety of organisms. In this region, many ecological indices such as temperature and humidity vary predictably as a function of both latitude and altitude; these environmental parameters significantly affect fundamental dynamics of natural populations. Indian drosophilids are diverse in their geographic distribution and climate tolerance, possibly as a result of climatic adaptation. These associations with environmental parameters are further reflected in a large number of clines that have been reported for various fitness traits along these geographical ranges. This unique amalgamation of environmental variability and genetic diversity make the subcontinent an ecological laboratory for studying evolution in action. We assembled data collected over the last 20 years on the geographical clines for various phenotypic traits in several species of drosophilids and present a web-resource on Indian-Drosophila (http://www.indian-drosophila.org/). The clinal data on ecologically relevant phenotypes of Indian drosophilids will be useful in addressing questions related to future challenges in biodiversity and ecosystems in this region.

AB  - Local adaptation is important when predicting arthropod-borne disease risk because of its impacts on vector population fitness and persistence. However, the extent that vector populations are adapted to the environment generally remains unknown. Despite low population structure and high gene flow in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes across Panama, excepting the province of Bocas del Toro, we identified 128 candidate SNPs, clustered within 17 genes, which show a strong genomic signal of local environmental adaptation. This putatively adaptive variation occurred across fine geographical scales with the composition and frequency of candidate adaptive loci differing between populations in wet tropical environments along the Caribbean coast and dry tropical conditions typical of the Pacific coast. Temperature and vegetation were important predictors of adaptive genomic variation in Ae. aegypti with several potential areas of local adaptation identified. Our study lays the foundations of future work to understand whether environmental adaptation in Ae. aegypti impacts the arboviral disease landscape and whether this could either aid or hinder efforts of population control.

AB  - In this research a hybrid thermochemical and biochemical approach is proposed to produce biocarbon, biomethane and biofertilizer from corn residue using the concept of resource recovery from biowaste. In this approach, corn residue is first pretreated in hydrothermal carbonization process to produce solid biocarbon. Hydrothermal process water, a co-product of hydrothermal carbonization process underwent fast anaerobic digestion to produce biomethane and biofertilizer. Effects of operating conditions (process temperature and residence time) on both biocarbon and hydrothermal process water contents were studied. Four selected hydrothermal temperatures of 200 degrees C, 220 degrees C, 240 degrees C and 260 degrees C and their three corresponding residence times of 10 min, 20 min and 30 min were considered. Among these 12 hydro thermal processes, 240 degrees C for 30 min process produced hybrid bioenergy of 14.26 MJkg(-1) of raw corn residue with an overall energy yield of 78.65%. Biocarbon produced at 240 degrees C for 30 min and 260 degrees C for 10 -30 min were comparable to pulverized coal used in power plants, which contained high heating values of 23.01 MJkg(-1) to 24.70 MJkg(-1). All anaerobic digestion digestate are nutrient enriched and useable as liquid fertilizer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A modern injection mould is a high-technology tool for mass production. The products typically have to meet high quality demands because they are often visible to the user. In order to manufacture high quality parts, the temperature of the mould has to be kept at an appropriate level and the temperature has to be equally distributed within the form. A net of interconnected deep-hole bores leads a water-oil emulsion to the critical areas for controlling the temperatures in the tool. Usually, the layout of the bores is constructed by means of human expert knowledge. In this paper an objective mathematical measure for the multiobjective quality of a mould temperature control system is introduced. Two different encoding approaches for cooling systems are compared. An approach to solve the complex layout problem using an evolutionary algorithm is described. To show the complexity of this multiobjective problem and to interpret and compare the quality of the existing algorithms, a new software environment called KEA (kit for evolutionary algorithms) is used.

AB  - To improve the thermodynamic efficiency of aircraft engine and other gas turbine engines, higher and higher pressure ratios are desired in conjunction with more refined engine cycles. In the high pressure compressor, higher pressure ratios result in lower aspect blades and enhanced sensitivity of the engine design to radial clearance effects.
   The tip clearance in the axial flow compressor of modern commercial civil aero-engines is of critical importance in terms of both mechanical integrity and performance. Typically as the clearance between the compressor blade tips and the casing increases, the aerodynamic efficiency will decrease and therefore the specific fuel consumption and operating costs will increase, and the clearance is therefore of critical importance to civil airline operators and their customers alike. A design exercise was performed and a series of conceptual solutions were developed using the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) process and their potential viability in clearance control was investigated with thermal modelling. TRIZ was selected as an appropriate tool as the issue was long-standing having been the focus of previous projects, and robust design solutions were being sought.
   In order to validate the concepts, use was made of a test facility developed at the University of Sussex, incorporating a rotor and an inner shaft scaled down from a Rolls Royce Trent aero-engine to a ratio of 0.7:1. The mechanical design of the test facility allows the simulation of flow conditions in the HP compressor cavity equivalent to the Trent 1000 aero-engine, with a rotational speed of up to 10000 rpm. The idle and maximum take-off conditions in the square cycle correspond to in-cavity rotational Reynolds numbers of 3.1 x 10(6) <= Re-phi <= 1.0 x 10(7). The finite element thermomechanical model has been built to validate the engine measurements. This paper describes the use of TRIZ and the development of a selected concept and the detailed evaluation for reduction and control of tip clearance in HP compressors. This was achieved through the reduction in the compressor disc heat expansion time constant by improving drum heat transfer using bleed air from the compressor core flow. This paper explores the trade-offs between clearance and efficiency and develops and explores concepts to control the compressor tip clearance throughout the engine operating cycle. The project involved modelling of potential solutions and use of experimental facilities, a rotating compressor cavity rig, in order to explore the physical principles and demonstrate proof of concept for controlling tip clearance in HP compressors of gas turbine engines.

AB  - Physical adsorbents are conventionally supposed to work at a normal temperature (298 K). However, elevating the working temperature can also restrain the adsorption of effective gas and may improve the adsorbent performance. Temperature variation is demonstrated to be a way to regulate the adsorbent performance. In this study, a coal-based activated carbon was synthesized and characterized. The CO2 and H-2 adsorption capacities are inversely associated with the adsorption temperature, and a larger adsorption heat does not mean a higher adsorption capacity. Although the CO2 adsorption capacity is much higher than that of H-2, sometimes the H-2 adsorption capacity is more sensitive to the temperature. The adsorption selectivity for CO, over H-2 improves when the temperature rises from 298 to 353 K A four-bed pressure swing adsorption (PSA) model was developed on the basis of an on-site pilot-scale PSA apparatus to determine the practical separation performance of adsorbents under different working conditions. The simulation results showed that, when the product gas purity is the same, the recovery rate at 353 K is approximately 2% higher than that at 298 K, indicating that the improvement in adsorption selectivity can make up for the declining adsorption capacity. More importantly, the improvement in gas recovery implies a higher energy efficiency or higher productivity. This phenomenon also exists in some other adsorbents reported before, including chemical adsorbents and composite adsorbents.

AB  - Tungsten inert gas welding is popular known welding technique for ferrous & nonferrous. Stainless steel grade 3HQ (S30430) is a specialized wire grade with very wide usage for manufacturer of stainless steel fastener. It has now totally replaced Grade 384 and 305 for heading application. The stable austenitic structure makes 302HQ nonmagnetic, even after substantial cold work, and also results in excellent toughness, even down to cryogenic temperatures. This paper attempts in optimizing the Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding process parameter. The effect of various parameters and their influence is important to determine the strength of welded joint. To obtain a good quality weld, it is therefore, essential to control the input welding parameters. Therefore appropriate selection of input welding parameter is necessary in order to obtain a good quality weld and subsequently increase the productivity of manufacturing industry. This paper present multi objective optimization using grey relation analysis (GRA) for S30430 with TIG process to determine the suitable selection of parameters. Experiment were conducted according to Taguchi's design of experiments (DOE) with orthogonal array L9 is used, mathematical model was developed using parameters such as speed (mm/min), current (Amp), voltage (V), depth of penetration (mm). After conducting experiment and collecting data, signal to noise ratio were determined by using Minitab18 and it is used to obtain optimum level for every input parameter.

AB  - A mathematical model, including the main morphological features of the polymerization process, is developed to study olefin polymerization with supported metallocene catalysts. Because the relatively large amount of methyl alumoxane (MAO) usually needed as a cocatalyst represents a disadvantage, the model introduces a scheme that simulates the results of the efforts being made in a supported catalyst to reduce MAO requirements to commercially acceptable levels. Critical fragmentation steps in the initial support-catalyst particles that render all active sites effectively available to the monomer are specifically considered, on the basis of the support morphological characteristics. With the available reaction data, fragmentation representation alternatives are discussed and a scheme proposed. Then, a mathematical model is developed based on the above representation scheme, to calculate monomer-concentration, temperature, and macroparticle-size evolutions. The main features of the scheme are displayed and discussed. Both for laboratory and high-productivity conditions, the model is used to predict changes in macro- and microparticle size, porosity, and concentration distribution. Predictions are employed to evaluate the impact of the initial support microparticle arrangement and fragmentation processes on the overall catalyst performance. Polymer yield, concentration profiles, and temperature transients predicted by the model are presented, showing the model application after verifying its accordance with the available experimental data.

AB  - The evolutionary model escape from adaptive conflict (EAC) posits that adaptive conflict between the old and an emerging new function within a single gene could drive the fixation of gene duplication, where each duplicate can freely optimize one of the functions. Although EAC has been suggested as a common process in functional evolution, definitive cases of neofunctionalization under EAC are lacking, and the molecular mechanisms leading to functional innovation are not well-understood. We report here clear experimental evidence for EAC-driven evolution of type III antifreeze protein gene from an old sialic acid synthase (SAS) gene in an Antarctic zoarcid fish. We found that an SAS gene, having both sialic acid synthase and rudimentary ice-binding activities, became duplicated. In one duplicate, the N-terminal SAS domain was deleted and replaced with a nascent signal peptide, removing pleiotropic structural conflict between SAS and ice-binding functions and allowing rapid optimization of the C-terminal domain to become a secreted protein capable of noncolligative freezing-point depression. This study reveals how minor functionalities in an old gene can be transformed into a distinct survival protein and provides insights into how gene duplicates facing presumed identical selection and mutation pressures at birth could take divergent evolutionary paths.

AB  - Fingerling Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus were held in water recirculating systems for 4-5 weeks under selected combinations of temperature and salinity: 30 degrees C and 35 parts per thousand (reference environment), 34 degrees C and 45%, or 34 degrees C and 55%. At the end of the culture period, condition factor, hematocrit, plasma osmolality, plasma lactate concentration, plasma glucose concentration, and liver glycogen content were determined. Responses of fish in the warm, hypersaline treatments did not differ significantly from fish in the reference treatment. Based on the results of this study, juvenile Red Drum can tolerate warm, hypersaline conditions for several weeks with no apparent detrimental effects if slowly acclimated to environmental temperature and salinity as long as food is not limiting and other water quality characteristics are acceptable.

AB  - Pakistan is one of those countries which are victim of climate change and is already facing many problems like poverty and food insecurity leading to threats to agriculture expansion. Climate change is ahead of all these due to decreasing agriculture production prolonged water scarcity and declined income growth. Agriculture plays a big role in economy of Pakistan and climate change is matter of serious concern. The main objective of the present study was to find out the factors affecting the strategies of farmers regarding the impact of climate change in Punjab, Pakistan. Three districts from rice-wheat cropping zone (Narowal, Sialkot and Gujranwala) were selected randomly. A total sample of four hundred eight respondents was selected by systematic random sample technique. A well-structured interview schedule was used as research instrument for data collection. Collected data were analyzed statistically. In addition, descriptive and inferential statistics were applied for the data analysis. It was found that education level of the farmers was low in the study area. Most farmers had small land holdings and were used to self-cultivation. Mean area of wheat and rice was 7.31 +/- 6.06 and 6.25 +/- 5.60 acres, respectively. It was observed that long summer and short winter season and high temperature were the main perceptions of climate change in the study area. Industrial smoke, excessive felling of forests and human activities were also perceived as the factors leading to change in environment. A vast majority of the farmers observed that climate change had negative impact on crop production and annual income. It was also found that recommended varieties (2.58 +/- 0.72), applying more industrial pesticides (2.50 +/- 0.76) and practicing crop diversification (2.36 +/- 0.81), increased use of irrigation (2.19 +/- 0.89) and integrated farming system (0 2.15 +/- 0.91) were the major coping strategies for minimizing the effect of climate changes and these strategies had positive impact on crop productivity. Binary Logistic Model showed that increase in education, income, agricultural experience, contributes in to adoption of strategies to cope climate changes of farmers. It is recommended that farmers should use approved varieties, fertilizers and practice crop diversification. Investment on improved agricultural technology by government and other stakeholders are very necessary for agriculture to be able to cope with climate change.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains a serious issue, and the role played by meteorological indicators in the process of virus spread has been a topic of academic discussion. Previous studies reached different conclusions due to inconsistent methods, disparate meteorological indicators, and specific time periods or regions. This manuscript is based on seven daily meteorological indicators in the NCEP reanalysis data set and COVID-19 data repository of Johns Hopkins University from 22 January 2020 to 1 June 2021. Results showed that worldwide average temperature and precipitable water (PW) had the strongest correlation (p > 0.9, p < 0.001) with the confirmed COVID-19 cases per day from 22 January to 31 August 2020. From 22 January to 31 August 2020, positive correlations were observed between the temperature/ PW and confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths in the northern hemisphere, whereas negative correlations were recorded in the southern hemisphere. From 1 September to 31 December 2020, the opposite results were observed. Correlations were weak throughout the near full year, and weak negative correlations were detected worldwide (vertical bar rho vertical bar < 0.4, p <= 0.05); the lag time had no obvious effect. As the latitude increased, the temperature and PW of the maximum confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths per day generally showed a decreasing trend; the 2020-year fitting functions of the response latitude pattern were verified by the 2021 data. Meteorological indicators, although not a decisive factor, may influence the virus spread by affecting the virus survival rates and enthusiasm of human activities. The temperature or PW threshold suitable for the spread of COVID-19 may increase as the latitude decreases.
   Plain Language Summary Climate change has altered life's living environment; humans seem to be able to adapt to climate change within a certain range. This adaptability seems to be human talent, but how about a coronavirus? The impact of environmental variables on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread varies between regions. The two meteorological variables that are most likely to affect the distribution of COVID-19 have significant latitude patterns, which means that in areas with higher climate temperatures, the temperature range for the maximum spread of COVID-19 is higher, while in areas with lower climate temperatures, the temperature for the maximum spread of COVID-19 is lower. Perhaps it indicates that the virus also has the ability to adapt to climate change, even more so than humanity. The complete cessation of COVID-19 pandemic requires everyone's efforts.

AB  - Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) distribute a steep gradient of environmental stress between intertidal and subtidal habits and provide insight into population-scale patterns and underlying processes of variation in physiological tolerance. In this study, 1-year-old-F-1 oysters, collected from subtidal and intertidal habitats, were obtained after common garden experiment. Genetic differentiation and physiological responses under air exposure were examined to determine whether they had evolved into local adapted subpopulations. Mortality rate, anaerobic glycolysis metabolism, and energy status indicated that oyster had initiated metabolism depression and anaerobic glycolysis metabolism in both intertidal and subtidal oysters under air exposure. However, the subtidal oysters displayed the larger energy metabolism depressions and the earlier anaerobic glycolysis responses. This may indicate that subtidal oysters were more sensitives to hypoxia stress, which may lead the higher mortality rate under long term of air exposure. Based on a common garden experimental design, we propose that this diversification may have a genetic background. Overall, the clear differences between intertidal and subtidal oysters under air exposure have provided an important reference for their aquaculture and transportation used in commercial production.

AB  - Understanding what determines range expansion or extinction is crucial to predict the success of biological invaders. We tackled this longstanding question from an unparalleled perspective using the failed expansions in Littorina saxatilis and investigated its present and past habitat suitability in Europe through Ecological Niche Modelling. This intertidal snail is a typically successful Atlantic colonizer and the earliest confirmed alien species in the Mediterranean Sea, where, however, it failed to thrive despite its high dispersal ability and adaptability. We explored the environmental constraints affecting its biogeography, identified potential glacial refugia in Europe that fuelled its post-glacial colonisations and tested whether the current gaps in its distribution are linked to local ecological features. Our results suggested that L. saxatilis is unlikely to be a glacial relict in the Mediterranean basin. Multiple Atlantic glacial refugia occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum, and abiotic environmental features such as salinity and water temperature have influenced the past and current distributions of this snail and limited its invasion of the Mediterranean Sea. The snail showed a significant overlap in geographic space and ecological niche with Carcinus maenas, the Atlantic predator, but distinct from Pachygrapsus marmoratus, the Mediterranean predator, further pointing to Atlantic-like habitat requirements for this species. Abiotic constrains during introduction rather than dispersal abilities have shaped the past and current range of L. saxatilis and help explaining why some invasions have not been successful. Our findings contribute to clarifying the processes constraining or facilitating shifts in species' distributions and biological invasions.

AB  - Changing global climate due to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are driving rapid changes in the physical and chemical environment of the oceans via warming, deoxygenation, and acidification. These changes may threaten the persistence of species and populations across a range of latitudes and depths, including species that support diverse biological communities that in turn provide ecological stability and support commercial interests. Worldwide, but particularly in the North Atlantic and deep Gulf of Mexico, Lophelia pertusa forms expansive reefs that support biological communities whose diversity rivals that of tropical coral reefs. In this study, L. pertusa colonies were collected from the Viosca Knoll region in the Gulf of Mexico (390 to 450 m depth), genotyped using microsatellite markers, and exposed to a series of treatments testing survivorship responses to acidification, warming, and deoxygenation. All coral nubbins survived the acidification scenarios tested, between pH of 767 and 7.90 and aragonite saturation states of 0.92 and 1.47. However, net calcification generally declined with respect to pH, though a disparate response was evident where select individuals net calcified and others exhibited net dissolution near a saturation state of 1. Warming and deoxygenation both had negative effects on survivorship, with up to 100% mortality observed at temperatures above 14 degrees C and oxygen concentrations of approximately 1.5 ml.l(-1). These results suggest that, over the short-term, climate change and OA may negatively impact L. pertusa in the Gulf of Mexico, though the potential for acclimation and the effects of genetic background should be considered in future research.

AB  - Heteroplasmy, the presence of more than one type of mtDNA within cells, is common in animals and has been associated with aging and disease in humans, Changes in the frequencies of mtDNA variants between cell and animal generations thus bears on the evolution of mtDNA and the progression of diverse pathologies. We have used densitometry of Southern blots of individual heteroplasmic Drosophila melanogaster to study the effects of age, increased egg production after mating, and temperature on evolution of heteroplasmy within and between generations, The frequency of the longer mtDNA variant consistently increased between early and late cohorts of F-1 offspring derived from 18 independent heteroplasmic mothers as they aged, Neither temperature (flies maintained at 25 degrees C and 18 degrees C) nor the holding of flies as virgins for 10 days before mating had significant effects on transmission patterns, However, at the ends of their lives, flies that had laid eggs at 25 degrees C had a greater frequency of the long mtDNA than did their siblings who had laid eggs at 18 degrees C, The evolution of heteroplasmy within a generation was studied in samples of siblings that either were mated or held as virgins, and then scored for mtDNA haplotype frequencies at two different ages (day 2 and day 14), Mated flies showed a significantly greater increase in the frequency of the long mtDNA variant with age than did the unmated flies, This system provides a model for the joint analysis of generational and chronological age in the transmission dynamics of a molecular polymorphism.

AB  - Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (red palm weevil) is highly susceptible to infection by the entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. However, to reach and penetrate the insect in its habitat with good efficacy, the nematode infective juveniles (IJs) need to move through the tunnels bored by the feeding insect larvae in the tree trunk. We used a genetic-improvement approach to enhance host-seeking ability (HSA) of these nematode species' IJs. The IJs were allowed to move through a 45-cm L-shaped tube toward red palm weevil larvae. The IJs which reached within 5 cm of the insect larvae were collected and reared. Selection cycles were repeated 15 times. The HSA of S. carpocapsae IJs was enhanced 11-fold (from 3.7 to 39.8% of all IJs reaching proximity of the larvae) and 8.5-fold (from 2.3 to 19.7%) for H. bacteriophora after 10 cycles of selection. Further selections (cycles 11-15) had no significant impact on improving HSA. HSA of the selected lines was highly specific to R. ferrugineus larvae. Selection for improved HSA also enhanced infectivity to R. ferrugineus, Galleria mellonella and Spodoptera littoralis. In addition, it enhanced host penetration 2.7-fold for S. carpocapsae and 1.5-fold for H. bacteriophora, and desiccation tolerance improved 1.2- and 1.7-fold, respectively. Heat tolerance and fecundity of the selected lines were somewhat reduced (MT50 by factors of 1.02 and 1.2 and fecundity by factors of 0.93 and 0.99, respectively) as compared to the foundation population. Improved HSA with substantial improvement of other traits may enhance field performance of these biocontrol agents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cold acclimation is one of the important factors in temperature adaptation for insects needing to make rapid adjustment to the seasonal temperature changes in their living environment. In a fruit fly species, Drosophila albomicans, which has a tropical origin and currently has a wide geographic distribution extended into Asian temperate regions, cold tolerance in terms of survival time at 1 degrees C of adult flies reared at 25 degrees C was substantially improved by a cold acclimation at 20 degrees C for several days. Examining 29 isofemale lines from widely distributed natural populations, we observed a substantial variation in their acclimation response. However, the acclimation response was not necessarily stronger in the strains from the recently colonized temperate regions. A significantly stronger acclimation response was detected in male flies of the temperate strains when compared to those of the tropical strains. D. albomicans also showed stronger cold tolerance compared to its closely related species belonging to the D. nasuta subgroup. Among these strains, we detected a strong positive correlation between the cold tolerance change and the metabolic rate change upon the cold acclimation, suggesting their strong physiological association regulated by common genetic factors, which may have been the target of natural selection for the temperature adaptation. The response to deacclimation and reacclimation suggested that a systematic change in gene expressions is the main molecular mechanism for the cold acclimation to have effects on the cold tolerance and metabolic rate changes.

AB  - The ecological and economic importance of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden) in British Columbia (BC) has heightened interest in the adaptability and effective management of the species, especially as climate changes. The relationship between climate and the seed production of natural populations is a key management issue that has yet to be assessed. The purpose of this study is to determine if variation in P. contorta seed yield is related to the climate of BC.
   Regional differences in the seed production of lodgepole pine were examined using 1924 archived seedlot collections across 18 different natural stand seed planning zones (SPZs) in BC. The relationship between climate variation and the seed production of P. contorta was then evaluated using dynamically downscaled output from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM).
   Seed production is relatively consistent across SPZs spanning a wide range of climate regimes, with the exception of Nass Skeena Transition (NST) where seed yield is an order of magnitude higher than elsewhere. Significant temporal correlations between overall trends in seed production and both temperature and precipitation were found using the CRCM output. However, only three of the 18 SPZs showed a significant overall trend in mean annual seed yield based on cone collections made between 1963 and 2013, suggesting that the reproductive capacity of natural populations is well adapted to decadal-scale climate change. Tolerance to significant variation in climate likely plays an important role in explaining the ability of this species to thrive well outside its natural range. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Loading metal nanoparticles on the surface of solid supports has emerged as an efficient route for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts. Notably, most of these supported metal nanoparticles still have shortcomings such as dissatisfactory activity and low product selectivity in catalysis. In addition, these metal nanoparticles also suffer from deactivation because of nanoparticle sintering, leaching, and coke formation under harsh conditions. The fixation of metal nanoparticles within zeolite crystals should have advantages of high activities for metal nanoparticles and excellent shape selectivity for zeolite micropores as well as extraordinary stability of metal nanoparticles immobilized with a stable zeolite framework, which is a good solution for the shortcomings of supported metal nanoparticles.
   Materials with metal nanostructures within the zeolite crystals are normally denoted as metal@zeolite, where the metal nanoparticles with diameters similar to those of industrial catalysts are usually larger than the micropore size. These metal nanoparticles are enveloped with the zeolite rigid framework to prevent migration under harsh reaction conditions, which is described as a fixed structure. The zeolite micropores allow the diffusion of reactants to the metal nanoparticles. As a result, metal@zeolite catalysts combine the features of both metal nanoparticles (high activity) and zeolites (shape selectivity and thermal stability), compared with the supported metal nanoparticles.
   In this Account, we describe how the zeolite micropore and metal nanoparticle synergistically work to improve the catalytic performance by the preparation of a variety of metal@zeolite catalysts. Multiple functions of zeolites with respect to the metal nanoparticles are highlighted, including control of the reactant/product diffusion in the micropores, the adjustment of reactant adsorption on the metal nanoparticles, and sieving the reactants and products with zeolite micropores. Furthermore, by optimizing the wettability of the zeolite external surface, the zeolite crystals could form a nanoreactor to efficiently enrich the crucial intermediates, thus boosting the performance in low-temperature methane oxidation. Also, the microporous confinement weakens the adsorption of C-1 intermediates on the metal sites, accelerating the C-C coupling to improve C-2 oxygenate productivity in syngas conversion. In particular, the zeolite framework efficiently stabilizes the metal nanoparticles against sintering and leaching to give durable catalysts. Clearly, this strategy not only guides the rational design of efficient heterogeneous catalysts for potential applications in a variety of industrial chemical reactions but also accelerates the fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanisms by providing new model catalysts.

AB  - Background: The concept of homeostasis is often ill-defined, in the scientific literature. The word "homeostasis", literally, indicates the absence of changes and an absolute maintenance of the status quo. The multiplicity of possible examples of homeostasis suggests that it is essentially impossible that all aspects of the composition of the organism and the rate of processes carried out by the organism are simultaneously held constant, when the environment changes are in the non-lethal range.
   Scope: In attempting to clarify the usage of the term homeostasis, I emphasize the probable contributions to evolutionary fitness of homeostasis main attributes: rate processes and compositions. I also attempted to identify the aspects of homeostasis that are most likely to be subject to natural selection.
   Conclusions: The tendency to retain the status quo derives from the interplay of functions (among which growth), metabolic pools and elemental stoichiometry. The set points around which oscillations occur in biological system and their control mechanisms are determined by evolutionary processes; consequently, also the tendency of a cell to be homeostatic with respect to a given set point is selectable. A homeostatic response to external perturbations may be selectively favored when the potential reproductive advantage offered by a reorganization of cell resources cannot be exploited. This is most likely to occur in the case of environmental perturbations of moderate intensity and short duration relative to the growth rate. Under these circumstances, homeostasis may be an energetically and competitively preferable option, because it requires no alteration of the expressed proteome and eliminates the requirement for reverse acclimation, upon cessation of the perturbation. This review also intends to be a stimulus to "ad hoc" experiments to assess the ecological and evolutionary relevance of homeostasis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freeze-tolerance, or the ability to survive internal ice formation, is relatively rare among insects. Larvae of the Antarctic midge Belgica antarctica are freeze-tolerant year-round, but in dry environments, the larvae can remain supercooled (i.e., unfrozen) at subzero temperatures. In previous work with summer-acclimatized larvae, we showed that freezing is considerably more stressful than remaining supercooled. Here, these findings are extended by comparing survival, tissue damage, energetic costs, and stress gene expression in larvae that have undergone an artificial winter acclimation regime and are either frozen or supercooled at -5 degrees C. In contrast to summer larvae, winter larvae survive at -5 degrees C equally well for up to 14 days, whether frozen or supercooled, and there is no tissue damage at these conditions. In subsequent experiments, we measured energy stores and stress gene expression following cold exposure at -5 degrees C for either 24 h or 14 days, with and without a 12 h recovery period. We observed slight energetic costs to freezing, as frozen larvae tended to have lower glycogen stores across all groups. In addition, the abundance of two heat shock protein transcripts, hsp60 and hsp90, tended to be higher in frozen larvae, indicating higher levels of protein damage following freezing. Together, these results indicate a slight cost to being frozen relative to remaining supercooled, which may have implications for the selection of hibernacula and responses to climate change.

AB  - Background: The mechanisms of testicular thermoregulation may influence the blood flow provided by the testicular artery, where the proper blood supply to the testicle is crucial for promotingspermatogenesis and reproductive function in bulls. The size and shape of the testicles are determined by genetic mechanisms and environmental effects. A better understanding of the relationships between the anatomical characteristics of the testicles and scrotum can support a better reproductive assessment. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the testicular temperature of different scrotal shapes using infrared thermography in bulls.
   Materials, Methods & Results: We evaluated 132 Braford bulls with an average age of 24 months. The evaluation of breeding bull semen was performed prior to the beginning of the experiment. Then, animals were selected on the basis of the size of their testes, which was determined by dividing the average width by the average length. The scrotal circumference was measured with a millimeter tape positioned around the largest circumference. Testicular and ocular temperature measurements and analysis were conducted using an infrared thermal camera, Flir T440 with emissivity of 0.98 and thermal sensitivity of 0.05 degrees C. Testicular scrotum temperature and testicular shape were analyzed with one-way ANOVA using Minitab 16, and values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We observed that 67.42% of testicle shapes were long-oval, and 32.58% were long-moderate. The testicular temperature was higher in bulls with the long-moderate shape compared to those with the long-oval shape (P < 0.05). The mean length was higher in long-moderate shaped testicles compared to those of the long-oval shape (P < 0.01). There was no significant differences in rectal and ocular temperatures or in scrotal circumference between bulls with long-moderate and long-oval shapes (P > 0.05). In addition, the mean width was lower in testicles of long-moderate shape compared to those of the long-oval scrotal format (P < 0.01).
   Discussion: The results obtained showed that Braford bulls with the long-moderate testicular shape have a higher testicular temperature to maintain proper thermoregulation. The present study demonstrated that IRT can be used to evaluate the testicular temperature in animals with different scrotal conformations. In this study, Braford bulls showed lower length and width values for animals having long-moderate (9.21 and 5.22, respectively) and long-oval formats (8.56 and 5.56, respectively). In contrast, previous reports examining Nellore bulls between the ages of 17-20 months found a predominance of the long oval shape followed by the long-moderate shape, which indicates a change in testicular shape as age progresses, resulting in a rounder testicular shape. Perhaps other factors, such as the external cremaster muscle and tunica dartos, cause the testicles to be retracted towards the body at lower temperatures while at high temperatures, relaxation occurs. The prevailing testicular shape in Braford animals with a mean age of 24 months was the long-moderate shape. Thus, testicles with a larger surface area will have lower temperatures because they can dissipate heat more easily than testicles with lower surface area. The results suggest that the long-moderate scrotum format may influence the testicular temperature in mature Braford bulls.

AB  - Snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus) populations have declined throughout their range, in part because of habitat degradation and poor nest success, making information regarding regionally specific nest site selection and spatial patterns important when considering habitat conservation and management guidelines. We determined nest site selection characteristics (n?=?180) and examined spatial patterns (n?=?215) of snowy plover nests in saline lakes in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas. At 104 nests, we examined the influence of substrate type on nest temperatures and heat mitigation. Snowy plover nests were more likely to be found near an object, on pebble substrate, and with fewer plants than random sites. High use areas were generally located in areas with pebble substrate and on human-made or natural islands, berms, and peninsulas. Overall, nests placed on pebble substrate had lower temperatures during the day than nests placed on sand substrates. Nest placement on pebble substrate may be valuable to nesting snowy plovers, providing thermal advantages to incubating adults and depressing potentially high nest predation rates. Management guidelines for this region should emphasize the importance of addressing key elements of snowy plover nesting habitat including the presence of pebble substrate and reducing vegetation encroachment.

AB  - Today, the agriculture industry has been developing intellectualization and automation proactively for reducing labor force and increase yields. In the past, farmers usually followed the rule of thumb to grow crops; however, due to the dramatic climate change, it becomes harder for farmers to cope with it by merely following the rule of thumb, which leads to crop damage. Therefore, it is vital to input scientific data development and technology for optimizing the environment parameters of crops and further enhance the yields. Additionally, many farms need to spread pesticides to avoid pests and diseases; yet, too much pesticide may cause soil alkalization. To enrich the growing-power of the lands, farmers will fertilize the lands; nevertheless, too much of it will also cause soil acidification, which will need to leave the land fallow to improve the soil quality. The study provides an intelligent agriculture system based on LSTM. The system develops an Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor the environmental conditions of soil, sunlight, and temperature; additionally, the research combines the information from the Central Weather Bureau for predicting the timing for watering and notifying farmers about the suggested amount of pesticides and fertilizers. The features of this article are as follows: 1. Build a clustering tree of crops according to the adaptability; 2. Calculate the critical values of each selected crop; 3. Develop an LSTM system that provides analyses according to the current soil conditions and weather forecast information; the system will reveal the conditions of the soil, and water the land to balance the condition and reach an optimal status if the soil pH is too high. The research is capable of enhancing crop yields and optimizing the land.

AB  - A Channel-type Molten Salt Fast Reactor (CMSFR) concept is studied to improve the Th-U breeding performance and to reduce the loss ratio of effective delayed neutron fraction (beta(eff)). In the CMSFR, fuel salt is filled in the active zone of the cylindrical core for fission heat generation, while fertile salt is contained in SiC tubes distributed regularly in the core for U-233 breeding and for transferring fission heat from the fuel salt to the secondary loop. To enhance the neutron capture reaction rate of Th-232, both radial and axial Th fertile blankets are adopted. Only a small part of fuel salt in the reprocessing system is adopted for fission products removing and refueling, which reduces significantly the required initial loading of fuel salt compared with a conventional Molten Salt Reactor (MSR). Based on an in-house developed analysis code for reprocessing system of MSR, the Th-U breeding capability of CMSFR with different molten salt reprocessing rates (from 101 per day to 50 1 per day) is simulated for a 50-year operation. The simulated results show that the doubling time of U-233 with U-233 as starting fuel shortens significantly to about 37 years compared with the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). Furthermore, the Th-U breeding capability with Pu, TRU and Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) as starting fuels is also analyzed. The simulated results indicate that the doubling time of U-233 with Pu and TRU as starting fuels is shortened to 22 years and 17 years, respectively. It indicates that both Pu and TRU can be employed for a transition approach to Th-U fuel cycle. The largest molar proportion of Pu with TRU as starting fuel during operation is about 7.1 mol% which is under the Pu solubility limit. Although the Th-U-233 breeding with LEU as starting fuel can also be achieved at the end of life of operation, it needs external U-233 supply (about 0.6 tons) during the first 20 years operation. Both Temperature Reactivity feedback Coefficient (TRC) and beta(eff) for all the starting scenarios are also investigated. The TRC for all the starting scenarios is always negative enough during 50-year operation. The total loss ratio of beta(eff) with U-233, LEU and Pu/TRU as starting fuels is only 13.76%, 13.47% and 13.56%, respectively, which is much smaller than that of the MSFR. Considering the limitation of reactor period T > 15 s, the largest introduced reactivity for U-233, LEU or Pu/TRU as starting fuel shall not be greater than 110 pcm, 202 pcm and 103 pcm, respectively.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that viruses play an influential role within the marine microbial food web. To understand this role, it is important to determine rates and mechanisms of virus removal and degradation, We used plaque assays to examine the decay of infectivity in lab-grown viruses seeded into natural seawater. The rates of loss of infectivity of native viruses from Santa Monica Bay and of nonnative viruses from the North Sea in the coastal seawater of Santa Monica Bay were determined. Viruses were seeded into fresh seawater that had been pretreated in various ways: filtration with a 0.2-mu m-pore-size filter to remove organisms, heat to denature enzymes, and dissolved organic matter enrichment to reconstitute enzyme activity, Seawater samples were then incubated in full sunlight, in the dark, or under glass to allow partitioning of causative agents of virus decay, Solar radiation always resulted in increased rates of loss of virus infectivity, Virus isolates which are native to Santa Monica Bay consistently degraded more slowly in full sunlight in untreated seawater (decay ranged from 4.1 to 7.2% h(-1)) than nonnative marine bacteriophages which were isolated from the North Sea (decay ranged from 6.6 to 11.1% h(-1)). All phages demonstrated susceptibility to degradation by heat-labile substances, as heat treatment reduced the decay rates to about 0.5 to 2.0% h(-1) in the dark, Filtration reduced decay rates by various amounts, averaging 20%. Heat-labile, high-molecular-weight dissolved material (>30 kDa, probably enzymes) appeared responsible for about 1/5 of the maximal decay, Solar radiation was responsible for about 1/3 to 2/3 of the maximal decay of nonnative viruses and about 1/4 to 1/3 of that of the native viruses, suggesting evolutionary adaptation to local light levels. Our results suggest that sunlight is an important contributing factor to virus decay but also point to the significance of particles and dissolved substances in seawater.

AB  - The possibility of using the adaptive capacity of the larvae of marine invertebrates under the variation of environmental parameters was studied as a sensitive test of sea water pollution. The object of the research was the larvae of Cryptonatica janthostoma (Naticidae), the environmental factor was the freshening of sea water, and the toxic factor used was copper ions. Adding copper to sea water at a concentration of 0.005 mg/l did not reveal any pronounced effect on the development, behavior and growth of larvae in conditions of normal salinity (32aEuro degrees), however their adaptive potential decreased with a decrease of salinity to 24aEuro degrees. The results of the present work and experiments carried out previously enabled us to conclude that before assessing any concentration of pollutant as one not affecting marine organisms, it is necessary to investigate not only their development, growth and survival, but also their adaptive capacity relative to the variation of natural environmental parameters, such as even temperature and salinity.

AB  - Temperature, dissolved oxygen, and depth preferences of Jocassee Reservoir rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta implanted with temperature-sensing radio transmitters were determined during July, August, and September 1994-1998. Specific knowledge of these preferences was needed to verify habitat criteria designed to assist in the management of water quality in this reservoir for trout survival in late summer and early fall. Rainbow trout exhibited temperature, dissolved oxygen, and depth preferences in the ranges 8.3-13.4 degreesC, 2.9-8.7 mg/L, and 30.0-52.0 m, respectively, while brown trout exhibited preferences in the ranges 7.5-21.9 degreesC, 4.2-10.0 mg/L, and 14.0-54.0 m, respectively. Even though rainbow trout selected cooler water temperatures and greater depths than brown trout. both species generally exhibited preferences for water 20 degreesC or cooler and containing 5.0 mg/L or more of dissolved oxygen. Maintenance of these criteria in Jocassee Reservoir should ensure adequate habitat for the summer and early fall survival of rainbow and brown trout.

AB  - The development of ectothermic embryos is strongly affected by incubation temperature, and thermal imprinting of body growth and muscle phenotype has been reported in various teleost fishes. The complex epigenetic regulation of muscle development in vertebrates involves DNA methylation of the myogenin promoter. Body growth is a heritable and highly variable trait among fish populations that allows for local adaptations, but also for selective breeding. Here we studied the epigenetic effects of embryonic temperature and genetic background on body growth, muscle cellularity and myogenin expression in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Eggs from salmon families with either high or low estimated breeding values for body growth, referred to as Fast and Slow genotypes, were incubated at 8(circle)C or 4(circle)C until the embryonic 'eyed-stage' followed by rearing at the production temperature of 8(circle)C. Rearing temperature strongly affected the growth rates, and the 8(circle)C fish were about twice as heavy as the 4(circle)C fish in the order Fast8>Slow8>Fast4>Slow4 prior to seawater transfer. Fast8 was the largest fish also at harvest despite strong growth compensation in the low temperature groups. Larval myogenin expression was approximately 4-6 fold higher in the Fast8 group than in the other groups and was associated with relative low DNA methylation levels, but was positively correlated with the expression levels of the DNA methyltransferase genes dnmt1, dnmt3a and dnmt3b. Juvenile Fast8 fish displayed thicker white muscle fibres than Fast4 fish, while Slow 8 and Slow 4 showed no difference in muscle cellularity. The impact of genetic background on the thermal imprinting of body growth and muscle development in Atlantic salmon suggests that epigenetic variation might play a significant role in the local adaptation to fluctuating temperatures over short evolutionary time.

AB  - This study reports the first geochemical and Pb isotopic data for mantle xenoliths from beneath the Neoproterozoic Ribeira Belt, southeastern Brazil. The cm-sized spinel peridotite xenoliths are hosted by a Cretaceous lamprophyre dike that intruded high-grade metamorphic rocks. Major- and trace-element compositions of the main minerals indicate that the xenoliths derive from a shallow fertile mantle that has undergone a low degree of melt extraction (2-9% partial melting). On the basis of modeled isochemical phase diagrams for lherzolites, pressure and temperature conditions are inferred to vary from 1300-1350 degrees C and 17-19 kbar (fertile composition) to 1330-1430 degrees C and 17-23 kbar (relatively depleted composition), which correspond to high geothermal gradients of 65-80 mW/m(2). Temperatures of last equilibration calculated based on the average REE content of pyroxenes for the same lherzolite samples vary from 1233 +/- 56 degrees C to 1085 +/- 42 degrees C, while conventional thermometry (T-BKN) yields average values of 807 and 755 degrees C, indicating re-equilibration at lower temperatures. Pb isotope ratios of clinopyroxene define a mixing line that intercepts the Stacey-Kramers two-stage terrestrial Pb evolution curve at ca. 200 Ma. Linear regressions yield two errorchrons of 56 +/- 75 Ma and 571 +/- 99 Ma (95% confidence level). These results combined with the ages and tectonic settings of host rocks are suggestive of an overprint of a younger tectono-thermal event, most likely related to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, over a mantle previously equilibrated during the Precambrian development of the Ribeira Belt.

AB  - Hierarchical biomorphic ZnO films are prepared by a simple soakage procedure associated with succedent calcination treatment, using natural eggshell membrane (ESM) as the template. The hierarchy of ESM architecture is faithfully achieved by the assembly of ZnO nanocrystallites into interwoven meshwork at three dimensions. The thermal evolution, phase, morphology and pore size distribution of the samples are characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and nitrogen isothermal adsorption measurement. Based on the detailed investigation, a possible synthesis mechanism is discussed here. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change impacts such as an increase in mean temperature, change in precipitation patterns and sea level rise are affecting regional road transportation network (RRTN) in Atlantic Canada. Those impacts cause direct and indirect economic consequences for the network and regional economy. In our study, we constructed a dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGEM) to trace these consequences over time. Basic principles of the designed CGEM are discussed and the model's architecture is presented. The model's elements are estimated, and the obtained CGEM is tested with exogenously imposed shock. Evolutionary dynamics of regional temperature, precipitation and sea level is analyzed on the basis of comprehensive time series analysis. This dynamics will be later imposed on the designed CGEM as external productivity shocks. Some preliminary cumulative economic consequences are evaluated in monetary terms to obtain benchmarks for the mitigation measures associated with future development of the RRTN.

AB  - Virucidal properties of sunlight and temperature have been identified for a long time. However, it is less well established if virioplankton communities are evenly susceptible or geographically adapted to these environmental factors. Transplant experiments were conducted between a tropical (Senegal) and temperate (France) site to examine the effect of natural daylight conditions and temperature on the persistence of free viruses in water. Fresh- and seawater viruses from both countries were simultaneously subjected to 12 h of full sunlight and dark exposure under their native and "transplanted" latitudes. Consistently, viruses decayed much faster when incubated abroad, regardless of origin (latitude and/or water type). However, viral losses, in most cases, were not significantly different between sunlight exposed and dark samples, implying that ambient radiation does not exert strong negative effects on virioplankton particles. Rather, temperature clearly emerged as the principal determinant of viral survival in all samples. This suggests that viruses, under local temperature, can adapt through an evolutionary process to survive for longer periods of time thus increasing their chances to encounter their hosts.

AB  - This paper describes the results of an experimental investigation aimed to study the machinability of AA7075 T6 (160 LIV) for aerospace industry at high cutting speeds. The paper investigates the effects of different lubri-cooling strategies (cryogenic, MQL and dry) during high speed turning process on cutting forces, tool wear, chip morphology and cutting temperatures. The cutting speeds selected were 1000m/min, 1250m/min and 1500 m/min, while the feed rate values used were 0.1mm/rev and 0.3 mm/rev. The results of cryogenic and MQL application is compared with dry application. It was found that the cryogenic and MQL lubri-cooling techniques could represent a functional alternative to the common dry cutting application in order to implement a more effective high speed turning process. Higher cutting parameters would be able to increase the productivity and reduce the production costs. The effects of the cutting parameters and on the variables object of study were investigated and the role of the different lubri-cooling conditions was assessed.

The prototype is designed and fabricated at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut to conduct the experimental investigation of the dynamic behaviour of the solar desalination unit during summer season (November, December & January) and during a typical day in December was carried out to study the temporal evolutions of the temperature of air and water and the relative humidity at the inlet and the outlet of each component of the system. The results showed excellent behavior of series of parabolic reflectors over flat plate solar collector and enhanced productivity, thermally efficient and simultaneously reaches a maximum temperature of more than 75 degrees C in a short time. The running cost of the system is low as it consumes very small power to run a small air blower and a water pump reducing the final cost per liter of fresh water.

AB  - A silicalite-1/alpha-Al2O3 zeolite membrane with high para-xylene (PX) selectivity was tested for isomerization of meta-xylene (MX) to PX. Two HZSM-5 catalyst packing methods were compared in the membrane reactor (1) catalyst in contact with the Al2O3 substrate and (2) catalyst in contact with the membrane layer. The second packing method exhibited higher efficiency for MX isomerization. Compared with a conventional reactor, the membrane reactor with the second catalyst packing method had increased rates of 26.0% and 31.2% for the PX yield and selectivity, respectively, at a temperature of 270 degrees C. PX selectivity and yield increased as the flow rate of the sweep gas increased because of the enhanced PX flux through the zeolite membrane. Increasing the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) could reduce the Contribution of membrane permeation to PX productivity. It was also revealed that MFI zeolite membranes exhibit a high stability for xylene isomerization.

AB  - Abalones are especially susceptible to environmental lighting conditions. This factor greatly affects crucial biological process such as feeding rates, energy balance, physiological stress status, and consequently, growth and survival of farmed abalone. Most of these effects have been studied in the economically valuable abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The use of specific photoperiods, and/or light qualifies and intensifies, have been proposed as managing strategies to increase its production; however, for extensive off-shore or in intensive land-based farming systems, lighting conditions are not likely to be easily managed. Despite the great importance of the biological responses to the light/dark stimuli for abalone farming production, to the best of our knowledge the genetic control upon the variation associated behavioral traits have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the heritable variation and potential responses to selection for the phototaxis [i.e., displacement towards (positive) or against (negative) the light source] and locomotion behaviors associated to the intensity of the response (i.e., crawling speed and displacement distance) to the light/dark stimuli in juvenile H. discus hannai. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between these traits were also estimated. Results showed moderate but significant heritable variations for phototaxis (h(2) = 0.15) and locomotion responses (h(2) = 0.18-0.37); and significant positive genetic correlations among them. Expected gain responses to selection per generation (with a selection intensity of 2.06, i.e., selecting 5% of the individuals from a population) were moderate for phototaxis variation (16%) and high for locomotion responses variation (33-67 or 36-73%, depending on the model used for the estimations). As a consequence, the potential for reducing (or incrementing, depending on the breeding goal) the reactivity or the sensibility to the light stimulus by selective breeding is good, and can be an attractive way of indirectly improving growth, survival and general welfare of farmed H. discus hannai.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY

KW  - NORTHERN
AB  - The fossil record of the volutid gastropod Arctomelon is represented by three species from the Koryak Upland and the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russian northeast), ranging in age from late middle Eocene to early Miocene. Although Recent Arctomelon stearnsii (Dall, 1872) from the northeastern Pacific is a cold-water species, paleontological data point to the origin of the genus in shallow, warm-water conditions that existed in high latitudes of the northwestern Pacific during Paleogene time. The fossil record also indicates survival of the genus during the climatic coolings through the Cenozoic. It is apparent that Arctomelon successfully adapted to the new cooler and deeper-water conditions. Despite this major change of life habit, shell morphology has remained fairly unchanged since the Eocene. Two new species of the genus Arctomelon, A. harasewychi sp. nov. and A. rateginense sp. nov., are described.

AB  - Uneven patterns in the rate of climate change have profound implications for adaptation. Assuming a linear or monotonic increase in global or regional temperatures can lead to inefficient planning processes that underestimate the magnitude, pattern, and timing of the risks faced by human and natural systems, which could exaggerate future impacts and the costs of managing them. Adaptation planning needs to move beyond imposing linear thinking and analysis onto nonlinear systems. Doing so would improve research into adaptive management processes that learn from and adapt to new knowledge at a pace that reflects non-linearity. Specifically, the pace of adaptation must consider the potential consequences of uneven increases in weather and climate variables as a means to reduce system vulnerability. Projections simulating periods of relative stability with those of rapid change would lead to more complex and more accurate expectations of future risks and associated consequences for human and natural systems. Adaptation planning based on such projections could then consider the implications of non-linear climate change on the extent of any adaptation effort, including quantified (or qualitative) risks and associated costs and benefits. Adaptation planning could be improved by projections that incorporate more nuanced understandings of how development processes could interact with climate change to alter future risks and vulnerabilities. Two examples are highlighted to illustrate the complexity and dynamic nature of non-monotonic climate-development-response scenarios: vector borne diseases and agricultural productivity.

AB  - Rice, with its wide geographic distribution extending from 50 degrees N to 35 degrees S, is expected to be the most vulnerable cultivated crop to future changing climates. Among the different abiotic stresses, extreme temperatures coinciding with critical developmental stages, increasingly frequent floods and drought spells, and worsening sea water inundation are some of the major threats to sustainable rice productivity. Following the successful implementation of molecular marker-assisted backcrossing to introgress large-effect QTL for submergence tolerance in rice mega varieties, rice breeding for drought, salinity and, recently, heat tolerance is employing the same approach. Although tolerance for combined submergence and salinity has been achieved, developing rice varieties with multiple tolerance for other abiotic and biotic stresses and finding the appropriate agronomic package to exploit their performance remain a challenge. The major bottleneck is the lack of unidentified large-effect QTL for other abiotic stresses that are strongly influenced by genotype x environment (G x E) interaction. Rapid advances in the use of molecular tools, including a plethora of SNP markers, are expected to facilitate the development of major abiotic stress-tolerant rice. In response to the actual farmer field situation, progress achieved in understanding and developing independent abiotic stress tolerance is being exploited to combine tolerances (for example, heat and drought; salinity and submergence) to address emerging environmental problems across a wide range of rice ecosystems.

AB  - We present experimental determinations of trace element partitioning between natural fertile lherzolite and near-solidus carbonatitic liquid (cbL) at pressures of 6.6 and 8.6 GPa and temperatures between 1265 and 1470 degrees C, conditions relevant for initial generation Of CO2-rich melt beneath oceanic ridges and for carbonate melt percolation in the deep source regions of ocean island basalts. Compared to previous experiments at lower pressures, which produced more aluminous cpx, our experimental cpx-melt pairs show lower partition coefficients for trivalent cations entering the M2 site (D-Lu(cpx/cbL) = 0.17, D-La(cpx/cbL) = 0.006). D-U(cpx/cbL) (0.002) and D-Th(cpx/cbL) (0.001) also are distinctly lower than previous estimates. The garnet-carbonate melt partition coefficients for REE vary from highly incompatible La to moderately compatible Lu and are slightly lower than those from lower pressure experiments. From 6.6 to 8.6 GPa, HFSEs including Zr, Hf, and Ti range from moderately incompatible to slightly compatible, with D-Hf(gamet/cbL) > D-Ti(gamet/cbL) > D-Zr(gamet/cbL). U and Th remain highly incompatible in garnet at both pressures with D-U(gamet/cbL)/D-Th(gamet/cbL) of 1.2-1.25 at 6.6 GPa and 1.35 at 8.6 GPa. Estimates of D-gtlherzolite/cbL, based on our newly measured partition coefficients, suggest that 30-60% of some of the highly incompatible elements can be removed by efficient extraction of 0.1% carbonatitic melt from the Earth's deep upper mantle, and that 0.1% C-rich melt extraction can create a residue that has Rb/Sr, U/Pb and Th/U ratios, respectively, 29, 12, and 6% lower and Sm/Nd ratio similar to 11% higher than the unmelted source. Our data also suggest that ancient carbonate melt extraction and metasomatism can decouple the Hf and Nd isotope systems. Garnet lherzolite derived carbonatitic melt has lower normalized HREEs and smaller Nb/Ta ratios than erupted natural carbonatites. Therefore, the trace element abundances of erupted carbonatites require either reaction with a shallower mantle peridotite with low modal garnet or derivation from an enriched source. The trace element abundances of deep carbonate-rich melts must become diluted by greater volumes of silicate melt produced in the shallower portions of sub-ridge basalt source regions. But, the observed Th-230 and Pa-231 excesses and variations Of CO2/Nb in erupted MORBs are a likely consequence of variable contributions of carbonate-rich melt. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main disadvantage of the current electrospinning and related processes for producing nanofibers is low throughput rate, which is a challenge for quite some time. Traditional approach of studying the influence of one factor at time on nanofiber diameter does not give a complete picture of the process, where many interacting process parameters are being neglected. This paper reports a melt spinning process to increase the production rate of nanofiber materials. An additional attachment was fixed below the filament extruder of a melt spinning line. This attachment with controlled heated airflow arrangement stretches the filament coming out of the extruder by the process of sequential drawing which result in the formation of nanofiber materials. A die with segmented cross-section was used during melt extrusion process. A Box and Behnken factorial design of experiment was conducted to study the influence of multiple parameters on fiber/filament diameters. These parameters were distance of the first drawing zone from the die, airflow, and air temperature. The selected parameters were varied at three levels, -1, 0, and +1, respectively. The current setup produces fibers with diameter ranging from 820 to 1145nm, smallest diameter was 820nm. Among the selected parameters, the interaction effect of the air temperature and distance of the first drawing zone from the die was a dominant factor on the extrusion of nanofibers. These results show that in a multivariable process, interaction effect of the parameters played a major role in determining fiber diameter and it cannot be neglected.

AB  - The process for the production of biodegradable plastic material (polyhydroxyalkanoates, PHAs) from microbial cells by mixed-bacterial cultivation using readily available waste (renewable resources) is the main consideration nowadays. These observations have shown impressive results typically under high carbon fraction, COD/N and COD/P (usually described as nutrient-limiting conditions) and warmest temperature (moderate condition). Therefore, the aim of this work is predominantly to select mixed cultures under high storage responded by cultivation on a substrate - non limited in a single batch reactor with shortest period for feeding and to characterize their storage response by using specific and kinetics determination. In that case, the selected-fixed temperature is 30 degrees C to establish tropical conditions. During the accumulated steady-state period, the cell growth was inhibited by high PHA content within the cells because of the carbon reserve consumption. From the experiments, there is no doubt about the PHA accumulation even at high carbon fraction ratio. Apparently, the best accumulation occurred at carbon fraction, 160 +/- 7.97 g COD/g N (PHA(mean) = 44.54% of dried cells). Unfortunately, the highest PHA productivity was achieved at the high carbon fraction, 560 +/- 1.62g COD/g N (0.152 +/- 0.1 7g/l min). Overall results showed that with high carbon fraction induced to the cultivation, the PO4 and NO3 can remove up to 20% in single cultivation.

AB  - Recent studies suggest an important role of thermophilic bacterial communities of the Phylum Firmicutes on soil C, N and S cycling, and a positive effect on crop productivity through the production of sulfate (SO42-) and ammonium (NH4+), essential plant nutrients. Copper (Cu) is commonly supplemented to soils as a fungicide in phytosanitary treatments although its consequences to the bacterial communities is frequently overlooked. Herein, we report on the influence of temperature and Cu on the microbial communities, namely those of the Phylum Firmicutes, from a soil collected at an olive orchard in S Portugal. Community fingerprints and band identification through sequencing was combined with measurement of SO42- and NH4+ production at different supplemented amounts of Cu and at moderate and high temperatures (30 degrees C and 50 degrees C, respectively). Both temperature and Cu induced changes in these communities, selecting for specific bacteria. Temperature induced the dominance of Brevibacillus, and Cu addition to soil caused a reduction of SO42- release by soil bacteria. Ammonium production during bacterial growth at moderate and high temperatures was not affected by Cu addition. A Cu-tolerant thermophilic isolate, belonging to the Bacillus genus, showed significant inhibition by high Cu concentrations and a reduction of NH4+ release during growth; genera Brevibacillus and Bacillus have been previously reported as high NH4+ and SO42- producers of the Firmicutes phylum. Results indicate that Cu treatments select specific tolerant bacterial strains which could influence natural soil fertilization in Cu-treated orchards.

AB  - As the effects of anthropogenic climate change become more severe, several approaches for deliberate climate intervention to reduce or stabilize Earth's surface temperature have been proposed. Solar radiation modification (SRM) is one potential approach to partially counteract anthropogenic warming by reflecting a small proportion of the incoming solar radiation to increase Earth's albedo. While climate science research has focused on the predicted climate effects of SRM, almost no studies have investigated the impacts that SRM would have on ecological systems. The impacts and risks posed by SRM would vary by implementation scenario, anthropogenic climate effects, geographic region, and by ecosystem, community, population, and organism. Complex interactions among Earth's climate system and living systems would further affect SRM impacts and risks. We focus here on stratospheric aerosol intervention (SAI), a well-studied and relatively feasible SRM scheme that is likely to have a large impact on Earth's surface temperature. We outline current gaps in knowledge about both helpful and harmful predicted effects of SAI on ecological systems. Desired ecological outcomes might also inform development of future SAI implementation scenarios. In addition to filling these knowledge gaps, increased collaboration between ecologists and climate scientists would identify a common set of SAI research goals and improve the communication about potential SAI impacts and risks with the public. Without this collaboration, forecasts of SAI impacts will overlook potential effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services for humanity.

AB  - In this paper we provide a unified framework for quasispecies evolution and stochastic quantization. We map the biological evolution described by the quasispecies equation to the stochastic dynamics of an ensemble of particles undergoing a creation-annihilation process. We show that this mapping identifies a natural decomposition of the probability that an individual has a certain genotype into eigenfunctions of the evolutionary operator. This alternative approach to study the quasispecies equation allows for a generalization of the Fisher theorem equivalent to the Price equation. According to this relation the average fitness of an asexual population increases with time proportional to the variance of the eigenvalues of the evolutionary operator. Moreover, from the present alternative formulation of stochastic quantization a novel scenario emerges to be compared with existing approaches. The evolution of an ensemble of particles undergoing diffusion and a creation-annihilation process is parametrized by a variable beta that we call the inverse temperature of the stochastic dynamics. We find that the evolution equation at high temperatures is simply related to the Schrodinger equation, but at low temperature it strongly deviates from it. In the presence of additional noise in scattering processes between the particles, the evolution reaches a steady state described by the Bose-Einstein statistics.

AB  - The first critical step in a virus's infection cycle is attachment to its host. This interaction is precise enough to ensure the virus will be able to productively infect the cell, but some flexibility can be beneficial to enable coevolution and host range switching or expansion. Bacteriophage Sf6 utilizes a two-step process to recognize and attach to its host Shigella flexneri. Sf6 first recognizes the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of S. flexneri and then binds outer membrane protein (Omp) A or OmpC. This phage infects serotype Y strains but can also form small, turbid plaques on serotype 2a(2); turbid plaques appear translucent rather than transparent, indicating greater survival of bacteria. Reduced plating efficiency further suggested inefficient infection. To examine the interactions between Sf6 and this alternate host, phages were experimentally evolved using mixed populations of S. flexneri serotypes Y and 2a(2). The recovered mutants could infect serotype 2a(2) with greater efficiency than the ancestral Sf6, forming clear plaques on both serotypes. All mutations mapped to two distinct regions of the receptor-binding tailspike protein: (i) adjacent to the LPS binding site near the N terminus; and (ii) at the distal, C-terminal tip of the protein. Although we anticipated interactions between the Sf6 tailspike and 2a(2) O-antigen to be weak, LPS of this serotype appears to inhibit infection through strong binding of particles, effectively removing them from the environment. The mutations of the evolved strains reduce the inhibitory effect by either reducing electrostatic interactions with the O-antigen or increasing reliance on the Omp secondary receptors. IMPORTANCE Viruses depend on host cells to propagate themselves. In mixed populations and communities of host cells, finding these susceptible host cells may have to be balanced with avoiding nonhost cells. Alternatively, being able to infect new cell types can increase the fitness of the virus. Many bacterial viruses use a two-step process to identify their hosts, binding first to an LPS receptor and then to a host protein. For Shigella virus Sf6, the tailspike protein was previously known to bind the LPS receptor. Genetic data from this work imply the tailspike also binds to the protein receptor. By experimentally evolving Sf6, we also show that point mutations in this protein can dramatically affect the binding of one or both receptors. This may provide Sf6 flexibility in identifying host cells and the ability to rapidly alter its host range under selective pressure.

AB  - In order to quantify the rate of filtration of the liquid and gas phases of pore-water and hydrocarbon fluids, convection processes were explored in the framework of the two-dimensional problem of convective heat transfer, taking into account phase transitions under the influence of the heat of sheet igneous bodies. Various regimes of the convection of pore-water fluid were simulated. In the case of a homogeneous fluid (without boiling), regular convection cells are formed, showing periodicity with respect to flow velocity and temperature. When a sheet igneous body is emplaced near the surface, flow patterns and the evolution of the temperature field change dramatically owing to boiling of interstitial liquid. The cellular structure does not form, and heat advection is observed via an ascending flow of a gas or gas-liquid mixture in the form of a "mushroom" or a plume. The initial stage of heating of fluid-bearing rocks is accompanied by the generation of excess pressure below the lower contact of a sill. The lifetime of such anomalously high pressures is estimated for the watervapor system, where they may be higher than hydrostatic pressure by a factor of 1.5-1.8. Models including sills of finite extensions show the viability of mechanisms of long lateral fluid migration below impermeable igneous bodies toward discharge zones. The application of the results of modeling to oil- and gas-bearing sedimentary basins with flood basalt magmatism demonstrated that sheet intrusions played a significant role in the transformation of hydrocarbon matter and influenced the character of convection flows. Magmatic heat causes phase transitions of liquid hydrocarbons into gas phase in a country rock volume comparable with that of the igneous body (sill or dike).

AB  - A novel approach is introduced here to selectively lyse exocrine cells in an islet preparation by hypoosmotic treatment. Time to hypotonic cell lysis required for the islet cells was much longer than that for the exocrine cells, which permits a possibility of selectively killing the exocrine cells by hypotonic treatment. The first set of experiments was designed to select an appropriate osmolality for the hypotonic treatment. Kinetic changes in cell volume in response to extracellular anisosmolalities (30 to 90 mOsm/kg) were recorded using an electronic particle counter. The results indicated that, when exposed to a 30 mOsm/kg solution, islet cells swelled slowly to reach volumetric equilibrium in approximately 3 min. There was no significant hypotonic cell lysis observed even at the end of 4 min (n = 4). In contrast, pancreatic exocrine cells, when exposed to the same solution, expanded rapidly to the lytic volume and burst within 30 s. Significant exocrine cell lysis was invariably achieved within 30 s when cells were exposed to the osmolalities below 60 mOsm/kg. For osmolalities between 70 to 80 mOsm/ kg, exocrine fell lysis was highly variable. When cells were exposed to 80 to 90 mOsm/kg, no significant cell lysis was observed. Thus, an osmolality of 50 mOsm/kg is recommended for hypotonic treatment, as it maximizes the lysis of exocrine cells without unnecessarily stressing (osmotically) the islet cells. The second set of experiments (time-course experiments, 20 to 120 s) was designed to determine the length of exposure time for which the exocrine cells were irreversibly damaged but the islet cells had only swollen to such a degree that cell function is restored upon returning to an isotonic condition. Viability of the hypotonic treated cells was evaluated at two different levels: membrane integrity, measured by combined fluorescent dye staining with propidium iodide (PI) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA), and mitochondrial function, measured by colorimetric MTT assay. The results showed that hypotonic treatment in a 50 mOsm/kg solution for 30 s resulted in over 85% loss of the membrane integrity for the exocrine cells. About 90% of these membrane lysed cells lost mitochondrial function (n = 3). By contrast, under the same treatment, less than 15% of the islet cells lost membrane integrity and mitochondrial Function (n = 3). In conclusion, hypotonic treatment with a 50 mOsm/kg solution for 20 to 30 s at room temperature is sufficient to lyse the majority of the contaminating exocrine cells in an islet cell preparation, while maintaining function in the islet cells.

AB  - Context: Solubility limitation of BCS class II drugs pose challenges to in vitro release.
   Objective: To investigate the miscibility of Aprepitant (APR) and Soluplus VR (SOL) for hot melt extrusion (HME) viability and improved in vitro release of APR.
   Methods: Solubility parameters of APR and SOL from group contribution methods were evaluated. Heat-cool-heat differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans were assessed for determining the glass forming ability (GFA) and glass stability (GS) of APR. An optimum HME temperature was selected based on melting point depression in physical mixtures. Moisture sorption isotherms were collected using a dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) analyzer at 25 degrees C. A 1: 4 APR: SOL physical mixture was extruded in a co-rotating 12mm twin screw extruder and in vitro release was assessed in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) with 0.25% SLS. Extrudates were analyzed using TGA, DSC, XRD and FTIR.
   Results: APR was classified as a class II glass former. APR and SOL had composition dependent miscibility based on Gibb's free energy of mixing. Extrudate prepared using HME had an amorphous as well as a crystalline phase that showed good stability in accelerated stability conditions. Smaller particle size extrudates exhibited a higher % moisture uptake and in vitro release compared to larger particle size extrudates. Enhanced in vitro release of APR from extrudates was attributed to amorphization of APR, solubilization as well as crystal growth inhibition effect of SOL due to H-bond formation with APR.
   Conclusions: A solid dispersion of APR with improved in vitro release was successfully developed using HME technology.

AB  - The Lower Paleozoic Ordovician Wufeng Formation and the Silurian Longmaxi Formation shale in the southeastern part of Sichuan Basin in China are the key strata for shale gas exploration. In this paper, based on a large number of outcrops, cores and natural gamma spectroscopy logs combined with scanning electron microscopy, geochemical parameter testing and mineral component analysis, the geological conditions and exploration potential of shale gas accumulation were studied in this area, and the relationship between structure and shale gas preservation is discussed. The vertical reduction in the U/Th ratio measured in the outcrop sandstone lenses and core horizontal bedding and observed in the energy spectrum logs indicates that the sedimentary water body transformed from a low-energy anoxic reducing environment to a high-energy oxidizing environment. The TI index and the kerogen carbon isotope indicate that the organic matter type of the shale is mainly type I kerogen. The TOC content of high-quality shale is generally above 2.50%, and the R-o value is between 2.00% and 3.08%. High organic matter abundance, moderate thermal evolution and a large thickness of high-quality shale ensure an adequate supply of hydrocarbon resources. Multiple types of inorganic pores, primary organic pores and pores formed during hydrocarbon generation provide abundant reservoir space for the enrichment of shale gas. The tectonics have an important influence on the preservation of shale gas. Moderate fracture development, a late tectonic uplift time, small-scale tectonic uplift, and high formation pressure coefficient are conducive to the preservation of shale gas, and the gas content and productivity will be higher. Overall, a structural stability zone with a high formation pressure coefficient is a favorable area for shale gas exploration.

AB  - This article provides a review of the possibility of using different types of reactors to power ships. The analyses were carried out for three different large vessels: a container ship, a liquid gas carrier and a bulk carrier. A novelty of this work is the analysis of the proposal to adapt marine power plants to ecological requirements in shipping by replacing the conventional propulsion system based on internal combustion engines with nuclear propulsion. The subjects of comparison are primarily the dimensions of the most important devices of the nuclear power plant and the preliminary fitness analysis. It was assumed for this purpose that the nuclear power plant fits in the engine room compartment and uses the space left after the removal of the combustion engines. At the same time, this propulsion provides at all times sufficient energy for port, technological and shipping operations at an economically justifiable speed. For deep-sea vessels, which are supposed to reach null emissions of CO, CO2, NOx, SOx and H2O, this is one of the most reasonable solutions. Finally the paper proves that all the above-mentioned marine functions could be effectively applied in power plants equipped with 4th generation nuclear reactors.

AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) of acrystalline type play a key role in the cell survival under stress conditions by preventing irreversible denaturation and aggregation of proteins. In contrast to most Mollicutes (mycoplasmas) where no sHsps were found, recently, some sHsp homologs were identified in the Acholeplasmataceae family, including Acholeplasma laidlawii, the only representative of Mollicutes that is known to survive in a hostfree environment. Using pull-down followed by LC-MS, we identified the potential target proteins co-eluting with IbpA from the A. laidlawii cell extracts after exposition to low-and high temperatures. 308 and 464 proteins were co-eluted with IbpA from the cold-and heat-treated extracts, respectively, while only 240 of them were co-eluted with sHsp independently of the temperature. Most of potential IbpA targets were identified as enzymes involved in biosynthetic cycles and energy metabolism. We show IbpA specificity for target proteins on the incubation temperature. Significant differences between protein pools co-eluting specifically with IbpA at either 4 or 46 degrees C could be observed in terms of their aliphatic index, charge, molecular weight, and isoelectric point. Interestingly, only the isoelectric point distribution significantly differed between the protein pool co-eluting with IbpA under cooling (4 degrees C) and the entire proteome. In contrast, significant discrepancies in the distributions of aliphatic index, charge, hydropathy, molecular weight, and isoelectric point could be observed between the pool of proteins co-eluting with IbpA under heating (46 degrees C) and the entire proteome, indicating that there is likely a complex selective mechanism for proteins interaction with IbpA under heat shock conditions.

AB  - Purpose - The aim of the present research was to study and model drying of loquat fruit under vacuum conditions at three temperatures to select the best mathematical model for predicting drying rate of loquat during times which is used in designing of vacuum dryer. The dried product may be used in the preparation of soups, jam, premixed foods, snacks, etc.
   Design/methodology/approach - Loquat samples were dried by vacuum oven (52 cm Hg) at three temperatures, 60, 70 and 808C. First, moisture content was plotted against time for each treatment and after that moisture ratio curves were plotted. These curves were fitted with nine well- known models to select the best model.
   Findings - Regression analysis of different models and values of RMSE and x(2) showed that page model had the best fitness due to highest R-2 and lowest RMSE and x(2). Moisture diffusivity of loquat 'samples at 60, 70 and 808C was calculated to be 6.87 x 10(10), 9.17 x 10(10) and 1.29 x 10(9) m(2)/s, respectively, which increased with temperature.
   Originality/value - This paper is believed to be the only one which investigates and models drying loquat under vacuum conditions to select the best mathematical model for predicting drying rate of loquat.

AB  - Both modern humans (MHs) and Neanderthals successfully settled across western Eurasian cold-climate landscapes. Among the many adaptations considered as essential to survival in such landscapes, changes in the nasal morphology and/or function aimed to humidify and warm the air before it reaches the lungs are of key importance. Unfortunately, the lack of soft-tissue evidence in the fossil record turns difficult any comparative study of respiratory performance. Here, we reconstruct the internal nasal cavity of a Neanderthal plus two representatives of climatically divergent MH populations (southwestern Europeans and northeastern Asians). The reconstruction includes mucosa distribution enabling a realistic simulation of the breathing cycle in different climatic conditions via computational fluid dynamics. Striking across-specimens differences in fluid residence times affecting humidification and warming performance at the anterior tract were found under cold/dry climate simulations. Specifically, the Asian model achieves a rapid air conditioning, followed by the Neanderthals, whereas the European model attains a proper conditioning only around the medium-posterior tract. In addition, quantitative-genetic evolutionary analyses of nasal morphology provided signals of stabilizing selection for MH populations, with the removal of Arctic populations turning covariation patterns compatible with evolution by genetic drift. Both results indicate that, departing from important cranio facial differences existing among Neanderthals and MHs, an advantageous species-specific respiratory performance in cold climates may have occurred in both species. Fluid dynamics and evolutionary biology independently provided evidence of nasal evolution, suggesting that adaptive explanations regarding complex functional phenotypes require interdisciplinary approaches aimed to quantify both performance and evolutionary signals on covariation patterns.

AB  - Aiming at the problems of low shortest path selection accuracy, longer response time, and poor selection effect in current cold chain logistics transportation methods, a cold chain logistics transportation shortest path selection algorithm based on improved artificial bee colony is proposed. The improved algorithm is used to initialize the food source, reevaluate the fitness value of the food source, generate a new food source, optimize the objective function and food source evaluation strategy, and get an improved artificial bee colony algorithm. Based on the improved artificial bee colony algorithm, the group adaptive mechanism of particle swarm algorithm is introduced to initialize the position and velocity of each particle randomly. Dynamic detection factor and octree algorithm arc adopted to dynamically update the path of modeling environment information. According to the information sharing mechanism between individual particles, the group adaptive behavior control is performed. After the maximum number of cycles, the path planning is completed, the shortest path is output, and the shortest path selection of cold chain logistics transportation is realized. The experimental results show that the shortest path selection effect of the cold chain logistics transportation of the proposed algorithm is better, which can effectively improve the shortest path selection accuracy and reduce the shortest path selection time.

AB  - Plants have developed intricate mechanisms involving gene regulatory systems to adjust to stresses. Phenotypic variation in plants under stress is classically attributed to DNA sequence variants. More recently, it was found that epigenetic modifications - DNA methylation-, chromatin- and small RNA-based mechanisms can contribute separately or together to phenotypes by regulating gene expression in response to the stress effect. These epigenetic modifications constitute an additional layer of complexity to heritable phenotypic variation and the evolutionary potential of natural plant populations because they can affect fitness. Natural populations can show differences in performance when they are exposed to changes in environmental conditions, partly because of their genetic variation but also because of their epigenetic variation. The line between these two components is blurred because little is known about the contribution of genotypes and epigenotypes to stress tolerance in natural populations. Recent insights in this field have just begun to shed light on the behavior of genetic and epigenetic variation in natural plant populations under biotic and abiotic stresses.

AB  - Preserving intraspecific genetic diversity is essential for long-term forest sustainability in a climate change scenario. Despite that, genetic information is largely neglected in conservation planning, and how conservation units should be defined is still heatedly debated. Here, we use maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), an outcrossing long-lived tree with a highly fragmented distribution in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, to prove the importance of accounting for genetic variation, of both neutral molecular markers and quantitative traits, to define useful conservation units. Six gene pools associated to distinct evolutionary histories were identified within the species using 12 microsatellites and 266 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, height and survival standing variation, their genetic control, and plasticity were assessed in a multisite clonal common garden experiment (16 544 trees). We found high levels of quantitative genetic differentiation within previously defined neutral gene pools. Subsequent cluster analysis and post hoc trait distribution comparisons allowed us to define 10 genetically homogeneous population groups with high evolutionary potential. They constitute the minimum number of units to be represented in a maritime pine dynamic conservation program. Our results uphold that the identification of conservation units below the species level should account for key neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity, especially in species with strong population structure and complex evolutionary histories. The environmental zonation approach currently used by the pan-European genetic conservation strategy for forest trees would be largely improved by gradually integrating molecular and quantitative trait information, as data become available.

AB  - The Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is an economically important pest of food, fiber, and ornamental crops. This pest has evolved a number of adaptations to overcome physiological challenges, including 1) the ability to regulate osmotic stress between gut lumen and hemolymph after imbibing large quantities of a low nitrogen, sugar-rich liquid diet; 2) the ability to avoid or prevent dehydration and desiccation, particularly during egg hatching and molting; and 3) to be adapted for survival at elevated temperatures. One superfamily of proteins involved in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis in many organisms includes the aquaporins, which are integral membrane channel proteins that aid in the rapid flux of water and other small solutes across biological membranes. Here, we show that B. tabaci has eight aquaporins (BtAqps), of which seven belong to the classical aquaporin 4 related grade of channels, including Bib, Drip, Prip, and Eglps and one that belongs to the unorthodox grade of aquaporin 12-like channels. B. tabaci has further expanded its repertoire of water channels through the expression of three BtDrip2 amino-terminal splice variants, while other hemipteran species express amino- or carboxyl-terminal isoforms of Drip, Prip, and Eglps. Each BtAqp has unique transcript expression profiles, cellular localization, and/or substrate preference. Our phylogenetic and functional data reveal that hemipteran insects lost the classical glp genes, but have compensated for this by duplicating the eglp genes early in their evolution to comprise at least three separate clades of glycerol transporters.

AB  - Background One of the dangers of global climate change to wildlife is distorting sex ratios by temperature-induced sex reversals in populations where sex determination is not exclusively genetic, potentially leading to population collapse and/or sex-determination system transformation. Here we introduce a new concept on how these outcomes may be altered by mate choice if sex-chromosome-linked phenotypic traits allow females to choose between normal and sex-reversed (genetically female) males. Results We developed a theoretical model to investigate if an already existing autosomal allele encoding preference for sex-reversed males would spread and affect demographic and evolutionary processes under climate warming. We found that preference for sex-reversed males (1) more likely spread in ZW/ZZ than in XX/XY sex-determination systems, (2) in populations starting with ZW/ZZ system, it significantly hastened the transitions between different sex-determination systems and maintained more balanced adult sex ratio for longer compared to populations where all females preferred normal males; and (3) in ZW/ZZ systems with low but non-zero viability of WW individuals, a widespread preference for sex-reversed males saved the populations from early extinction. Conclusions Our results suggest that climate change may affect the evolution of mate choice, which in turn may influence the evolution of sex-determination systems, sex ratios, and thereby adaptive potential and population persistence. These findings show that preferences for sex-linked traits have special implications in species with sex reversal, highlighting the need for empirical research on the role of sex reversal in mate choice.

AB  - Environmental awareness is an essential attribute of all organisms. The homeoviscous adaptation system of Bacillus subtilis provides a powerful experimental model for the investigation of stimulus detection and signaling mechanisms at the molecular level. These bacteria sense the order of membrane lipids with the transmembrane (TM) protein DesK, which has an N-terminal sensor domain and an intracellular catalytic effector domain. DesK exhibits autokinase activity as well as phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities toward a cognate response regulator, DesR, that controls the expression of an enzyme that remodels membrane fluidity when the temperature drops below similar to 30 degrees C. Membrane fluidity signals are transmitted from the DesK sensor domain to the effector domain via rotational movements of a connecting 2-helix coiled coil (2-HCC). Previous molecular dynamic simulations suggested important roles for TM prolines in transducing the initial signals of membrane fluidity status to the 2-HCC. Here, we report that individual replacement of prolines in DesKs TM1 and TM5 helices by alanine (DesKPA) locked DesK in a phosphatase-ON state, abrogating membrane fluidity responses. An unbiased mutagenic screen identified the L174P replacement in the internal side of the repeated heptad of the 2-HCC structure that alleviated the signaling defects of every transmembrane DesKPA substitution. Moreover, substitutions by proline in other internal positions of the 2-HCC reestablished the kinase-ON state of the DesKPA mutants. These results imply that TM prolines are essential for finely tuned signal generation by the N-terminal sensor helices, facilitating a conformational control by the metastable 2-HCC domain of the DesK signaling state.
   IMPORTANCE Signal sensing and transduction is an essential biological process for cell adaptation and survival. Histidine kinases (HK) are the sensory proteins of two-component systems that control many bacterial responses to different stimuli, like environmental changes. Here, we focused on the HK DesK from Bacillus subtilis, a paradigmatic example of a transmembrane thermosensor suited to remodel membrane fluidity when the temperature drops below 30 degrees C. DesK provides a tractable system for investigating the mechanism of transmembrane signaling, one of the majors interrogates in biology to date. Our studies demonstrate that transmembrane proline residues modulate the conformational switch of a 2-helix coiled-coil (2-HCC) structural motif that controls input-output in a variety of HK. Our results highlight the relevance of proline residues within sensor domains and could inspire investigations of their role in different signaling proteins.

AB  - The increasing interest in green energy storage materials for electrochemical devices with the development of polymer as electrolytes candidate has attracted great attention recently. It can offer a number of high-value opportunities, provided that lower costs can be obtained besides environmental friendly. Due to this attention, the development of biodegradable polymer electrolytes (BPEs) has been accomplished in this work by incorporating various composition of dodecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB) with carboxy methylcellulose (CMC) via solution casting method. The highest ionic conductivity of the BPEs obtained at room temperature is 7.72 x 10(-4) S cm(-1). The solid-state battery were fabricated with the configuration of Zn + ZnSO4 center dot 7H(2)O vertical bar BPEs vertical bar MnO2 for the highest conductivity. The open-circuit voltage (OCV) of the fabricated battery with the best performance is 1.33 V at ambient temperature. The performance of the battery at ambient and selected temperature is evaluated to ascertain the effective and viability of these BPEs in solid-state batteries.

AB  - Climate warming, in particular in island environments, where opportunities for species to disperse are limited, may become a serious threat to cold adapted alpine species. In order to understand how alpine species may respond to a warming world, we need to understand the drivers that have shaped their habitat specialisation and the evolutionary adaptations that allow them to utilize alpine habitats. The endemic, endangered New Zealand kea (Nestor notabilis) is considered the only alpine parrot in the world. As a species commonly found in the alpine zone it may be highly susceptible to climate warming. But is it a true alpine specialist? Is its evolution driven by adaptation to the alpine zone, or is the kea an open habitat generalist that simply uses the alpine zone to, for example, avoid lower lying anthropogenic landscapes? We use whole genome data of the kea and its close, forest adapted sister species, the kaka (Nestor meridionalis) to reconstruct the evolutionary history of both species and identify the functional genomic differences that underlie their habitat specialisations. Our analyses do not identify major functional genomic differences between kea and kaka in pathways associated with high-altitude. Rather, we found evidence that selective pressures on adaptations commonly found in alpine species are present in both Nestor species, suggesting that selection for alpine adaptations has not driven their divergence. Strongly divergent demographic responses to past climate warming between the species nevertheless highlight potential future threats to kea survival in a warming world.

AB  - 2D materials display very promising intrinsic material properties, with multiple applications in electronics, photonics, and sensing. In particular layered platinum diselenide has shown high potential due to its layer-dependent tunable bandgap, low-temperature growth, and high environmental stability. Here, the conformal and area selective (AS) low-temperature growth of layered PtSe2 is presented defining a new paradigm for 2D material integration. The thermally-assisted conversion of platinum which is deposited by AS atomic layer deposition to PtSe2 is demonstrated on various substrates with a distinct 3D topography. Further the viability of the approach is presented by successful on-chip integration of hybrid semiconductor devices, namely by the manufacture of a highly sensitive ammonia sensors channel with 3D topography and fully integrated infrared-photodetectors on silicon photonics waveguides. The presented methodologies of conformal and AS growth therefore lay the foundation for new design routes for the synthesis of more complex hybrid structures with 2D materials.

AB  - Background: Recently, it has been revealed that tetragonal lysozyme crystals show a phase transition at 307 K upon heating. The underlying mechanisms of the phase transition are still not fully understood. Here we focus on the study of highfrequency vibrational modes arising from the protein and their temperature evolution in the vicinity of T-ph as well as on the detailed study of crystalline water dynamics near T-ph.
   Methods: Raman experiments have been performed at temperatures 295-323 K including T-ph. The lowfrequency modes and the modes of fingerprint region, CH-and OHstretching regions have been analyzed.
   Results and conclusions: In spite of the absence of noticeable rearrangements in protein structure, the high frequency vibrational modes of lysozyme located in the fingerprint region have been found to exhibit the features of critical dynamics near T-ph. Pronounced changes in the dynamics of ethelixes and Tyr residues exposed on the protein surface point to the important role of Hbond rearrangements at the phase transition. Additionally the study of temperature evolution of OHstretching modes has shown an increase in distortions of tertahedral Hbond network of crystalline water above T-ph. These changes in water dynamics could play a crucial role in the mechanisms of the phase transition.
   General significance: The present results shed light on the mechanisms of the phase transition in lysozyme crystals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The control of mold surface temperature is an important factor that affects the sample surface morphology as well as the structural gradients (orientation crystal size, and type) as well as cooling stresses. The frozen layer thickness formed during the tilling stage also has a very significant effect on the flow resistance and thus on the resulting pressure drop and flow length in thin wall parts. The possibility to have a hot mold during filling and a quick cooling soon afterward is a significant process enhancement particularly for specialized applications such as micro injection molding and for the reproduction of micro structured surfaces. Up to now, several methods (electromagnetic, infrared, hot vapor fleshing etc,) were tried to achieve fast temperature evolution of the mold. Unfortunately, all these methods require a complex balance between thermal and mechanical problems, equipment cost, energy consumption, safety, molding cycle time and part quality achievable.
   In this work, a thin electrical resistance was designed and used to generate a fast and confined temperature variation on mold surface (by joule effect). Since the whole temperature evolution can take place in a few seconds, one can couple the advantages of a high surface temperature during filling with the advantages of a low mold temperature, fast cooling and low heating dissipation. Some experiments were performed with a commercial iPP resin. The effects of the surface temperature and of the heating time (under constant electric power) on surface finishing and on the final morphology (thickness and structure of the different layers) are explored and discussed.

AB  - A numerical model is established to investigate the effects of the influencing factors such as design parameters and operating conditions on the performance and behavior of the engagement process of the wet clutch based on the Navier-Stokes equations, contact mechanics, and heat transfer theory. A finite element contact model called KE contact model is used to analyze the rough contact during engagement process and thermal effect on the viscosity is considered based on heat transfer theory. The integration of the grooving into the simulation and the method of coupled finite element by domain decomposition of groove and ungrooved areas are put forward to facilitate the analysis. The experimental results agree well with the numerical model which takes the normal pressure, the temperature of ATF, relative revolution speed, the permeability and the groove geometry into account. The results of numerical simulation and the experiment indicate that the applied pressure not only affects the engagement time, but also has influence on the value of the engagement torque. Besides, the engagement time is roughly proportional to the relative revolution speed. The influencing factors such as the temperature of ATF, the permeability, grooves, the torque judders and effects of PID control parameters are also discussed in the paper. The performance and behavior of the engagement of the wet clutch were studied by two methods of numerical calculation and experimental research, which make the working process of the wet clutch more detailed.

AB  - Volume increasing processes in rocks can induce various types of fractures, such as hierarchical domain division of the unreacted material and spalling of the reacted material. The mechanism responsible for the selection of a particular fracture type is generally not known. We study such deformations and fracture mechanisms in a simplified system with a range of numerical techniques, and find that sharpness of reaction fronts and magnitude of volume increase are the main parameters controlling which fracture type forms. Spalling dominates when there is sharp reaction fronts and large magnitude of volume change, otherwise, we get mainly domain dividing fractures. Increasing reaction front sharpness and magnitude of volume change also increases the fracture density, and we argue that the change in fracture density can be important for the viability of in situ CO2 sequestration in ultramafic rock.

AB  - The synthesis of a polyacetal-block-polyurethane copolymer was achieved which possesses the ability to depolymerize both selectively and in response to orthogonal stimuli, heat and pH. To utilize heat as a stimulus, poly(phthalaldehyde) (PPA) was used as a block of the copolymer, while poly(benzyl-4-hydroxymethylphenylcarbamate) (PPC) end-capped with a tertbutoxycarbonyl protecting group (Boc group) were explored for viability as a pH-responsive block. The stimulus-induced depolymerization was studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). These techniques confirmed that the depolymerization event did not affect the nature of the neighboring polymeric block. Depolymerization kinetics were measured for various chain lengths of each block. The results are presented and discussed to explore the ability of these materials to depolymerize in a controlled manner depending on the magnitude of the stimulus, as well as the ability for the blocks to remain unaffected by the orthogonal stimulus. This work shows promise for the development of advanced coatings systems and drug delivery applications.

AB  - The use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as an environmental tool to evaluate the sustainability of different bioenergy pathways has become a common practice since the European Renewable Energy Directive was published in 2009. In the evaluation of bioenergy produced out from dedicated energy crops, nitrogen fertilizer production and use are commonly identified as the most important contributors to fossil energy consumption and to several environmental impacts categories including Global Warming Potential. In considering the impacts produced by the nitrogen fertilization of energy crops and in addition to the effects of fertilization schemes on the biomass yield, more attention should be paid to the changes in soil nitrogen to know if fertilization doses and application schemes are sufficient enough to maintain soil nitrogen stocks and ensure that soil quality is preserved for future years. To this aim, in this work soil nitrogen balance is used as an indicator to estimate the evolution of soil nitrogen stocks and complement LCA calculations. In this paper, the effects of three nitrogen top fertilization doses (null, 30 and 80 kg NI (hay)) used for rye cultivation are compared when ry is grown as a dedicated energy crop for electricity generation under the Spanish province of Soria conditions. A LCA was carried out using experimental crop testing results and a centralised (25 MWe) straw power plant data in combination with soil nitrogen balance obtained in each of the experimental crop trials. After that, the LCA results were compared with those obtained when electricity is generated from natural gas in Spanish power plants. According to the average calculations, each additional kg N/(ha y) applied in top fertilization produces a reduction of 0.18% on GHG savings with respect to natural gas electricity, as well as a worsening in the energy balance of 0.00084 TJ fossil energy per TJ of electricity generated but reduces soil nitrogen deficit in 0.43 kg N/(ha y). For top fertilization doses of 80 kg N/(ha y) the average GHG savings with respect to natural gas were 63.7% and the average non-renewable energy consumption was 6, 4 times less for the bioenergy system than for natural gas. Fossil energy accounted for more than 95% of total nonrenewable energy in this calculation. This work evidences that determinate biomass growing conditions associated to high GHG savings and improved energy balances may cause detrimental effects for soil fertility due to considerable associated negative soil nitrogen balances. This finding suggests the convenience to include the soil nitrogen balance as a complementary indicator for bioenergy LCA calculations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of wood fuel for energy production in the UK is set to increase in the near future as part of a government commitment to increase renewable sources to 10 per cent by 2010. The ash generated as a by-product of combustion, whether for heat or power generation, has potential use as a fertilizer in forest systems. This review assesses the available information on factors affecting the quality of the ash and environmental implications arising from its application. The key determinants of wood ash chemistry are the tree species combusted, the nature of the burn process and the conditions at the application site. Wood ash from hardwood species produces higher levels of macronutrients in their ash than conifers, and the silica content is frequently lower. A furnace temperature between 500 and 900 degrees C is critical to the retention of nutrients, particularly potassium, and determines the concentrations of potentially toxic metals including aluminium in the ash. Fly ash, the lightest component that accumulates in the flue system, can contain high concentrations of cadmium, copper, chromium, lead and arsenic and this ash should not be used as fertilizer. The form of the ash at application is important, with loose ash releasing Ca, K and Na more rapidly than granulated ash. Heavy metal, radionuclide and dioxin contamination of wood ash-based fertilizers is minimal and unlikely to affect ecosystem function. The effects of wood ash are primarily governed by application rate and soil type. The benefits are maximized at low dose rates, with possible toxicity from applications in excess of 10 t ha(-1). For most forest sites, a single wood ash application per rotation could replace all the nutrients lost after whole-tree harvesting (excepting N). Long-lasting positive effects on tree growth have been observed on shallow peats, in which the humus is slowly mineralized in response to elevated pH and increased nutrient availability. In contrast, wood ash application to podzols is only effective in enhancing tree growth when nitrogen availability is non-limiting. To date, published research of wood ash effects on trees growing in clays and loams is minimal. A lag time for positive tree responses to wood ash application is often observed, and may be the result of phosphorous limitation at higher soil pH. The greatest reported adverse ecological effects are to acidophilic ecosystems, particularly the constituent bryophyte, soil bacteria and ectomycorrhizal communities.

The amplitude of these diel vertical migrations (DVM) varies from several hundreds of metres in the oceans to approx. 5-20 m in lakes. DVM can be studied from a proximate and an ultimate point of view. A proximate analysis is intended to reveal the underlying behavioural mechanism and the factors that cause the daily displacements. The ultimate analysis deals with the adaptive significance of DVM and the driving forces that were responsible for the selection of the traits essential to the behavioural mechanism. The freshwater cladoceran Daphnia is the best studied species and results can be used to model migration behaviour in general. Phototaxis in Daphnia spp., which is defined as a light-oriented swimming towards (positive phototaxis) or away (negative phototaxis) from a light source, is considered the most important mechanism basic to DVM. A distinction has been made between primary phototaxis which occurs when light intensity is constant, and secondary phototaxis which is caused by changes in light intensity. Both types of reaction are superimposed on normal swimming. This swimming of Daphnia spp. consists of alternating upwards and downwards displacements over small distances. An internal oscillator seems to be at the base of these alternations. Primary phototaxis is the result of a dominance of either the upwards or the downwards oscillator phase, and the direction depends on internal and external factors: for example, fish-mediated chemicals or kairomones induce a downwards drift. Adverse environmental factors may produce a persistent primary phototaxis. Rare clones of D. magna have been found that show also persistent positive or negative primary phototaxis and interbreeding of the two types produces intermediate progeny: thus a genetic component seems to be involved. Also secondary phototaxis is superimposed on normal swimming: a continuous increase in light intensity amplifies the downwards oscillator phase and decreases the upwards phase. A threshold must be succeeded which depends on the rate and the duration of the relative change in light intensity. The relation between both is given by the stimulus strength versus stimulus duration curve. An absolute threshold or rheobase exists, defined as the minimum rate of change causing a response if continued for an infinitely long time. DVM in a lake takes place during a period of 1.5-2 h when light changes are higher than the rheobase threshold. Accelerations in the rate of relative increase in light intensity strongly enhance downwards swimming in Daphnia spp, and this enhancement increases with increasing fish kairomone and food concentration. This phenomenon may represent a 'decision-making mechanism' to realize the adaptive goal of DVM: at high fish predator densities, thus high kairomone concentrations, and sufficiently high food concentrations, DVM is profitable but not so at low concentrations. Body axis orientation in Daphnia spp. is controlled with regard to light-dark boundaries or contrasts. Under water, contrasts are present at the boundaries of the illuminated circular window which results from the maximum angle of refraction at 48.9 degrees with the normal (Snell's window). Contrasts are fixed by the compound eye and appropriate turning of the body axis orients the daphnid in an upwards or an obliquely downwards direction.
   A predisposition for a positively or negatively phototactic orientation seems to be the result of a disturbed balance of the two oscillators governing normal swimming. Some investigators have tried to study DVM at a laboratory scale during a 24 h cycle. To imitate nature, properties of a natural water column, such as a large temperature gradient, were compressed into a few cm. With appropriate light intensity changes, vertical distributions looking like DVM were obtained. The results can be explained by phototactic reactions and the artificial nature of the compressed environmental factors but do not compare with DVM in the held.
   A mechanistic model of DVM based on phototaxis is presented. Both, primary and secondary phototaxis is considered an extension of normal swimming. Using the light intensity changes of dawn and the differential enhancement of kairomones and food concentrations, amplitudes of DVM could be simulated comparable to those in a lake.
   The most important adaptive significance of DVM is avoidance of visual predators such as juvenile fish. However, in the absence of fish kairomones, small-scale DVMs are often present, which were probably evolved for UV-protection, and are realized by not enhanced phototaxis. In addition, the 'decision-making mechanism' was probably evolved as based on the enhanced phototactic reaction to accelerations in the rate of relative changes in light intensity and the presence of fish kairomones.

AB  - Using the HURDAT best track analysis of track and intensity of tropical cyclones that made landfall over the continental United States during the satellite era (1980-2005), we analyze the role of land surface variables on the cyclone decay process. The land surface variables considered in the present study included soil parameters (soil heat capacity and its surrogate soil bulk density), roughness, topography and local gradients of topography. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using a data-adaptive genetic algorithm approach that automatically selects the most suitable variables by fitting optimum empirical functions that estimates cyclone intensity decay in terms of given observed variables. Analysis indicates that soil bulk density (soil heat capacity) has a dominant influence on cyclone decay process. The decayed inland cyclone intensities were found to be positively correlated with the cube of the soil bulk density (heat capacity). The impact of the changes in soil bulk density (heat capacity) on the decayed cyclone intensity is higher for higher intensity cyclones. Since soil bulk density is closely related to the soil heat capacity and inversely proportional to the thermal diffusivity, the observed relationship can also be viewed as the influence of cooling rate of the land surface, as well as the transfer of heat and moisture underneath a land-falling storm. The optimized prediction function obtained by statistical model processes in the present study that predicts inland intensity changes during 6-h interval showed high fitness index and small errors. The performance of the prediction function was tested on inland tracks of eighteen hurricanes and tropical storms that made landfall over the United States between 2001 and 2010. The mean error of intensity prediction for these cyclones varied from 1.3 to 15.8 knots (0.67-8.12 m s(-1)). Results from the data-driven analysis thus indicate that soil heat flux feedback should be an important consideration for the inland decay of tropical cyclones. Experiments were also undertaken using Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) Advanced Research Version (ARW ver 3.3) to assess the sensitivity of the soil parameters (roughness, heat capacity and bulk density) on the post-landfall structure of select storms. The model was run with 1-km grid spacing, limited area single domain with boundary conditions from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Of different experiments, only the surface roughness change and soil bulk density (heat capacity) change experiments showed some sensitivity to the intensity change. The WRF results thus have a low sensitivity to the land parameters (with only the roughness length showing some impact). This calls for reassessing the land surface response on post-landfall characteristics with more detailed land surface representation within the mesoscale and hurricane modeling systems.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this review was to provide a summary of the current agriculture determinants of economically important traits, and solutions for challenges in water buffalo production to maximize benefits for both producers and consumers.
   Sources: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the current state of knowledge of water buffalo published in high-quality peer-reviewed journals. The search revealed important progress in generation of knowledge about uses, economically important traits, challenges, and science-based solutions of water buffalo. Molecular determinants of key economically important traits such as longevity, disease resistance, milk production and quality, meat production and quality, growth and development, heat stress, and fertility are deciphered.
   Synthesis: Water buffalo are important sources of food and fiber for the ever-increasing global human population. Drought-adapted water buffalo provide meat, and highly nutritious milk used to make cream, butter, yogurt, and cheese. Despite valuable contributions to agriculture and human well-being, there are current and emerging challenges and opportunities. High resolution sequencing of breeds and comprehensive annotation of the genomes are not yet available. In addition, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge about economically important traits including longevity, disease resistance, milk production and quality, meat production and quality, growth and development, heat tolerance, and fertility. With the advances in both basic science and technology, the gaps in the knowledge in these areas can be tackled with innovative research and systems biology approaches. In addition, the power of comparative animal and functional genomics can be harnessed to fill in the gaps. The core elements of sustainable solutions include education, innovative, transformative and translational research, and technology transfer.
   Conclusions and Applications: Knowledge about the fundamental biology of water buffalo gives the power to improve sustainable, efficient, and profitable production. Although a considerable amount of information is available, providing new knowledge about the economically important traits will enable precision farming in water buffalo agriculture. New data and knowledge generated through the genome to phenome will uncover essential molecular, cellular, and physiological markers for marker-assisted selection and breeding to enhance the efficiency of reproduction and production as well as product quality. Future studies using systems physiology approaches will advance the science and technology for water buffalo. These new frontiers are important for empowering the next generation of animal scientists and the public as well as for food security on the global scale.

AB  - To evaluate the survival of Salmonella on raw almond surfaces, whole almond kernels were inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis phage type (PT) 30 collected from a 24-h broth culture or by scraping cells from an agar lawn. Kernels inoculated with lawn-collected cells to 8, 5, 3, and 1 log CFU per almond after a 24-h drying period were stored for 161 days at 23 +/- 3 degrees C. Calculated rates of reduction were similar for the four inoculum levels (0.22, 0.28, 0.29, and 0.22 log CFU/month, respectively). Kernels inoculated to 7.1 or 8.0 log CFU per almond after drying were stored for 171 or 550 days, respectively, at selected temperatures, including -20 +/- 2 degrees C, 4 +/- 2 degrees C, 23 +/- 3 degrees C, and 35 +/- 2 degrees C. No significant reductions of Salmonella were observed during storage at -20 and 4 degrees C over 550 days. At 35 degrees C, a biphasic survival curve was observed, with calculated reductions of 1.1 log CFU/month from days 0 to 59 and no significant reduction from days 59 to 171. At 23 degrees C, reductions of 0.18 and 0.30 log CFU/month were calculated for 171 and 550 days of storage, respectively. When combined with data from the study of inoculum levels, an overall average calculated reduction at 23 degrees C was 0.25 +/- 0.05 log CFU/month. Significantly greater reductions were observed during the 24-h drying period when broth-collected cells were used as the inoculum, suggesting that cells collected from agar lawns were more resistant to drying. However, after initial drying, the rates of reduction at 23 degrees C did not differ significantly between the inoculum preparation methods. Salmonella Enteritidis PT 30 survives for long periods on almond kernels under a variety of common storage conditions.

KW  - GROWTH
AB  - The humidity on the surface of the red planet, Mars, drops steeply during the daytime as the temperature rises. In this situation, Martian microorganisms should have the capability to cope with desiccation. Extremophiles are microorganisms that are capable of surviving in extreme environmental conditions. It has previously been shown that a pre-exposure to low levels of either ionizing or non-ionizing radiation can induce resistance against subsequent exposure to high levels of different stressors (e.g. high doses of ionizing radiation) in a wide variety of living systems. Moreover, it has been shown that E. coli bacteria repeatedly exposed to a dose needed for 1% survival, and increasing the dose each time due to increased radioresistance for the same survival (1%), generates extremely radioresistant bacteria through directed evolution. Mortazavi et al. have warned that in a similar manner with extremophiles such as Deinococcus radiodurans, it would be very likely that this type of human-directed radioresistance makes E. coli bacteria resistant to all physical and chemical agents (generation of serious life-threatening micro-organisms). There are reports about the possibility of the existence of microbes in the salty puddles of Mars. On Mars, with its thin atmosphere and lack of the protective magnetic field, higher levels of space radiation cause more genetic mutations. Interestingly, these mutations in bacteria, which can make them resistant against radiation, can also make them resistant against desiccation. Moreover, the adaptive response to radiation in bacteria might play an important role in this process. As stated in a NASA report, the cells in the astronauts will be traversed by multiple protons before exposure to HZE particles. This sequential exposure might significantly increase the resistance against radiation. The same exposure in bacteria might not only induce resistance against the high levels of damage caused by HZEs, but also to other life-threatening factors for bacteria such as desiccation. In this paper, the current understanding of extremophiles and their capability of surviving in extreme environmental conditions as well as current findings about radioadaptive responses in bacteria will be discussed.

AB  - The Cretaceous Paleogene marine sedimentary succession exposed in the banks of the middle reaches of the Waipara River (referred to as mid-Waipara), north Canterbury, New Zealand, has been the subject of several high-profile studies of Paleogene paleoclimate over the past decade. It is one of relatively few sections globally where a multi-proxy approach is possible due to the good preservation of microfossils and organic biomarkers. The Eocene section is also well dated by magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy based on planktic foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils and dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts). Here, we build on this previous work and undertake a comprehensive analysis of paleontological and geochemical indicators of climatic and environmental changes through the early middle Eocene part of the section, with particular focus on the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO; 53.26-49.14 Ma). We correlate a 33.5 m-thick interval with the EECO, based on biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, TEX86-paleothermometry and bulk carbonate delta C-13. Our new sea-surface temperature (SST) record based on TEX86 agrees with a previous lower resolution record based on TEX86 and planktic foraminiferal delta O-18 and Mg/Ca ratios. The EECO interval in this section extends from the upper part of the New Zealand Waipawan Stage to the Mangaorapan/Heretaungan Stage boundary at 49.27 Ma. The EECO onset is not exposed, but the termination is well constrained by a fall in SST and shift to more positive delta C-13 values. Six negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) are recognised within the EECO and are tentatively correlated with CIEs J/K, M, O, Q, T and C22nH4 in the global delta C-13 compilation. The CIEs are associated with warmer SSTs, indicating that they represent hyperthermals. The BAYSPAR TEX86 calibration indicates SST increased by as much as 12 degrees C from the early Eocene (similar to 55 Ma) to the EECO, where SST peaked at 35 degrees C. SST gradually declined from mid EECO (similar to 51 Ma) into the middle Eocene. The marked warming in the early EECO is associated with the highest abundance of warm-water taxa in calcareous nannofossil and dinocyst assemblages, the highest proportion of planktic foraminifera, and a coeval long-term shift to abundant angiosperm vegetation, primarily driven by a rise in Casuarinaceae. There is good agreement between TEX86 and marine microfossilbased proxies for temperature, providing confidence that both approaches are useful guides to past water temperature. Warm-water marine taxa are most abundant in the EECO but are not dominant. Comparison of the abundance of nannofossil warm-water taxa between mid-Waipara and a low-latitude site on Shatsky Rise suggests the latitudinal temperature gradient between mid- and low-latitudes in the EECO was greater than the TEX86 proxy implies. There is no clear evidence for enhanced sedimentation rates associated with the EECO, in contrast to evidence from the nearby Mead Stream section. Superabundant Homotryblium, a euryhaline dinocyst, in the early and middle EECO suggests elevated salinity and/or stratified surface waters, and there is no clear evidence of increased surface productivity associated with the EECO. Declining SST in the late EECO, 50 Ma, corresponds with an increase in cool-water taxa and terrigenous material.
   This article highlights the importance of combining well-calibrated paleontological and geochemical records to better constrain and understand past warm climate states.

AB  - Shared fire-survival and fire-persistence traits are found in taxonomically unrelated plant species that commonly grow in fire-prone ecosystems. Such traits include resprouting, after fire has killed the above-ground biomass, and postfire seed release after the death of individual plants. Classification of such traits has led to a change in focus from research on the impact of fire as a disturbance factor on individual species, towards research into plant functional types associated with fire. This has led to a better understanding of the timing and geographic evolution of such traits as either fire-adapted or as a selective response to other disturbance factors. The identification of fire-survival and fire-persistence traits in fire-prone ecosystems is the first focus of this paper. It is followed by a discussion of recent research which offers a critical reappraisal of patch mosaic burning as a means to increase landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity, including the role played by plant functional types in determining diversity. The fire-prone ecosystems of mediterranean-type shrublands and heathlands, savannas and grasslands, and boreal and other coniferous forests are the main geographic focus of the paper.

One approach was to use rhizobia associated with legume species indigenous to arctic and subarctic regions: (i) Mesorhizobium sp. isolated from Astragalus and Oxytropis spp. and (H) Rhizobium leguminosarum from Lathryrus spp. The majority of these rhizobia are considered psychrotrophs because they can grow at 0 degreesC. The advantages of cold adaptation of arctic Mesorhizobium to improve legume symbiosis were demonstrated with the temperate forage legume sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia). In laboratory and field studies, arctic rhizobia were more efficient than temperate (commercial) rhizobia in improving growth of sainfoin and were more competitive in forming nodules. Biochemical studies on cold adaptation showed higher synthesis of cold shock proteins in cold-adapted than in nonadapted arctic rhizobia. Since arctic Mesorhizobium cannot nodulate agronomically important legumes, the nodulation genes and the bacterial signals (Nod factors) were characterized as a first step to modifying the host specificity of nodulation. Another valuable approach was to screen for cold adaptation, that is, rhizobia naturally associated with agronomic legumes cultivated in temperate areas. A superior strain of Sinorhizobium meliloti adapted for nodulation of alfalfa at low temperatures was selected and was the most efficient for improving growth of alfalfa in laboratory and field studies. This strain also performed well in improving regrowth of alfalfa after overwintering under cold and anaerobic (ice encasement) stresses, indicating a possible cross-adaptation of selected rhizobia for various abiotic stresses inherent to temperate climates.

AB  - The sensitivity of silage maize to changing climate in Denmark under varying Nitrogen (N) and undersown catch crop (CC) treatments was investigated using a process-based, soil-plant-atmosphere model; Farm Assesment Tool (FASSET), and the impact response surfaces (IRS). The baseline period consisted of an experiment over a 3-year time period from 2009 to 2011 that was carried out in mid Jutland, Denmark (56 degrees 5'N, 9 degrees 56'E 38 m asl). The results indicated that an increase from the average annual temperature (approximate to 6.5 degrees C) of up to 1.5 degrees C is beneficial for maize yield. At approximately 8 degrees C annual average temperature and above, the yield dropped sharply, and any positive impact of varying N treatments and CC was diminished. The maize yield was not as sensitive to precipitation as it was to temperature. The undersown grass in silage maize was not found to be a viable option in relation to warmer climate for all of its benefits were widely overshadowed by the excessive NO3- leaching risk. This study suggested that the warming of the climate along with the projected increase in precipitation in Denmark in the future will greatly challenge the management of N in maize cropping systems. Under changing climate, increasing crop N uptake efficiency by both maize and CC should be targeted as priority. Root growth in this context is an essential feature for the N uptake efficiency. Further research on potential adaptation of different deep-rooted species in the warmer climate that might be suitable as undersown CC is needed.

AB  - reptiles thermoregulate to achieve body temperatures needed for biological processes, such as digestion and growth. Temperatures experienced during embryogenesis may also influence post-hatching growth rate, potentially through influencing post-hatching choice of temperatures. We investigated in laboratory settings whether embryonic temperatures (constant 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C and 22 degrees C) influence selected body temperatures (T-sel) of juvenile tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), providing a possible mechanism for differences in growth rates. We found that incubation temperature does not influence T-sel. Although the average daily mean T-sel was 21.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C, we recorded individual T-sel values up to 33.5 degrees C in juvenile tuatara, which is higher than expected and above the panting threshold of 31-33 degrees C reported for adults. We found diel patterns of T-sel of juvenile tuatara, observing a general pattern of two apparent peaks and troughs per day, with T-sel being significantly lower around dawn and at 1500 h than any other time. When comparing our results with other studies on tuatara there is a remarkable consistency in mean T-sel of similar to 21 degrees C across tuatara of different ages, sizes and acclimatization histories. The ability of juvenile tuatara to withstand a wide range of temperatures supports their former widespread distribution throughout New Zealand and warrants further investigation into their plasticity to withstand climate warming, particularly where they have choices of habitat and the ability to thermoregulate.

AB  - Late Cenozoic marine proxy data record a long-term transition in the tropical Pacific from El Nino-like conditions with reduced zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, deepened thermocline, and reduced upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) to conditions similar to modern. This transition coincides with kilometer-scale uplift of the central Andes. To understand whether the rise of the Andes contributed to tropical Pacific climate evolution, we performed experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Climate System Model version 4 to quantify changes in tropical Pacific climate and El Nino-Southern Oscillation as a function of Andean elevations. Our results demonstrate that uplift increases the equatorial east-west SST gradient and Walker circulation. The rise of the Andes from 1 to 3 km increases the SST gradient by 0.8 degrees C and Walker circulation by 60% due to strengthened radiative cooling by enhanced low-cloud formation in the EEP. This cooling effect is largest in the southeastern tropical Pacific and accounts for about one half of the reconstructed SST cooling along the Peru coast. The uplift also strengthens upwelling north of the EEP, consistent with documented increases in biological productivity in this region, and decreases the frequency of El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the number of strong El Nino events. Simulated responses to Andean uplift are generally consistent with the late Cenozoic proxy records, but too small in magnitude. Taken together, our results indicate that Andean uplift was likely one of the multiple factors that contributed to the long-term evolution of both the mean climate state and the interannual variability in the tropical Pacific.

AB  - Lignocellulose composed of complex carbohydrates and aromatic heteropolymers is one of the principal materials for the production of renewable biofuels. Lignocellulose-degrading genes from cold-adapted bacteria have a potential to increase the productivity of biological treatment of lignocellulose biomass by providing a broad range of treatment temperatures. Antarctic soil metagenomes allow to access novel genes encoding for the cold-active lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, for biotechnological and industrial applications. Here, we investigated the metagenome targeting cold-adapted microbes in Antarctic organic matter-rich soil (KS 2-1) to mine lignolytic and celluloytic enzymes by performing single molecule, real-time metagenomic (SMRT) sequencing. In the assembled Antarctic metagenomic contigs with relative long reads, we found that 162 (1.42%) of total 11,436 genes were annotated as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy). Actinobacteria, the dominant phylum in this soil's metagenome, possessed most of candidates of lignocellulose catabolic genes like glycoside hydrolase families (GH13, GH26, and GH5) and auxiliary activity families (AA7 and AA3). The predicted lignocellulose degradation pathways in Antarctic soil metagenome showed synergistic role of various CAZyme harboring bacterial genera including Streptomyces, Streptosporangium, and Amycolatopsis. From phylogenetic relationships with cellular and environmental enzymes, several genes having potential for participating in overall lignocellulose degradation were also found. The results indicated the presence of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria in Antarctic tundra soil and the potential benefits of the lignocelluolytic enzymes as candidates for cold-active enzymes which will be used for the future biofuel-production industry.

AB  - The South American fur seal, Arctocephalus australis, was one of the earliest otariid seals to be exploited by humans: at least 6000 years ago on the Atlantic coast and 4000 on the Pacific coast of South America. More than 750,000 fur seals were killed in Uruguay until 1991. However, a climatological phenomenon-the severe 1997-1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-was responsible for the decline of 72% Of the Peruvian fur seal population due to starvation as a consequence of warming of sea-surface temperatures and primary productivity reduction. Currently, there is no precise information on global population size or on the species' conservation status. The present study includes the first bottleneck test for the Pacific and Atlantic populations of A. australis based on the analysis of seven microsatellite loci. Genetic bottleneck compromises the evolutionary potential of a population to respond to environmental changes. The perspective becomes even more alarming due to current global warming models that predict stronger and more frequent ENSO events in the future. Our analysis found moderate support for deviation from neutrality-equilibrium for the Pacific population of fur seals and none for the Atlantic population. This difference among population reflects different demographic histories, and is consistent with a greater reduction in population size in the Pacific. Such an event could be a result of the synergic effects of recurrent ENSO events and the anthropogenic impact (sealing and prey overfishing) on this population.

AB  - Using results from four coupled global carbon cycle-climate models combined with in situ observations, we estimate the effects of future global warming and ocean acidification on potential habitats for tropical/subtropical and temperate coral communities in the seas around Japan. The suitability of coral habitats is classified on the basis of the currently observed regional ranges for temperature and saturation states with regard to aragonite (Omega(arag)). We find that, under the "business as usual" SRES A2 scenario, coral habitats are projected to expand northward by several hundred kilometers by the end of this century. At the same time, coral habitats are projected to become sandwiched between regions where the frequency of coral bleaching will increase, and regions where Omega(arag) will become too low to support sufficiently high calcification rates. As a result, the habitat suitable for tropical/subtropical corals around Japan may be reduced by half by the 2020s to 2030s, and is projected to disappear by the 2030s to 2040s. The habitat suitable for the temperate coral communities is also projected to decrease, although at a less pronounced rate, due to the higher tolerance of temperate corals for low Omega(arag). Our study has two important caveats: first, it does not consider the potential adaptation of the coral communities, which would permit them to colonize habitats that are outside their current range. Second, it also does not consider whether or not coral communities can migrate quickly enough to actually occupy newly emerging habitats. As such, our results serve as a baseline for the assessment of the future evolution of coral habitats, but the consideration of important biological and ecological factors and feedbacks will be required to make more accurate projections.

AB  - Polycrystalline LiCo0.33Ni0.33Mn0.33O2 compounds were prepared via a sol-gel auto combustion synthesis route to examine its conduction mechanism with thermal assessment and a new window of its application as a field emitter is explored. The structural modules and molecular footmarks have been confirmed by XRD, Raman, FTIR, XPS and FESEM techniques. The Nyquist plots (Z' vs. Z '') exhibits significant contribution of electrode solid interface effect with compared to intra and inter granular contribution. The variation of real and imaginary impedance, modulus, and conductivity spectra with thermal evolution is attributed with the creation of a quasi-particle called "polaron" and the migration of small polaron by tunneling/hopping creates localized state in high temperature. However, a weak crossover between small polaron hopping (SPH) and Mott's variable range hopping (VRH) is observed near 323 K. The colossal dielectric permittivity (epsilon'(r))similar to 5 x 10(6) is originated from inhomogeneous electronic conduction process in LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 due to the creation of absorption current in the flimsy grain boundary which leads to the stockpile of charge carriers in the external-electrode sample interface and induces Maxwell-Wagner electrode interfacial polarization. The exquisite field emission properties were discovered in LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 with low turn-on field@ 1 mu A/cm(2)similar to 2.75 V/mu m and threshold field@ 10 mu A/cm(2)similar to 4.39 V/mu m with field enhancement factor (beta) similar to 4251.

AB  - Seeds play key roles in the acquisition of plant pioneer microbiota, including the transmission of microbes from parent plants to offspring. However, the issues about seed microbial communities are mostly unknown, especially for their potential origins and the factors influencing the structure and composition. In this study, samples of rice seed and rhizosphere were collected from northeast and central-south China in two harvest years and analyzed using a metabarcoding approach targeting 16S rRNA gene region. A higher level of vertical transmission (from parent seed microbiota to offspring) was revealed, as compared to the acquisition from the rhizosphere (25.5 vs 10.7%). The core microbiota of the rice seeds consisted of a smaller proportion of OTUs (3.59%) than that of the rice rhizosphere (7.54%). Among the core microbiota, species inArthrobacter,Bacillus,Blastococcus,Curtobacterium,Pseudomonas, andRamlibacterhave been reported as potential pathogens and/or beneficial bacteria for plants. Both the seed and the rhizosphere of rice showed distance-decay of similarity in microbial communities. Seed moisture and winter mean annual temperature (WMAT) had significant impacts on seed microbiota, while WMAT, total carbon, available potassium, available phosphorus, aluminum, pH, and total nitrogen significantly determined the rhizosphere microbiota. Multiple functional pathways were found to be enriched in the seed or the rhizosphere microbiota, which, to some extent, explained the potential adaptation of bacterial communities to respective living habitats. The results presented here elucidate the composition and possible sources of rice seed microbiota, which is crucial for the health and productivity management in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Pruning of Clementine requires a lot of time: more than 50 days of work per hectare in the traditional forms of orchard management. Because of the high cost and the lack of specialised workers, we observe a general tendency to delay the frequency of pruning in the citrus orchards. On the other hand regular pruning is of fundamental importance to have good fruit quality, to maintain health status of the orchard, and to store their regular productivity.
   In order to optimise the Clementine pruning technique, reduce the time of execution and maintain a good level of yield of better quality a field experiment was designed. In 1996 a commercial orchard of 'SRA 63' Clementine located in Southern East Sardinia was selected for the experiment. Plants were grafted on 'Troyer' Citrange, twenty-year-old, spaced 7x5 m, shaped to globe, over 4 m in height, and showed an excessive number of main branches (about 7-8 per tree) with a dense canopy.
   The entire orchard was preliminarily submitted to a gradual shape pruning during the first four years. In 2000 two main plots of 72 plants each were designed: A) pruning every year; and B) pruning every two years. The orchard was observed for a further period of four years for the following characters: trunk section area; canopy size, working time for pruning; pruned wood weight; fruit yield; fruit size.
   In both pruning applications (A and B) the canopy was more open and green than in the past, with a improvement of the plant heath status, a reduction of the number of treatments, water for irrigation and fertilizers, less working time for harvest, and with a significant better fruit size and increase of the production value.

AB  - Methanol is considered a promising liquid fuel for hydrogen fuel cell systems. Catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methanol offers the potential of producing hydrogen for these systems, and is capable of high hydrogen production rates with no heat addition. However, the mechanism of methanol CPO is not completely understood due to its complexity. In this work, methanol CPO on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts was studied using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and mass spectrometry.
   Methanol adsorption experiments were conducted on different catalyst states. Methoxy species, CH3OS, were formed during dissociative adsorption of methanol. As temperature was increased, formate adspecies, likely formed by reaction of methoxy species with surface hydroxyls, were increasingly formed. Ignition of CPO was also studied, and it was found to occur at room temperature on both reduced and oxidized powder catalysts. Formate disappeared during this process, while CO species and Co-2 were detected in the products.
   CPO was studied at different temperatures from 723 K to 973 K, and for methanol to oxygen mole ratios from 2 to 4. It was found that CO2 productivity increased at lower temperatures and H-2 and CO had a higher selectivity at higher temperatures. Fuel lean conditions favored H-2 and HCOOH production. CO2 increased when O-2 concentration increased in the reaction mixture.
   These results suggest that formate was one of the important intermediates in the methanol partial oxidation reaction pathway. Indirect formate decomposition is dominant for CO2 production in the reactions at higher temperatures. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present results of the evolution of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of 3 and 5 M. with solar metallicity calculated with the Eggleton stellar evolution code (STARS), which has a fully implicit and simultaneous method for solving for the stellar structure, convective mixing and nuclear burning. We introduce the concept of a viscous mesh in order to improve the numerical stability of the calculations. For the 5-M. star, we evolve through 25 thermal pulses and their associated third dredge-up events. We obtain a maximum helium luminosity of 1.7 x 10(9) L. and significantly deep dredge-up after the second pulse. Strong hot-bottom burning is observed after the fifth pulse. The 3-M. model is evolved through 20 thermal pulse events, and we find third dredge-up after the seventh pulse. During the 14th pulse, sufficient carbon has been brought to the surface to produce a carbon star. We find that dredge-up and the transformation into a carbon star occur at significantly smaller core masses (0.584 and 0.608 M., respectively) than in previous calculations for 3 M..

AB  - Monitoring of renal LH-excretion, changes in genital tumescence and menses assesses reproductive status in zookept female chimpanzees. Temporary detumescence of female sex skin in estrus is a reliable indicator for stress. Assessment of female chimpanzee reproductive status relates to local and individual variation of cycle length and temporal correlation of investigated parameters. Monitoring of neonate chimpanzee behavioural ontogeny is an essential tool of evaluating applied rearing methods since individuals were to be integrated into the adult group during adolescence. Slow and continuous transition periods between consecutive rearing phases avoid irreversible disturbed behaviour. Care by one person up to the age of 12 months, followed by a 3 year stay in a peer group guarantee normal development in zookept infant chimpanzees. 4-5 years old chimpanzees with infantile attributes and abilities to submit and appease can be integrated to adults with low risk. In female gorillas sexual cyclicity was monitored by renal excretion of LH, length of menses, sexual behaviour and - in tame females - by basal body temperature and variation of length of the urogenital cleft. Intraspecific variation of cyclicity allowed individual fertility assessment after comparison of several cycles. Analyses of behaviour gave hints to overcharged adaptability and reduced infertility under inadequate maintenance. Data on semen and testicular biopsy improve fertility-evaluation in gorilla males and point to degree and time of tissue alteration and etiology. Body hygiene analogous to the human, tool use and interspecific play with chimpanzees and humans behind window screens were observed in inadequately kept gorillas. Homosexual behaviour among females was reversible with environmental and social changes. Coalitions among nonrelated females were-an effective social strategy against an aggressive male. Cyclicity was disturbed drastically by social events such as physical lesions made by a male but normalized with improved social situation. Disturbed cyclicity featured prolongation of interestrus intervals and complete detumescence, oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea. Nulliparous females in their third decennium needed more than 1,5 years of social contact to a fertile male to become fullterm pregnant. During the first two months of pregnancy stillbirths and embryonic resorptions were detected. Hand-reared and inexperienced primiparous gorilla females accepted their infants and reared them normally after witnessing motherrearing in neighbored chimpanzee females for several years. Opportunities of free choice and decision making determine zookept pongid behaviour, that cannot be compared with prisoners' ethology. Adaptations of ontogenetic behaviour and reproduction, teleonomic patterns and zoomorphism are of zoobiological relevance. Adaptations develope during prolonged periods of time and thus results of corresponding management issues are to be assessed a posteriori.

AB  - Temperature preference is vital for the survival of all animals. A small set of warm-activated anterior cell (AC) neurons acting as an internal thermosensor in the Drosophila brain is critical for optimal temperature selection (Hamada et al., 2008, Nature, 454, 217--220). Here, the authors analyze the circuit components of the AC neurons by characterization of its spatial distribution, dendrite-axon polarity, and the putative type of neurontransmitter released. The results show that the AC neurons are serotonergic, do not have any dendrites, and send axons bilaterally to the superior dorsofrontal protocerebrum (SDFP). Searching the FlyCircuit database for neurons with serotonin receptor and dendrites in the SDFP, the authors found a dorsal-anterior-lateral (DAL) neuron as a candidate postsynaptic partner of the AC neurons. In conclusion, by morphological analysis of the AC neurons, the authors show a general strategy for predicting brain circuits orchestrating thermosensory behaviors.</.

We describe the design of an environmental chamber to simulate these high altitudes and present an experimental investigation of the engine operation at high altitude on Jet A-I. comparing this to the engine's performance at sea level. Although attention must be paid to the provision of adequate cooling, no modification to the engine itself is required. Our final system provides very high reliability and produces 1500 W of electrical power with a fuel consumption of 280 g k Wh(-1). A bank of ultracapacitors is used to start the engine in the cold environment of Antarctica. We describe the low-temperature operation and survival tests that we performed on the ultracapacitors and the engine. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Among vertebrates, only a few species of amphibians and reptiles tolerate the formation of ice crystals in their body fluids. Freeze tolerance is much more widespread in invertebrates, especially in overwintering insects. Evolutionary adaptations for freeze tolerance are considered to be highly complex. Here we show that surprisingly simple laboratory manipulations can change the chill susceptible insect to the freeze tolerant one. Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly of tropical origin with a weak innate capacity to tolerate mild chilling, can survive when approximately 50% of their body water freezes. To achieve this goal, synergy of two fundamental prerequisites is required: (i) shutdown of larval development by exposing larvae to low temperatures (dormancy) and (ii) incorporating the free amino acid proline in tissues by feeding larvae a proline-augmented diet (cryopreservation).

AB  - The genetic relationship of 345 specimens of the parthenogenetic lumbricid Dendrobaena octaedra from Greenland, Canada and Europe were analysed by means of isozymes. The results showed that populations from Greenland were markedly different from Canadian and European populations, suggesting that dispersal between Greenland and the continents has been much more restricted in the past than dispersal between North America and Europe. This observation supports to the notion that Greenland populations have persisted for a long period and perhaps have survived the Last glacial period in ice-free refugia. A highly significant positive correlation was seen between diversity measured either as mean haptoid diversity or clonal. diversity and mean temperature of the annual coldest month. These results indicate that temperature might cause selection in colder climates or that sexual processes in D. dendroboeno could have been active recently on an evolutionary time scale.

AB  - Effects of recent climate change have already been detected in many species, and, in particular, in insects. The present paper reviews the key impacts of global warming on insect development and dispersal. The effects of climate change appear to be much more complex than a simple linear response to an average increase in temperature. They can differ between seasons and bioclimatic regions. Earlier flight periods, enhanced winter survival and acceleration of development rates are the major insect responses. Differential response of insects and hosts to warming up might also lead to disruption of their phenological synchrony, but adaptive genetic processes are likely to quickly restore this synchrony. In a number of cases, warming results in removing or relocating the barriers that limit present species' ranges. It is also likely to facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive alien species. Finally, knowledge gaps are identified and future research interests are suggested.

AB  - Enhanced melt productivity as a consequence of buoyant upwelling and small-scale convection of the mantle during rifting may play an important role in determining the fundamental structure of igneous crust produced during and following continental breakup. This paper investigates the relationship between rift-related decompression melting and the influence of small-scale mantle convection and rift geometry on the subsequent production and distribution of melt-related crust. Extension of the lithosphere is modelled numerically using a 2-D plane-strain finite element method for viscous-plastic creeping flows. The evolving temperature and pressure fields within the model are coupled to an algorithm that predicts the amount and timing of decompression melting of upwelling mantle. Predicted melt fractions are converted to equivalent thicknesses of igneous crust, and the predicted crustal thicknesses for a series of models are compared to the observed crustal structure of rifted margins inferred from seismic data. Models characterized by small-scale mantle convection can to first order reproduce the general architecture of most volcanic rifted margins, that is, a relatively narrow band of thick (12-13 km) igneous crust (inferred to occur along strike of the margin), juxtaposed with thinner oceanic crust farther offshore. The variability in thickness (4-7 km) predicted for the later stage thinner igneous crust is however difficult to reconcile with global observations of oceanic crustal thickness (7 +/- 1 km). Also, the peak 13 km thickness of igneous crust predicted for models with convectively enhanced upwelling fails to match the great thicknesses (>= 20 km) of igneous crust observed at many volcanic margins. Composite models that include both small-scale convection and a small increase to mantle potential temperature predict large pulses in initial magmatism and generation of 17 to 21-km-thick crust, followed by unstable production of thinner igneous crust. The results indicate that models with small-scale convection and no temperature anomaly may play a role in explaining the formation of volcanic margins with only moderately thick (11-15 km) igneous crust. Further, convection coupled with small increases to mantle temperature may be important during the initial phase of very thick igneous crust generation at some volcanic margins. Predicted distributions of igneous crust are moderately sensitive to asymmetric rifting of the lithosphere. Prior to breakup, igneous crust accretion is asymmetric; subsequent to breakup, symmetry in the thermal structure of the upwelling sublithospheric mantle is the dominant control on the final distribution of igneous crust.

AB  - The Permian Lucaogou Formation (P(2)l) in the Jimusaer Sag, Junggar Basin is an essential source rock and a tight oil-producing layer in China. The source rock of the Lucaogou Formation is characterized by mixed sedimentation of siliciclastics, carbonates, and tuffaceous materials, and the formation of mixed source rocks is different from that of conventional source rocks (e.g., mudstones or carbonates). Our petrological observation and X-ray diffraction mineralogical analysis suggest that the mixed source rocks are divided into three types: terrigenous-dominated mixed rocks (Td-mixed rocks), carbonate-dominated mixed rocks (Cd-mixed rocks), and tuffaceous-dominated mixed rocks (Tuf-mixed rocks). Compared with the upper section, more Td- and Tuf-mixed rocks, as well as less Cd-mixed rocks, developed in the lower section. Integrated organic geochemical and molecular geochemical analyses indicate that the Lucaogou mixed source rock is abundant in organic matter (OM) (TOC = 3.12 wt %), which is at the thermally low mature to mature stage. The sources of OM mainly originate from the mixture of planktonic organisms, bacteria, and terrigenous higher plants. Comparatively, some geochemical parameters (e.g., TOC, S-1 + S-2, and hydrogen index) of the upper section of P(2)l show slightly higher values than those of the lower section both before and after extraction, indicating a higher hydrocarbon generation potential of the source rocks in the upper section. Besides, more finely disseminated bacterial and planktonic organics are present in the upper section, whereas the lower section is more enriched in terrestrial OM. The mixed source rocks of the lower section were deposited in a deeper, anoxic-dysoxic, and brackish environment, whereas those of the upper section were deposited in a shallow, suboxic, saline, and evaporative environment. Moreover, we found that the lacustrine basin evolved from a more balanced-filled scenario with moderate productivity during the lower section deposition to an under-filled lake basin with higher productivity during the upper section deposition, in response to the climatic change from warm humid to hot semiarid conditions. Accordingly, the corresponding depositional models of mixed source rocks in the upper and lower sections of the Lucaogou Formation are proposed. Overall, the mixed rocks of the Lucaogou Formation can be regarded as good source rocks, which could offer favorable targets and resource potential for tight oil exploration.

AB  - Much has been published on the effects of ocean acidification on plankton since the original Royal Society 2005 report. In addition to direct effects on primary production, it is clear that ocean acidification also has profound consequences for biogeochemistry. Furthermore, although ocean acidification can have direct effects of on grazers such as copepods, acidification induces changes in nutritional value of phytoplankton which can be passed on up the food chain. There has also been recognition of the complexity of the interactions between elevated CO2 and other environmental factors and this has seen an upsurge in climate change research involvingmultifactorial experiments. In particular, the interaction of ocean acidification with global warming resulting from the increasing greenhouse effect has been investigated. There has also been research on acidification and warming effects in inland water plankton. These, combined with novel experimental techniques and long termstudies of genetic adaptation, are providing better insights to plankton biology and communities in a future world.

TI  - ITQ-12: A zeolite having temperature dependent adsorption selectivity and potential for propene separation
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
LA  - English
KW  - DD3R
AB  - A study of the adsorption properties of the new, 8-ring, pure silica zeolite ITQ-12 at several temperatures reveals that it has unique, temperature dependent adsorption selectivity and high potential for the separation of propene from propene/propane mixtures. At 30 degreesC, propene is adsorbed more than 100 times faster than propane, forming the basis for a kinetic based separation. Unexpectedly, at 80 degreesC, little or no propane adsorption is observed whereas there is no evidence for any unusual decrease in propene adsorption, a property adding to the potential of this zeolite for propene separation. A small, temperature induced decrease in the minimum dimension of the ITQ-12's "slit shaped" cages is proposed as the reason for the loss of sorption capacity for the slightly larger propane molecules. ITQ-12's unique, temperature-dependent property gives rise to a sorption selectivity that is thermodynamically driven rather than the result of diffusion barriers. Preliminary PSA simulations indicate 99.5% purity propene can be achieved with productivity significantly larger than that reported for the aluminophosphate based zeolite, AlPO-14.

AB  - Inconel 718, a hard-to-cut superalloy is reputed for having poor machining performance due to its low thermal conductivity. Consequently, the surface quality of the machined parts suffers. The surface roughness value must fall within the stringent limits to ensure the functional performance of the components used in aerospace and bioimplant applications. One doable way to enhance its machinability is the adequate dissipation of heat from the machining zone through efficient and ecofriendly cooling environment. With this perspective, an experimental and integrated green-response surface machining-based-evolutionary optimization (G-RSM-EO) approach is presented during this investigation. The results are compared with two base-line techniques: the traditional flooded approach with Hocut WS 8065 mineral oil, and the dry green approach. A Box-Behnken response surface methodology (RSM) is employed to design the milling tests considering three control parameters, i.e., cutting speed (v(s)), feed/flute (f(z)), and axial depth of cut (a(p)). These control parameters are used in the various experiments conducted during this research work. The parametric analysis is then accomplished through surface plots, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is presented to assess the effects of these control parameters. Afterwards, a multiple regression model is developed to identify the parametric relevance of v(s), f(z), and a(p), with surface roughness (SR) as the response attribute. A residual analysis is performed to validate the statistical adequacy of the predicted model. Lastly, the surface roughness regression model is considered as the objective function of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) model to minimize the surface roughness of the machined parts. The optimized SR results are compared to the widely employed genetic algorithm (GA) and RSM-based desirability function approach (DF). The confirmatory machining tests proved that the integrated optimization approach with PSO being an evolutionary technique is more effective compared to GA and DF with respect to accuracy (0.05% error), adequacy, and processing time (3.19 min). Furthermore, the study reveals that the Mecagreen 450 biodegradable oil-enriched flooded strategy has significantly improved the milling of Inconel 718 in terms of eco-sustainability and productivity, i.e., 42.9% cost reduction in cutting fluid consumption and 73.5% improvement in surface quality compared to the traditional flooded approach and the dry green approach. Moreover, the G-RSM-EO approach presents a sustainable alternative by achieving a Ra of 0.3942 mu m that is finer than a post-finishing operation used to produce close tolerance reliable components for aerospace industry.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are Gram-negative bacteria that are typically resistant to most or all antibiotics and are responsible for a global pandemic of high mortality. Rapid, accurate detection of CPOs and the classification of their carbapenemases are valuable tools for reducing the mortality of the CPO-associated infections, preventing the spread of CPOs, and optimizing use of new beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam and imipenem/relebactam. The current study evaluated the performance of CPO Complete, a novel, manual, phenotypic carbapenemase detection and classification test. The test was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity against 262 CPO isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii and 67 non-CPO isolates. It was also evaluated for carbapenemase classification accuracy against 205 CPOs that produced a single carbapenemase class. The test exhibited 100% sensitivity 98.5% specificity for carbapenemase detection within 90 minutes and detected 74.1% of carbapenemases within 10 minutes. In the classification evaluation, 99.0% of carbapenemases were correctly classified for isolates that produced a single carbapenemase. The test is technically simple and has potential for adaptation to automated instruments. With lyophilized kit storage at temperatures up to 38 degrees C, the CPO Complete test has the potential to provide rapid, accurate carbapenemase detection and classification in both limited resource and technologically advanced laboratories.

AB  - Genetic analysis of Drosophila has provided evidence in support of two proposed evolutionary genetic mechanisms of aging: mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy. Both mechanisms result from the lack of natural selection acting on old organisms. Analyses of large numbers of flies have revealed that mortality rates do not continue to rise with age as previously thought, but plateau at advanced ages. This phenomenon has implications both for models and for definitions of aging, and may be explained by the evolutionary theories. The physiological processes and genes most relevant to aging are being identified using Drosophila lines selected in the laboratory for postponed senescence. Oxidative stress and insufficient metabolic reserves/capacity may be particularly important factors in limiting the fruitfly lifespan. Genes which exhibit aging-related changes in expression are now being identified. Transgenic flies are being used to analyze the mechanisms of such aging-related gene expression, and to test the effects of specific genes on aging and aging-related deterioration.

AB  - In this paper, we pose and solve an adaptive extremum control problem to optimize the productivity of a van de Vusse reaction taking place in a tubular reactor governed by a set of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Estimation and control algorithms that take into account control input constraints are developed by using a Lyapunov-based procedure, ensuring stability and convergence under a persistency of excitation condition. Here, we assume that the temperature information along the reactor is the only available on-line measurement to estimate the unmeasured objective function at the reactor exit. Numerical application of the proposed method shows that the resulting feedback algorithm steers the system to its optimum using a non-distributed jacket temperature actuation. The time evolution of the cost function is compared with an idealized distributed version of the algorithm presented previously. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Feeding systems is an important factor for productivity and quality of casting. In this paper, the computation of feed-path based on temperature gradient method is proposed to remedy the deficiencies in the feeder optimisation through traditional numerical methods. Feed-path is the direction of microscopic flow of liquid metal during solidification. In the aspect of calculation, feed-path consists of a series of vectors in the direction of maximum temperature gradient at the evolving solid-liquid interface during the solidification process. With the help of feed-path, the feed-regions in castings can be identified, potential defects of cavity shrinkage as well as centreline porosity can be predict, and the direction and distance of feeding can be visualised intuitionally, providing reliable basis for feeder design. A typical casting is set as an example to illustrate the computation of feed-path based on temperature gradient method, and the facility of feed-path in the feeder optimisation is verified with a ladder sample.

AB  - Maps of interpolated climate normals have recently become essential tools for many types of forestry research, such as studying genetic adaptation of trees to local environments, modeling species ranges shifts, or forest productivity under climate change scenarios. In this paper, we evaluate two widely used climate models for British Columbia with respect to their general precision and regional bias. We discuss limitations due to the resolution of the current "state of the art" PRISM climate model and provide new methodology for "intelligent" up-sampling of the PRISM model for studies that require spatially explicit climate data. In order to stress the importance of choosing an adequate climate model and understanding its limitations, we provide two examples where baseline climate models caused misleading predictions of how the climate envelope of ecosystems shifts as a consequence of increased temperature, and how tree growth may respond to climate change.

AB  - The pathogenic microorganism Listeria monocytogenes is ubiquitous and responsible for listeriosis, a disease with a high mortality rate in susceptible people. It can persist in different habitats, including the farm environment, the food production environments, and in foods. This pathogen can grow under challenging conditions, such as low pH, low temperatures, and high salt concentrations. However, L. monocytogenes has a high degree of strain divergence regarding virulence potential, environmental adaption, and stress response. This review seeks to provide the reader with an up-to-date overview of clonal and serotype-specific differences among L. monocytogenes strains. Emphasis on the genes and genomic islands responsible for virulence and resistance to environmental stresses is given to explain the complex adaptation among L. monocytogenes strains. Moreover, we highlight the use of advanced diagnostic technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing, to fine-tune quantitative microbiological risk assessment for better control of listeriosis.

AB  - A study on the preferred physicochemical and metallurgical properties of fluxed pellets has been undertaken assuming a higher pellet ratio in order to maintain a higher productivity of sinter plants. Experimental conditions were selected to simulate a high PCR operation at the blast furnace for evaluating commercial pellets under high production rate operation. The higher PCR would potentially result in a wider cohesive zone due to the relatively increased load distributed onto the burdens and encourage gradual widening of the cohesive zone due to the higher level of hydrogen and a virtual load increase onto the burdens. As a result of various changes inside the furnace with increased PCR, the size consistency of all charge materials must be controlled and maintained, aside from monitoring their metallurgical properties. Experiments were carried out to determine the effects of the load, pre-reduction and hydrogen gas on the high temperature characteristics of the commercial pellets. The results indicated that the high PCR operation would have a wider cohesive zone compared to the all-coke operation.

AB  - Ocean warming and acidification are serious threats to marine life. While each stressor alone has been studied in detail, their combined effects on the outcome of ecological interactions are poorly understood. We measured predation rates and predator selectivity of two closely related species of damselfish exposed to a predatory dottyback. We found temperature and CO2 interacted synergistically on overall predation rate, but antagonistically on predator selectivity. Notably, elevated CO2 or temperature alone reversed predator selectivity, but the interaction between the two stressors cancelled selectivity. Routine metabolic rates of the two prey showed strong species differences in tolerance to CO2 and not temperature, but these differences did not correlate with recorded mortality. This highlights the difficulty of linking species-level physiological tolerance to resulting ecological outcomes. This study is the first to document both synergistic and antagonistic effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on a crucial ecological process like predator-prey dynamics.

AB  - Background: Theory suggests that biodiversity can act as a buffer against disturbances and environmental variability via two major mechanisms: Firstly, a stabilising effect by decreasing the temporal variance in ecosystem functioning due to compensatory processes; and secondly, a performance enhancing effect by raising the level of community response through the selection of better performing species. Empirical evidence for the stabilizing effect of biodiversity is readily available, whereas experimental confirmation of the performance-enhancing effect of biodiversity is sparse.
   Results: Here, we test the effect of different environmental regimes (constant versus fluctuating temperature) on bacterial biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relations. We show that positive effects of species richness on ecosystem functioning are enhanced by stronger temperature fluctuations due to the increased performance of individual species.
   Conclusions: Our results provide evidence for the performance enhancing effect and suggest that selection towards functionally dominant species is likely to benefit the maintenance of ecosystem functioning under more variable conditions.

AB  - Photodriven CH(4)conversion has been regarded as a promising green strategy for fabrication of value-added commodity chemicals, in particular methanol. However, due to the incomplete transformation of intermediates or the overoxidation of products, a good selectivity of methanol is hard to achieve. Here, we present a highly selective transformation of methane to methanol using gold modified zinc oxide as a photocatalyst under full light spectrum irradiation at atmospheric temperature. The selectivity of methanol can reach 99.1% with a productivity of 1371 mu mol g(-1). Fine tuning the loading amount of gold nanoparticles (0.75 wt%) and inputting an appropriate light energy are the pivotal factors for selectivity improvement. Besides, in contrast to the reported photocatalytic aerobic CH(4)oxidation on gold modified zinc oxide, we find that both oxygen and water, rather than only molecular oxygen, provide the O-source for methanol formation. This result is verified through(18)O-isotope tests ((18)O(2)and (H2O)-O-18), leading to a disparate mechanism.

AB  - Nature's selection of the contemporary nucleobases in RNA and DNA continues to intrigue the origin of life community. While the prebiotic synthesis of the N-glycosyl bond has historically been a central area of investigation, variations in hydrolytic stability among the N-glycosyl bonds may have presented an additional selection pressure that contributed to nucleobase and nucleoside evolution. To experimentally probe this hypothesis, a systematic kinetic analysis of the hydrolytic deglycosylation reactions of modified, alternative, and native nucleosides was undertaken. Rate constants were measured as a function of temperature (at pH 1) to produce Arrhenius and Eyring plots for extrapolation to 37 degrees C and determination of thermodynamic activation parameters. Rate enhancements based on the differences in reaction rates of deoxyriboglycosidic and riboglycosidic bonds were found to vary under the same conditions. Rate constants of deoxynucleosides were also measured across the pH range of 1-3 (at 50 degrees C), which highlighted how simple changes to the heterocycle alone can lead to a significant variation in deglycosylation rates. The contemporary nucleosides exhibited the slowest deglycosylation rates in comparison with the nonnative/alternative nucleosides, which we suggest as experimental support for nature's selection of the fittest N-glycosyl bonds.

TI  - Taking evolutionary circuit design from experimentation to implementation: some useful techniques and a silicon demonstration
T2  - IEE PROCEEDINGS-COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL TECHNIQUES
LA  - English
AB  - Current techniques in evolutionary synthesis of analogue and digital circuits designed at transistor level have focused on achieving the desired functional response, without paying sufficient attention to issues needed for a practical implementation of the resulting solution. No silicon fabrication of circuits with topologies designed by evolution has been done before, leaving open questions on the feasibility of the evolutionary circuit design approach, as well as on how high-performance, robust, or portable such designs could be when implemented in hardware. It is argued that moving from evolutionary 'design-for experimentation' to 'design-for-implementation' requires, beyond inclusion in the fitness function of measures indicative of circuit evaluation factors such as power consumption and robustness to temperature variations, the addition of certain evaluation techniques that are not common in conventional design. Several such techniques that were found to be useful in evolving designs for implementation are presented; some are general, and some are particular to the problem domain of transistor-level logic design, used here as a target application. The example used here is a multifunction NAND/NOR logic gate circuit, for which evolution obtained a creative circuit topology more compact than what has been achieved by multiplexing a NAND and a NOR gate. The circuit was fabricated in a 0.5 mum CMOS technology and silicon tests showed good correspondence with the simulations.

AB  - Cuticular permeability is thought to be related to the biophysical properties of cuticular waxes and, in turn, to the chemical composition of this boundary layer. However, thus far evidence for this relationship has been elusive. We investigated possible correlations between habitat and inter- and intraspecific variations in two parameters likeley to affect crystallinity and transition melting temperatures of waxes. Three species from the family Cupressaceae (Austrocedrus chilensis, Fitzroya cupressoides, Pilgerodendron uviferm) were selected as a model system because they are closely related and form a continuum over 20 degrees of latitude in South America that includes important climatic differences. We found major divergence among the three species and more fine-scale population differentiation for A. chilensis and P. uviferum in weighted mean carbon number (N) and dispersion about this mean (d). Broad-sense heritabilities, estimated from ramet-ortet regressions and from analysis of variance among ortets of F. cupressoides were 0.92 for N and from 0.64-0.76 for d. Even in areas of close sympatry, species maintained their unique biochemical characteristics, thus supporting the genetic basis of cuticular hydrocarbons. Both species and population patterns suggest that natural selection has favored cuticular hydrocarbon mixes that provide differential fitness in the face of habitat differences in water stress and temperature.

AB  - Ultrasound-stimulated IR thermography, thanks to its large-area imaging capability, high test productivity and safety, is a powerful tool for the inspection of cracks in heavy aluminum structures. In thick aluminum parts, the most important defect detection parameters are the differential temperature signal and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which typically reach their maximums at shortly (under 1 s) after the beginning of the ultrasonic excitation. In the IR inspection of non-metals, the ultrasonic excitation may be relatively long, while in the case of highly-conductive aluminum, short-pulse (burst) stimulation (from 0.4 to 1 s) is sufficient The crack detectability can be improved by evaluating temperature images at the times when maximum SNR values occur. Further enhancement of test results can be achieved by applying some data processing algorithms which can be 1D, i.e. applied to temperature evolutions in time, or 20, i.e. applied to spatial coordinates, or a single image.

AB  - Observed changes in weather can reveal marginal impacts of climate change on economic outcomes and the potential for adaptation. When modeling the nonlinear relationship between weather and changes in economic outcomes empirically, model choice can confound the interpretation of marginal and percentage effects and their respective confidence intervals. I present a simple solution for better characterizing semi-elasticities of nonlinear climate damages, and evaluate its relevance in interpreting empirical climate damages. For small marginal effects, the implications of this interpretation error is small; for larger effects, however, the misinterpretation error can be substantial.

AB  - We studied male phonotactic behaviors elicited by acoustic cues that simulate conspecific male songs in the field cricket, Gryllus texensis. Males exhibited significant positive phonotaxis in response to the simulated song stimuli, but showed no such response to atypical song stimuli. We found no significant relationship between males' own calling behavior and their phonotactic responses to the stimuli. Analyses indicated that larger males exhibited greater phonotactic responses, which may indicate a greater tendency to engage in aggressive interactions if size is an indicator of fighting ability. Male phonotactic responses were significantly weaker than those exhibited by females, and adult males did not exhibit stronger responses with increasing age as has been documented for females. Observed sex differences in the strengths of phonotactic responses may reflect differences in the fitness-payoffs of responding. That is, females are under strong selection pressure to respond to male songs and subsequently mate. In contrast, males responding to acoustic signals from other males need not precisely locate the signaler but would likely move to areas where females are likely to be found. Alternatively, males might benefit from avoiding areas with calling males and establishing their own calling stations away from competing males.

AB  - Theory suggests that heterogeneous environments should maintain more genetic variation within populations than homogeneous environments, yet experimental evidence for this effect in quantitative traits has been inconsistent. To examine the effect of heterogeneity on quantitative genetic variation, we maintained replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster under treatments with constant temperatures, temporally variable temperature, or spatially variable temperature with either panmictic or limited migration. Despite observing differences in fitness and divergence in several wing traits between the environments, we did not find any differences in the additive genetic variance for any wing traits among any of the treatments. Although we found an effect of gene flow constraining adaptive divergence between cages in the limited migration treatment, it did not tend to increase within-population genetic variance relative to any of the other treatments. The lack of any clear and repeatable patterns of response to heterogeneous versus homogeneous environments across several empirical studies suggests that a single general mechanism for the maintenance of standing genetic variation is unlikely; rather, the relative importance of putative mechanisms likely varies considerably from one trait and ecological context to another.

AB  - A warmer climate may increase the risk of attacks by insect pests on agricultural crops, and questions on how to adapt management practice have created a need for impact models. Phenological models driven by climate data can be used for assessing the potential distribution and voltinism of different insect species, but the quality of the simulations is influenced by a range of uncertainties. In this study, we model the temperature-dependent activity and development of the Colorado potato beetle, and analyse the influence of uncertainty associated with parameterization of temperature and day length response. We found that the developmental threshold has a major impact on the simulated number of generations per year. Little is known about local adaptations and individual variations, but the use of an upper and a lower developmental threshold gave an indication on the potential variation. The day length conditions triggering diapause are known only for a few populations. We used gridded observed temperature data to estimate local adaptations, hypothesizing that cold autumns can leave a footprint in the population genetics by low survival of individuals not reaching the adult stage before winter. Our study indicated that the potential selection pressure caused by climate conditions varies between European regions. Provided that there is enough genetic variation, a local adaption at the northern distribution limit would reduce the number of unsuccessful initiations and thereby increase the potential for spreading to areas currently not infested. The simulations of the impact model were highly sensitive to biases in climate model data, i.e. systematic deviations in comparison with observed weather, highlightening the need of improved performance of regional climate models. Even a moderate temperature increase could change the voltinism of Leptinotarsa decemlineata in Europe, but knowledge on agricultural practice and strategies for countermeasures is needed to evaluate changes in risk of attacks.

AB  - Reproductive diapause is a primary mechanism used by arthropods to synchronize their life cycle with seasonal changes in temperate regions. Our study species, Drosophila montana, represents the northern insect species where flies enter reproductive diapause under short day conditions and where the precise timing of diapause is crucial for both survival and offspring production. We have studied clinal variation in the critical day length for female diapause induction (CDL) and their overall susceptibility to enter diapause (diapause incidence), as well as the temperature sensitivity of these traits. The study was performed using multiple strains from four latitudinal clines of the species - short clines in Finland and Alaska and long clines in the Rocky Mountains and the western coast of North America - and from one population in Kamchatka, Russia. CDL showed strong latitudinal clines on both continents, decreasing by one hour per five degrees decline in latitude, on average. CDL also decreased in all populations along with an increase in fly rearing temperature postponing the diapause to later calendar time, the effects of temperature being stronger in southern than in northern population. Female diapause incidence was close to 100% under short day/low temperature conditions in all populations, but decreased below 50% even under short days in 19 degrees C in the southern North American western coast populations and in 22 degrees C in most populations. Comparing a diversity of climatic data for the studied populations showed that while CDL is under a tight photoperiodic regulation linked with latitude, its length depends also on climatic factors determining the growing season length. Overall, the study deepens our understanding of how spatial and environmental parameters affect the seasonal timing of an important biological event, reproductive diapause and helps to estimate the evolutionary potential of insect populations to survive in changing climatic conditions.

AB  - Parameter extraction of photovoltaic models based on measured current-voltage data plays an important role in the simulation, control, and optimization of photovoltaic systems. Although many parameter extraction techniques have been devoted to solving this problem, they may suffer from some deficiencies. In this paper, an enhanced adaptive differential evolution algorithm is proposed to extract photovoltaic parameters fast, accurately and reliably. In proposed method, the crossover rate sorting mechanism is introduced to assign each individual to an adapted crossover rate value according to their fitness values, which allows good elements to be more inherited in next generation. In addition, a dynamic population reduction strategy is used to improve the convergence speed and balance the exploration and exploitation. The performance of proposed method is confirmed by extracting parameters of different photovoltaic models, i.e., single diode, double diode, and photovoltaic modules. The simulated results show that the proposed method exhibits competitive performance on accuracy, reliability and convergence speed compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the test results on experimental data from the manufacturers data sheet also indicate that the proposed algorithm can obtain superior solutions at different irradiance and temperature. Therefore, the proposed method can be an effective and efficient alternative for parameter extraction of photovoltaic models.

AB  - Effects of climate warming on trophic cascades are increasingly reported for large herbivores occupying northern latitudes. During the last 40 years, moose (Alces alces) in northeast China have lost nearly half of their historical distribution through their habitat shifting northwards. There are many possible causes of bottom-up and topdown effects of temperature and for moose in northeast China they are poorly understood. Of particular relevance are the effects of extrinsic environmental factors on gene flow, nutritional adaptions, and gut microbiota that occur as moose populations retreat northwards. We combined molecular biology, nutritional ecology and metagenomics to gain deeper mechanistic insights into the effects of temperature on moose populations. In this study, we revealed that the direction and intensity of gene flow is consistent with global warming driving retreats of moose populations. We interpret this as evidence for the northward movement of moose populations, with cooler northern populations receiving more immigrants and warmer southern populations supplying emigrants. Comparison across latitudes showed that warmer late spring temperatures were associated with plant community composition and facilitated related changes in moose protein and carbohydrate intake through altering forage availability, forage quality and diet composition. Furthermore, these nutrient shifts were accompanied by changes in gut microbial composition and functional pathways related to nutrient metabolism. This study provided insights into mechanisms driving effects of spatial heterogeneous warming on genetic, nutritional and physiological adaptions related to key demographic rates and patterns of survival of heat-sensitive ungulates along a latitude gradient. Understanding such changes helps to identify key habitat areas and plant species to ensure accurate assessment of population status and targeted management of moose populations.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-stage multi-objective evolutionary approach (MS-MOEA) for allocating parallel computations on multi-core processors by joint optimizing performance (P), energy (E), and temperature (T). Evolutionary techniques have been shown to be effective for solving optimization problems, including our own previous work on solving the PET-optimized scheduling (PETOS) problem. There have long been a great many debates and rivalries between various evolutionary approaches, such as the SPEA or NSGA, with regard to their relative matters. The novelty of the proposed MS-MOEA approach is its amalgamation of the basic evolutionary algorithms that are already shown to be highly effective, thereby creating a niche of these techniques. The niche takes advantages of the strengths of each baseline technique for achieving additional enhancement in the precision of the optimization. We propose six multi-stage hybrids, each designed with either niched fitness assignment strategy, or combining populations from multiple MOEAs, or incorporating the problem knowledge into the conventional technique. The experimental results measure the quality of resulting Pareto fronts and demonstrate that the proposed MS-MOEAs yield better optimization for the PETOS problem in achieving three-objective in parallel task-to-core mapping.

AB  - Despite considerable interest in temporal and spatial variation of phenotypic selection, very few methods allow quantifying this variation while correctly accounting for the error variance of each individual estimate. Furthermore, the available methods do not estimate the autocorrelation of phenotypic selection, which is a major determinant of eco-evolutionary dynamics in changing environments. We introduce a new method for measuring variable phenotypic selection using random regression. We rely on model selection to assess the support for stabilizing selection, and for a moving optimum that may include a trend plus (possibly autocorrelated) fluctuations. The environmental sensitivity of selection also can be estimated by including an environmental covariate. After testing our method on extensive simulations, we apply it to breeding time in a great tit population in the Netherlands. Our analysis finds support for an optimum that is well predicted by spring temperature, and occurs about 33 days before a peak in food biomass, consistent with what is known from the biology of this species. We also detect autocorrelated fluctuations in the optimum, beyond those caused by temperature and the food peak. Because our approach directly estimates parameters that appear in theoretical models, it should be particularly useful for predicting eco-evolutionary responses to environmental change.

AB  - As climate change challenges organismal fitness by creating a phenotype-environment mismatch, phenotypic plasticity generated by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) can provide a temporal buffer for genetic adaptation. Epigenetic mechanisms may be crucial for sessile benthic marine organisms, such as reef-building corals, where ocean acidification (OA) and warming reflect in strong negative responses. We tested the potential for scleractinian corals to exhibit phenotypic plasticity associated with a change in DNA methylation in response to OA. Clonal coral fragments of the environmentally sensitive Pocillopora damicornis and more environmentally robust Montipora capitata were exposed to fluctuating ambient pH (7.9-7.65) and low pH (7.6-7.35) conditions in common garden tanks for similar to 6 weeks. M. capitata responded weakly, or acclimated more quickly, to OA, with no difference in calcification, minimal separation of metabolomic profiles, and no change in DNA methylation between treatments. Conversely, P. damicornis exhibited diminished calcification at low pH, stronger separation in metabolomic profiles, and responsiveness of DNA methylation to treatment. Our data suggest corals differ in their temporal dynamics and sensitivity for environmentally triggered real-time epigenetic reprogramming. The generation of potentially heritable plasticity via environmental induction of DNA methylation provides an avenue for assisted evolution applications in corals under rapid climate change.

AB  - Aedes albopictus, the Asian Tiger Mosquito, vector of Chikungunya, Dengue Fever and Zika viruses, has proven its hardy adaptability in expansion from its natural Asian, forest edge, tree hole habitat on the back of international trade transportation, re-establishing in temperate urban surrounds, in a range of water receptacles and semi-enclosures of organic matter. Conventional aerial spray mosquito vector controls focus on wetland and stagnant water expanses proven to miss the protected hollows and crevices favoured by Ae. albopictus. New control or eradication strategies are thus essential, particular in light of potential expansions in the southeastern and eastern USA. Successful regional vector control strategies require risk level analysis. Should strategies prioritize regions with non-climatic or climatic suitability parameters for Ae. albopictus? Our study used current Ae. albopictus distribution data to develop two independent models: (i) regions with suitable non-climatic factors, and (ii) regions with suitable climate for Ac. albopictus in southeastern USA. Non-climatic model processing used Evidential Belief Function (EBF), together with six geographical conditioning factors (raster data layers), to establish the probability index. Validation of the analysis results was estimated with area under the curve (AUC) using Ae. albopictus presence data. Climatic modeling was based on two General Circulation Models (GCMs), Miroc3.2 and CSIRO-MK30 running the RCP 8.5 scenario in MaxEnt software. EBF non climatic model results achieved a 0.70 prediction rate and 0.73 success rate, confirming suitability of the study site regions for Ae. albopictus establishment. The climatic model results showed the best-fit model comprised Coldest Quarter Mean Temp, Precipitation of Wettest Quarter and Driest Quarter Precipitation factors with mean AUC value of 0.86. Both GCMs showed that the whole study site is highly suitable and will remain suitable climatically, according to the prediction for 2055, for Ae. albopictus expansion.

AB  - Newly molted first stage juvenile mud crabs (C1), Scylla paramamosain, were subjected to different temperatures (14, 20, 26, 32 and 39 degrees C), salinity (5, 10, 20, 30 and 40), starvation conditions and autotomy (for the autotomy experiment, the second stage crabs (C2) were used) to assess their effects on molting success, molting interval and corresponding expressions of the crab's ecdysone receptor (EcR). The results showed that at a low temperature of 14 degrees C no molt occurred with a subdued EcR mRNA level detected. In contrast, a higher temperature of 32 degrees C induced a significant increase in the expression of EcR gene and dramatically reduced the Cl molting interval as compared to other treatments. As the temperature further increased to 39 degrees C and after a period of 6 or more hours the expression of EcR gene dropped abruptly and all C1 crabs died without molt. On the other hand, a low salinity of 5 increased EcR mRNA levels at 72 hand shortened the molting interval significantly whilst high salinity of 40 resulted in the opposite. No significant difference in percentage molting success was detected among salinity from 10 to 40. When C1 crabs were subjected to starvation for longer than 48 h, the expression of EcR was found to be significantly repressed as compared to the feeding control, in which none of the starved crabs successfully molted. Meanwhile, although the molting success of C2 crabs was not significantly affected by autotomy, the molting interval significantly increased from 5.8 days for intact crabs to 6.2 days for the autotomized crabs. Interestingly, when compared to intact crabs, the expression level of EcR gene in autotomized crabs was at first repressed (i.e. during the first 120 h) but increased sharply to a level significantly higher than the control at 134 h (i.e. during premolt stage of the autotomized crabs). Our results showed that temperature, salinity, starvation and autotomy all affected molting of early juvenile mud crabs and changes in their EcR mRNA levels appeared to play an important role in regulating the molting process. The current experiment also showed that S. paramamosain early juveniles could withstand a broad range of temperatures and salinity, therefore highlighting their adaptability to the seasonal variation in salinity and temperature of natural habitat.

AB  - The rare maritime ringlet butterfly (Coenonympha tullia nipisiquit McDonnough), which inhabits salt marshes in maritime Canada, experiences tidal flooding throughout its development. Its low vagility and the imminence of sea level rise call for the immediate investigation on the effect of flooding on survival. The maritime ringlet's tolerance to tidewater submergence for up to 24 h was compared with that of the inornate ringlet (C. tullia inornata Edwards), a subspecies occupying nearby upland meadows. The suitability of salt meadow cordgrass [Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl.], a major host of the maritime ringlet, for neonate inornate ringlet larvae was tested as well. Maritime ringlet larvae showed higher tolerance to tidewater submergence than inornate ringlet larvae, which were more likely to die from submergence stress after a few days. Although tidal submergence is probably not lethal to the maritime ringlet, there is a possibility of negative impact caused by prolonged submergence during storm tides. The inornate ringlet larvae failed to adopt S. patens, and all larvae died within 1 wk when forced to feed on it. The results suggest that the maritime ringlet has evolved physiological adaptations to saline wetland conditions that have enabled it to exploit its current habitat.

AB  - Adaptive mutations appear in response to selection. In the best-studied system, the two most controversial issues were resolved this year. The mutations are neither Lamarckian nor a peculiarity of bacterial sex, as had been suggested. They occur genome-wide in a hypermutable subpopulation of stressed cells. Genomic 'hot' and 'cold' regions may explain previous failures to detect similar mutations in other systems and at other sites. Stationary phase specific limitation of mismatch repair has also been discovered. (C) Current Biology Ltd ISSN 0959-437X.

AB  - The recent increased market demand for locally grown produce is generating interest in the application of techniques developed for controlled environment agriculture (CEA) to urban agriculture (UA). Controlled environments have great potential to revolutionize urban food systems, as they offer unique opportunities for year-round production, optimizing resource-use efficiency, and for helping to overcome significant challenges associated with the high costs of production in urban settings. For urban growers to benefit from CEA, results from studies evaluating the application of controlled environments for commercial food production should be considered. This review includes a discussion of current and potential applications of CEA for UA, references discussing appropriate methods for selecting and controlling the physical plant production environment, resource management strategies, considerations to improve economic viability, opportunities to address food safety concerns, and the potential social benefits from applying CEA techniques to UA. Author's viewpoints about the future of CEA for urban food production are presented at the end of this review.

AB  - Pancreas transplant achieves consistent long-term euglycemia in type 1 diabetes. Allograft thrombosis (AT) causes the majority of early graft failure. We compared outcomes of four anticoagulation regimens administered to 95 simultaneous kidney-pancreas or isolated pancreas transplanted between 1/1/2015 and 11/20/2018. Early postoperative anticoagulation regimens included the following: none, subcutaneous heparin/aspirin, with or without dextran, and heparin infusion. The regimens were empirically selected based on each surgeon's assessment of hemostasis of the operative field and personal preference. A sonographic-based global scoring system of AT is presented. The 47-month recipients and graft survival were 95% and 86%, respectively. Recipients with or without AT had similar survival. Five and four grafts were lost due to death and AT, respectively. Outcomes of prophylaxis regimens correlated with intensity of anticoagulation. Compared with no anticoagulation, an increase in hemorrhagic complications occurred exclusively with iv heparin. The higher arterial AT score found in regimens lacking antiplatelet therapy highlights the importance of early antiaggregants therapy. Abnormal fibrinolysis was associated with an increase in AT score. Platelet dysfunction, warm ischemia time, and enteric drainage were predictive of AT and, along with other known risk factors, were incorporated into an algorithm that matches intensity of early postoperative anticoagulation to the thrombotic risk.

AB  - This work analyses the distribution of living benthic foraminiferal assemblages of surface sediments in different intertidal areas of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), a polihaline and anthropized coastal lagoon. The relationships among foraminiferal assemblages in association with environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, Eh and pH), grain size, the quantity and quality of organic matter (enrichment in carbohydrates, proteins and lipids), pollution caused by metals, and mineralogical data are studied in an attempt to identify indicators of adaptability to environmental stress. In particular, concentrations of selected metals in the surficial sediment are investigated to assess environmental pollution levels that are further synthetically parameterised by the Pollution Load Index (PLI). The PLI variations allowed the identification of five main polluted areas. Concentrations of metals were also analysed in three extracted phases to evaluate their possible mobility, bioavailability and toxicity in the surficial sediment. Polluted sediment in the form of both organic matter and metals can be found in the most confined zones. Whereas enrichment in organic matter and related biopolymers causes an increase in foraminifera density, pollution by metals leads to a decline in foraminiferal abundance and diversity in those zones. The first situation may be justified by the existence of opportunistic species (with high reproduction rate) that can live in low oxic conditions. The second is explained by the sensitivity of some species to pressure caused by metals. The quality of the organic matter found in these places and the option of a different food source should also explain the tolerance of several species to pollution caused by metals, despite their low reproductive rate in the most polluted areas. In this study, species that are sensitive and tolerant to organic matter and metal enrichment are identified, as is the differential sensitivity/tolerance of some species to metals enrichment.

AB  - The introduction of exotic species can often cause problems in the structure and function of ecosystems. The case of Procambarus clarkii is a good example. The amount of impact that crayfish have on ecosystems is strongly influenced by the environmental conditions of the habitat they occupy. The crayfrsh population structure is also affected by these conditions owing to the high adaptive plasticity of the species. The size structure of a population is useful in predicting its ecological success and therefore its impact on the ecosystem. The objective of this study was to comparatively analyse six populations of P. clarkii from different ecosystem types in the Donana National Park (DNP) in Spain. In order to evaluate possible differences related to adaptation processes, comparisons based on several phenotypic and population dynamic traits were made. Environmental physicochemical parameters and water regime were recorded monthly. From our results, we could infer that although P. clarkii populations in the DNP did not differ phenotypically, they greatly differ physiologically, resulting in different growth rates, and structure and dynamic of the populations. This fact helps us to explain why the ecological impact of P. clarkii is very different from one ecosystem to another, and hopefully, to gain insight concerning the role of P. clarkii on the ecosystems. Differences were due to water regime and temperature, so recruitment and reproduction seasons were longer in the places flooded in spring and in early autumn. Population parameters appear more appropriate for predicting future selection trends in P. clarkii population growth rate and possible maximum length in DNP than morphometric analyses. Furthermore, the present paper has illustrated the crayfish's great adaptability to different ecosystems, which is the basis of its great ecological success.

AB  - An electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometric method (ET-AAS) was developed for the direct determination of iron in intestinal Caco-2 cells after studying cell viability and proliferation using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT test). Zeeman background correction and end-capped graphite tubes with L'vov platforms were used. Samples were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and pipetted directly into the graphite tube. The preashing, pretreatment and atomization steps were optimized. The temperatures selected were 600, 1200, and 2100 degrees C, respectively. Stability measurements were performed using iron standard solutions in DMSO on the one hand and acidified cell solutions on the other. Direct measurement and standard addition were compared in order to determine possible influences of the matrix. The low detection limit of the ET-AAS method (1.3 mu g/L or 3.3 mu g/g) combined with the small sample quantities required are ideal for the determination of iron in cells due to the low iron content and the limited growth area of the cells. The method was developed for iron uptake studies for toxicological purposes.

AB  - A biocompatible photothermal nanomedicine based on a PEGylated nanogel containing gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in a cross-linked network core of stimuli-responsive poly[ 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PEAMA) gel for cancer photothermal therapy (PTT) was prepared through the reduction of Au(III) ions without any reducing agents. The influence of the reduction conditions, such as pH, temperature, and N/Au ratio (molar ratio of the amino groups in the PEGylated nanogel to the Au(III) ions), on the formation of the GNPs in the stimuli-responsive PEAMA gel core (reducing environment) was also studied. Note that the PEGylated nanogel containing GNPs prepared at pH 6, 60 degrees C and N/Au 1 (PEGylated GNG (1)) was found to have the highest GNP-loading capacity with a diameter of about 8 nm, as observed by TEM; viz., about 27 GNPs formed in a single PEAMA gel core. PEGylated GNG (1) showed a remarkable photothermal efficacy (Delta T = 7.7 degrees C) under irradiation with Ar ion (Ar(+)) laser (514.5 nm) at a fluence of 39 W cm(-2) for 6 min (14 kJ cm(-2)). Note that PEGylated GNG (1) showed non-cytotoxicity in the absence of irradiation with Ar(+) laser (480 mu g mL(-1): > 90% cell viability), whereas pronounced cytotoxicity (IC(50) = 110 mu g mL(-1)) was observed for PEGylated GNG (1) under irradiation with Ar(+) laser at a fluence of 26 W cm(-2) for 5 min (7.8 kJ cm(-2)), because of the heat-generation from the GNPs in the cells, which resulted in selective and noninvasive cancer PTT. Thus, PEGylated GNG (1), which has a high GNP-loading capacity, would be a promising nanomedicine for cancer PTT.

AB  - Background Barley is one of the major cereal crops, which can provide a significant source of genes for stress tolerance due to its high diversity and adaptability. Metabolite traits are considered to be significant for adaptation of barley to heat stress. Methods and results In the present study, genetic relationships between 120 barley genotypes were determined with 50 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 26 inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers under heat stress and non-stress conditions. Moreover, genetic diversity of barley accessions was investigated using the studied markers covering 7 chromosomes of barley. Results In general, 153 and 85 polymorphic alleles were detected for SSR and ISSR and number of the observed polymorphic allele varied between 2-9 and 2-6, with an average of 3.26 and 3.26 alleles per locus, respectively. Markers of Bmag0223, GBMS180/180, HVM7, ISSR22, ISSR25, and ISSR48 were the most informative due to their high polymorphism information content value demonstrating that putative techniques utilized in this research can be powerful and valuable tools in breeding program of barley. Association analysis was performed between 9 important traits and SSR and ISSR markers using four statistical models. The results revealed that the model containing both population structure (Q) and general similarity in genetic background arising from shared kinship (K) factors reduced false positive associations between markers and phenotypes. Conclusions According to the results, some of markers related to more than one trait under normal conditions (ISSR31-2, HVM62, and GBMS180/180) and heat stress conditions (ISSR20-5, EBmac635, HVM14, and ISSR37-3) were determined, which can be considered to be the most interesting candidates for further studies and simultaneously will provide a useful target for the future breeding programs, such as marker-assisted selection (MAS).

AB  - The past two decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century have been characterized by global temperature rise and increased frequency of weather-induced extreme events such as floods, droughts, heavy rainfall, and heat waves. We investigated the heat and the cold waves in the Carpathian Region, an area whose rich biosphere is endangered by extreme events. We used the daily minimum (T-N) and maximum (T-X) temperature data collected in the framework of the CARPATCLIM project. Such high-resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) gridded data range from January 1961 to December 2010. In this study, a heat wave occurs when temperature is above the 90th percentile for at least five consecutive days and a cold wave occurs when temperature is below the 10th percentile for at least five consecutive days. The percentiles have been computed over the baseline period 1971-2000. We distinguish between night-time and daytime events and we discuss heat (and cold) waves considering at least five consecutive night and days with temperature above (below) the selected percentile. For each heat or cold wave event, we assigned duration, severity, and intensity. For these parameters and for frequency, we performed linear trend analysis for the period 1961-2010. The trends have been computed on an annual and seasonal basis and tested for statistical significance. Different spatial patterns of heat and cold waves characterize the Carpathian Region: heat wave events show general increase in all the parameters considered, while cold wave events show a decrease in all the variables West to the Carpathians and an increase North-East to the Carpathians. We also compiled a list of the most relevant heat waves that hit the Carpathian Region from 1961 to 2010: out of seven events, four occurred from 2000 to 2010. Instead, the 1960s and the 1980s have been the decades most hit by severe cold waves.

AB  - A novel method to improve the recovery of fines in the flotation process involving the use of a temperature-responsive copolymer poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-ethyl xanthate methacrylate) (PNEXMA) incorporating poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) and xanthate functionality has been investigated. Above a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), the polymer functions as both a collector and flocculant, forming hydrophobic aggregates of the valuable fines that are amenable to beneficiation by flotation. The viability of using PNEXMA for the flotation of sulfide fines has been evaluated based on initial screening with adsorption, contact angle and aggregation studies followed by flotation tests. The studies were conducted at both temperatures below and above the LCST, and the results were compared with an industrial collector, potassium amyl xanthate (PAX). Adsorption isotherms indicate a strong polymer affinity for chalcopyrite surfaces. The quartz contact angles were found to remain relatively hydrophilic and unchanged in the presence of the PNEXMA and PAX, while the chalcopyrite surface turned hydrophobic with contact angles above 60 degrees, comparable to PAX. Temperature-responsive reversible flocculation was also observed with the polymer on chalcopyrite, while no response was found with PAX or with quartz. Flotation studies with chalcopyrite confirmed that PNEXMA is able to act as a selective collector, with performances on par with PAX. However, no recovery improvement over PAX was observed in the -20 mu m fines fraction, which was attributed to the use of fully-liberated synthetic feed in the current work resulting in high fines recoveries with PAX not usually found in actual ground mineral ores.

AB  - Background: Extreme environments can impose strong ecological and evolutionary pressures at a local level. Ectotherms are particularly sensitive to low-temperature environments, which can result in a reduced activity period, slowed physiological processes and increased exposure to sub-zero temperatures. The aim of this study was to assess the behavioural and physiological responses that facilitate survival in low-temperature environments. In particular, we asked: 1) do high-altitude common frog (Rana temporaria) adults extend the time available for larval growth by breeding at lower temperatures than low-altitude individuals?; and 2) do tadpoles sampled from high-altitude sites differ physiologically from those from low-altitude sites, in terms of routine metabolic rate (RMR) and freeze tolerance? Breeding date was assessed as the first day of spawn observation and local temperature recorded for five, paired high-and low-altitude R. temporaria breeding sites in Scotland. Spawn was collected and tadpoles raised in a common laboratory environment, where RMR was measured as oxygen consumed using a closed respiratory tube system. Freeze tolerance was measured as survival following slow cooling to the point when all container water had frozen.
   Results: We found that breeding did not occur below 5 degrees C at any site and there was no significant relationship between breeding temperature and altitude, leading to a delay in spawning of five days for every 100 m increase in altitude. The relationship between altitude and RMR varied by mountain but was lower for individuals sampled from high-than low-altitude sites within the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (>= 900 m). In contrast, individuals sampled from low-altitudes survived freezing significantly better than those from high-altitudes, across all mountains.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that adults at high-altitude do not show behavioural adaptations in terms of breeding at lower temperatures. However, tadpoles appear to have the potential to adapt physiologically to surviving at high-altitude via reduced RMR but without an increase in freeze tolerance. Therefore, survival at high-altitude may be facilitated by physiological mechanisms that permit faster growth rates, allowing completion of larval development within a shorter time period, alleviating the need for adaptations that extend the time available for larval growth.

AB  - Microbes live in complex and constantly changing environments, but it is difficult to replicate this in the laboratory. Escherichia coli has been used as a model organism in experimental evolution studies for years; specifically, we and others have used it to study evolution in complex environments by incubating the cells into long-term stationary phase (LTSP) in rich media. In LTSP, cells experience a variety of stresses and changing conditions. While we have hypothesized that this experimental system is more similar to natural environments than some other lab conditions, we do not yet know how cells respond to this environment biochemically or physiologically. In this study, we began to unravel the cells' responses to this environment by characterizing the transcriptome of cells during LTSP. We found that cells in LTSP have a unique transcriptional program and that several genes are uniquely upregulated or downregulated in this phase. Further, we identified two genes, cspB and cspI, which are most highly expressed in LTSP, even though these genes are primarily known to respond to cold shock. By competing cells lacking these genes with wild-type cells, we show that these genes are also important for survival during LTSP. These data can help identify gene products that may play a role in survival in this complex environment and lead to identification of novel functions of proteins.
   IMPORTANCE Experimental evolution studies have elucidated evolutionary processes, but usually in chemically well-defined and/or constant environments. Using complex environments is important to begin to understand how evolution may occur in natural environments, such as soils or within a host. However, characterizing the stresses that cells experience in these complex environments can be challenging. One way to approach this is by determining how cells biochemically acclimate to heterogenous environments. In this study, we began to characterize physiological changes by analyzing the transcriptome of cells in a dynamic complex environment. By characterizing the transcriptional profile of cells in long-term stationary phase, a heterogenous and stressful environment, we can begin to understand how cells physiologically and biochemically react to the laboratory environment, and how this compares to more-natural conditions.

AB  - In a previous paper, using Eggleton's stellar evolution code, we have discussed the structure and evolution of low-mass W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) type contact binaries with angular momentum loss owing to gravitational radiation or magnetic braking. We find that gravitational radiation is almost insignificant for cyclic evolution of low-mass W UMa type systems, and it is possible for angular momentum to be lost from W UMa systems in a magnetic stellar wind. The weaker magnetic activity shown by observations in W UMa systems is likely caused by the lower mass of the convective envelopes in these systems than in similar but non-contact binaries. The spin angular momentum cannot be neglected at any time for W UMa type systems, especially for those with extreme mass ratios. The spin angular momenta of both components are included in this paper and they are found to have a significant influence on the cyclic evolution of W UMa systems. We investigate the influence of the energy transfer on the common convective envelopes of both components in detail. We find that the mass of the convective envelope of the primary in contact evolution is slightly more than that in poor thermal contact evolution, and that the mass of the convective envelope of the secondary in contact evolution is much less than that in poor thermal contact evolution. Meanwhile, the rate of angular momentum loss of W UMa type systems is much lower than that of poor thermal contact systems. This is indeed caused by the lower masses of the convective envelopes of the components in W UMa type systems. Although the models with angular momentum loss for W UMa systems exhibit cyclic evolution, they seem to show that a W UMa system cannot continue this type of cyclic evolution indefinitely, and it might coalesce into a fast-rotating star after about 1200 cycles of evolution (about 7.0 x 10(9) yr).

AB  - Red palm weevil (RPW) causes severe damage to date palm trees, leading to the death of trees if not detected and treated in time. A major obstacle in RPW control is the difficulty in identifying an early stage infestation In the present study, we measured the efficacy of some non-invasive optical devices including cameras (digital camera and thermal camera), TreeRadarUnit (TM) (TRU) (Radar 2000, Radar 900), resistograph, magnetic DNA biosensor, and Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to detect RPW infestation in date palm trees under field conditions at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Date palm trees used in these experiments were selected based on visual observations. After inspection of date palm trees with different devices to detect RPW infestation, each tree was taken down and dissected in detail to validate the accuracy of each device. Results indicated that the visual RPW detection approach presented the highest accuracy (87%) followed by Radar 2000 (77%), Radar 900 (73%), resistograph (73%), thermal camera (61%), and digital camera (52%).
   Moreover, different stages of RPW placed in plastic cups were fastened onto the healthy date palm trunks to judge RPW presence, the magnetic DNA biosensor correctly detected RPW eggs 75% of the time, followed by detection of larvae (64%) and the control (empty cup) (54%). In another experiment where determinations were made in an open area, the efficiency of the DNA biosensor for detecting adults was 100%, followed by 83%, 63%, 60%, and 39% for pupae, larvae, eggs, and control, respectively. Absorption spectra generated through NIRS for infested, wounded, and control samples of date palm tissue showed a remarkable variation in the gradient of the corresponding peaks between 1850 nm and 1950 nm. Based on the detection efficiency of the tested devices, the resistograph and NIRS have the best potential to detect RPW infestation in date palm trees. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The response of a glass batch to heating is determined by the batch makeup and in turn determines the rate of melting. Batches formulated for a high-alumina nuclear waste to he vitrified in an all-electric inciter were heated at a constant temperature-increase rate to determine changes in melting behavior in response to the selection of batch chemicals and silica grain-size as well as the addition of heat-generating reactants. The type of hatch materials and the size of silica grains determine how much, if any, primary foam occurs during melting. Small quartz grains, 5 mu m in size, caused extensive foaming because their major portion dissolved at temperatures <800 degrees C, contributing to the formation of viscous glass-forming melt that trapped evolving batch gases. Primary foam did not occur in batches with larger quartz grains, +/- 75 mu m in size, because their major portion dissolved at temperatures >800 degrees C when batch gases no longer evolved. The exothermal reaction of nitrates with sucrose was ignited at a temperature as low as 160 degrees C and caused a temporary jump in temperature of several hundred degrees. Secondary foam, the source of which is oxygen from redox reactions, occurred in all batches of a limited composition variation involving five oxides, B2O3, CaO, Li2O, MgO, and Na2O. The foam volume at the maximum volume-increase rate was a weak function of temperature and melt basicity. Neither the batch makeup nor the change in glass composition had a significant impact on the dissolution of silica grains. The impacts of primary foam generation on glass homogeneity and the rate of melting in large-scale continuous furnaces have yet to be established via mathematical modeling and melter experiments.

AB  - Temperature affects physiological performance in reptiles and, therefore, body temperature (T-b) control is argued to have an important adaptive value. Alterations in T-b due to transient changes in physiological state, as during digestion or gestation, are often linked to the potential benefits of a more precise T-b regulation. However, such thermoregulatory responses in nature remain controversial, particularly for tropical snakes. Herein, we measured T-b of the golden lanceheads, Bothrops insularis (Amaral, 1921), at Queimada Grande Island, southeastern Brazil, to test for alteration in selected body temperatures associated with feeding or gestation. We found no evidence that postprandial or gravid snakes selected for higher T-b indicating that, under natural conditions, body temperature regulation in B. insularis apparently encompasses other ecological factors beyond physiological state per se.

AB  - Animal distributions are shaped by the environment and antecedents. Here I show how the temperature dependence of aerobic scope (the difference between maximum and minimum rates of oxygen uptake) is a useful tool to examine the fundamental temperature niches of salmonids and perhaps other fishes. Although the concept of aerobic scope has been recognized for over half a century, only recently has sufficient evidence accumulated to provide a mechanistic explanation for the optimal temperature of salmonids. Evidence suggests that heart rate is the primary driver in supplying more oxygen to tissues as demand increases exponentially with temperature. By contrast, capacity functions (i.e. cardiac stroke volume, tissue oxygen extraction and haemoglobin concentration) are exploited only secondarily if at all, with increasing temperature, and then perhaps only at a temperature nearing that which is lethal to resting fish. Ultimately, however, heart rate apparently becomes a weak partner for the cardiorespiratory oxygen cascade when temperature increases above the optimum for aerobic scope. Thus, the upper limit for heart rate may emerge as a valuable, but simple predictor of optimal temperature in active animals, opening the possibility of using biotelemetry of heart rate in field situations to explore properly the full interplay of environmental factors on aerobic scope. An example of an ecological application of these physiological discoveries is provided using the upriver migration of adult sockeye salmon, which have a remarkable fidelity to their spawning areas and appear to have an optimum temperature for aerobic scope that corresponds to the river temperatures experienced by their antecedents. Unfortunately, there is evidence that this potential adaptation is incompatible with the rapid increase in river temperature presently experienced by salmon as a result of climate change. By limiting aerobic scope, river temperatures in excess of the optimum for aerobic scope directly impact upriver spawning migration and hence lifetime fecundity. Thus, use of aerobic scope holds promise for scientists who wish to make predictions on how climate change may influence animal distributions.

AB  - Optimization of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process in a fixed-bed reactor is carried out using non-uniform catalysts. The C-5(+) yield of the reactions is maximized utilizing a combination of non-uniform catalysts across the bed. A 1D heterogeneous model is developed to simulate the bed containing uniform and non-uniform catalysts. It is found that the egg-shell and surface-layered catalysts result in higher C-5(+) yield. Moreover, effects of cooling temperature are studied. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Successive Quadratic Programming (SQP) methods are applied. Feed and cooling temperature are selected as decision variables together with distribution of non-uniform catalysts along the bed. The optimization result shows 14.47% increase in the C-5(+) yield with respect to the base condition.

AB  - Despite intensive research activity within the area of climate change, substantial knowledge gaps still remain regarding the potential future impacts of climate change on human health. A key shortcoming in the scientific understanding of these impacts is the lack of studies that are conducted in a coordinated and consistent fashion, producing directly comparable outputs. This Viewpoint discusses and exemplifies a bottom-up initiative generating new research evidence in a more coordinated and consistent way compared with previous efforts. It describes one of the largest model comparisons of projected health impacts due to climate change, so far. Yet, the included studies constitute only a selection of health impacts in a variety of geographical locations, and are therefore not a comprehensive assessment of all possible impact pathways and potential consequences. The new findings of these studies shed light on the complex and multidirectional impacts of climate change on health, where impacts can be both adverse or beneficial. However, the adverse impacts dominate overall, especially in the scenarios with more greenhouse gas forcing. Overall, the future population at risk of disease and incidence rates are predicted to increase substantially, but in a highly location-specific and disease-specific fashion. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation can substantially reduce risk and resultant morbidity and mortality. The potential positive impact of adaptation has not been included in the models applied, and thus remains a major source of uncertainty. This bottom-up initiative lays out a research strategy that brings more meaningful research outputs and calls for greater coordination of research initiatives across the health community.

AB  - Contaminants accumulated in sediments may directly harm benthic organisms, however, the specific contaminants responsible for adverse effects have been poorly described. In this study, a bioassay directed analysis combined with toxicity tests and chemistry analysis was conducted to determine the compounds eliciting the greatest toxicological effect in the sediments in Liaohe River, northeast China. A total of 24 sediment samples were examined to determine their acute toxicity to midge Chironomus tentans (C. tentans). Of these samples, 15 exhibited significant toxicity, with a mortality of 23%-93% (p < 0.05). Numerous contaminants, including 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 32 polychlorinated biphenyls, 20 organochlorine pesticides, 6 organophosphate pesticides, 8 pyrethroids, and 5 heavy metals were analyzed. On the basis of toxic unit (TU) analysis results, pyrethroids may contribute to the toxicity of 9 of the 15 toxic samples with concentrations of >1 TU. The significant correlation between the TUs of pyrethroids and the mortality of C tentans (r(2) = 0.74, p < 0.01) confirmed the major role of pyrethroids in toxicity. The selected sediment samples responding to piperonyl butoxide and low temperature with the increased toxicity exhibited the characteristics of pyrethroids. The bioassay-based screening framework provided strong evidence that pyrethroids were the primary cause of sediment toxicity in Liaohe River. Further studies should therefore be conducted to regulate this important class of pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are the most useful microorganisms to society, LAB are used in the production of many fermented food products that stimulate digestion and immunity. Therefore, the objective study aimed to isolate, characterize, and identify new LAB members and determining their potential probiotic properties.Materials and methods This study was performed through isolation, selection, and identification of LAB strains morphologically, biochemically, and genetically. Then, to determine their probiotics traits, which include acid resistance, bile-salt tolerance, beta-galactosidase activity, heat sensitivity, salinity, cholesterol reduction, and antioxidant activity.Results and discussion Eight LAB isolates were isolated and purified from milk and cheeses, out of eight isolates, K2 showed the highest resistance to acidic pH 2.0, where Log CFU/ml reduced from the initial count 8.79 & PLUSMN;0.17 at pH 7.0 to 4.57 & PLUSMN;0.10 at pH 2.0 with 51.99% survival rate. Also, the six bile-tolerant isolates (K1, K2, K3, K4, A11, and A5) were found tolerant to 1% bile-salt concentrations for 3 h with 92.50, 71.10, 64.35, 60.72, 71.11, and 72.21% rate of survival, respectively. Also, antibiotic susceptibility of A11 isolate was the most sensitive, but isolate A2 was the most resistant against antibiotics. Besides, heat sensitivity of selected LAB isolates (K1, K2, A11, and B1) were able to survive at temperatures 15, 37, and 45 & DEG;C, but isolates (K3, K4, A5, and A2) did not grow at 45 & DEG;C. Additionally, NaCl tolerance clearly revealed that both isolates (K2 and A11) were able to tolerate a wide range of NaCl (1-8% w/v), then the growth declined with the increase of salt (10%) concentration. The results showed that the cholesterol assimilation was reduced by 32.66 and 30.20% for A11 and K1 isolates, respectively. Also, K2 isolate showed the highest antioxidant activity (86.93%), and the best B-galactosidase producer (24.65 U/ml). Therefore, the 16S-rRNA sequencing was carried out to identify four promising LAB isolates that could be employed as a probiotic strain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates belonged to three genera, including Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus. Strains were Lactobacillus casei (A5) KU510332, Enterococcus faecium (A11) KU510333, Lactococcus lactis (K1) KU510334, and E. faecium (K2) KU510335.Conclusion Our results presenting four new isolates as promising potential probiotics for further application in processing probiotic products.

AB  - After reviewing the microscopic and macroscopic texture of fault zones, the localisation of rupture and creep is described, and the reduced strength of fault zones is investigated. Simple strength and viscosity models for the whole lithosphere play a major role for the geometry of fault zones. Compressional faults (thrusts) show ramp- and flat structures, often soling in a (weak) detachment zone, extensional faults prefer a listric shape, often turning subhorizontal and being invisible in the seismic lamellae of the ductile lower crust which according to the models is also a broad zone of detachment and decoupling. Faults in the lower crust are rare and restricted to strain hardened fault rocks or intrinsically rigid rocks like oceanic mafic-ultramafic rocks of suture zones. Transient faults in the lower crust are created by rupture processes of large earthquakes. Some deep faults, moderately dipping or flat, are again observed in the (rather rigid) uppermost mantle. The observation of folding inside the crust seems to be connected with an intermediate viscosity range and with a broad (vertical) transition zone where rigid reactions and ductile processes are mixed.
   Various methods of detecting faults by seismic studies are critically reviewed, and some sequence of reliability is suggested. Impedance contrasts, polarity, dip, thickness, and multiple fault strings have to be deciphered by wavefront modelling. Origin and survival of faults are considered to be a consequence of tectonic and thermal evolution under specific stress systems.

AB  - Treatment of Drosophila melanogaster adults with an inhibitor of protein synthesis led to a decrease in intrinsic cold-shock tolerance, but no difference in the rapid cold hardening response, which is apparent only if a period at 4 degreesC precedes the cold stress. Increases in energy reserves, including proline, were found in lines of flies selected for resistance to chilling injury. Since an increase in proline levels has been associated with overwintering in insects, and for salt and cold tolerance in plants, an RNase protection assay was developed to assess changes in transcript abundance for two genes encoding enzymes important for proline metabolism, pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase and proline oxidase. The mRNA levels did not change in response to low temperature, but the high level of pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase transcript is consistent with the interpretation that a large proline pool is important for Drosophila metabolism and survival during cold stress.

AB  - BackgroundThe identification of naturally occurring bacteria with lignin-oxidizing enzymes would be significant. Several species of filamentous bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces (Actinomycetes) have been identified as degraders of lignin. Such species play the most important role in biodegradation of lignin. ObjectiveThis study aimed to isolate and discover promising isolates and ideal conditions for lignin peroxidase (LiP) production as well as 16S-rRNA identification of the ligninolytic bacterial strains. Materials and methodsLignin was isolated and purified from black wood liquor. The ligninolytic bacterial colonies were isolated from three types of soil farms (F1, F2, and F3) from Jeddah, KSA. Fermentation medium (FM) was used for screening of lignin-degrading bacteria after dilution of the soil sample using lignin (0.1% v/v). The FM medium was supplemented with 50 mg/l of Azure B and toluidine dyes and 100 mg/l of tannic acid. FM was used without any supplements and agar for isolation of lignin-degrading bacteria after dilution of the soil samples. Different concentrations of lignin (0.1-0.9%) were applied to optimize LiP production by the selected strains under different temperatures (30, 35, 40, and 45 & DEG;C); different pH values (7, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5); eight different carbon sources (0.1%, w/v), such as glucose, fructose, xylose, lactose, sucrose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and xylan; and four organic sources (0.1%, w/v), such as peptone, meat extract, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate. The enzyme productivity was evaluated in the culture supernatant. The bacterial strain genomic DNA was extracted from pure culture isolated from soil and subjected to amplification and sequencing of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene. Results and discussionNine ligninolytic bacterial colonies that excrete peroxidases based on the use of lignin (as sole carbon source) were isolated from three types of soil farms (F1, F2, and F3) from Jeddah, KSA, and the promising isolates and the optimum conditions for LiP production using FM under three incubation periods were evaluated. Two most active isolates for production of LiP belonging to Actinomycetes and Bacilli designated (R-St-1 and R-B-1) were identified using 16S-rRNA. Results showed that the highest LiP producer was Streptomyces R-St-1 isolate (3.8 U/ml) followed by Bacilli R-B-1 isolate (2.4 U/ml) after 3 days of fermentation. Different concentrations of lignin (0.1-0.9%) were tested for their effect on LiP production by Streptomyces R-St-1. As lignin concentration increased, LiP production increased, and the maximum productivity of 4.9 U.mL(-1) was observed at 0.5% lignin after which the LiP production was decreased. At the ideal temperature recorded of 35 & DEG;C and at the optimum pH of 7.5, the production of LiP rose significantly (4.6 U.mL-1 and 4.0 U.mL-1).Various carbon sources were examined for LiP production, and glucose was shown to be the best option for producing a high yield of LiP by Streptomyces R-St-1, followed by lactose (4.6 and 4.0 U/ml, respectively). However, neither organic nor inorganic nitrogen sources were shown to be suited for high LiP output. As lignin concentration increased, LiP production increased, and the maximum productivity of 4.4 U/ml from Bacilli R-B-1 isolate was observed at 0.7% lignin, after which LiP production was decreased. The optimum temperature was 40 & DEG;C, where LiP production showed a significant increase (4.5 U/ml), whereas the optimum pH was 8.
   0, and sucrose was found to be more suitable for high yield of LiP production followed by glucose (4.3 and 3.3 U/ml, respectively). The identified bacterial DNA sequences were conserved in the GenBank under two accession numbers OL697233.1 (Streptomyces lavendulae R-St-1) and Priestia aryabhattai R-B-1(OL697234.1) (formerly known as Bacillus aryabhattai).

AB  - Climate change is threating species' persistence worldwide. To predict species responses to climate change we need information not just on their environmental tolerance but also on its adaptive potential. We tested how the foundation species of rocky littoral habitats, Fucus vesiculosus, responds to combined hyposalinity and warming projected to the Baltic Sea by 2070-2099. We quantified responses of replicated populations originating from the entrance, central, and marginal Baltic regions. Using replicated individuals, we tested for the presence of within population tolerance variation. Future conditions hampered growth and survival of the central and marginal populations whereas the entrance populations fared well. Further, both the among- and within-population variation in responses to climate change indicated existence of genetic variation in tolerance. Such standing genetic variation provides the raw material necessary for adaptation to a changing environment, which may eventually ensure the persistence of the species in the inner Baltic Sea.

AB  - This study reversed the developing environments of hydrocarbon-source rocks in the Ordos Basin and evaluated carbonate rocks as hydrocarbon-source rocks and their distributions on account of the fact that China's marine carbonate rocks as hydrocarbon-source rocks are characterized by intensive thermal evolution and relatively low abundance of organic matter, by taking the Lower Paleozoic of the Ordos Basin for example and in light of the calculated enrichment coefficients of trace elements, the REE distribution patterns, the mathematical statistics analysis of elements and carbon isotopes and their three-dimensional diagrammatization in combination with the necessary organic parameters. As for the Ordos Basin, TOC=0.2% is an important boundary value. Studies have shown that in the strata where TOC is greater than 0.2%, Ba is highly enriched with positive delta C-13(carb) shifts and delta C-13(org) less than -28 parts per thousand, reflecting a thigh paleo-productivity, high burial amounts of organic matter, relatively good hydrocarbon-generating potentiality and intensive REE fractionation. All these indicated that the settlement rates are low and the geological conditions are good for the preservation of organic matter, hence favoring the development of hydrocarbon-source rocks. The Klimory and Wulalik formations show certain regularities in those aspects and, therefore, they can be regarded as the potential effective hydrocarbon-source rocks. In the strata where total TOC is less than 0.2%, the contents of Ba are low, delta C-13(carb) values are mostly negative, and delta C-13(org) values range from -24 parts per thousand-28 parts per thousand, demonstrating low burial amounts of organic matter, poor potentialities of hydrocarbon generation, weak REE fractionation and rapid settlement rates. These facts showed that most of the hydrocarbon-source rocks were formed in shallow-water, high-energy oxidizing environments, thus unfavoring the development of hydrocarbon-source rocks. It is feasible to make use of the geochemical method to comprehensively assess the highly evolved marine carbonates rocks as potential hydrocarbon-source rocks and their distributions.

AB  - The study of bacterial communities associated with extreme ecosystems is one of the most important tasks in modern microbial ecology. Despite a large number of studies being performed, the ecosystems that have not been sufficiently explored from the microbiological point of view still exist. Such research is needed for improving the understanding of the limits and mechanisms of bacterial survival under extreme conditions, and for revealing previously undescribed species and their role in global biospheric processes and their functional specifics. The results of the complex microbiological characteristics of permafrost and ice-collected on the Severniy Island in the northern part of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago-which have not previously been described from microbiological point of view, are presented in this article. The analysis included both culture-independent and culture-dependent methods, in particular, the spectra of metabolic activity range analysis in vitro under different temperature, pH and salinity conditions. High values for the total number of prokaryotes in situ (1.9 x 10(8)-3.5 x 10(8) cells/g), a significant part of which was able to return to a metabolically active state after thawing, and moderate numbers of culturable bacteria (3.3 x 10(6)-7.8 x 10(7) CFU/g) were revealed. Representatives of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were dominant in situ; Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in vitro. Physiological assays revealed the mesophilic and neutrophilic optima of temperature and pH of culturing conditions, respectively, and wide temperature and pH ranges of culturable communities' reproduction activity. Isolated strains were characterized by moderate halotolerant properties and antibiotic resistance, including multiple antibiotic resistance. It was found that almost all cultured bacterial diversity revealed (not just a few resistant species) had extremotolerant properties regarding a number of stress factors. This indicates the high adaptive potential of the studied microbial communities and their high sustainability and capability to retain functional activity under changing environmental (including climatic) conditions in wide ranges.

AB  - This study describes microbial community compositions, and various cold-responsive stress genes, encompassing cold-induced proteins (CIPs) and cold-associated general stress-responsive proteins (CASPs) in selected Antarctic lake water, sediment, and soil metagenomes. Overall, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the major taxa in all metagenomes. Prochlorococcus and Thiomicrospira were highly abundant in waters, while Myxococcus, Anaeromyxobacter, Haliangium, and Gloeobacter were dominant in the soil and lake sediment metagenomes. Among CIPs, genes necessary for DNA replication, translation initiation, and transcription termination were highly abundant in all metagenomes. However, genes for fatty acid desaturase (FAD) and trehalose synthase (TS) were common in the soil and lake sediment metagenomes. Interestingly, the Lake Untersee water and sediment metagenome samples contained histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) and all genes for CIPs. As for the CASPs, high abundances of a wide range of genes for cryo- and osmo-protectants (glutamate, glycine, choline, and betaine) were identified in all metagenomes. However, genes for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis were dominant in Lake Untersee water, sediment, and other soil metagenomes. The results from this study indicate that although diverse microbial communities are present in various metagenomes, they share common cold-responsive stress genes necessary for their survival and sustenance in the extreme Antarctic conditions.

AB  - The initiation of the Benguela upwelling has been dated to the late Miocene, but estimates of its sea surface temperature evolution are not available. This study presents data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1085 recovered from the southern Cape Basin. Samples of the middle Miocene to Pliocene were analyzed for alkenone-based (U-37(K'), SSTUK) and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) based (TEX86, Temp(TEX)) water temperature proxies. In concordance with global cooling during the Miocene, SSTUK and Temp(TEX) exhibit a decline of about 8 degrees C and 16 degrees C, respectively. The temperature trends suggest an inflow of cold Antarctic waters triggered by Antarctic ice sheet expansion and intensification of Southern Hemisphere southeasterly winds. A temperature offset between both proxies developed with the onset of upwelling, which can be explained by differences in habitat: alkenone-producing phytoplankton live in the euphotic zone and record sea surface temperatures, while GDGT-producing Thaumarchaeota are displaced to colder subsurface waters in upwelling-influenced areas and record subsurface water temperatures. We suggest that variations in subsurface water temperatures were driven by advection of cold Antarctic waters and thermocline adjustments that were due to changes in North Atlantic deep water formation. A decline in surface temperatures, an increased offset between temperature proxies, and an increase in primary productivity suggest the establishment of the Benguela upwelling at 10 Ma. During the Messinian Salinity Crisis, between 7 and 5 Ma, surface and subsurface temperature estimates became similar, likely because of a strong reduction in Atlantic overturning circulation, while high total organic carbon contents suggest a "biogenic bloom." In the Pliocene the offset between the temperature estimates and the cooling trend was reestablished.

AB  - Quarkonium suppression is one of the more useful observables to obtain information about the hot medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this manuscript, we discuss a simple way to implement both the initial-state effects and the hot-medium evolution, and to compute the quarkonium nuclear modification factor if the survival probability for a bound state at a given energy density is known. Based on the Glauber model, the temperature of the evolving medium and the centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor will be analyzed.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for up-to-date soil organic carbon (OC) data for global environmental and climatic modelling. The aim of this study was to create a map of topsoil OC content at the European scale by applying digital soil mapping techniques to the first European harmonized geo-referenced topsoil (0-20 cm) database, which arises from the Land use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS). A map of the associated uncertainty was also produced to support careful use of the predicted OC contents. A generalized additive model (GAM) was fitted on 85% of the dataset (R-2 = 0.29), using OC content as dependent variable; a backward stepwise approach selected slope, land cover, temperature, net primary productivity, latitude and longitude as suitable covariates. The validation of the model (performed on 15% of the data-set) gave an overall R-2 of 0.27 and an R-2 of 0.21 for mineral soils and 0.06 for organic soils. Organic C content in most organic soils was under-predicted, probably because of the imposed unimodal distribution of our model, whose mean is tilted towards the prevalent mineral soils. This was also confirmed by the poor prediction in Scandinavia (where organic soils are more frequent), which gave an R-2 of 0.09, whilst the prediction performance (R-2) in non-Scandinavian countries was 0.28. The map of predicted OC content had the smallest values in Mediterranean countries and in croplands across Europe, whereas largest OC contents were predicted in wetlands, woodlands and mountainous areas. The map of the predictions' standard error had large uncertainty in northern latitudes, wetlands, moors and heathlands, whereas small uncertainty was mostly found in croplands. The map produced gives the most updated general picture of topsoil OC content at the European Union scale.

AB  - A field site in the Coachella Valley of California was selected as an ideal experimental location to study the effect of organic amendments on soil ecology and crop productivity. The high temperatures, low rainfall, and frequent irrigation of low desert agriculture leads to rapid breakdown of organic residue and soils naturally low in organic matter. Because organic carbon is relatively scarce in desert soils, amending with compost or cover crops may have a more dramatic and easily detectable effect than in temperate regions. Our experimental treatments included all possible combinations of summer cover crops and vegetable crop management systems. Summer cover crops were dry fallow or sudangrass or cowpea. Fall lettuce was followed by spring cantaloupe. Both crops were continuously managed as either conventional, organic, or an integrated system that reduced insecticide applications. The experimental design allowed direct comparisons of many combinations of organic or conventional fertility and pest management regimes. Yields in the first year of study were lower in the organic plots. However, yields for the following year for conventional and organic systems were equal despite less effective insect control in the organic system. Soil organic matter content was correlated with soil structure and lettuce yield. However, the range of organic carbon was very narrow (0.5-1%) and it was correlated with the clay percentage of the soils. The negative charges of the surface of the clays act as an absorbent interface where the organic molecules attach. Attachment to the clay surfaces protected organic matter from microbial degradation so that it could accumulate in the soil, but the amount of organic carbon accumulated was restricted to the limited amount of colloidal or clay particles present in these sandy desert soils. Soil microbial respiration was related to the amount of organic carbon added as either cover crop or compost, indicating that microbes were degrading and using the organic residues as an energy source.

AB  - Solar biomass steam gasification using concentrated sunlight offers an efficient means of storing intermittent solar energy into renewable solar fuels while upgrading the carbonaceous feedstock. Such solar-driven (allothermal) processes have demonstrated the ability and the effectiveness for the production of high quality hydrogen-rich syngas, but they suffer from inherent barriers related to the variability of solar energy caused by cloud passages and shut off at night. The concept of hybrid solar/autothermal gasification appears promising to meet the requirement for stable and continuous operation under fluctuating or intermittent solar irradiation. To date, dynamic modelling to simulate coupled solar/combustion heating and steam gasification using real solar irradiation data has never been proposed and could be used to predict the annual performance of large-scale solar gasification plants. In this study, a dynamic mathematical model of a scaled-up solar gasification reactor was developed. The model was composed of a system of differential equations that were derived from unsteady mass and energy conservation equations. After an experimental validation step with the results from a lab-scale solar reactor, the dynamic model was applied at large scale to determine the reactor temperature and syngas production evolution during continuous day and night operation in both solar-only (allothermal) and hybrid solar/autothermal modes. Different reactants feeding management strategies were proposed and compared with the aim of achieving enhanced syngas productivity and optimized use of solar energy during solar-aided steam gasification. It was shown that the hybrid mode with partial oxy-combustion of the feedstock and dynamic feeding control results in the most stable process operation upon fluctuating solar power input, while ensuring continuous production of H-2 and CO at night and during cloudy periods.

AB  - Inertial electrostatic confinement devices can generate secondary, thermionic, photo, and field emission electrons from the cathode grid, which is a drain on the system. Of the various electron emission contributions, methods to study and minimize the thermionic emission current are explored in this paper using a new diagnostic called "chordwire" wire placed in the form of a chord of a circle inside the cathode that intercepts particles. This chordwire intercepts particles and gets heated; the rise in temperature can be monitored externally using a pyrometer. Local power balance on the chordwires can then be used to infer the particle flux reaching the chordwires. This diagnostic helps show that to accurately estimate the ion current reaching the central grid, the thermionic electron emission has to be taken into account. The thermionic emission could become significant even for low power operation (<10 kW) in the presence of asymmetric grid heating. The asymmetric grid heating can be mitigated by homogenizing the ionization source around the chamber. The ion-recirculation current equation has been updated to accommodate the thermionic emission current. This ion-recirculation current equation shows that while the electron current increases nonlinearly with the power-supply current (when the grid is thermionically active for input power that is >10 kW), the ion current increases only in a less-than-linear fashion. Hence, the scaling of the fusion productivity with the power-supply current appears to be less than linear. Material selection and device operation should be aimed at reducing this electron energy drain for optimum performance. The overall thermionic emission from the cathode could be reduced through the selection of appropriate grid material with high work function (e. g., Re and W-25%Re). Moreover, this material also has lower sputter yield relative to Type 304 stainless steel, thus helping in high-voltage operation of the device.

AB  - 1. Many animals forage for non-food objects, such as nesting materials. In many organisms, the depots of such objects can be expansive, and are not intuitively adaptive. This study empirically explores varying theories for why these depots exist in the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius.
   2. The Florida harvester ant, like its western congeners, collects and deposits large quantities of non-food objects around its nest entrance. The vast majority of objects sampled from colonies in this study population were charcoal pieces whereas most western species collect pebbles.
   3. Objects in these depots can number in the millions, suggesting a large cost to this behaviour and strengthening an adaptationist argument.
   4. Many hypotheses have been suggested for these depots, including temperature and water modification and territoriality. No evidence was found to support the results of a previous study which found that charcoal depots deter other ant species.
   5. The depots do not appear to affect soil hydrology, but do slightly increase soil temperature at the very top of the nest. In an attempt to estimate the seasonal fitness of colonies with and without charcoal depots, no statistical difference was detected in sexual investment between treatment groups.
   6. These results suggest that the charcoal depots may be selectively advantageous through temperature modification, but may serve alternate functions that are species and habitat specific.

AB  - Assuming that mutation and fixation processes are reversible Markov processes, we prove that the equilibrium ensemble of sequences obeys a Boltzmann distribution with exp(4N(e)m(1 - 1/(2N))), where m is Malthusian fitness and N-e and N are effective and actual population sizes. On the other hand, the probability distribution of sequences with maximum entropy that satisfies a given amino acid composition at each site and a given pairwise amino acid frequency at each site pair is a Boltzmann distribution with exp(-psi(N)), where the evolutionary statistical energy psi(N) is represented as the sum of one body (h) (compositional) and pairwise (J) (covariational) interactions over all sites and site pairs. A protein folding theory based on the random energy model (REM) indicates that the equilibrium ensemble of natural protein sequences is well represented by a canonical ensemble characterized by exp(-Delta G(ND)/k(B)T(S)) or by exp(-G(N)/k(B)T(S)) if an amino acid composition is kept constant, where Delta G(ND) equivalent to G(N) - G(D), G(N) and G(D) are the native and denatured free energies, and T-S is the effective temperature representing the strength of selection pressure. Thus, 4N(e)m(1 - 1/(2N)), -Delta psi(ND)(equivalent to -psi(N) + psi(D)), and -Delta G(ND)/k(B)T(S) must be equivalent to each other. With h and J estimated by the DCA program, the changes (Delta psi(N)) of psi(N) due to single nucleotide nonsynonymous substitutions are analyzed. The results indicate that the standard deviation of Delta G(N)(= k(B)T(S)Delta psi(N)) is approximately constant irrespective of protein families, and therefore can be used to estimate the relative value of T-s. Glass transition temperature T-g and Delta G(ND) are estimated from estimated T-S and experimental melting temperature (T-m) for 14 protein domains. The estimates of Delta G(ND) agree with their experimental values for 5 proteins, and those of T-s and T-g are all within a reasonable range. In addition, approximating the probability density function (PDF) of Delta psi(N) by a log-normal distribution, PDFs of Delta psi(N) and K-a/K-s, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate per site, in all and in fixed mutants are estimated. The equilibrium values of psi(N), at which the average of Delta psi in fixed mutants is equal to zero, well match f psi(N) averaged over homologous sequences, confirming that the present methods for a fixation process of mutations and for the equilibrium ensemble of psi(N) give a consistent result with each other. The PDFs of K-a/K-s at equilibrium confirm that T-s negatively correlates with the amino acid substitution rate (the mean of K-a/K-s) of protein. Interestingly, stabilizing mutations are significantly fixed by positive selection, and balance with destabilizing mutations fixed by random drift, although most of them are removed from population. Supporting the nearly neutral theory, neutral selection is not significant even in fixed mutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Poxviruses employ sophisticated, but incompletely understood, signaling pathways that engage cellular defense mechanisms and simultaneously ensure viral factors are modulated properly. For example, the vaccinia B1 protein kinase plays a vital role in inactivating the cellular antiviral factor BAF, and likely orchestrates other pathways as well. In this study, we utilized experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus to perform an unbiased search for suppressor mutations and identify novel pathways involving B1. After several passages of the B1 virus we observed a robust increase in viral titer of the adapted virus. Interestingly, our characterization of the adapted viruses reveals that mutations correlating with a loss of function of the vaccinia B12 pseudokinase provide a striking fitness enhancement to this virus. In support of predictions that reductive evolution is a driver of poxvirus adaptation, this is clear experimental evidence that gene loss can be of significant benefit. Next, we present multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that expression of full length B12 leads to a fitness reduction in viruses with a defect in B1, but has no apparent impact on wild-type virus or other mutant poxviruses. From these data we infer that B12 possesses a potent inhibitory activity that can be masked by the presence of the B1 kinase. Further investigation of B12 attributes revealed that it primarily localizes to the nucleus, a characteristic only rarely found among poxviral proteins. Surprisingly, BAF phosphorylation is reduced under conditions in which B12 is present in infected cells without B1, indicating that B12 may function in part by enhancing antiviral activity of BAF. Together, our studies of B1 and B12 present novel evidence that a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair can exhibit a unique epistatic relationship in a virus, perhaps serving to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and to orchestrate yet-to-be-discovered nuclear events during infection.
   Author summary Vaccinia virus is the archetype member of the Poxviridae family. This virus encodes similar to 200 genes that contribute to viral propagation in the cytoplasm and coordinate restriction of the host antiviral response through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Notably, the B1 kinase inhibits a highly conserved antiviral protein, allowing viral DNA replication to proceed in the cytoplasm. To better understand B1 driven signaling, we used experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus to identify viral genes within shared signaling pathways. Herein we describe our success in isolating adapted viruses and the discovery of a genetic link between B1 and the related B12 gene. Thus this study illustrates the utility of experimental evolution to discover novel digenic relationships. Interestingly, we also elucidated an unexpected regulatory intersection between the B1 kinase and B12 pseudokinase that likely masked discovery of the repressive function of B12 during previous studies of this factor. As kinase-pseudokinase protein families are abundant in many forms of life, the genetic and functional relationship between B1 and B12 that we uncovered is likely of broad biological relevance. Further investigation of individual genes and gene families in multigenic knockout backgrounds may uncover similar masked phenotypes in a broad range of model systems.

AB  - The use of model based control for polymerization reactors is a very attractive alternative to the classical master slave control of temperature. However the bottleneck has been always the construction of a reliable model. Classical identification techniques fail in the control of batch processes because the operating point changes along the reaction. Rigorous modeling is sometimes a very complicated task because of the lack of knowledge about the process or because the fitting of the dynamic parameters demands specific experiments. Also the complexity of the model and the lack of observability represent a major obstacle for the online operation of a full dynamic rigorous model.
   This paper presents the development of a gray-box model that can be fitted with minimal experimentation time and provides reliable predictions and information for the INCA (Ipcos Novel Control Architecture) model based predictive controller (MPC).
   The model not only provides reliable predictions of the evolution of the temperature but also generates online information about the status of the conversion. The use of such controller improves the performance of the control system providing extra room to increase the temperature of the reaction in order to increase productivity.

AB  - A commercial silica water selective membrane was evaluated experimentally. Additionally, its potential application in the synthesis of 1,1-diethoxybutane was studied from the process intensification point of view. The membrane performance was evaluated experimentally, at different compositions and temperatures, by measuring the flux and permeate composition of binary and ternary mixtures. The effect of composition and temperature on the species permeances was also studied. For ethanol and butyraldehyde the permeances depend only on the temperature, following an Arrhenius equation; while for the water, its permeance depends on both temperature and composition, following a modified Arrhenius equation. Altogether, the permeation data obtained in the present work combined with reaction and adsorption data from previous works allowed a comparison, by simulation, between the PermSMBR and simulated moving bed reactor (SMBR) for the synthesis of 1,1-diethoxybutane. Results showed that the PermSMBR, operating at 50 degrees C, presents an improvement of about 7% in both productivity (34.3 kg(DEB)I(day. L.(catalyst))) and desorbent consumption (1.73 L-Eth/Kg(DEB)).

AB  - Environmental humidity influences the fitness and geographic distribution of all animals [1]. Insects in particular use humidity cues to navigate the environment, and previous work suggests the existence of specific sensory mechanisms to detect favorable humidity ranges [2-5]. Yet, the molecular and cellular basis of humidity sensing (hygrosensation) remains poorly understood. Herewe describe genes and neurons necessary for hygrosensation in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. We find that members of the Drosophila genus display species-specific humidity preferences related to conditions in their native habitats. Using a simple behavioral assay, we find that the ionotropic receptors IR40a, IR93a, and IR25a are all required for humidity preference in D. melanogaster. Yet, whereas IR40a is selectively required for hygrosensory responses, IR93a and IR25a mediate both humidity and temperature preference. Consistent with this, the expression of IR93a and IR25a includes thermosensory neurons of the arista. In contrast, IR40a is excluded from the arista but is expressed (and required) in specialized neurons innervating pore-less sensilla of the sacculus, a unique invagination of the third antennal segment. Indeed, calcium imaging showed that IR40a neurons directly respond to changes in humidity, and IR40a knockdown or IR93a mutation reduced their responses to stimuli. Taken together, our results suggest that the preference for a specific humidity range depends on specialized sacculus neurons, and that the processing of environmental humidity can happen largely in parallel to that of temperature.

AB  - Geographic range margins offer testing grounds for limits to adaptation. If range limits are concordant with niche limits, range expansions require the evolution of new phenotypes that can maintain populations beyond current range margins. However, many species' range margins appear static over time, suggesting limits on the ability of marginal populations to evolve appropriate phenotypes. A potential explanation is the swamping gene flow hypothesis, which posits that asymmetrical gene flow from large, well-adapted central populations prevents marginal populations from locally adapting. We present an empirical framework for combining gene flow, environment, and fitness-related phenotypes to infer the potential for maladaptation, and we demonstrate its application using the scarlet monkeyflower Mimulus cardinalis. We grew individuals sampled from populations on a latitudinal transect under varied temperatures and determined the phenotypic deviation (PD), the mismatch between phenotype and local environment. We inferred gene flow among populations and predicted that populations receiving the most temperature- or latitude-weighted immigration would show the greatest PD and that these populations were likely marginal. We found asymmetrical gene flow from central to marginal populations. Populations with more latitude-weighted immigration had significantly greater PD but were not necessarily marginal. Gene flow may limit local adaptation in this species, but swamping gene flow is unlikely to explain its northern range limit.

AB  - Due to the existence of wake effect that causes the reduction of intake wind speed among wind turbines in the downwind direction, the wind farm efficiency is substantially discounted. An integral question to ask is how to find the optimal wind turbine layout given a wind farm. Inspired by the self-adjustment capability among individuals in the natural evolution process, a new algorithm called support vector regression guided genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the wind warm layout optimization problem which integrates the capability in each individual to adjust itself for a better "fitness" with guiding information sampled from a response surface approximated by support vector regression. It is also interesting to use the new proposed algorithm to evaluate the impact of the constraints imposed by landowners' willingness whether to rent their land to the wind farm company. Extensive numerical experiments under different settings of wind distribution and wind farms with unusable cells are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm, shedding insights on the impact of landowners' participation on the overall efficiency. The experiment showcases that the proposed algorithm outperforms two baseline algorithms under different conditions with improved efficiency. The proposed framework with consideration of landowners' participation decision provide insights for wind farm planner on the different values of farm lands from the landowners.

AB  - Background
   Since miltefosine monotherapy against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani has been discontinued in the Indian subcontinent due to an increase in the number of treatment failures, single dose liposomal amphotericin B is now advocated as a treatment option of choice. Paromomycin-miltefosine combination therapy can be used as substitute first-line treatment in regions without cold-chain potential. Previous laboratory studies in the closely related species Leishmania infantum have demonstrated that paromomycin monotherapy fairly rapidly selects for resistance producing a phenotype with increased fitness. Given the possible clinical implications of these findings for the current field situation, the present study aimed to identify the potential hazards of paromomycin-miltefosine combination therapy.
   Principal findings
   Drug interaction studies using the fixed-ratio isobologram method revealed an indifferent interaction between paromomycin and miltefosine. In hamsters infected with L. infantum, the combination resulted in cumulative efficacy in reducing parasite burdens in the liver, spleen and bone marrow. Selected resistant lines against the single drugs did not display cross-resistance. When the intracellular amastigote stage was repeatedly exposed to the paromomycin-miltefosine combination, either in vitro or in vivo, no significant susceptibility decrease towards either drug was noted.
   Conclusions
   These results suggest that implementation of paromomycin-miltefosine combination therapy indeed could represent a safe and affordable treatment option for L. donovani VL as miltefosine appears to overrule the anticipated rapid development of PMM resistance.

AB  - Formation of particle deposit in the reactor cyclone of the commercial residue fluidized catalytic cracking (RFCC) process is one of the major problems causing serious catalyst carryover into the fractionators and process shutdown. This problem has been considered as an unavoidable issue in sustainable operations and required an accurate forecasting model. The particle deposition model in the cyclone dipleg of RFCC process is developed considering both of mathematical particle deposit factors and actual operating data. The model for particle deposition was researched in the viewpoint of transport phenomenon of particle. Verification of the model is conducted with actual plant data using parameter estimation method. Optimization model of RFCC process is developed by combining particle deposition model and cracking reaction model to find optimal operating conditions. The optimal operating conditions are found by selection of reaction temperature, catalyst/oil ratio and feed rate, to minimize particle deposit thickness. As a result, the operating cycle time is increased from 31 to 47 months (52%) by the decreasing particle deposition rate and the productivity of gasoline is increased at about 46% by increasing RFCC operation period.

AB  - We examine the ability of SAR-derived landfast sea ice thermodynamic state surrounding the North Water Polynya to predict the timing of a shallow, stably stratified summer ocean mixed layer in the region. Radarsat-1 ScanSAR is used to derive melt and pond onset dates over landfast sea ice surrounding the polynya, describing its thermodynamic evolution. Salinity and temperature profiles, connected in time and space, are complemented by potential density profiles and mixed layer depths, which describe the evolution of the upper ocean mixed layer between 4 April and 21 July 1998. Surface salinity driven potential density stratification and summer mixed layer depths are temporally coincident. Sea ice-ocean connection is first described at the local scale, then regionally. At the local scale, a reduction in surface salinity occurs between the melt and pond onsets over landfast sea ice. At the polynya scale, interpolated pond onset date is highly effective at predicting the timing of a thin, stably stratified summer ocean mixed layer; this has consequences for the potential prediction of timing of maximum ecosystem productivity.

AB  - Connectivity studies in the marine realm are of great importance to understand the evolutionary potential of populations in a context of growing pressures on the marine environment. Here, we investigated the effect of the local, regional, and depth spatial scale on the population genetic structure of the yellow gorgonian Eunicella cavolini, one of the most common octocoral species of the Mediterranean hard-bottom communities. This species, along with other sessile metazoans typical of coralligenous ecosystems, plays an important role in supporting biodiversity, but is also impacted by direct and indirect consequences of human activities, such as physical destruction or mortality events due to thermal anomalies. Samples were taken from 15 sites located in the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean) in two adjacent regions 100 kilometres apart, i.e. from the areas of Marseille (France) and Portofino (Genoa, Italy), and were analysed using six microsatellite loci. A pattern of isolation by distance was observed at the regional as well as the local scales. Although E. cavolini showed less genetic structure than other Mediterranean octocorallian species, we observed a significant genetic differentiation between populations a few kilometres apart. A low genetic differentiation was also observed between shallow and deep populations. The occurrence of genetically differentiated populations of E. cavolini at the scale of kilometres has important consequences for the management of this species and of the associated communities.

AB  - A simple model is used to estimate the potential costs of production of four cultivation regimes that can be used to produce biomass for energy in central Chile. The selected cultivation regimes represent different silvicultural intensities and use Populus, Salix, Pinus and Eucalyptus genders. The model considers that the potential cost of production is explained by a cost of cultivation, a cost of harvest and a cost of soil use. It accounts for the different yields expected in each site and the energetic value of the biomass obtained. Sites of minimum potential costs for each cultivation regime are identified. The results obtained show that non-intensive silvicultural regimes using Eucalyptus and Pinus are associated to considerably lower minimum potential costs of production (0.04-0.06 UF GJ(-1) HHV)(1) than intensive silvicultural regimes that use Salix and Populus (0.12-0.14 UF GJ(-1) HHV). It was also found that to obtain the lowest production cost in non-intensive silviculture, it is preferable to use sites of high productivity although their cost of use is higher.

AB  - In this work, a simple and general procedure for optimally scaling-up exothermic semibatch processes has been applied to the analysis of a nitration reaction performed in the agrochemical industry for the production of an important class of herbicides. Such a reaction is performed in indirectly cooled semibatch reactors in which the species to be nitrated is added to a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid, forming a heterogeneous (liquid-liquid) system. Adiabatic calorimetric experiments performed in an ARC equipment showed that the reaction in question belongs to the most critical class of exothermic reaction processes, for which maximum attainable temperature due to synthesis reaction (MTSR) is, at the same time, higher than system decomposition temperature and lower than boiling temperature of the reaction mass. It has been verified, through reaction calorimetry experiments (performed in an RC I equipment), that the optimization-scale-up procedure previously developed allows, with minimum calculation and experimental effort, both for a selection, at laboratory scale, of operating conditions characterized by a rapid coreactant consumption and for their safe scale-up, maximizing industrial reactor productivity.

AB  - Global change challenges the adaptive potential of forests. Large-scale alterations of forest canopies have been reported across Europe, and further modifications are expected in response to the predicted changes in drought and windstorm regimes. Since forest canopies are dynamic interfaces between atmosphere and land surface, communities of canopy-dwelling insects are at the forefront of major changes in response to both direct and indirect effects of climate change. First, we briefly introduce the factors shaping arthropod communities in the canopy of temperate forests. Second, we cover the significant impacts of a forest decline on canopy structure and functioning, and more specifically its contrasted effects on insect microhabitats, trophic resources and forest microclimates. Deleterious effects may be expected for several guilds of leaf-dwelling insects. Nonetheless, a forest decline could also lead to transient or long-lasting resource pulses for other canopy-dwelling guilds, especially saproxylic species depending on deadwood substrates and tree-related microhabitats. The novel microclimates may also become more favorable for some particular groups of insects. We pinpoint current knowledge gaps and the technological locks that should be undone to improve our understanding of the canopy biotope and biodiversity in temperate forests. We highlight the need for integrative approaches to reveal the mechanisms at play. We call for cross-scale studies and long-term collaborative research efforts, involving different disciplines such as community and disturbance ecology, plant and insect ecophysiology, and thermal ecology, to better anticipate ongoing functional and conservation issues in temperate forest ecosystems.

AB  - High geotemperature seriously impacts personnel and equipment during railway and expressway tunnel construction. In this study, the Nige tunnel in the expressway from Gejiu to Yuanyang in Honghe Prefecture was used as an example. Firstly, automatic temperature recording devices were used to monitor the variation characteristics of the tunnel temperature. Afterward, the variation characteristics of the temperature at 5-10 days and 150 days after tunnel's completion were revealed. The results showed that the evolution laws of air temperature in each stage could be revealed by logarithmic functions of increasing type and decreasing type. Based on the monitoring over 5-10 days after tunnel's completion, the temperature range was 26-44 degrees C, and the highest temperature in the tunnel is located near the middle of the tunnel. The temperature fluctuation near the tunnel entrance is relatively small, while it fluctuates greatly near the tunnel exit. Based on the monitoring over 150 days, the air temperature was maintained between 16 and 31 degrees C. The temperature near the tunnel entrance was high, while the temperature near the tunnel exit was low. The performance had a guiding significance for the design and construction of the high-geotemperature tunnel.

AB  - The structure of phytoplankton communities is thought to influence total productivity, trophic structure and the export of carbon below the mixed layer. Community structure is determined by a complex interaction between the physiological characteristics of each species, environmental conditions, resource availability, competition among species, and numerous loss terms. This complexity makes it very difficult to predict how changes in environmental conditions will alter the structure of phytoplankton communities. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model with variable selection to identify how temperature, salinity, irradiance, and macronutrient concentrations determine the abundance of the 67 dominant identified species at Station CARIACO in the Caribbean Sea. This approach allows us to overcome the statistical challenge presented by the highly correlated environmental variables. Approximately three-quarters of the variables for each species have little effect on phytoplankton abundance. About half of the species decline in abundance with increasing temperature. Diatom species' abundances are much more likely to respond to changes in irradiance and nitrate concentration than dinoflagellates and dinoflagellate species' abundances are more likely to respond to changes in salinity.

AB  - Water temperature is a key driver of aquatic processes. Monitoring stream water temperature is key to understanding current species distributions and future climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems. However, a very small fraction of streams are continuously monitored for water temperature throughout North America, due to prohibitive logistical costs. We develop a framework that aids in developing cost-effective stream temperature monitoring by using stream habitat features to inform strategic site selection of temperature monitoring sites. We test this framework using sockeye salmon spawning streams as a model, which included 19 streams in the northern-most watershed of the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia, Canada. The objective of this framework is to evaluate the trade-off between cost (i.e., the number of streams monitored) and the effectiveness of monitoring scenarios at meeting different monitoring objectives. We compared monitoring scenarios that were informed by well-established relationships between variables and that are commonly collected or available as part of other monitoring activities (stream length, magnitude, order, gradient, wetted width, and spot temperatures) and water temperature metrics (maximum, mean, and variance during August) derived from continuously monitored streams to monitoring scenarios where streams were randomly selected. Informed scenarios included streams that were selected in order of watershed level and stream habitat characteristics (e.g., longest to shortest); ordering was based on the relationship between each habitat variable and temperature metrics. Informed monitoring scenarios were then compared to random selection of monitoring sites with regard to how well monitoring scenarios met two management objectives during the critical salmon spawning period: (1) identifying streams that exceed a temperature threshold and (2) identifying streams that represent the temperature regime of a complex of streams (e.g., mean and variance of streams within an aggregate of streams). Management objectives were met by monitoring fewer streams using the informed monitoring scenarios rather than the average of the random scenarios. This highlights how common inexpensive watershed level variables that relate to stream temperature can inform the strategic selection of sites and lead to more cost-effective stream temperature monitoring.

AB  - The very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) is one of the most promising and innovative designs selected by the Generation IV International Forum. Although previous papers have focused on the study and optimization of several parameter of a VHTR conceptual design, there is still much work needed to achieve the commercial introduction of this technology. The primary aim of this study is to obtain the reactivity effects of such parameters as the temperature of the fuel, moderator, and reflector, and the poisoning by Xe-135 and Sm-149 in the VHTR critically. To reach this goal, the widely-used MCNP6 code was employed in order to simulate the neutronics of the VHTR. The viability of the utilization of the MCNP6 code and the developed model for the study of the physics of the VHTR core was confirmed through the calculation and comparison with benchmarks provided by the IAEA. Based on the results of the temperature coefficients of reactivity obtained, a negative reactivity effect on the system of about -12 pcm/K was found, as is expected in all the nuclear fission reactors, while the combined effect of fission products 135Xe and 149Sm implies a negative reactivity of -3475 pcm.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Kidneys from marginal or donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors are particularly susceptible to injury during hypothermic preservation and may benefit from alternative methods of preservation. Normothermic preservation can be adapted to improve the quality of kidneys for transplantation by a variety of techniques.
   Recent findings
   Extracorporeal membrane support to maintain circulation before cooling and organ retrieval has been used to improve the condition of DCD donor kidneys, with lower rates of delayed graft function (DGF) compared with standard retrieval conditions.
   Experimentally, normothermic perfusion has been used in conjunction with hypothermic techniques as a resuscitation technique to improve graft outcome. An ex-vivo porcine kidney model showed that energy levels could be replenished to improve tissue perfusion during reperfusion. This technique was translated into a porcine transplant model demonstrating that it was a feasible and safe method of preservation.
   Summary
   Normothermic preservation techniques have the potential to be adapted into an improved method of retaining tissue viability compared with hypothermic techniques. Furthermore, they may be used as a device to enhance and assess the condition of the kidney which would be particularly beneficial for kidneys from DCD donors.

AB  - Different Nile tilapia stocks belonging to the fish breeding program of the Epagri (Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuaria e Extensao Rural de Santa Catarina) were characterized by microsatellite markers. A total of nine stocks (S1 to S9) were evaluated, and for each stock the caudal fin of 30 individuals were sampled. A total of 75 alleles were found at the 11 microsatellite loci used (UNH104, UNH108, UNHI60, UNH208, UNH222, UNH848, UNH879, UNH898, UNH952, UNH998). Among the loci used, only UHN160 showed significance for null alleles in stocks S1, S2, S3 and S5. The average number of alleles per loci was 6.8, while the average number of alleles per tilapia stock was 4.4. Five unique alleles were identified between the stock Si and S5. The observed heterozygosity values (Ho) exceeded the expected heterozygosity (He), resulting in a negative inbreeding coefficient (F-IS = -0.092). F-ST for the total population was 0.109, demonstrating moderate genetic differentiation between the stocks. According to the Euclidean distance, three groups were formed as follows: I - S6, S7 and S9; II - S2, S3 and S4; and III - SI, S5 and S8. However, the existence of two groups can be observed from the PCoA representation: I - S6, S7, S8 and S9; and II - S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5. The fonnation of these two genetic groups is consistent with the genealogy of stocks. The formation of group III (S1, S5 and S8) in the dendrogram can be explained by the higher average observed heterozygosity values of these stocks. Bayesian analysis revealed the formation of 16 groups with an F-ST value of 0.2107. This result reinforces the existence of variability existing in the Epagri breeding program, from which it is possible to form heterotic groups to enable the direction of potential crosses to obtain genetic gain. The study enabled genotypic characterization of the tilapia brood stock used in the Epagri breeding program, determining the genetic distance between the stocks, which will enable more accurate selection of individuals for mating for the next generation. It was possible to verify that there is high heterozygosity within the stocks, and moderate genetic differentiation between the stocks. Furthermore, all evaluated markers were polymorphic for this brood stock and will be used to characterize the next generations.

AB  - Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used for the production of biotherapeutic recombinant proteins for a range of molecules including monoclonal antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins. Regulatory requirements for the final product include the removal of host cell proteins (HCPs) to acceptable amounts (<100 ppm). Recent research has begun to unravel the extent to which upstream process conditions and subsequent product recovery and purification processes impact upon the HCP profile. A number of upstream parameters, including the selection of the cell line, the culturing process (e.g. feeding regime, culture temperature), cell viability at time of harvest/culture duration and cell shear sensitivity can all influence the resulting HCP profile. Further, the molecule itself plays an important role in determining those HCPs that are retained throughout a bioprocess and HCPs can co-elute with the target product during purification. Measurement and monitoring of HCPs is usually undertaken using ELISA technology, however alternative approaches are also now emerging that complement ELISA and allow the detection, identification and monitoring of specific HCPs. Here we discuss our understanding of how the process itself influences those HCPs present throughout the production process and the challenges in their monitoring, measurement and removal.

AB  - We investigate a form off (R) = R-1+(delta)/R-c(delta) and study the viability of the model for inflation in the Jordan and the Einstein frames. We have extended this form to f (R) = R + R1+epsilon/R-c(delta) in an attempt to solve the problems of the former model. This model is further analyzed by using the power spectrum indices of inflation and the reheating temperature. During the inflationary evolution, the model predicts a value of the delta parameter very close to one (delta = 0.98), while the reheating temperature T-re similar to 10(16) GeV at delta = 0.98 is consistent with the standard approach to inflation and observations. We calculate the slow roll parameters for the minimally coupled scalar field within the framework of our models. It is found that the values of the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are very close to the recent observational data, including those released by Planck. Further, we find the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are exactly the same in the first model because the Jordan and the Einstein frames are conformally equivalent. We also attempt to provide a constraint through the non-Gaussianity parameter.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) constitute a heterogeneous group of bacteria that are traditionally used to produce fermented foods. The industrialization of food bio-transformations increased the economical importance of LAB, as they play a crucial role in the development of the organoleptique and hygienic quality of fermented products. Therefore, the reliability of starter strains in terms of quality and functional properties (important for the development of aroma and texture), but also in terms of growth performance and robustness has become essential. These strains should resist to adverse conditions encountered in industrial processes, for example during starter handling and storage (freeze-drying, freezing or spray-drying). The development of new applications such as life vaccines and probiotic foods reinforces the need for robust LAB since they may have to survive in the digestive tract, resist the intestinal flora, maybe colonize the digestive or uro-genital mucosa and express specific functions under conditions that are unfavorable to growth (for example, during stationary phase or storage). Also in nature, the ability to quickly respond to stress is essential for survival and it is now well established that LAB, like other bacteria, evolved defense mechanisms against stress that allow them to withstand harsh conditions and sudden environmental changes. While genes implicated in stress responses are numerous, in LAB the levels of characterization of their actual role and regulation differ widely between species. The functional conservation of several stress proteins (for example, HS proteins, Csp, etc) and of some of their regulators (for example, HrcA, CtsR) renders even more striking the differences that exist between LAB and the classical model micro-organisms. Among the differences observed between LAB species and B. subtilis, one of the most striking is the absence of a sigma(B) orthologue in L. lactis ssp. lactis as well as in at least two streptococci and probably E. faecalis. The overview of LAB stress responses also reveals common aspects of stress responses. As in other bacteria, adaptive responses appear to be a usual mode of stress protection in LAB. However, the cross-protection to other stress often induced by the expression of a given adaptive response, appears to vary between species. This observation suggests that the molecular bases of adaptive responses are, at least in part, species (or even subspecies) specific. A better understanding of the mechanisms of stress resistance should allow to understand the bases of the adaptive responses and cross protection, and to rationalize their exploitation to prepare LAB to industrial processes. Moreover, the identification of crucial stress related genes will reveal targets i) for specific manipulation (to promote or limit growth), ii) to develop tools to screen for tolerant or sensitive strains and iii) to evaluate the fitness and level of adaptation of a culture. In this context, future genome and transcriptome analyses will undoubtedly complement the proteome and genetic information available today, and shed a new light on the perception of, and the response to, stress by lactic acid bacteria.

AB  - Molecular dynamics simulations using fully atomistic models were conducted to investigate gas transport mechanism and its connection to the free volume distribution and morphology in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and in PVC modified with 4-fluorothiophenol. The influence of both, modification degree and temperature on diffusion mechanism was thoroughly studied. The diffusion coefficients of O-2 and N-2, were determined via molecular dynamics simulation using the COMPASS forcefield over a range of temperatures (375, 400, 425, and 450 K) using up to 200 ns simulation time. The introduction of pendant bulky groups along the polymer backbone results in a less ordered polymer matrix increasing the free volume available and consequently the diffusion coefficients of both gases, O-2 and N-2. Additionally, the temperature range selected in this work allows us to investigate the crossover from a solid-like diffusion mechanism (at low temperatures) to a liquid-like mechanism that takes place at higher temperatures. The gas transport coefficients of these polymers obtained from MD simulations were compared with previously reported values in literature based on both experimental and simulation studies, and the results obtained were within the expectations indicating the viability of the approach.

AB  - Two of the most invasive freshwater bivalve species in temperate regions worldwide are the Ponto-Caspian dreissenids Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis. Throughout their range, observations have been made of a dominance shift favouring D. r. bugensis where the two species co-occur. Although both dreissenids have been widely studied, the mechanisms driving this dominance shift are not completely understood. Our long-term and short-term field experiments assessed a selection of species traits related to growth and settlement, which may be linked to a competitive benefit for either of both species. We assessed relative population densities in time and space, mortality, and inter- and intraspecific interactions in relation to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, and light intensity, using 14 x 14 cm PVC settlement plates. Dreissenids were identified, counted and measured over 11 years in the waterbody where D. r. bugensis was first discovered in Western Europe. Dreissena polymorpha appeared to have a competitive benefit over D. r. bugensis by being able to settle earlier, i.e. in spring, while other studies indicate the opposite. As salinities in the study region were relatively high in spring, this discrepancy may be explained by a higher salinity tolerance of D. polymorpha, as is known from the literature. In addition, Common Coots predated D. r. bugensis clusters. Dreissena polymorpha were not usually found in such clusters. Regardless of these competitive benefits for D. polymorpha, D. r. bugensis is the dominant species in the region. One possible explanation could be the fact that D. r. bugensis was found in similar densities on both light exposed and shaded fouling plates. Dreissena polymorpha on the other hand, was practically absent on light-exposed plates after 12 months. Therefore, a wider range of habitats seems to be suitable for the settlement of D. r. bugensis. Another driver of the dominance shift can be linked to it having faster growth than D. polymorpha, especially during spring. More generally, D. r. bugensis occurred in higher population densities on plates with D. polymorpha than on plates with only D. r. bugensis. Dreissena polymorpha individuals may thus induce the settlement of additional individuals of D. r. bugensis. A final reason for the dominance of D. r. bugensis concerns its low winter mortality. While the number of D. polymorpha individuals more than halved over the winter 2016-2017, no significant decrease in numbers of D. r. bugensis was recorded.

AB  - The research is focused on an ecologically sound and highly productive cultivation system for fodder and/or biomass for thermal power generation on the basis of winter legumes and maize as subsequent summer crop, managed without additional nitrogen fertiliser. Therefore the yield of biomass and N-fixing capacity of a winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) monocropped and intercropped with rye (Secale cereale L.) were examined for five years in a field trial. In mid-June above-ground biomass of winter crops was removed and maize transplanted. The winter crops achieved maximum dry matter yield about three to five weeks before maturity. Mixed stands yielded more biomass than pure stands and exhibited greater yield stability. The relative advantage of intercropping, expressed as land equivalent ratio (LER), determined for intercropped winter pea/rye were 1.1 to 1.2 and for crimson clover/rye 1.3. At maturity, the amount of fixed nitrogen ranged between 178 kg N for crimson clover and 242 kg N ha(-1) for winter pea, respectively. At the end of anthesis (middle of June, harvesting stage for silage fodder) 75% and 88% of the total fixed nitrogen was achieved, for clover and pea, respectively. In intercropping the amount of fixed nitrogen was lower than in pure stands due to a lower seed density of the legume; however, the N-fixing efficiency was greater than in pure stands. N-release of the winter pea in a pure stand produced a maximum yield in maize (Zea mays L.) without additional N-fertiliser. An additional N mineral fertilisation of 75 to 150 kg N and 75 to 225 kg N was necessary to achieve maximum yields in maize following intercropped winter pea and crimson clover, respectively. Legumes in mixed stands with rye resulted in lower amounts of residual nitrogen after maize harvest. The beneficial effect of legumes on maize can be divided into N-effects and rotation effects. Both effects were positive regarding winter pea. The rotation effect of crimson clover in pure stands on maize was negative. Allelopathic effects and the high sensitivity of crimson clover to mineral nitrogen in the soil, released by residues of the preceding crop, winter rape (Brassica rapa L.), were discussed as the reason for this observation. The combination of the winter pea in pure stand and maize achieved the highest total biomass yield from winter and summer crops, unfertilised (156 dt ha(-1) dry). The combinations of intercropped legumes and maize produced biomass yields of 142 to 145 dt ha(-1). Because winter pea is highly susceptible to lodging, intercropping with low seed density of rye is recommended (3/4 winter pea, 1/4 rye). The rye crop prevents lodging by providing support and high rates of N-fixation are achieved with high seed density of pea. lntercropping with crimson clover and rye should be based on high seed densities of legumes, too because rye is highly competitive within those mixtures.

AB  - The use of Galleria mellonella as a model host to elucidate microbial pathogenesis and search for novel drugs and therapies has been well appreciated over the past years. However, the effect of microorganisms with functional appeal in the specific host remains scarce. The present study investigates the effect of treatment with selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with probiotic potential, as potential protective agents by using live or heat-killed cells at 6 and 24 h prior to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus or as potential therapeutic agents by using cell-free supernatants (CFS) after infection with the same pathogens. The employed LAB strains were Lactobacillus pentosus B281 and Lactobacillus plantarum B282 (isolated from table olive fermentations) along with Lactobacillus rhamnosusGG (inhabitant of human intestinal tract). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted while the pathogen's persistence in the larval hemolymph was determined by microbiological analysis. It was observed that the time (6 or 24 h) and type (live or heat-killed cells) of challenge period with LAB prior to infection greatly affected the survival of infected larvae. The highest decrease of L. monocytogenes population in the hemolymph was observed in groups challenged for 6 h with heat-killed cells by an average of 1.8 log units compared to non challenged larvae for strains B281 (p 0.0322), B282 (p 0.0325), and LGG (p 0.0356). In the case of S. aureus infection, the population of the pathogen decreased in the hemolymph by 1 log units at 8 h post infection in the groups challenged for 6 h with heat-killed cells of strains B281 (p 0.0161) and B282 (p 0.0096) and by 1.8 log units in groups challenged with heat-killed cells of LGG strain (p 0.0175). Further use of CFS of each LAB strain did not result in any significant prolonged survival but interestingly it resulted in pronounced decrease of L. monocytogenes in the hemolymph at 24 h and 48 h after infection by more than 1 log unit (p < 0.05) depending on the strain. The results of the present work support the broader use of G. mellonella larvae as a low cost in vivo tool for screening for probiotic properties.

AB  - Most cyclic biological processes are under control of a circadian molecular timing system that synchronizes these phenomena to the 24-h day. One generic property of circadian-controlled processes is that they operate within a specific temperature range, below which the manifestation of rhythm ceases. Little is known about the evolutionary relevance of the lower temperature limit of rhythmicity or about the mechanism underlying the loss of overt circadian behavior below this lower limit, especially in one model organism of chronobiology, Drosophila melanogaster. Natural populations of Drosophila are evolving under divergent selection pressures and so provide a source of diversity necessary to address these issues. Using lines derived from African populations, we find that there is natural variation in the expression of rhythmic behavior under low-temperature conditions. We found evidence that this variability is evolutionarily relevant at extremely low temperature (12 degrees C) because high-altitude populations exhibit selection for locally adapted genomes that contribute to rhythmic behavior. Lines resistant to 15 degrees C show an additional layer of diversity in their response to temperature extremes because some lines are resistant to low temperature (15 degrees C) only, whereas others are cross-resistant to high and low temperature (15 degrees C and 30 degrees C). Genetic analysis of one cold-resistant circadian line at 15 degrees C reveals that the phenotype maps to the X-chromosome but not to the core clock genes, per and sgg. Analysis of the central clock cells of this line reveals that maintenance of rhythm is associated with robust clock function, which is compromised in a standard laboratory strain. These data indicate that the cold-resistant circadian phenotype is clock based. This study highlights the importance of using natural populations to inform us of the basic features of circadian traits, especially those that might be under temperature-based selection.

AB  - The following study was developed during experimental research to determine the most appropriate methods for quail egg (coturnix coturnixjaponica) preservation in order to extend their useful shelf life. Quail eggs are a highly perishable product which causes economic losses to their suppliers due to fluctuations in the demand of the product in spite of its nutritional content. Two specific objectives were established: 1) To formulate preserving solutions of different concentrations to apply to the quail egg as a liquid seal, determined through a Box-Behnken response surface design, which resulted in a preserving solution of NaCl 1.5%, potassium sorbate 400 ppm and acetic acid 0.125%. 2) To determine the ideal pasteurization temperature at which to preserve the quail eggs, using three randomly selected thermal values of 60, 70 and 80 degrees C, which resulted in a recommended temperature of 70 degrees C for 90 seconds. Finally, the stability of the final product was established by studying accelerated conditions at different storage temperatures and an estimated duration of approximately 500 days was established through a lineal regression mathematical model.

AB  - Climate change presents potential increased threats to the comfort and health of urban populations as a result of higher summer temperatures. This paper reviews recent research on the climate change adaptation potential of urban environments and focuses on a major conurbation, London. Recent work relating to the impact of exposure to heat on population health is also noted. Data obtained from a pilot monitoring study carried out in a subset of 36 dwellings (from a total of 110 dwellings in the overall study) across London during the summer of 2009 is then discussed. Preliminary results illustrate the need to quantify the net impacts of individual building characteristics and the location of each dwelling within the London heat island. During a hot period, more than 40% of the monitored bedrooms failed the recommended overheating criteria during the night time. There was some indication of purpose built flats being more prone to overheating. The potential use of such data as the basis of a heat-related health risk epidemiological model for London is discussed. Such a tool would help health policy makers to target the most vulnerable building types and areas.

AB  - Many oak stands (Quercusspp.) have been managed as coppices for firewood production for centuries in the Mediterranean area. After the abandonment of firewood production during the 1980s, current management practices attempt to convert coppices into coppices-with-standards through thinning and promoting forest regeneration via sexual reproduction. In this work, we used long-term data from repeated forest inventories and dendrometers in a thinning trial to assess the effects of thinning and climate on the intra- and inter-annual growth dynamics ofQuercus pyrenaicaWilld. coppices. Our results revealed that thinning favored the growth ofQ. pyrenaicatrees, especially when the stand density reduction was high (ca. 50% of the basal area extracted). Unthinned plots displayed more natural mortality i.e., self-thinning. Growth was enhanced with low vapor pressure deficit. Intense thinning treatments displayed higher intra-annual growth rates and interacted positively with rainfall to induce higher growth. We conclude that thinning, especially intensive thinning, may alleviate the negative effects of dry years and thus could provide a potential measure to adapt these stands to the different climatic scenarios with higher temperatures and less precipitation within the framework of sustainable forest management.

AB  - Background: In West Africa, populations of the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles coluzzii, are seasonally exposed to strong desiccating conditions during the dry season. Their dynamics strictly follows the pace of the availability of suitable larval development sites (water collections). Accordingly, mosquitoes can reproduce all year long where permanent breeding is possible, or stop reproduction and virtually disappear at the onset of the dry season when surface water dries up, like observed in temporary habitats of dry savannah areas. This highlights the strong adaptive abilities of this mosquito species, which relies at least in part, upon physiological and molecular mechanisms of specific signatures.
   Methods: Here, we analysed a range of physiological and molecular responses expressed by geographically different populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting permanent and temporary breeding sites from the north and the south-west of Burkina Faso. Four mosquito colonies, namely (i) Oursi, built from females breeding in permanent habitats of the north; (ii) Deou, from temporary northern habitats; (iii) Soumousso from south-western temporary breeding sites; and (iv) Bama, from permanent habitats of the same south-western zone, were reared in climatic chambers under contrasted environmental conditions, mimicking temperature, relative humidity and light regimen occurring in northern Burkina Faso. Female mosquitoes were analysed for the seasonal variation in their amounts of proteins, triglycerides and free-circulating metabolites. The expression level of genes coding for the adipokinetic (AKH-I) and the AKH/corazonin-related peptides (ACP) were also assessed and compared among populations and environmental conditions.
   Results: Our analysis did not reveal an apparent pattern of physiological and molecular variations strictly correlated with either the larval ecotype or the geographical origin of the mosquitoes. However, specific distinct responses were observed among populations, suggesting that dry season survival may rely on more complex ecological parameters at a micro-habitat scale. Interestingly, the physiological and molecular data support the hypothesis that different aestivation abilities exist among populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting contrasted ecological settings. In particular, the striking metabotypes differentiation and the AKH mRNA expression level observed in females from temporary northern populations may suggest the existence of a "strong" aestivation strategy in these specimens.
   Conclusion: Our work provides insights into the physiological and molecular basis of dry and rainy season responses in An. coluzzii, and highlights the important diversity of the mechanisms involved. Such results represent key data for understanding the ecophysiological mechanisms underpinning the strong adaptive potential of this malaria vector species, which undoubtedly contributes to the spreading of mosquito distribution areas in space and time.

AB  - Many studies in the last few years have been dedicated to the increasing temperatures and extreme heat in Europe since the second half of the 20th century because of their adverse effects on ecosystems resilience, human health, and quality of life. The present research aims to analyze the spatio-temporal variations of extreme heat events in Southeastern Europe using daily temperature data from 70 selected meteorological stations and applying methodology developed initially for the quantitative assessment of hot weather in Bulgaria. We demonstrate the suitability of indicators based on maximum temperature thresholds to assess the intensity (i.e., magnitude and duration) and the tendency of extreme heat events in the period 1961-2020 both by individual stations and the Koppen's climate zones. The capability of the used intensity-duration hot spell model to evaluate the severity of extreme heat events has also been studied and compared with the Excess Heat Factor severity index on a yearly basis. The study provides strong evidence of the suitability of the applied combined approach in the investigation of the spatio-temporal evolution of the hot weather phenomena over the considered domain.

AB  - Adaptation strategies and policies are normally based on climate impact assessments that fail to take account of the social nature and distribution of vulnerability to climate change. This is largely a product of the dominant assessment techniques that are used to inform such strategies and the limits of existing evidence. In this paper I contribute to filling gaps in the current adaptation literature by exploring the social nature of vulnerability and the potential for socially just adaptation. It does so by reviewing studies from the UK, in particular those under the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Climate Change and Social Justice programme. It finds that vulnerability to high temperatures and fluvial and coastal flooding, in terms of sensitivity, exposure, and the capacity to anticipate, respond, and recover, is concentrated in certain disadvantaged and socially marginalized groups, including those on low incomes. It also finds that both autonomous and planned adaptation may fail to protect the most vulnerable individuals and groups, and may even reinforce existing patterns of vulnerability in some cases, i.e., mal-adaptation, especially where they rely on unmediated market forces or where they fail to explicitly recognize aspects of social vulnerability in their design and implementation. I argue that social justice should be an explicit objective of adaptation strategy.

AB  - Two modes of sex determination occur in squamates: genotypic sex determination (GSD) and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Within each of these two major modes, there are many different variants, or mechanisms. Male heterogamety, female heterogamety, multiple sex chromosome systems, and homomorphic sex chromosome systems are all types of GSD found in squamates. Two patterns of TSD have been reported.
   Only three snakes have been investigated for their sex-determining mechanisms, each having GSD, although incubation temperature does cause differential mortality and affects post-hatching physiology. Less than 50 lizard species have been investigated, but there is considerable diversity in the sex-determining mechanisms reported thus far. Apparently, TSD (and/or GSD) has evolved multiple times within a given taxon. Presently, both GSD and TSD are found in the Agamidae, Eublepharidae, and Gekkonidae, and possibly in the Iguanidae, Lacertidae, and Varanidae as well. Only GSD has been reported for the Scincidae and Teiidae.
   Correlations within the Eublepharidae suggest an adaptive explanation for the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms; a shift from male-larger dimorphism to female-larger (or no sexual size dimorphism) is accompanied by a shift in sex-determining mode. These shifts are in agreement with similar correlations observed in turtles. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Persistent heat extremes can have severe impacts on ecosystems and societies, including excess mortality, wildfires, and harvest failures. Here we identify Europe as a heatwave hotspot, exhibiting upward trends that are three-to-four times faster compared to the rest of the northern midlatitudes over the past 42 years. This accelerated trend is linked to atmospheric dynamical changes via an increase in the frequency and persistence of double jet stream states over Eurasia. We find that double jet occurrences are particularly important for western European heatwaves, explaining up to 35% of temperature variability. The upward trend in the persistence of double jet events explains almost all of the accelerated heatwave trend in western Europe, and about 30% of it over the extended European region. Those findings provide evidence that in addition to thermodynamical drivers, atmospheric dynamical changes have contributed to the increased rate of European heatwaves, with implications for risk management and potential adaptation strategies.
   Europe is a heatwave hotspot exhibiting three-to-four times faster upward trends compared to the rest of the northern midlatitudes. Here, this accelerated trend is linked to the increased persistence of Eurasian double jets in the upper troposphere.

AB  - The corals of the Persian/Arabian Gulf are better adapted to temperature fluctuations than elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific. The Gulf is an extreme marine environment displaying the highest known summer water temperatures for any reef area. The small and shallow sea can be considered a good analogue to future conditions for the rest of the world's oceans under global warming. The fact that corals can persist in such a demanding environment indicates that they have been able to acclimatize and selectively adapt to elevated temperature. The implication being that colonies elsewhere may be able to follow suit. This in turn provides hope that corals may, given sufficient time, similarly adapt to survive even in an impoverished form, under conditions of acidification-driven lowering of CaCO3 saturation state, a further consequence of raised atmospheric CO2. This paper demonstrates, however, that the uniquely adapted corals of the Gulf may, within the next three centuries, be threatened by a chronic habitat shortage brought about by the dissolution of the lithified seabed on which they rely for colonisation. This will occur due to modifications in the chemical composition of the Gulf waters due to climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have used transposon Tn5 mutagenesis to insert a promoter-less luxAB gene-cassette into multiple locations in the chromosome of a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain, thereby bringing the Ewe reporter genes under the control of resident promoters. To identify reporter bacteria responsive to nutritional stresses we isolated and characterized a collection of 23 gene fusions consistently displaying bioluminescence under nitrogen starvation and 12 phosphorus starvation inducible fusions. Bioluminescence of one group of mutants was induced after 4 to 6 h of starvation and was continuously expressed at a high level, whereas a second group was induced earlier and the bioluminescence subsequently declined. Finally, a third group was induced later after 24 h of starvation. Four strains were selected for further study, namely, two Tn5-lux containing strains which were induced by nitrogen starvation and two strains induced by phosphorus starvation. Another two strains, carrying constitutively expressed lux fusions, were included as controls. An analysis of biochemical characters, as well as LPS and protein composition, did not reveal any discernible differences between the mutants and the wild-type strain. Survival experiments with the selected Tn5-lux containing strains showed that they all performed comparably to the wild-type under carbon and nitrogen starvation, whereas some of the strains were less resistant to phosphorus starvation. Expression of bioluminescence by the mutants during carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus starvation was detectable even after 18 days and was not affected by high osmolarity or low temperature.

AB  - Simple Summary Insects have different strategies to adapt to environment change and parasites, but the supercooling response of pollinator populations under the biological stress has not been sufficiently investigated. This study assessed the supercooling traits of the solitary bee and its brood parasite. We discovered significant differences in the supercooling points were found between the solitary bee and its brood parasite in the same sex, and also between sexes of same species. The supercooling traits (supercooling points, fresh weight, and fat content) of the two species were significantly positively correlated. Our results suggest that the supercooling points of the solitary bee increase under the biological stress of its brood parasite at a certain level. Overall, the supercooling of pollinator populations varies regularly under brood parasitism pressure.
   (1) Background: Many insects have evolved different strategies to adapt to subzero temperatures and parasites, but the supercooling response of pollinator populations under the brood parasitism pressure has not been sufficiently investigated. (2) Methods: This study assessed the supercooling traits (supercooling points, fresh weight and fat content) of the solitary bee Osmia excavata Alfken and its brood parasite, Sapyga coma Yasumatsu & Sugihara. We measured 4035 samples (3025 O. excavata and 1010 S. coma, one individual as one sample) and discovered the supercooling traits relations between solitary bee and brood parasite. (3) Results: Significant differences in the supercooling points were found between O. excavata (females: -24.18 (-26.02 similar to-20.07) vs. males: -23.21 (-25.15 similar to-18.65) degrees C) and S. coma (females: -22.19 (-25.46 similar to-18.38) vs. males: -20.65 (-23.85 similar to-16.15) degrees C, p < 0.0001) in the same sex, and also between sexes of same species. The two species' supercooling traits (supercooling points, fresh weight, and fat content) were significantly positively correlated. The supercooling points of the solitary bee varies regularly under brood parasitism pressure. (4) Conclusions: Our study indicates the supercooling traits relationships between a solitary bee and its brood parasite and suggests that the supercooling points of the solitary bee increase under the biological stress of its brood parasite in a certain level.

AB  - Urodele amphibians are thought to have poorer immune responses than evolutionary more ancestral vertebrate classes, such as bony fish. We investigated skin graft rejection and transplantation immunity in Urodele amphibians, Japanese newts, and Asiatic salamanders, and compared these findings to those from transplants in several species of frogs. The skin grafts used in this study were either allogeneic or xenogeneic. The mean survival time of the first set of allografts at 20 degrees C was approximately 60 days for chronic responses in Urodela and 20 days for acute responses in Anura. As the graft survival times of urodeles were significantly longer than those of anurans, even when urodeles were repeatedly grafted from identical donors, there appear to be substantial differences in transplantation immunity between Urodela and Anura. These slow responses in Urodela may not be accompanied by the expansion of cytotoxic T cells, as observed in fish and anuran species, which are known to have functional major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class I systems. In our study, approximately five histo-incompatible immunogenic components were found to be involved in chronic responses in newts. Similar chronic responses were also observed in xenograft rejection in newts. In contrast, xenografts were rejected in frogs due to an accelerated acute response, possibly involving natural killer cells. Our findings that some anti-allogeneic components appear to be shared with xenogeneic components indicate that the diversification of the acquired immune system is poorly developed in Urodela.

AB  - In western North America, the tick Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae) is the primary vector to humans and domestic animals of the disease agents causing Lyme disease and granulocytic ehrlichiosis. We examined the seasonal activity patterns of I. pacificus nymphs over a 4-year period, including the wet and cold El Nino winter/spring of 1998, in a dry oak/madrone woodland, and for one year in a cooler and moister redwood/tanoak woodland in Mendocino County, California. Linear regressions were used to estimate when nymphal densities first exceeded and then fell below 25, 50 and 75% of the recorded yearly peak densities. In oak/madrone woodland, nymphs typically were active by mid-March, reached 50% of their yearly peak densities in early to mid-April, peaked by early May, fell below 50% of their peak densities by early to mid-June, and were absent by late July to mid-August. The lengths of the periods with nymphal densities exceeding 50 and 75% of the recorded yearly peaks in oak/madrone woodland were associated positively with rainfall and negatively with maximum air temperatures during April-May. Moreover, nymphal numbers typically reached 50% of their peak 10-15 days later, remained at levels above 50% of the peak 1.3-1.5 times longer, and started declining 4-6 weeks later under cooler, moister climatic conditions (oak/madrone woodland in 1998 and redwood/tanoak woodland in 2000) relative to warmer, drier conditions (oak/madrone woodland in 2000-2001). In oak/madrone woodland, nymphal densities typically started to decline when mean maximum daily air temperatures exceeded 23degreesC. Nymphal densities were higher in dry oak/madrone relative to moist redwood/tanoak woodland from mid-March to late May 2000, similar in both habitat types in early June, but higher in redwood/tanoak woodland from late June onwards. We conclude that large-scale studies of the density of I. pacificus nymphs in California need to consider spatial variation in the length of nymphal activity periods and select temporal sampling regimens that yield representative data for all included habitat types.

AB  - Under the background of global climate change, the variation in the spatial distribution and ice volume of mountain glaciers have a profound influence on regional economic development and ecological security. The development of glaciers is like biological succession; when climate change approaches or exceeds the threshold of suitable conditions for glacier development, it will lead to changes in potential distribution pattern. Therefore, from the perspective of the "biological" characteristics of glaciers, it is a beneficial exploration and attempt in the field of glaciology to explore its potential distribution law with the help of the niche model. The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) can explain the environmental conditions suitable for the survival of things by analyzing the mathematical characteristics and distribution laws of samples in space. According to glacier samples and the geographical environment data screened by correlation analysis and iterative calculation, the potential distribution pattern of Tianshan glaciers in China in reference years (1970-2000) was simulated by MaxEnt. This paper describes the contribution of geographical environmental factors to distribution of glaciers in Tianshan Mountains, quantifies the threshold range of factors affecting the suitable habitat of glaciers, and predicts the area variation and distribution pattern of glaciers under different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP5-8.5) in the future (2040-2060, 2080-2100). The results show that the MaxEnt model has good adaptability to simulate the distribution of glaciers. The spatial heterogeneity of potential distribution of glaciers is caused by the spatio-temporal differences of hydrothermal combination and topographic conditions. Among the environmental variables, precipitation during the wettest month, altitude, annual mean temperature, and temperature seasonality have more significant effects on the potential distribution of glaciers. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the potential distribution of glaciers in different watersheds, altitudes, and aspects. From the forecast results of glacier in various climatic scenarios in the future, about 18.16-27.62% of the total reference year glacier area are in an alternating change of melting and accumulation, among which few glaciers are increasing, but this has not changed the overall retreat trend of glaciers in the study area. Under the low emission scenario, the glacier area of the Tianshan Mountains in China decreased by 18.18% and 23.73% respectively in the middle and end of the 21st century compared with the reference years and decreased by 20.04% and 27.63%, respectively, under the high emission scenario, which showed that the extent of glacier retreat is more intense under the high emission scenario. Our study offers momentous theoretical value and practical significance for enriching and expanding the theories and analytical methods of the glacier change.

AB  - The synthesis of ATP, life's "universal energy currency," is the most prevalent chemical reaction in biological systems and is responsible for fueling nearly all cellular processes, from nerve impulse propagation to DNA synthesis. ATP synthases, the family of enzymes that carry out this endless task, are nearly as ubiquitous as the energy-laden molecule they are responsible for making. The F-type ATP synthase (F-ATPase) is found in every domain of life and has facilitated the survival of organisms in a wide range of habitats, ranging from the deep-sea thermal vents to the human intestine. Accordingly, there has been a large amount of work dedicated toward understanding the structural and functional details of ATP synthases in a wide range of species. Less attention, however, has been paid toward integrating these advances in ATP synthase molecular biology within the context of its evolutionary history. In this review, we present an overview of several structural and functional features of the F-type ATPases that vary across taxa and are purported to be adaptive or otherwise evolutionarily significant: ion channel selectivity, rotor ring size and stoichiometry, ATPase dimeric structure and localization in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and interactions with membrane lipids. We emphasize the importance of studying these features within the context of the enzyme's particular lipid environment. Just as the interactions between an organism and its physical environment shape its evolutionary trajectory, ATPases are impacted by the membranes within which they reside. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of membrane proteins-including ATP synthase-requires such an integrative approach.

This sponge can develop long and slender outgrowths extending from the parental body. According to some authors, this phenomenon, called "creeping", can be related to asexual reproduction, atypical mechanisms of "localized" locomotion or passive response to environmental stress. Here we address this phenomenon by means of an interdisciplinary approach consisting of field survey, experimental field studies and experimental laboratory studies. During field survey and field experimental survey we observed that the instability of substratum is an important factor that trigs the beginning of creeping. The sponge size does not seem to be directly involved in the occurrence of the phenomenon. Specimens of Bergeggi (Ligurian Sea, northern Italy) show a high correlation between the creeping phenomenon and the sea temperature: this seems to support the hypothesis that the phenomenon is related to asexual reproduction, which is in its turn seasonally regulated by environmental temperature. In addition, experimental laboratory studies performed in different mechanical conditions on isolated samples of both ectosome and choanosome showed that temperature affects mesohyl mechanical properties: the lower is the temperature the stiffer is the mesohyl. The different physiological states recorded by the laboratory experiments are expressions of the mechanical adaptability of the collagenous mesohyl of C. reniformis and suggest that stiffness variability is under cellular control. On the basis of present results we can infer that C. reniformis can exert some control on the creeping phenomenon and that the primary factors implied in inducing creeping phenomena are the instability of substratum and the temperature.
   Interestingly the capability to modulate the mechanical properties of the collagenous matrix is an uncommon feature that C reniformis shares with the mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) of Echinoderms. This close analogy, which is supported by morphological and physiological evidence, is an intriguing point that opens a wide range of evolutionary and functional questions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simultaneous generation of plasma by microwave irradiation of perovskite or the spinel type of silica supported porous catalyst oxides and their reduction by nitrogen in the presence of oxygen is demonstrated. As a result of plasma generation in air, NOx generation is accompanied by the development of highly heterogeneous regions in terms of chemical and morphological variations within the catalyst. Regions of almost completely reduced catalyst are dispersed within the catalyst oxide, across micron-scale domains. The quantification of the catalyst heterogeneity and evaluation of catalyst structure are studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy and XRD. Plasma generating supported spinel catalysts are synthesized using the technique developed by the author (Catalysts; 2016; 6; 80) and BaTiO3 is used to exemplify perovskites. Silica supported catalyst systems are represented as M/Si = X (single catalysts) or as M((1))/M((2))/Si = X/Y/Z (binary catalysts) where M; M((1)) M((2)) = Cr; Mn; Fe; Co; Cu and X, Y, Z are the molar ratio of the catalysts and SiO2 support. Composite porous catalysts are synthesized using a mixture of Co and BaTiO3. In all the catalysts, structural heterogeneity manifests itself through defects, phase separation and increased porosity resulting in the creation of the high activity sites. The chemical heterogeneity results in reduced and oxidized domains and in very large changes in catalyst/support ratio. High electrical potential activity within BaTiO3 particles is observed through the formation of electrical treeing. Plasma generation starts as soon as the supported catalyst is synthesized. Two conditions for plasma generation are observed: Metal/Silica molar ratio should be > 1/2 and the resulting oxide should be spinel type; represented as MaOb (a = 3; b = 4 for single catalyst). Composite catalysts are represented as {M/Si = X}/BaTiO3 and obtained from the catalyst/silica precursor fluid with BaTiO3 particles which undergo fragmentation during microwave irradiation. Further irradiation causes plasma generation, NOx formation and lattice oxygen depletion. Partially reduced spinels are represented as MaOb-c. These reactions occur through a chemical looping process in micron-scale domains on the porous catalyst surface. Therefore; it is possible to scale-up this process to obtain NOx from MaOb for nitric acid production and H-2 generation from MaOb-c by catalyst re-oxidized by water. Re-oxidation by CO2 delivers CO as fuel. These findings explain the mechanism of conversion of combustion gases (CO2 + N-2) to CO and NOx via a chemical looping process. Mechanism of catalyst generation is proposed and the resulting structural inhomogeneity is characterized. Plasma generating catalysts also represent a new form of Radar Absorbing Material (RAM) for stealth and protection from radiation in which electromagnetic energy is dissipated by plasma generation and catalytic reactions. These catalytic RAMs can be expected to be more efficient in frequency independent microwave absorption.

AB  - Angiosperm mitochondrial (mt) genes are generally slow-evolving, but multiple lineages have undergone dramatic accelerations in rates of nucleotide substitution and extreme changes in mt genome structure. While molecular evolution in these lineages has been investigated, very little is known about their mt function. Some studies have suggested altered respiration in individual taxa, although there are several reasons why mt variation might be neutral in others. Here, we develop a new protocol to characterize respiration in isolated plant mitochondria and apply it to species of Silene with mt genomes that are rapidly evolving, highly fragmented, and exceptionally large (similar to 11 Mbp). This protocol, complemented with traditional measures of plant fitness, cytochrome c oxidase activity assays, and fluorescence microscopy, was also used to characterize inter- and intraspecific variation in mt function. Contributions of the individual "classic" OXPHOS complexes, the alternative oxidase, and external NADH dehydrogenases to overall mt respiratory flux were found to be similar to previously studied angiosperms with more typical mt genomes. Some differences in mt function could be explained by inter- and intraspecific variation. This study suggests that Silene species with peculiar mt genomes still show relatively normal mt respiration. This may be due to strong purifying selection on mt variants, coevolutionary responses in the nucleus, or a combination of both. Future experiments should explore such questions using a comparative framework and investigating other lineages with unusual mitogenomes.

AB  - Molecular chaperones, also known as heat-shock proteins, refold misfolded proteins and help other proteins reach their native conformation. Thanks to these abilities, some chaperones, such as the Hsp90 protein or the chaperonin GroEL, can buffer the deleterious phenotypic effects of mutations that alter protein structure and function. Hsp70 chaperones use a chaperoning mechanism different from that of Hsp90 and GroEL, and it is not known whether they can also buffer mutations. Here, we show that they can. To this end, we performed a mutation accumulation experiment in Escherichia coli, followed by whole-genome resequencing. Overexpression of the Hsp70 chaperone DnaK helps cells cope with mutational load and completely avoid the extinctions we observe in lineages evolving without chaperone overproduction. Additionally, our sequence data show that DnaK overexpression increases mutational robustness, the tolerance of its clients to nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions. We also show that this elevated mutational buffering translates into differences in evolutionary rates on intermediate and long evolutionary time scales. Specifically, we studied the evolutionary rates of DnaK clients using the genomes of E. coli, Salmonella enterica, and 83 other gamma-proteobacteria. We find that clients that interact strongly with DnaK evolve faster than weakly interacting clients. Our results imply that all three major chaperone classes can buffer mutations and affect protein evolution. They illustrate how an individual protein like a chaperone can have a disproportionate effect on the evolution of a proteome.

AB  - Anopheles funestus is a major malaria vector in Africa. Insecticide resistance has developed in populations of this species in several African countries, prompting the need to develop additional vector control methods such as the sterile insect technique (SIT). This technique requires an understanding of those underlying physiological events that lead to sexual maturity of An. funestus males, the rotation of their genitalia in particular. The aim of this study was to qualitatively and quantitatively describe genital rotation in An. funestus males as it is an essential function of sexual maturation. Genital rotation of all the males reached its final rotation stage (135-180 degrees rotation) 36 h post emergence at 23 +/- 1 degrees C in laboratory colonised An. funestus males. These males had a comparable rotation rate to wild caught An. funestus at the same temperature setting. A temperature change (either 18 +/- 1 degrees C or 29 +/- 1 degrees C versus 23 +/- 1 degrees C) significantly influenced the genital rotation rate such that this rate increased with increasing temperature. This information enhances our knowledge of the An. funestus male biology. This is important in terms of applying the sterile insect technique as the understanding and manipulation of the rate of sexual maturation in males has implications for the timing of sterile male release.

AB  - Niche breadth is predicted to correlate with environmental heterogeneity, such that generalists will evolve in heterogeneous environments and specialists will evolve in environments that vary less over space and time. We tested the hypothesis that lizards in a heterogeneous environment were generalists compared to lizards in a homogeneous environment. We compared niche breadths of greater short-horned lizards by quantifying resource selection in terms of two different niche axes, diet (prey items and trophic level), and microhabitat (ground cover and shade cover) between two populations occurring at different elevations. We assessed the heterogeneity of dietary and microhabitat resources within each population's environment by quantifying the availability of prey items, ground cover, and shade cover in each environment. Overall, our results demonstrate that despite differences in resource heterogeneity between elevations, resource selection did not consistently differ between populations. Moreover, environmental heterogeneity was not associated with generalization of resource use. The low-elevation site had a broader range of available prey items, yet lizards at the high-elevation site demonstrated more generalization in diet. In contrast, the high-elevation site had a broader range of available microhabitats, but the lizard populations at both sites were similarly generalized for shade cover selection and were similarly specialized for ground cover selection. Our results demonstrate that environmental heterogeneity of a particular resource does not necessarily predict the degree to which organisms specialize on that resource.

AB  - Field studies were carried out at two sites in 2005 using common lambsquarters seed collected from long-term research plots near Scottsbluff, NE; Fort Collins, CO; and Torrington, WY, to determine the effect of herbicide selection pressure on glyphosate susceptibility. Parental herbicide exposure influenced the level of glyphosate susceptibility exhibited by a subsequent generation. Common lambsquarters selected from historical I plots receiving continuous and exclusive use of glyphosate exhibited lower mortality in response to 420 g ae ha(-1) glyphosate compared with selections from nonglyphosate treatment histories. Selections from rotating glyphosate treatment histories demonstrated an intermediate tolerance response. Differences in response were also influenced by environmental conditions.

AB  - The significance of discontinuous gas-exchange cycles (DGC) in reducing respiratory water loss (RWL) in insects is contentious. Results from single-species studies are equivocal in their support of the classic 'hygric hypothesis' for the evolution of DGC, whereas comparative analyses generally support a link between DGC and water balance. In this study, we investigated DGC prevalence and characteristics and RWL in three grasshopper species (Acrididae, subfamily Pamphaginae) across an aridity gradient in Israel. In order to determine whether DGC contributes to a reduction in RWL, we compared the DGC characteristics and RWL associated with CO2 release (transpiration ratio, i.e. the molar ratio of RWL to CO2 emission rates) among these species. Transpiration ratios of DGC and continuous breathers were also compared intraspecifically. Our data show that DGC characteristics, DGC prevalence and the transpiration ratios correlate well with habitat aridity. The xericadapted Tmethis pulchripennis exhibited a significantly shorter burst period and lower transpiration ratio compared with the other two mesic species, Ocneropsis bethlemita and Ocneropsis lividipes. However, DGC resulted in significant water savings compared with continuous exchange in T. pulchripennis only. These unique DGC characteristics for T. pulchripennis were correlated with its significantly higher mass-specific tracheal volume. Our data suggest that the origin of DGC may not be adaptive, but rather that evolved modulation of cycle characteristics confers a fitness advantage under stressful conditions. This modulation may result from morphological and/or physiological modifications.

AB  - Many tests are in use to assess the quality of the ferrous burden for the blast furnace. Generally, these tests are designed to routinely control the agglomerate quality based on given blast furnace requirements. However, in the case of a burden design for an optimum blast furnace process, a test strategy based on blast furnace simulation tests is the justified approach. These simulation tests can either be based on the blast furnace operating line, or its working line. A careful selection of the applied process conditions, notably the heating rate, is a prerequisite since they have a major impact on the test results. Slow heating rates, like at the wall of the blast furnace, promote burden disintegration. Although knowledge on each burden component is beyond dispute, the understanding of the behaviour of the burden as a whole is emphasized and decisive in the set off to the optimum mixture of agglomerates in relation to its associated costs, the required blast furnace productivity and the reducing agent consumption. A single test suitable for all requirements on the whole burden might be an utopian dream, but with a conscious combination of blast furnace simulation tests, proper quality assessment is achievable.

AB  - H2O2 was directly synthesized from the elements over supported I'd membranes in O-2-saturated, aqueous H2SO4 (0.03 mol/l) between 303 and 348 K while feeding H-2 through the membrane. The H2O2 yield increased with temperature despite H2O2 selectivity declining simultaneously due to faster H2O2 decomposition. Both H2O2 yield and selectivity improved with H-2 feed pressure, however. Comparison of H-2 consumption during H2O2 synthesis with the intrinsic membrane H-2 permeability and the energetics of H-2 oxidation on Pd surfaces revealed that the H2O2 productivity gain with temperature was primarily owed to the acceleration of reaction kinetics. The H2O2 selectivity enhancement with H-2 feed pressure is attributed to the inhibition of direct H2O formation as a result of hindered O-2 dissociation due to blocking of O atom adsorption sites on the membrane surface because of increasing occupation by H atoms. H2O2. decomposition and reduction on the Pd membrane surface accelerate much faster with temperature than H2O2 formation and need to be suppressed in order to maximize H2O2 yield and H-2 utilization at higher temperatures.

AB  - The impacts of climate change on profitability and carbon storage in even-aged forest stands of two dominant commercial pine species, loblolly and slash pine, in the southern United States were assessed under alternative assumptions about the impact of climate change on forest productivity and catastrophic disturbance rates. Potential adaptation strategies to reduce losses from disturbance included: 1) alternative planting densities, and 2) planting slash pine instead of loblolly pine. In addition, the amount of sequestered carbon was used to develop an index of economic efficiency for carbon sequestration, which further helps rank the suitability of alternative adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that greater economic rents from forests occur with lower planting densities and the substitution of slash pine for high density loblolly pine. However, less carbon is sequestered by low density loblolly pine compared to slash pine and high density loblolly pine. Both adaptation strategies are economically more effective in terms of carbon sequestration compared to the baseline since they generate more economic revenues per Mg of sequestered carbon.

AB  - Twenty five rhizobial isolates were obtained from root nodules of Medicago sativa inoculated with soil samples collected from the Sapporo region and Ishigaki Island in Japan. To study their diversity and characterize them in relation to the climatic conditions of their soils of origin, a polyphasic approach analyzing stress tolerance, symbiotic and genetic properties was used. Stress tolerance assays revealed marked variations in salinity, pH and temperature tolerance. Isolates originating from a sub-tropical climate in alkaline soil (Ishigaki Island) tolerated high temperature, salinity and pH levels. Moreover, isolates recovered from a temperate climate in acidic soil (Sapporo) were sensitive to high temperature and salinity, and tolerated acidic pH. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved 16S rRNA and recA genes, and symbiotic nodA and nifDK revealed 25 isolates to be closely related to Ensifer meliloti. Furthermore, the branch patterns of phylogenetic trees constructed from different genes revealed the existence of at least two E. meliloti types in the soils studied. These results may be relevant to programs directed towards improving crop productivity through biofertilization with locally adapted and genetically defined strains. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - This work provides a mathematical model and process simulations of a monolith reactor operated in Taylor mode and film flow mode. The three-phase hydrogenation of a-methylstyrene into cumene and the consecutive hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene were studied as model reactions. The influences of operating conditions and reactor parameters, such as superficial gas and liquid velocities, bed structure, pressure and temperature on conversion, selectivity and productivity were examined. This model also includes the correlations for estimating mass transfer coefficients and kinetic parameters obtained from the literature. The proposed model has been successfully verified with experimental data. A comparison of the reactor performance between Taylor flow and film flow under optimum operating conditions was carried out. Key operating parameters have been identified to maintain optimal performance, which can subsequently be used as criteria for design and scale up. Furthermore, the behaviour of a trickle-bed reactor was modelled using correlations from the literature. The simulations for both monolithic and trickle-bed reactors were performed under optimum operating conditions of each system. It shows that the monolith reactor has higher selectivity and increased product yield.

AB  - As an important intermediate of prostaglandins and entecavir, optically pure Corey lactone diol (CLD) has great value in the pharmaceutical industry. In this work, the enantioseparation of (+/-)-CLD was evaluated using high-performance liquid (HPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). In HPLC, the separations of CLD enantiomers on polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases with both normal phase and polar organic phase were screened. And the conditions for the enantioseparation were optimized in HPLC and SFC, including the selection of mobile phase, temperature, back-pressure, and other conditions. More important, it was found that the chiral resolutions were greatly enhanced by the increase of the coating amount of ADMPC (amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)) under both HPLC and SFC conditions, which can lead to the increase of the productivity and the decrease of the solvent consumption. The preparations of optically pure CLD were evaluated on a semi-preparative (2 x 25 cm) column packed with 30% ADMPC-coated CSP under HPLC and SFC conditions. Preparative performances in terms of kkd are 1.536 kg racemate/kg CSP/day and 1.248 kg racemate/kg CSP/day in HPLC and SFC, respectively.

AB  - A molecular catalyst, (sal)Mo-VI, and a heterogeneous catalyst, either Pd or Au nanoparticles (NPs), were integrated into one UiO-66 MOF microcrystal. The resulting dually functionalized catalysts, Pd@UiO-66-(sal)Mo and Au/UiO-66-(sal)Mo, have been utilized for a one-pot tandem reaction of H2O2 generation and selective liquid-phase alkene oxidation. The NPs serve as catalysts for the production of H2O2 from H-2 and O-2 gases, while the (sal)Mo moieties function as the oxidation catalyst. When the metal NPs are fully encapsulated within the MOF microcrystals, the alkene hydrogenation side reaction is largely suppressed, with a 6-fold decrease in the hydrogenation/oxidation product ratio for 5-bromo-1-cyclooctene favoring the epoxide as the major product. For Au/UiO-66-(sal)Mo, where the two catalysts are in close proximity on the MOF microcrystal, the enhancement in oxidation productivity is increased by 10 times in comparison to the [Au/UiO-66-NR2 + UiO-66-sal(Mo)] physical mixture of the two singly functionalized MOFs.

AB  - A potential biosurfactant producing strain, marine Nocardiopsis B4 was isolated from the West coast of India. Culture conditions involving variations in carbon and nitrogen sources were examined at constant pH, temperature and revolutions per min (rpm), with the aim of increasing productivity in the process. The biosurfactant production was followed by measuring the surface tension, emulsification assay and emulsifying index E24. Enhanced biosurfactant production was carried out using olive oil as the carbon source and phenyl alanine as the nitrogen source. The maximum production of the biosurfactant by Nocardiopsis occurred at a C/N ratio of 2:1 and the optimized bioprocess condition was pH 7.0, temperature 30 degrees C and salt concentration 3%. The production of the biosurfactant was growth dependent. The surface tension was reduced up to 29 mN/m as well as the emulsification index E24 was 80% in 6 to 9 days. Properties of the biosurfactant that was separated by acid precipitation were investigated. The biosurfactant activity was stable at high temperature, a wide range of pH and salt concentrations thus, indicating its application in bioremediation, food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries.

AB  - Dimethoxymethane or DMM is a versatile chemical with applications in many industries such as paints, perfume, pharmacy, and fuel additives. DMM can be produced through the reaction of methanol and formaldehyde in the presence of acid catalysts or, directly, through the selective oxidation of methanol over catalysts with redox and acid functionalities. In terms of sustainability, the so-called bio-methanol derived from syngas obtained via biomass gasification can be used in DMM synthesis. In this review article, we have condensed and classified the research outputs published over the past decade aimed at producing DMM from methanol over different types of catalysts. The majority of studies described the reaction of methanol to DMM in a promising way using heterogeneous catalysts in the gas phase for the ease of product and catalyst recovery as well as suitability for continuous processing. Likewise, the influence of parameters including catalyst component, feed composition, and temperature on the performance of catalysts utilised in DMM production is analysed and discussed. Further, some perspectives concerning the evolution of potential DMM market with respect to the characteristics of the best catalyst materials for high DMM productivity are expressed.

AB  - Evapotranspiration, an important component in terrestrial water balance and net primary productivity models, is difficult to measure and estimate. In this Study, the potential of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is investigated in modelling of daily grass crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo) obtained using the Penman-Monteith equation. Various combinations of daily climatic data, namely solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, are used as inputs to the ANFIS so as to evaluate the degree of effect of each of these variables on daily Penman-Monteith estimated ETo. The results of the ANFIS model are compared with a multiple linear regression model. Mean square error, average absolute relative error and determination coefficient statistics are used as comparison criteria for evaluation of the model performance. The ANFIS technique whose inputs are solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, gave mean square errors of 0.016, average absolute relative errors of 6.4%, and determination coefficients of 0.996 for Morgan Hill 139 station (San Francisco Bay, USA). Based on the comparisons, it was found that the ANFIS model could be successfully employed in estimating the daily ETo. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - With the aim to produce ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AsA-2-P) from L-ascorbic acid (AsA, Vitamin C), nine bacteria conferring the ability to transform AsA to AsA-2-P were isolated from soil samples alongside known strains from culture collections. Most isolates were classified to the genus Brevundimonas by 16S phylogenetic analysis. Among them, Brevundimonas diminuta KACC 10306 was selected as the experimental strain because of its the highest productivity of AsA-2-P. The optimum set of conditions for the AsA-2-P production from AsA using resting cells as the source of the enzyme was also investigated. The optimum cultivation time was 16 h and the cell concentration was 120 g/l (wet weight). The optimum concentrations of AsA and pyrophosphate were 550 mM and 450 mM, respectively. The most effective buffer was 50 mM sodium formate. The optimum p-H was 4.5 and temperature was 40 degrees C. Under the above conditions, 27.5 g/l of AsA-2-P was produced from AsA after 36 h of incubation, which corresponded to a 19.7% conversion efficiency based on the initial concentration of AsA.

TI  - LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS IN SPECIES-DIVERSITY - THE SEARCH FOR THE PRIMARY CAUSE
T2  - OIKOS
LA  - English
AB  - Hypotheses that attempt to explain latitudinal gradients in species diversity are reviewed. Some hypotheses are circular, i.e. they are based on the assumption that some taxa have greater diversity in the tropics. These include explanations assuming different degrees of competition, mutualism, predation, epiphyte load, epidemics, biotic spatial heterogeneity, host diversity, population size, niche width, population growth rate, environmental harshness, and patchiness at different latitudes. Other explanations are not supported by sufficient evidence, i.e. there is no consistent correlation between species diversity and environmental stability, environmental predictability, productivity, abiotic rarefaction, physical heterogeneity, latitudinal decrease in the angle of the sun above the horizon, area, aridity, seasonality, number of habitats, and latitudinal ranges. The ecological and evolutionary time hypotheses, as usually understood, also cannot explain the gradients, nor does the temperature dependence of chemical reactions permit predictions on species richness. Only differences in solar energy are consistently correlated with diversity gradients along latitude, altitude and perhaps depth. It is concluded that greater species diversity is due to greater "effective" evolutionary time (evolutionary speed) in the tropics, probably as the result of shorter generation times, faster mutation rates, and faster selection at greater temperatures. There is an urgent need for experimental studies of temperature effects on speed of selection.

AB  - Low indoor air quality (IAQ) can impact occupants' health and lead to poor productivity or low academic performance. Therefore the provision of good IAQ in classrooms and laboratories is very important. This paper presents the results of the investigation devoted to the quality of indoor air in computer laboratories of selected Polish high schools. Six schools in a town with a population of 200 000 inhabitants were involved in the investigations. The participating school buildings were built between 1975 and 1991 and had gravity ventilation systems. The variability of basic IAQ parameters, i.e., temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide level, was analysed and the assessment of the computer laboratories in terms of microbiological purity was performed. The outomes confirmed the low quality of the indoor air in these buildings. Certain modifications aimed at improving IAQ were proposed during the investigations. Two solutions were implemented. The first solution involved a twofold increase in the volume of supply air from 90 m(3)/h to 180 m(3)/h. The other modification consisted in installing indoor air cleaning devices based on the radiant catalytic ionization technology (RCI). The results of this study indicate that the proposed solution offers the potential to improve IAQ within computer labs. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seasonality describes cyclic and largely predictable fluctuations in the environment. Such variations in day length, temperature, rainfall, and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong selection pressure on organisms to adapt to seasonal environments. However, seasonal variations exhibit large scale geographical divergences caused by a whole suite of factors such as solar radiation, ocean currents, extent of continents, and topography. Realizing these contributions in driving patterns of overall seasonality may help advance our understanding of the kinds of evolutionary adaptations we should expect at a global scale. Here, we introduce a new concept and provide the data describing the overall degree of seasonality, based on its two major components-amplitude and predictability. Using global terrestrial datasets on temperature, precipitation and primary productivity, we show that these important seasonal factors exhibit strong differences in their spatial patterns with notable asymmetries between the southern and the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that seasonality is highly diverse across latitudes as well as longitudinal gradients. This indicates that using a direct measure of seasonality and its components, amplitude and predictability, may yield a better understanding of how organisms are adapted to seasonal environments and provide support for predictions on the consequences of rapid environmental change.

AB  - Analyzing the spatio-temporal characteristics and identifying of main factors that drive grassland degradation are essential for formulating ecological restoration measures for grassland. In this study, we addressed two main scientific questions: (1) how to accurately characterize the spatial and temporal variability in grassland degradation; and (2) how to identify the dominant factors that affect grassland degradation. Based on the data obtained from 270 field sampling points (912 quadrats) and MODIS, we selected the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), vegetation coverage ( VC), biomass and ecosystem service values (ESVs) to study the degradation of grassland in Altay Prefecture, China. From 2000 to 2016, the area with decrease in TVDI accounted for 93.4% of the total grassland. The VC values in the warm steppe and mountain meadow areas decreased by 5.3% and 1.6%, respectively, and the biomass decreased by 80% and 76.4% in these areas. Compared with 2000-2005, the mean total ESVs decreased by 5.1% in 2011-2016, where the reductions in the ESVs for warm steppe and mountain meadow accounted for 54.3% and 38% of the total reduction, respectively. The results showed that the degradation trends were more significant in the warm steppe and mountain meadow than the other land types. These findings improve our understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of grassland degradation. Human disturbance was the main factor responsible for grassland degradation in Altay Prefecture, according to the framework developed in this study based on biomass and TVDI metrics. Our results provide a reference for characterizing the spatio-temporal variability of grassland degradation by combining statistical and spatial analyses, as well as a simple framework for application in similar regions to analyze the effects of climate change and human disturbance on grassland degradation.

AB  - Recent and projected future changes in the temperature and chemistry of marine waters around the UK and Ireland are having, and will in the future have, effects on the phenology, productivity and distribution of marine fish and shellfish. However, the overall consequences are still hard to predict because behaviour, genetic adaptation, habitat dependency and the impacts of fishing on species, result in complex species' responses that may be only partially explained by simple climate envelope predictions. There is a broad body of evidence that climatic fluctuations are playing an important role in changing fish distributions and abundances, which is discernible against the background of trends in abundance due to fishing. During warm periods, southern species have tended to become more prominent and northern species less abundant. However, the changes in distribution are often more complicated than might be expected from a simple climate envelope approach, partly due to ocean circulation patterns which create invasion routes for southern water species into the North Sea from the south and from the north via the continental shelf west of Britain and Ireland. The eventual population-scale impacts of ocean acidification on fish and shellfish are currently very difficult to predict. However, the scant evidence suggests that indirect food web effects arising from the enhanced sensitivity of calcifying planktonic organisms may be important, and the direct effect on fish sensory systems leading to subtle influences on behaviour with possible population-level implications are possible. In British waters, the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) is identified as being at particular risk from climate change. Owing to its strict association with coarse sandy sediments it is unable to adapt its distribution to compensate for warming sea temperatures. Sandeels are a key link in the food web, linking primary and zooplankton production to top predators. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Ultramafic soils are typically enriched in nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), and cobalt (Co) and deficient in essential nutrients, making them unattractive for traditional agriculture. Implementing agromining systems in ultramafic agricultural soils represent an ecological option for the sustainable management and re-valorisation of these low-productivity landscapes. These novel agroecosystems cultivate Ni-hyperaccumulating plants which are able to bioaccumulate this metal in their aerial plant parts; harvested biomass can be incinerated to produce Ni-enriched ash or "bio-ore" from which Ni metal, Ni ecocatalysts or pure Ni salts can be recovered. Nickel hyperaccumulation has been documented in similar to 450 species, and in temperate latitudes these mainly belong to the family Brassicaceae and particularly to the genus Odontarrhena (syn. Alyssum pro parte). Agromining allows for sustainable metal recovery without causing the environmental impacts associated with conventional mining activities, and at the same time, can improve soil fertility and quality and provide essential ecosystem services. Parallel reductions in Ni phytotoxicity over time would also permit cultivation of conventional agricultural crops. Field studies in Europe have been restricted to Mediterranean areas and these only evaluated the Ni-hyperaccumulator Odontarrhena muralis s.l. Two recent EU projects (Agronickel and LIFE-Agromine) have established a network of agromining field sites in ultramafic regions with different edapho-climatic characteristics across Albania, Austria, Greece and Spain. Soil and crop management practices are being developed so as to optimize the Ni agromining process; field studies are evaluating the potential benefits of fertilization regimes, crop selection and cropping patterns, and bioaugmentation with plant-associated microorganisms. Hydrometallurgical processes are being up-scaled to produce nickel compounds and energy from hyperaccumulator biomass. Exploratory techno-economic assessment of Ni metal recovery by pyrometallurgical conversion of O. muralis s.l. shows promising results under the condition that heat released during incineration can be valorized in the vicinity of the processing facility.

AB  - Sustainable bioconversion of plant biomass sugars for 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) production is a carbon-neutral practice, however, its economic feasibility has been hindered by inefficient utilization of xylose. In this study, a novel Enterococcus faecalis strain OPS1 was isolated from palm oil-polluted soil, which assimilates xylose for 2,3-BDO production. While this wild-type strain OPS1 was suppressed with an increase in xylose concentration (60 g/L), strain OPS2, constructed using an adaptive laboratory evolution, achieved a desirable 2,3-BDO production with high-xylose (>100 g/L) tolerance. Whole-genome sequencing analysis reconstructed the metabolic pathways facilitating xylose utilization and 2,3-BDO production in these two novel strains that evolved within from a lactic acid-producing genus Enterococcus. A rpiB gene encoded for ribose-5-phosphate isomerase B enzyme of xylose metabolism in these two strains was identified to be horizontally acquired from a different family Enterobacteriaceae. The detection of a bacteriocin gene UviB and an antitoxin gene hicB in strain OPS1 and OPS2 which are absent in the E. faecalis type strain indicates their beneficial probiotic and antitoxin features. A mutation in uge (UDP-xylose 4-epimerase) was identified between strain OPS1 and OPS2 which may cater to the high-xylose stress. The evolved E. faecalis OPS2 showed a 3-fold increase in xylose consumption rate (2.19 g/L/h) with 0.67 g/L/h 2,3-BDO productivity than OPS1. For the first time, a maximum of 65.3 g/L 2,3-BDO was successfully produced via fed batch xylose fermentation.

AB  - In this paper, a hybrid switch (HyS) consisting of a large current rated Si insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) device connected in parallel with a small current rated SiC MOSFET device (low SiC/Si current ratio below unity) is proposed for high-current high-power converters. A systematic analysis involving a parametric sweep to understand the influence and to derive a boundary line of the parasitic interconnection inductance unbalance between Si and SiC within the HyS is presented. The boundary line prescribes the selection of an appropriate gate sequence control. A comprehensive cost analysis was performed using commercial 1.2 kV devices to demonstrate the cost viability of a 1:4 or 1:6 SiC/Si current ratio HyS compared to a SiC MOSFET. An algorithm using a dynamic junction temperature prediction is presented to select an optimum SiC/Si current ratio, which ensures a reliable HyS operation. Using a design example, the possibility of reliability using a 1:6 SiC/Si HyS is studied. A 650 V Si-IGBT- and SiC-MOSFET-based HyS (1:5 SiC/Si current ratio) was successfully demonstrated in a dc-dc boost converter. Also, electromagnetic interference analysis is presented for the HyS-based converter operation.

AB  - This paper reviews the progression of refrigerants from inception of mechanical refrigeration to the present. It divides historical and current refrigerants into separate generations and discusses the selection criteria distinguishing them. The four generations include slightly overlapping periods based on whatever worked (1830s-1930s), improved safety and durability (1931-1990s), stratospheric ozone protection (1990s-2010s), and attention to global warming (2012-?). The paper discusses the primary refrigerants employed in each period and goes on to examine the viability of the imminent fourth generation, responding to limits and anticipated limits to acceptable refrigerant global warming potential (GWP). The paper presents factors challenging or likely to challenge the fourth generation refrigerants. Among the potential driving factors are efficiency, momentum, prices, litigation and liability, unforeseen suitability issues, local impacts, and political naivete. The paper summarizes impacts from these concerns, individually or in combination, and their potential to necessitate a subsequent fifth generation. Notwithstanding the controversial and uncertain nature of predictions, the paper suggests an approach to selecting future refrigerants in the absence of ideal choices and of new chemical families that might better approach them. Despite what many practitioners now consider the second transition during their careers, retiring still new but now familiar candidates (or a third transition including the earlier advent of fluorochemicals), the paper concludes that industry must choose between forward-looking selections, which go beyond minimum mandates, or face refrigerant transitions ... again.

AB  - The goal of this work is to summarize the viability of several atmospheric chemical systems to generate atmospheric nanoparticles using accurate thermodynamic stabilities of molecular clusters. Positive ion, negative ion, and neutral cluster systems comprised of sulfuric acid and water, with and without ammonia, are considered. Step-wise association reaction energies are determined starting from bare monomers and continuing up through stable nanoparticles. For the smallest clusters, where thermodynamics most strongly influence the nucleation potential, association reaction energies are determined using experimental measurements and selected quantum chemical calculations from literature. Large, bulk-like nanoparticle energies are calculated using classical theory. Energies for the intermediate transitional clusters are determined by connecting the two approaches with globally consistent functions. The growth of molecular clusters into nanoparticles becomes thermodynamically favorable when the free energy surface contains a growth trajectory that has little or no uphill step, i.e., no energetic barrier to nucleation. Barrier heights, critical cluster compositions, and the overall potential for nucleation vary enormously between systems and as a function of precursor concentrations and temperature. Most of the binary and ternary mechanisms considered here achieve barrierless growth under conditions relevant to some region of the troposphere. Gaps and uncertainties in the thermodynamic database are addressed, and the need for future experimental and theoretical studies is discussed.

AB  - Natural selective processes have been known to drive phenotypic plasticity, which is the emergence of different phenotypes from one genome following environmental stimulation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been observed to modulate transcriptional and epigenetic states of genes in human cells. We surmised that lncRNAs are governors of phenotypic plasticity and drive natural selective processes through epigenetic modulation of gene expression. Using heat shocked human cells as a model we find several differentially expressed transcripts with the top candidates being lncRNAs derived from retro-elements. One particular retro-element derived transcripts, Retro-EIF2S2, was found to be abundantly over-expressed in heat shocked cells. Over-expression of Retro-EIF2S2 significantly enhanced cell viability and modulated a predisposition for an adherent cellular phenotype upon heat shock. Mechanistically, we find that this retro-element derived transcript interacts directly with a network of proteins including 40S ribosomal protein S30 (FAU), Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A), and Ubiquitin-60S ribosomal protein L40 (UBA52) to affect protein modulated cell adhesion pathways. We find one motif in Retro-EIF2S2 that exhibits binding to FAU and modulates phenotypic cell transitions from adherent to suspension states. The observations presented here suggest that retroviral derived transcripts actively modulate phenotypic plasticity in human cells in response to environmental selective pressures and suggest that natural selection may play out through the action of retro-elements in human cells.

AB  - The life and survival of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi during its adaptation in natural aquatic systems is highly influenced by the availability of nutrients and temperature. To learn about adaptation strategies evolved by this bacterium to cope with drastic temperature downshifts and nutrients depletion, we have studied the phenotypical and gene expression changes occurring in V.harveyi during its adaptation to cold seawater. We found that incubation in cold seawater up to 12h did not cause any significant morphological changes in V.harveyi and had no effect on the number of viable and culturable cells. Microarray analysis revealed that the V.harveyi response to cold seawater leads to up- and downregulation of numerous genes controlling the central carbon metabolism, nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis as well as DNA repair. In addition, expression of some genes controlling biosynthesis of lipids, molecular transport, and energy production was altered to likely affect the composition and properties of the V.harveyi cell envelope, thus implying the putative role of this compartment in adaptation to stress. Here, we discuss these results with regard to the putative adaptive responses likely triggered by V.harveyi to cope with environmental challenges in natural aquatic systems.

AB  - The present study proposes a non-intrusive visualization technique based on two-wavelength Raman imaging for in-situ monitoring of the unsteady temperature field in microfluidic systems. The measurement principle relies on the contrasting temperature dependencies of hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded OH stretching modes of the water Raman band, whose intensities were simultaneously captured by two cameras equipped with corresponding bandpass filters. The temperature distributions were then determined from the intensity ratio of the simultaneously-obtained Raman images, which enables compensation for temporal fluctuation and spatial inhomogeneity of the excitation laser intensity. A calibration experiment exhibited a linear relationship between the temperature and the intensity ratio in the range 293-343 K and least-regression analysis gave an uncertainty of 1.43 K at 95% confidence level. By applying the calibration data, time series temperature distributions were quantitatively visualized in a Y-shaped milli-channel at a spatial resolution of 6.0 x 6.0 mu m(2) with an acquisition time of 16.5 s. The measurement result clearly exhibited the temporal evolution of the temperature field and was compared with the values obtained by thermocouples. This paper therefore demonstrates the viability of employing the two-wavelength Raman imaging technique for temperature measurements in microfluidic devices.

AB  - Understanding the role of urbanization in extreme temperature events can help mitigate their negative impacts. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the effect of urbanization on extreme temperature events in Liaoning Province, China, from a spatiotemporal perspective. First, eight extreme temperature indices were selected from the temperature data for the period 1959-2018. Climatic regions corresponding to 24 meteorological stations were divided, and land use data were used to classify urban and rural areas. Then, the dynamic "urban minus rural" method was improved and used to quantify the urbanization effect (UE) and temporal variation trend of extreme temperature events. Furthermore, landscape indices were used to quantify the impact of the spatial layout of urban landscapes on extreme temperatures. The results showed that the UE in the northern region of Liaoning Province was reflected by most indices (minimum urbanization contribution, UC = 9.61%), while that in the southern region was mainly observed at night (maximum UC = 75.00% observed during frost days). The area and fragmentation of the urban landscape were the main spatial factors affecting extreme temperatures, primarily extremely high temperatures at night. Further, the highest correlation coefficient (-0.74) was between the contagion index and tropical nights index.

AB  - Extreme heat events, a leading cause of weather-related fatality worldwide, are expected to intensify, last longer, and occur more frequently in the near future. In heat health risk assessments, a spatiotemporal mismatch usually exists between hazard (heat stress) data and exposure (population distribution) data. Such mismatch is present because demographic data are generally updated every couple of years and unavailable at the subcensus unit level, which hinders the ability to diagnose human risks. In the present work, a human settlement index based on multisensor remote sensing data, including nighttime light, vegetation index, and digital elevation model data, was used for heat exposure assessment on a per-pixel basis. Moreover, the nighttime urban heat island effect was considered in heat hazard assessment. The heat-related health risk was spatially explicitly assessed and mapped at the 250 m x 250 m pixel level across Zhejiang Province in eastern China. The results showed that the accumulated heat risk estimates and the heat-related deaths were significantly correlated at the county level (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.76, P <= 0.01). Our analysis introduced a spatially specific methodology for the risk mapping of heat-related health outcomes, which is useful for decision support in preparation and mitigation of heat -related risk and potential adaptation.

AB  - Shallow coastal waters are characterized by substantial diurnal fluctuations in pH, especially in nearshore environments. The biological effects of ocean acidification in combination with these natural fluctuations have received relatively little attention to date. We exposed multiple batches (approximate to different genotypes) of newly settled barnacles, Balanus improvisus, to constant pH under "control" (pH = 8.1) or "stable acidified" (pH = 7.7) conditions, as well as a treatment that simulated the maximum diurnal pH fluctuations seen in the nearshore habitats where this barnacle lives (+/- 0.2 pH units), superimposed on the stable acidified treatment ("fluctuating acidified"; 7.5 <= pH <= 7.9). We found that fluctuating acidification had no effect on mean response in growth and shell mineralogy, but caused an similar to 20-fold increase in variance of responses, compared with stable acidification. In contrast to these results, we found no effect of fluctuating acidification on variances of response ratios for barnacle survival and shell strength. Similarly, mean survival did not vary significantly with pH. However, we observed a strong negative effect of stable and fluctuating acidification on mean shell strength. Our finding that barnacles respond differently to fluctuating pH than to stable low pH indicate the importance of including fluctuating acidification treatments when studying species that live in variable environments. Importantly, because phenotypic variance is the raw material for natural selection, and thus lays at the heart of evolutionary responses to environmental variability and change, our findings also highlight the need to study changes in variance of-as well as mean-responses to changing ocean climates.

Mechanical performance of the detonation sprayed H10T10A and H20T20A hybrid ceramic powders on AISI 304L SS steel were estimated by pin-on-disc apparatus. A load of 110 N was applied constantly over the pin which slides a linear distance of 2700 m at a linear velocity of 1 m/s at atmospheric temperature. The present investigation shows that the specific wear rate of bare AISI 304L SS was 8.23 x 10(-5) mm(3)/N-m, while those of H20T20A and H10T10A coatings were 0.402 and 0.844 x 10(-5) mm(3)/N-m respectively. The coatings and coating powders were characterized by SEM, XRD and FT-IR, XRD techniques respectively. The results showed that H20T20A coating has higher wear resistance in comparison to HA10T10A.

AB  - The response surface methodology (RSM) was used in the optimization of a modified recipe of almond paste cookies to pinpoint the best combination of the most important factors, in order to obtain an enhanced product with quality characteristics similar to the typical one. In this modified recipe, bamboo fiber and fructose were added as humectant and anticrystallizing agents to extend the shelf life of the cookies. Five quantitative controllable factors were selected for the experimental design: weight of bamboo fiber, fructose/saccharose ratio (F/S) and weight of egg white as ingredients, and baking time and temperature as process parameters. To assess the product quality, texture, moisture content and color were considered as dependent variables. The three second-order polynomial models obtained by RSM and the subsequent optimization step indicated that a formulation with 28.95 g of fiber, 252.5 g of egg white, an F/S equal to 0.1, baking time and temperature of 21.5 min and 185.5C, respectively, represents the best recipe to manufacture a new product with quality attributes very similar to the typical one and, in addition, with an extended shelf life.

AB  - The time it takes for malaria parasites to develop within a mosquito, and become transmissible, is known as the extrinsic incubation period, or EIP. EIP is a key parameter influencing transmission intensity as it combines with mosquito mortality rate and competence to determine the number of mosquitoes that ultimately become infectious. In spite of its epidemiological significance, data on EIP are scant. Current approaches to estimate EIP are largely based on temperature-dependent models developed from data collected on parasite development within a single mosquito species in the 1930s. These models assume that the only factor affecting EIP is mean environmental temperature. Here, we review evidence to suggest that in addition to mean temperature, EIP is likely influenced by genetic diversity of the vector, diversity of the parasite, and variation in a range of biotic and abiotic factors that affect mosquito condition. We further demonstrate that the classic approach of measuring EIP as the time at which mosquitoes first become infectious likely misrepresents EIP for a mosquito population. We argue for a better understanding of EIP to improve models of transmission, refine predictions of the possible impacts of climate change, and determine the potential evolutionary responses of malaria parasites to current and future mosquito control tools.

AB  - In the present work, locally available clay has been utilized to develop cost effective catalyst for biodiesel production from low cost feedstock. The selected clay was modified with different concentrations (5 wt%, 10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt% and 40 wt %) of 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) to enhance the capability of the selected clay in biodiesel production from spent frying oil. The synthesized catalyst was characterized with different analytical techniques to evaluate its physiochemical properties. The result suggested that the catalyst containing 10 wt% 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) loading exhibited good trans-esterification activity to produce maximum biodiesel yield of 96% under the best reaction conditions: oil/methanol molar ratio, 1:10; catalyst amount, 0.7 g; reaction time, 4.5 h and reaction temperature, 85 degrees C.
   Moreover, the catalytic reusability of the synthesized catalyst was investigated to study its economic viability. The results suggested that the synthesized catalyst could be reused up to 6 times for biodiesel production without any high temperature treatment. Thus, the selected clay has the potential to be used as a starting material to develop an efficient catalyst for biodiesel production from low cost feedstock. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Conventional platelet storage in a blood bank is up to 5 days at room temperature in plasma. I We investigated the optimal medium for assessing the quality of stored platelets by comparing in vitro test responses after resuspension in autologous plasma prepared from platelet-rich plasma after 5 days of storage at room temperature, autologous plasma stored cell-free for 5 days at room temperature, or autologous plasma stored cell-free for 5 days at -20 degrees C. Five-day-old platelets were prepared from aliquots of the same unit and resuspended in 1 of the 3 plasma preparations. The platelet-plasma mixtures were monitored for changes in pH, mean platelet volume, hypotonic shock response, P-selectin expression, and aggregation. There were statistically significant differences between platelets resuspended in original plasma and platelets resuspended in either plasma stored cell-free at room temperature or frozen, with regard to hypotonic shock response, agonist-induced aggregation, and P-selectin expression. Plasma stored with platelets for 5 days yielded inferior platelet function test responses when? compared with plasma stored cell-free at room temperature or frozen. Therefore, for direct comparison of platelet responses following novel storage methods, the resuspending plasma should be stored under the same conditions as the control platelet unit.

AB  - In response to starvation, bacteria may be stressed and develop mechanism to remain viable. By enhancing rates of macromolecular degradation and protein synthesis, they can enhance resistance to others stresses like heat shock. Moreover, starved bacteria can enter a viable but non culturable state. Then, they fail to grow on selective media under laboratory conditions. They can be present in food and stay able to initiate humans' illness. These bacteria are feared by hygienists but are uneasy to detect in food.

AB  - The rate of migration and in situ genetic variation in forest trees may not be sufficient to compete with the current rapid rate of climate change. Ecophysiological adjustments of key traits, however, could complement these processes and allow sustained survival and growth across a wide range of climatic conditions. This was tested in Pinus halepensis Miller by examining seven physiological and phenological parameters in five provenances growing in three common garden plots along a climatic transect from meso-Mediterranean (MM) to thermo-Mediterranean (TM) and semi-arid (SA) climates. Differential responses to variations in ambient climatic conditions were observed in three key traits: (i) growing season length decreased with drying in all provenances examined (from 165 under TM climate to 100 days under SA climate, on average); (ii) water use efficiency (WUE) increased with drying, but to a different extent in different provenances, and on average from 80, to 95, to 110 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) H2O under MM, TM and SA climates, respectively; (iii) xylem native embolism was stable across climates, but varied markedly among different provenances (percent loss of conductivity, was below 5% in two provenances and above 35% in others). The results indicated that changes in growing season length and WUE were important contributors to tree growth across climates, whereas xylem native embolism negatively correlated with tree survival. The results indicated that irrespective of slow processes (e.g., migration, genetic adaptation), the capacity for ecophysiological adjustments combined with existing variations among provenances could help sustain P. halepensis, a major Mediterranean tree species, under relatively extreme warming and drying climatic trends.

AB  - We compare physiological responses of the crustacean copepod Calanus pacificus and pelagic pteropod mollusk Limacina helicina to ocean temperatures and pH by measuring biomarkers of oxidative stress, antioxidant defences, and the activity of the respiratory electron transport system in organisms collected on the 2016 West Coast Ocean Acidification cruise in the California Current System. Copepods and pteropods exhibited strong but divergent responses in the same habitat; copepods had higher oxygen-reactive absorbance capacity, glutathione-S-transferase, and total glutathione content. The ratio between reduced to oxidised glutathione was higher in copepods than in pteropods, indicating lower oxidative stress in copepods. Pteropods showed higher activities of glutathione reductase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation, indicating increased antioxidant defences and oxidative stress. Thus, the antioxidant defence system of the copepods has a greater capacity to respond to oxidative stress, while pteropods already face severe stress and show limited capacity to deal with further changes. The results suggest that copepods have higher adaptive potential, owing to their stronger vertical migration behaviour and efficient glutathione metabolism, whereas pteropods run the risk of oxidative stress and mortality under high CO2 conditions. Our results provide a unique dataset and evidence of stress-inducing mechanisms behind pteropod ocean acidification responses.

AB  - Global climate change is regarded as one of the major threats to biodiversity. Both local and regional climate parameters can have strong effects on ecological processes affecting the survival and reproduction of plants and animals. High Arctic ecosystems are characterized by low species diversity and the local species have often evolved specific adaptations to the harsh Arctic environment. Here, we investigate the effect of local and regional climate parameters on snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) reproductive success in the Arctic using a long-term dataset of 15 years. We found strong relationships between both local weather and the Arctic oscillation (AO), a regional climate index, with several breeding parameters. Onset of breeding was earlier in years with high spring temperatures and later in years with high AO index the preceding winter. Importantly, high AO winter index also increased the number of successful fledglings the following summer, possibly mediated via spring phenology. Nestling weight was negatively associated with the AO index during the breeding season. The strong effects of local and regional climate suggest that the ongoing global climate change could potentially have a large effect on this Arctic passerine population.

AB  - Believed to be the most abundant (similar to 10(30)) biological agents in the ocean, viruses play an important role in microbial metabolism, prokaryotic mortality, and nutrient recycling in marine ecosystems, thereby significantly influencing the geochemical cycles of our planet. The importance of viruses in the surface ocean has been well recognized, however we are just beginning to understand the viral role and the underlying mechanism in the deep ocean. As an essential part of the marine environment, the abyssal ocean has extensive material and energy exchanges with the upper ocean and the deep biosphere, and they constitute an integral whole of the marine ecosystem. With an average depth of approximately 3800 m, the benthic environment is characterized by total darkness, low temperature (<4 degrees C), and high hydrostatic pressure (>10 MPa). The deep-sea inhabited microorganisms, including viruses, are believed to develop unique strategy to survive under multiple extreme environmental stresses. Studies on deep-sea viruses have revealed their abundance, diversity, and important ecological functions. In this review, advances in research on deep-sea viruses are summarized into four parts: general features, relationship between environmental factors and deep-sea viruses, isolation and characterization of representative viruses, and significant influences of the viriobenthos on the physiological and ecological function of deepsea microorganisms. In general, the functions of viruses in the deep-sea environment mainly include two aspects: First, the regulation of material and energy cycle (viral shunt) and the dynamic change in ecosystem composition (balance of microbial communities) modulated by viral lysis; second, the expression of viral metabolic related genes (auxiliary metabolism) and the effect of viruses on host physiological activities (environmental adaptability). The former has been widely recognized, but the influence and molecular mechanism of the latter in the extreme deep-sea environment need to be further investigated. Here, we propose research directions and challenges in this field to undertake in future studies. Notably, the relationship between environmental factors and deep-sea viruses remains poorly understood. A deep-sea viral-host model system must be developed to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism of gene expression and the interaction between deep-sea viruses and their hosts under extreme environmental conditions. At present, the number of isolated deep-sea viruses is less than 30, which is below 1% of the total number of viruses in the International Virus Classification Database. In terms of classification, most of the isolated deep-sea viruses belong to Caudovirales, and nearly no representatives have been identified yet from other viral orders. Furthermore, deep-sea viruses have been rarely subjected to in-depth study possibly because of very few benthic microorganisms with genetic operating system. In addition to maximizing the use of existing virus-host systems, scholars must focus on isolating other representative deepsea viruses. Although our understanding on viriobenthos is still far from complete, data provided here encourage us to hypothesize that viruses are the key component of the benthic ecosystem and play an indispensable role in the deep ocean and deep biosphere.

AB  - High-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) present an interesting concept for the next generation of nuclear reactors due to them having many advantages. In particular, their fuel is based on coated particles known as tri-structural-isotropic (TRISO) particles, and these provide a strong container capacity for fission products. Solid graphite acts as a moderator by delaying the transient temperature in the event of an accident, while neutronically inert helium acts as a coolant. What is more, several TRISO particle models are in various stages of development. Nowadays, numerous studies have sought to investigate the integration of thorium as a fertile absorber with a driver fuel (ie, U-233, U-235, or Pu-293) in nuclear reactors due to its natural abundance and its potential for producing fissile material (U-233). In addition, there are numerous perspectives for recycling and reusing the fissile isotopes released during thorium irradiation and the spent fuels from current reactors, with the main goal being to dispose of the world's growing stocks of radioactive waste and surplus weapons material. The primary objective of this study is not just to discuss the advantages of using thorium in a (pebble-bed type) HTGR but also to investigate how thorium can be incorporated into the fuel with different drivers and how this affects the neutronic parameters in comparison to the nominal HALEU (UO2 17 wt%) fuel. These parameters include the burnup behavior, spent fuel compositions, effective delayed neutron fractions, neutron spectra, and temperature coefficients. The investigated fuel mixtures include thoria (ThO2) fuel mixed with high-assay, low enriched uranium (HALEU 20 wt%), reactor-grade plutonium (RGPuO(2)), weapons-grade plutonium (WGPuO(2)), and U-233. Neutronic analyses show that cores fueled by (Th + U-233)O-2 and ThO2 + WGPuO(2) achieved higher excess reactivity at the beginning of cycle (BOC), compared with the UO2 core which achieves higher discharge burnups. Cores fueled by ThO2 + RGPuO(2), in contrast, can achieve higher discharge burnup despite having the lowest excess reactivity at BOC. Further comparisons of the examined fuel mixtures reveal that the (Th + U-233)O-2 and ThO2 + PuO2 mixtures have less favorable effective delayed neutron fractions and temperature coefficients than the UO2. However, the moderator temperature coefficients of the (Th + U-233)O-2 mixtures were sufficiently negative for all time steps.YY

AB  - An age-structured trophodynamic model was constructed to quantitatively analyze factors affecting post-settlement mortality and growth of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the Doto area, the main nursery ground of the Japan Pacific population. The model included (i) multiple age classes of pollock, (ii) a generic predator, (iii) fisheries, and (iv) major prey of pollock. Major processes considered were (i) recruitment, (ii) bottom-up control of somatic growth, (iii) mortality because of predation, cannibalism and fishing, GO size-selective prey selection, (v) temperature-dependent bioenergetics such as conversion efficiency and daily consumption rate, and (vi) production and advective supply of prey. By assuming that pollock select prey based upon both relative abundance and predator-prey size relationships, the model accurately simulated seasonal and ontogenetic variations in the diet. However considering ontogenetic segregation, the model showed that, due to cannibalism, newly recruited fish would be totally consumed within 6 months after settlement. By considering segregation (10% overlap during spring and 0.1% during other seasons), an agreement of diet between the simulation and empirical data averaged 82.7% for the different seasons and fish sizes. Euphausiids, the most important prey of pollock, suffered the highest predation impact (22.2 +/- 5.3 WWg m(-2) yr(-1)) exceeding annual production in the model domain (17.2 +/- 0.1 WWg m(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that an advective supply of prey is necessary to support the pollock population. The daily ration of pollock during spring and summer averaged at 1.2 and 0.6% BW day(-1) for small (less than or equal to200 mm) and large (>200 mm) pollock, respectively; this daily ration was reduced by half during autumn and winter.

AB  - The present work describes experiments undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of selected physicochemical indices of semen, cell membrane integrity and sperm chromatin structure for the assessment of boar semen sensitivity to processes connected with pre-insemination procedures. The experiments were carried out on 30 boars: including 15 regarded as providers of sensitive semen and 15 regarded as providers of semen that is little sensitive to laboratory processing. The selection of boars for both groups was based on sperm morphology analyses, assuming secondary morphological change incidence in spermatozoa as the criterion. Two ejaculates were manually collected from each boar at an interval of 3 to 4 months. The following analyses were carried out for each ejaculate: sperm motility assessment, sperm pH measurement, sperm morphology assessment, sperm chromatin structure evaluation and cell membrane integrity assessment. The analyses were performed three times. Semen storage did not cause an increase in the incidence of secondary morphological changes in the group of boars considered to provide sperm of low sensitivity. On the other hand, with continued storage there was a marked increase in the incidence of spermatozoa with secondary morphological changes in the group of boars regarded as producing more sensitive semen. Ejaculates of group I boars evaluated directly after collection had an approximately 6% smaller share of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes than the ejaculates of boars in group II (p <= 0.05). In the process of time the percentage of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes decreased. The sperm of group I boars was characterised with a lower sperm motility than the semen of group II boars. After 1 hour of storing diluted semen, the sperm motility of boars producing highly sensitive semen was already 4% lower (p <= 0.05), and after 24 hours of storage it was 6.33% lower than that of the boars that produced semen with a low sensitivity. Factors that confirm the accuracy of insemination male selection can include a low rate of sperm motility decrease during the storage of diluted semen, low and contained incidence of secondary morphological changes in spermatozoa during semen storage and a high frequency of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes.

AB  - Survey-based choice scenarios used to value non-market public goods typically preclude any risk that the benefits described may not be delivered. Our survey specifies explicit risks of (a) outright program failure and (b) program redundancy due to possible private sector substitutes. Additionally, most analyses assume that survey subjects fully accept these scenarios and that all provided information receives their complete attention. Our discounted expected utility model of choice accommodates both these objective risks and the possibility of subjective scenario adjustment or selective inattention by respondents. We then counterfactually simulate willingness-to-pay in the absence of these distortions.

AB  - Based on formation testing data of more than 40 wells with industrial oil flow, systematic observation of 1 010.26 m long cores taken from 4 wells and test data of over 10 000 core samples combining with drilling and pilot fracturing data of multiple wells, the geological characteristics of the upper submember of the Sha 4 Member to the lower submember of the Sha 3 Member of Paleogene (Es4s-Es3x) in the Jiyang Depression were investigated to find out factors controlling the enrichment of shale oil and the accumulation model of shale oil, and a comprehensive evaluation method for shale oil sweet spots was established. It is found through the study that the target shale layer is characterized by strong heterogeneity, weak diagenesis, low thermal evolution and high content of clay and carbonate minerals. Shale lithofacies, microcrack, thin interlayer and abnormal pressure are the main factors affecting enrichment and stable production of shale oil, the organic rich laminar shale has the best storage and oil-bearing capacity, microcrack network system improve the storage capacity and permeability of the shale, the thin interlayer is the main flow channel for stable shale oil production, and the abnormal high pressure layer is rich in free state shale oil and high in oil content. The shale oil layers in the target section were divided into three types: matrix, interlayer and fracture ones. According to the occurrence state and exploration practice of shale oil at home and abroad, it is concluded that the interlayer shale oil is the most profitable type at present. The selection parameters for the different types of shale oil were determined, and accordingly the favorable areas were pointed out by comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors. Vertical wells in the interlayer shale oil reservoir, such as Fan 159, Fan 143 and GX 26, were stimulated by volume fracturing and high conductivity channel fracturing jointly. After fracturing, they had a daily oil production of over 6 t, up to 44 t, and stable productivity. Shale oil is expected to become an important replacement energy resource in the Jiyang Depression.

AB  - Adaptive responses are probably the most effective long-term responses of populations to climate change, but they require sufficient evolutionary potential upon which selection can act. This requires high genetic variance for the traits under selection and low antagonizing genetic covariances between the different traits. Evolutionary potential estimates are still scarce for long-lived, clonal plants, although these species are predicted to dominate the landscape with climate change. We studied the evolutionary potential of a perennial grass, Festuca rubra, in western Norway, in two controlled environments corresponding to extreme environments in natural populations: cold-dry and warm-wet, the latter being consistent with the climatic predictions for the country. We estimated genetic variances, covariances, selection gradients and response to selection for a wide range of growth, resource acquisition and physiological traits, and compared their estimates between the environments. We showed that the evolutionary potential of F. rubra is high in both environments, and genetic covariances define one main direction along which selection can act with relatively few constraints to selection. The observed response to selection at present is not sufficient to produce genotypes adapted to the predicted climate change under a simple, space for time substitution model. However, the current populations contain genotypes which are pre-adapted to the new climate, especially for growth and resource acquisition traits. Overall, these results suggest that the present populations of the long-lived clonal plant may have sufficient evolutionary potential to withstand long-term climate changes through adaptive responses.

AB  - Reproduction is strongly influenced by environmental temperature in insects. At high temperature, mating success could be influenced not only by basal (non-inducible) thermotolerance but also by inducible plastic responses. Here, mating success at high temperature was tested in flies carrying contrasting genotypes of heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. The possible heat-hardening effect was tested. Mating success did not differ between heat-resistant and heat-sensitive genotypes when tested both at high (33 degrees C) and benign (25 degrees C) temperature, independently of the heat-hardening status. Importantly, heat-hardening pre-treatment increased in a 70% the number of matings at 33 degrees C in a mass-mating experiment. Further, mating latency at 33 degrees C was shorter with heat hardening than without it in single-pair assays Heat-hardening had previously been showed to improve short-term thermotolerance in many organisms including Drosophila, and the present results show that heat hardening also improve mating success at elevated temperature. Previous exposures to a mild heat stress improve short-term mating success as a plastic response of ecological relevance. Such heat-hardening effects on mating success should be relevant for predicting potential evolutionary responses to any possible current scenery of global warming, as well as in sterile insect release programs for pest control in elevated temperature environments.

AB  - The sexual cycle of Siberian salamander females (Salamandrella keyserlingii Dybowski 1870) has been studied in the tundra of the northern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. Spawning starts soon after the end of wintering (in the second half of May) and ends up in the first half of June. At the end of June, the ovaries show obvious features of a new ovogenic cycle; i.e., pigment starts accumulating in large vitellogenic oocytes. By the end of July, the ovaries in most individuals are already filled with pigmented follicles and the oviduct epithelium is restored. The time from spawning to the appearance of a new generation of mature oocytes lasts a little more than two months (i.e., half of the whole activity season). In the second half of August, the state of the genital system is identical to that in spring before spawning, this proving their annual reproduction. The average fecundity in the studied water bodies varies from 102 to 123 eggs and is comparable to that in other parts of the distribution range. Oogenesis both in the vast majority of females that reach pubescence (subadultus) and in those that spawn in spring occurs simultaneously, but in some subadults it is completed almost a month or a month and a half earlier. By this phenological feature, the female subadults differ considerably from the male subadults, in which completion of spermatogenesis extends much more strongly into the season. A study of the ecology of the Siberian salamander in the conditions of a short season of activity with low temperatures allows for the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk to be considered not as extreme, but, in contrast, rather favorable for its habitation. Many population characteristics in this area are typical for the species in general. The main features of the male and female sexual cycles appear to be similar to those observed in species of the same family that live in the south of the region. The short period of germinal cell development, coupled with the outstanding winter cold hardiness of the species, partially accounts for its unique adaptive potential, which allows it to colonize vast territories of northern Eurasia and successfully thrive in the territories with short and cold summer period.

AB  - Current climate change affects the competitive ability and reproductive success of many species, leading to local extinctions, adjustment to novel local conditions by phenotypic plasticity or rapid adaptation, or tracking their optima through range shifts. However, many species have limited ability to expand to suitable areas. Altitudinal gradients, with abrupt changes in abiotic conditions over short distances, represent "natural experiments" for the evaluation of ecological and evolutionary responses under scenarios of climate change. Nothofagus pumilio is the tree species which dominates as pure stands the montane forests of Patagonia. We evaluated the adaptive value of variation in quantitative traits of N. pumilio under contrasting conditions of the altitudinal gradient with a long-term reciprocal transplant experimental design. While high-elevation plants show little response in plant, leaf, and phenological traits to the experimental trials, low-elevation ones show greater plasticity in their responses to changing environments, particularly at high elevation. Our results suggest a relatively reduced potential for evolutionary adaptation of high-elevation genotypes, and a greater evolutionary potential of low-elevation ones. Under global warming scenarios of forest upslope migration, high-elevation variants may be outperformed by low-elevation ones during this process, leading to the local extinction and/or replacement of these genotypes. These results challenge previous models and predictions expected under global warming for altitudinal gradients, on which the leading edge is considered to be the upper treeline forests.

AB  - Within the marine environment, per offspring investment (POI) is associated with modes in larval development; an increase in POI has often been described with a decrease in temperature, as evidenced along latitudinal clines. However, the environmental drivers of POI remain largely hypothetical and have not yet been tested within an evolutionary context. Here, we test the hypothesis that developmental temperature is linked to POI within a globally distributed and diverse family of benthic crustaceans, the Lithodidae, also known as stone or king crab. To do this, we examine variations in egg diameter-a proven corollary of POI-within the Lithodidae. Based on a rare case of well-construed phylogeny, we test the relationship between egg diameter and two aspects of the maternal physical environment: water depth and temperature. We observe a significant relationship between decreasing environmental temperature and an increase in POI within genera of lithodid crabs, and independent of depth. There is a clear correlation of high levels in POI with a decrease in temperature in lithodid crab genera currently inhabiting the deep sea, all of which follow a food-independent (lecithotrophic) mode of larval development. In contrast, lithodid genera thriving in the warmer waters of shallow (continental shelf) seas follow a feeding (planktotrophic) mode in larval development. We conclude that temperature is an important factor governing POI, and discuss its importance in the evolution of larval lecithotrophy in marine invertebrates.

AB  - The sexual cycle of Siberian salamander females (Salamandrella keyserlingii Dybowski 1870) has been studied in the tundra of the northern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. Spawning starts soon after the end of wintering (in the second half of May) and ends up in the first half of June. At the end of June, the ovaries show obvious features of a new ovogenic cycle, i.e. pigment starts accumulating in large vitollogenic oocytes. By the end of July, the ovaries in most individuals are already filled with pigmented follicles and the oviduct epithelium is restored. The time from spawning to the appearance of a new generation of mature oocytes totals a little more than 2 months (i.e. half of the whole activity season). In the second half of August, the state of the genital system is identical to that in spring before spawning, this proving their annual reproduction. The average fecundity in the study water bodies varies from 102 to 123 eggs and is comparable to that in the other parts of the distribution range. Oogenesis both in the vast majority of the females that reach pubescence (subadultus) and in those, which spawn in spring runs simultaneously, but in some subadults, it is completed almost a month or a month and a half earlier. By this phenological feature the female subadults differ considerably from the male subadults, in which the sperinatogenesis completion is much more strongly extended during the season. A study of the ecology of Siberian salamander in the conditions of a short season of activity with low temperatures allows for the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk to be considered not so extreme, but, in contrast, rather favourable for its habitation. Many population characteristics are typical here of the species in general. The main features of the male and female sexual cycles appear to be similar to those observed in species of the same family that live in the south of the region. The short period of germinal cell development coupled with the outstanding winter cold hardiness of the species partially account for its unique adaptive potential, which allows it to colonize the vast territories of northern Eurasia and to successfully thrive in the territories with short and cold summer periods.

AB  - Global climate change requires species to adapt to increasing environmental variability, rising air and ocean temperatures and many other effects, including temperature-associated phenological shifts. Species may adapt to such rapid changes by microevolutionary processes and/or phenotypic plasticity. The speed of microevolutionary adaptation may critically be enhanced by between-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity. However, such between-individual differences have rarely been shown, especially for long-lived and migratory species that appear particularly vulnerable to phenological shifts. Southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome are migratory, long-lived seabirds with a 'vulnerable' conservation status. We studied clutch initiation date (CID) and investment into egg mass in individually marked females in response to broad-scale and local climate variables across 7 yr. We thereby distinguished within-individual and between-individual variation and tested the existence of between-individual differences in the expression of phenotypic plasticity. Because of both within-individual and between-individual variation, CID was significantly advanced under high Southern Annular Mode (SAM), reflecting colder environmental conditions and higher food availability. Total clutch mass increased under low local sea surface temperatures (significant within-individual effect) but was mostly accounted for by female identity. Intra-clutch egg-mass di-morphism was not affected by environmental variables at all. We found no indication of be tween-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity and overall, the expression of phenotypic plasticity appeared to be limited. This raises the question whether between-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity exist in other long-lived species and whether rockhopper penguins show sufficient phenotypic plasticity to adapt to predicted climate changes.

AB  - Parents encountering stress environments can influence the phenotype of their offspring in a form of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity that has the potential to be adaptive if offspring are thereby better able to deal with future stressors. Here, we test for the existence of anticipatory parental effects in the heat stress response in the highly polymorphic nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. Rather providing an anticipatory response, parents subject to a prior heat stress actually produce offspring that are less able to survive a severe heat shock. Selection on heat shock resistance within the larvae via experimental evolution leads to a loss of sensitivity (robustness) to environmental variation during both the parental and larval periods. Whole genome transcriptional analysis of both ancestor and selected lines shows that there is weak correspondence between genetic pathways induced via temperature shifts during parental and larval periods. Parental effects can evolve very rapidly via selection acting directly on offspring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report evidence of adaptive evolution in juvenile development time on a decadal timescale for the cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) colonizing new habitats and hosts from the Willamette Valley to the Coast Range and Cascades Mountains in Oregon. Four lines of evidence reveal shorter egg to pupa juvenile development times evolved in the mountains, where cooler temperatures shorten the growing season: (i) field observations showed that the mountain populations have shorter phenological development; (ii) a common garden experiment revealed genetic determination of phenotypic differences in juvenile development time between Willamette Valley and mountain populations correlated with the growing season; (iii) a laboratory experiment rearing offspring from parental crosses within and between Willamette Valley and Cascades populations demonstrated polygenic inheritance, high heritability, and genetic determination of phenotypic differences in development times; and (iv) statistical tests that exclude random processes (founder effect, genetic drift) in favor of natural selection as explanations for observed differences in phenology. These results support the hypothesis that rapid adaptation to the cooler mountain climate occurred in populations established from populations in the warmer valley climate. Our findings should motivate regulators to require evaluation of evolutionary potential of candidate biological control organisms prior to release.

AB  - Accurate prediction of soil nitrogen (N) mineralization in agricultural soils is of major concern because uncertainty in making fertilizer N recommendations can lead to economic losses and environmental pollution. This study examined the suitability of three temperature functions (Q(10), Arrhenius, Logistic) as predictors of the temperature dependence of soil N mineralization rate, k, in soil using previously published data sets. Each function fits k/k(0), where k(0) is the reference mineralization rate, against soil temperature T, where k/k(0) = 1 at the reference temperature, T-0. No single value of soil temperature was common to all data sets, and consequently a series of values of T-0 from 5 degrees C to 35 degrees C were tested. The influence of the temperature zone, land use and soil textural class of soils in the data set on the temperature response function was also tested. Despite the different mathematical forms of the functions evaluated, the fitted curves for each function were very similar and choice of temperature response function had a limited effect on prediction of soil N mineralization rate. An additional model, the Logistic(Fixed M) model, is proposed which fits the data sets as well as the previous models, but also takes into account the existence of optimal and maximal temperatures in a reasonable temperature range for biological organisms. In contrast, choice of To had a much more pronounced impact on the k/k(0) values, and thus on the predicted N mineralization rate, than choice of temperature model. A greater response of N mineralization rate (i.e. k/k(0)) to changes in temperature was observed in soils originating from colder climatic zones (mean annual temperature <2 degrees C) compared with warmer climate zones (mean annual temperature >6 degrees C). There was also a greater temperature response of soil N mineralization rate for agricultural compared with forested soils. Among agricultural soils, sand-loam soils had a greater temperature response compared with clay soils. Overall. selection of temperature response model did not appear to be critical to prediction of soil N mineralization rate, and consequently a form of the model which best represents the biological system is therefore preferable, whereas more attention should be given to the choice of the appropriate T-0 for field prediction of N mineralization.

AB  - Hatchery enhancement has been reported to result in an increase in egg size in coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and a decline in egg size in Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha. Egg size may be directly influenced by selection, a larger egg size evolving as a consequence of hatchery incubation. Alternatively, a smaller egg size could evolve as a correlated response to fecundity selection, and a unidirectional change in egg size over time may reflect selection and an underlying genetic change in the population. To address this question, temporal trends in egg size were investigated for two hatchery-enhanced populations of Chinook salmon from Vancouver Island, British Columbia. After the effect of female length variation was removed by standardizing egg sizes to a female of common length (the overall mean for each population), there was no temporal trend in egg size from the 1970s to 2008 for any of the hatchery-enhanced populations evaluated. These results do not support a previous report of genetically based declines in egg size in hatchery-enhanced Chinook salmon populations from this region.

AB  - The hatching success of leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea (Vandelli, 1761), is influenced by heterogeneously distributed ecological factors. However, the hatching success according to nest-site selection has rarely been studied and little is known about the role of nest-site selection and infertile (yolkless) egg production on the predation rate and development of fertile eggs in leatherback turtle nests laid in French Guiana. A field study of 99 leatherback turtle nests was conducted to quantify the relationships between hatching success and (i) the nest-site selection (i.e., vegetation line, sea tide line) and (ii) the infertile eggs, especially their state after incubation (i.e., hydrated or dehydrated) and their effects on predation rate. We found that hatching success on this beach was very low (38.2%). This study illustrates that nest-site selection influences the predation rate and the dehydration of yolkless eggs, while the production of yolkless eggs by leatherback turtles has consequences on nest success. The proportion of yolkless eggs in the clutch, as well as their status at the end of incubation (hydrated or not, preyed upon), correlates with predation rate, development of yolked eggs, and hatching success. There was a significant relationship between nest location (relative to high tide line and vegetation line) and both the predation rates of eggs and the percentage of dehydrated yolkless eggs within a clutch. The production of yolkless eggs was related to hatching success and supports the hypothesis that yolkless eggs have a positive effect on the future of the clutch.

AB  - Parasite-mediated selection is potentially of great importance in modulating genetic diversity. Genetic variation for resistance, the fuel for natural selection, appears to be common in host-parasite interactions, but responses to selection are rarely observed. In the present study, we tested whether environmental variation could mediate infection and determine evolutionary outcomes. Temperature was shown to dramatically alter the potential for parasite-mediated selection in two independent laboratory infection experiments at four temperatures. The bacterial parasite, Pasteuria rainosa, was extremely virulent at 20degreesC and 25degreesC, sterilizing its host, Daphnia magna, so that females often never produced a single brood. However, at 10degreesC and 15degreesC, the host-parasite interaction was much more benign, as nearly all females produced broods before becoming sterile. This association between virulence and temperature alone could stabilize coexistence and lead to the maintenance of diversity, because it would weaken parasite-mediated selection during parts of the season. Additionally, highly significant genotype-by-environment interactions were found, with changes in clone rank order for infection rates at different temperatures. Our results clearly show that the outcome of parasite-mediated selection in this system is strongly context dependent.

AB  - Many insect species live in the arctic and show a wide range of adaptations to its extreme severity and seasonality. Long, cold winters are met, for example, by cold hardiness and choice of protected sites. Cold hardiness includes both widespread tolerance to freezing and extreme supercooling ability, as well as unusual responses in a few species, such as lack of typical cryoprotectants. Adaptations to short, cool summers include activity at low temperatures, selection of warm habitats and microhabitats, melanism and hairiness coupled with basking behaviour, and prolonged or abbreviated life cycles. Diapause ensures that many species emerge early in summer, with brief synchronized reproduction that maximizes the time for offspring development before winter returns. Some species overwinter in sites that thaw earliest in spring, even if they are relatively exposed in winter. Other adaptations respond to year-to-year variability: for example, prolonged diapause can provide insurance against unsuitable summers. All of these adaptations are co-ordinated. For example, cold hardiness relies on physiological and biochemical adaptations but also on habitat choice and timing. Because the adaptations are complex, predicted climatic warming probably will have unexpected effects. In particular, an increase in temperature that increases summer cloud when sea ice melts would likely reduce temperatures for insect development and activity, because sunshine provides critical warmth to insects and their microhabitats. Changes in moisture will also be important. Moreover, responses differ among species, depending especially on their microhabitats. The complexity of the responses of insects to arctic conditions reinforces the need for research that is sufficiently detailed.

AB  - Rapid embryonic development is a potential adaptation to cold climates. We tested this hypothesis for nine species of Sceloporus lizards from four species groups and one species of Urosaurus, an outgroup, using observations corrected for incubation temperature and hatchling size. Phylogenetically based comparisons indicated that relatively rapid development is characteristic of the scalaris species group and relatively slow development is characteristic of the undulatus species group. Comparisons within these lineages were therefore used to determine whether develop mental rate was related to climate, as judged by elevation and latitude. Within the scalaris species group, developmental rates of cool climate populations of S. aeneus and S, scalaris were not faster than that of a warm climate population of S. scalaris, Within the undulatus species-group, the developmental rate of cool climate populations or species were not faster than those of warm climate populations or species. In general, developmental rates of Sceloporus are lineage specific and do not appear to be adapted to local climates.

TI  - Thermoregulation in the nest of the neotropical stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica and a hypothesis on the evolution of temperature homeostasis in highly eusocial bees
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
LA  - English
AB  - In the Brazilian stingless bee, Scaptotrigona postica, social thermoregulation was studied. Intranidal temperature was recorded in different parts of the nest and related to changes in ambient temperature. In addition, cooling and overheating experiments were carried out using colonies in laboratory observation hives. The brood chamber is the warmest part of the nest, well insulated by a multi-layered involucrum. In the brood nest 32 +/- 3 degrees C were measured. In case of low aerial temperature the bees are capable of heating up the brood combs by mass incubation. In addition, cold spots around the brood chamber are insulated by covering with cerumen, and the entrance is more or less closed. Overheating of the brood is reduced by accelerated and aligned fanning and withdrawal of all the bees from the combs. Any direct cooling by evaporation of water could not be observed and probably is not needed in natural nests of Sc. postica which are built in trunk cavities of old trees in the neotropical rain forest. The importance of temperature homeostasis in the nest of stingless bees with perennial colonies and permanent brooding activity in tropical climate and a hypothesis on the evolution of thermoregulation in the highly eusocial Meliponidae and Apidae are discussed.

AB  - How do hierarchical gene regulation networks evolve in bacteria? Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) influence the overall structure of bacterial genomes, sigma factors and global transcription factors (TFs) control thousands of genes, and many operons are regulated by highly specific TFs that in turn are controlled allosterically by cellular metabolites. These regulatory hierarchies have been shaped by millions of years of evolution to optimize fitness in response to changing environmental conditions, but it is unclear how NAPs and TFs relate and have evolved together. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) is the paradigmatic global TF in Escherichia coli, and here we report that mutations in the topA gene compensate for loss of cAMP, showing that the interplay between Crp and the supercoiling status of promoters is key to global stress response. Furthermore, we observed an effect of apoCrp on gene expression in the absence of its effector cAMP. This provides support for the proposed NAP-like role for Crp, suggesting that it represents an intermediate point in the evolution of a ligandcontrolled TF from a NAP.

AB  - Understanding how selection shapes population differentiation and local adaptation inmarine species remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of evolutionary biology. The selection of genes in response to environment-specific factors and microenvironmental variation often results in chaotic genetic patchiness, which is commonly observed in rocky shore organisms. To identify these genes, the expression profile of the marine gastropod Littoraria flava collected from four Southeast Brazilian locations in ten rocky shore sites was analyzed. In this first L. flava transcriptome, 250,641 unigenes were generated, and 24% returned hits after functional annotation. Independent paired comparisons between 1) transects, 2) sites within transects, and 3) sites from different transects were performed for differential expression, detecting 8,622 unique differentially expressed genes. Araca (AR) and Sao Joao (SJ) transect comparisons showed the most divergent gene products. For local adaptation, fitness-related differentially expressed genes were chosen for selection tests. Nine and 24 genes under adaptative and purifying selection, respectively, were most related to biomineralization in AR and chaperones in SJ. The biomineralization-genes perlucin and gigasin-6 were positively selected exclusively in the site toward the open ocean in AR, with sequence variants leading to pronounced protein structure changes. Despite an intense gene flow among L. flava populations due to its planktonic larva, gene expression patterns within transects may be the result of selective pressures. Our findings represent the first step in understanding how microenvironmental genetic variation is maintained in rocky shore populations and the mechanisms underlying local adaptation in marine species.

AB  - Moonlighting proteins exhibit functions that are alternative to their main role in the cell. Heat-shock proteins, also known as molecular chaperones, are now recognized for their wide range of activities in and/or outside the cell, being prominent examples of moonlighting proteins. Chaperonins are highly conserved molecular chaperones that fold other proteins into their native conformation allowing them to carry out essential functions in the cell. Activities alternative to folding have been reported for the chaperonin (Cpn) 60 protein. Preservation of various alternative functions in one protein conflicts with the optimization of each of the functions. What evolutionary mechanisms have allowed the persistence of moonlighting proteins, and in particular the chaperonins, remains a mystery. In the present article, I argue that mechanisms that increase the resistance of phenotypes to genetic and environmental perturbations enable the persistence of a reservoir of genetic variants, each potentially codifying for a distinct function. Gene duplication is one such mechanism that has characterized the expansion and has been concomitant with the emergence of novel functions in these protein families. Indeed, Cpn60 performs a large list of folding-independent functions, including roles in the transmission of viruses from insects to plants and stimulation of the immune system, among others. In addition to the innovation promoted by gene duplication, I discuss that the Cpn60 protein comprises a hidden amino acid combinatorial code that may well be responsible for its ability to develop novel functions while maintaining an optimized folding ability. The present review points to a complex model of evolution of protein moonlighting.

AB  - Environmental pressures challenge the survivorship of wildlife, and adaptive ability is key to their success and establishment. However, it remains unclear how changes in environmental conditions affect the phenotypic plasticity of some species. Studies that consider the effect of the environment (e.g., climate changes) on species morphology are essential to better understand his potential resilience. Thus, Diptera species appear as an excellent model. Here we investigated the effect of environmental conditions on wing size and shape within and between one native and one invasive blowfly species populations, along an ecoregional gradient in Brazil. For native species, wing size was affected by almost all environmental variables, while wing shape was unaffected. For invasive species, humidity best explained both wing size and wing shape variation. Our results show a differentiation between populations for both species, but a transversal comparison reveals that invasive species do not seem to be affected in the same way as the native species by climatic variations in the field. Temperature and humidity are the most significant environmental variables associated with differences in wing size and shape for invasive species, indicating an elevated climate tolerance of this species, which may be associated with its invasive characteristics and adaptive potential. Thus, our findings shed light on the importance of assessing the individual and compound effect of environmental variation and biological invasion on the adaptation of native species, since it is expected to increase 3 degrees C with a 20% overall reduction in the amount of rainfall in the tropical region of Brazil by 2100.

Here, we characterised the total proteases and trypsin-like activities in the salivary glands of the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros (F.) and used in silico and biochemical approaches to determine the interactions between trypsin-like enzymes and the soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (SKTI). Additionally, we evaluated whether these enzyme activities were affected in individuals resistant to the actions of the insecticide imidacloprid. We used an originally field-collected strain to select individuals resistant to imidacloprid alone (ImiGoiasRes) or synergised with piperonyl butoxide (ImiPBORes). A laboratory-susceptible (ImiSusc) strain was also used to select piperonyl butoxide synergised imidacloprid-resistant (ImiPBOSel) individuals. Our results revealed that pH and temperature significantly affected the specific trypsin-like activities in imidacloprid-susceptible individuals. Significant alterations in the total protease activities were recorded for field- (ImiGoiasRes) and laboratory-selected imidacloprid-resistant individuals (ImiPBOSel and ImiPBORes). Our computational docking analysis demonstrated that the molecular interactions and the presence of the SKTI inhibitor (0.5 mg mL(-1)) could reduce up to 40% of the trypsin-like activities of imidacloprid-susceptible individuals. However, all imidacloprid-resistant strains exhibited significantly less trypsin-like activities and exhibited lower hydrolysing velocity (V-MAX) and affinity (K-M) rates, and the prior exposure to SKTI only synergised the imidacloprid toxicity for individuals of ImiFieldRes strain. Collectively, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, insecticide resistance detrimentally affected the activities of proteolytic enzymes in phytosuccivorous stink bug pests.

AB  - Bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudovibrio have been frequently found in association with a wide variety of marine eukaryotic invertebrate hosts, indicative of their versatile and symbiotic lifestyle. A recent comparison of the sponge-associated Pseudovibrio genomes has shed light on the mechanisms influencing a successful symbiotic association with sponges. In contrast, the genomic architecture of Pseudovibrio bacteria associated with other marine hosts has received less attention. Here, we performed genus-wide comparative analyses of 18 Pseudovibrio isolated from sponges, coral, tunicates, flatworm, and sea-water. The analyses revealed a certain degree of commonality among the majority of sponge- and coral-associated bacteria. Isolates from other marine invertebrate host, tunicates, exhibited a genetic repertoire for cold adaptation and specific metabolic abilities including mucin degradation in the Antarctic tunicate-associated bacterium Pseudovibrio sp. Tun.PHSC04_5.14. Reductive genome evolution was simultaneously detected in the flatworm-associated bacteria and the sponge-associated bacterium P. axinellae AD2, through the loss of major secretion systems (type IIINI) and virulence/symbioses factors such as proteins involved in adhesion and attachment to the host. Our study also unraveled the presence of a CRISPR-Cas system in P. stylochi UST20140214-052 a flatworm-associated bacterium possibly suggesting the role of CRISPR-based adaptive immune system against the invading virus particles. Detection of mobile elements and genomic islands (GIs) in all bacterial members highlighted the role of horizontal gene transfer for the acquisition of novel genetic features, likely enhancing the bacterial ecological fitness. These findings are insightful to understand the role of genome diversity in Pseudovibrio as an evolutionary strategy to increase their colonizing success across a wide range of marine eukaryotic hosts.

AB  - Spatial adaptations that maximize a species' fitness in its local environment, particularly in the form of countergradient variation (CnGV = genotypic influences counteract environmental effects on trait variation) and cogradient variation (CoGV = genotypic influences accentuate environmental plasticity), have been documented in many estuarine and anadromous fishes. However, their prevalence in more oceanic fishes, where extensive gene flow and reduced environmental selection may preclude local adaptation, remains unclear. If oceanic species lack genetic structure, they may be limited in their ability to adapt to global climate change. We examined the potential for adaptation in oceanic fishes by testing whether an oceanic silverside, the California grunion Leuresthes tenuis, displays CnGV in growth capacity and CoGV in vertebral number across a latitudinal gradient as found in estuarine silversides. Common garden experiments revealed that reaction norms for growth in response to temperature differed little among 3 L. tenuis populations from different latitudes. Growth rates of wild adult L. tenuis measured from scale analysis suggested that growth may be slightly faster at more southern latitudes, likely due to environmental variation. Mean vertebral number in wild L. tenuis, determined from radiographs, were nearly identical for all populations. Overall, our results did not provide evidence for spatial adaptations in these traits of L. tenuis, in contrast to the strong patterns of latitudinal trait adaptation in other, more estuarine silversides. This study provides support for the finding that higher gene flow levels and weaker environmental selection pressures of oceanic species limit local adaptation.

AB  - It has been proposed that population genetic structure at the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) locus in the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides (L.) could be due to selection by ice scour acting through variation in larval settlement behavior. Homogeneity of Mpi allele frequencies for barnacles within the Gulf of St. Lawrence could be maintained by a combination of selection and limited gene flow from populations of S. balanoides on the Atlantic coast of Canada south of the Cabot Strait. We sampled S. balanoides from 19 sites in Greenland and Baffin Island, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada, in order to test these hypotheses. Presumptive genetic variation at 2 enzyme loci, Mpi and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi), was quantified by isoelectric focusing. All populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and no linkage disequilibrium between loci was observed. We found significant spatial variation in allele frequencies at both loci. In particular, S. balanoides populations within the Gulf of St. Lawrence were not genetically homogeneous at either locus. A discontinuity in allele frequencies at both the Gpi and Mpi loci occurred in the vicinity of the Miramichi estuary, in the southern Gulf. Comparisons of allele frequencies between barnacle recruits and adults suggested this population structure may have resulted from selection, in the case of Mpi, possibly associated with environmental temperature. Selection by ice scour does not appear to affect spatial variation in allele frequencies in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

AB  - The ability of Listeria monocytogenes to grow at refrigeration temperatures is critical for transmission of this foodborne pathogen. We evaluated the contributions of different transcriptional regulators and two-component regulatory systems to L monocytogenes cold adaptation and cold growth. L. monocytogenes parent strain 10403S and selected isogenic null mutants in genes encoding four alternative sigma factors (sigB, sigH, sigC, and sigL), two regulators of sigma(B) (rsbT and rsbV), two negative regulators (ctsR and hrcA), and 15 two-component response regulators were grown in brain heart infusion broth at 4 degrees C with (i) a high-concentration starting inoculum (10(8) CFU/ml), (ii) a low-concentration starting inoculum (102 CFU/ml), and (iii) a high-concentration starting inoculum of cold-adapted cells. With a starting inoculum of 108 CFU/ml, null mutants in genes encoding selected alternative (T factors (Delta sigH, Delta sigC, and Delta sigL), a negative regulator (Delta ctsR), regulators of sigma(B) (Delta rsbT and Delta rsbV), and selected two-component response regulators (Delta lisR, Delta lmo,1172, and Delta lmo]060) had significantly reduced growth (P < 0.05) compared with the parent strain after 12 days at 4 degrees C. The growth defect for Delta sigL was limited and was not confirmed by optical density (OD600) measurement data. With a starting inoculum of 102 CFU/ml and after monitoring growth at 4 degrees C over 84 days, only the Delta ctsR strain had a consistent but limited growth defect; the other mutant strains had either no growth defects or limited growth defects apparent at only one or two of the nine sampling points evaluated during the 84-day growth period (Delta sigB, Delta sigC, and Delta lmo1172). With a 10(8) CFU/ml starting inoculum of cold-adapted cells, none of the mutant strains that had a growth defect when inoculation was performed with cells pregrown at 37 degrees C had reduced growth as compared with the parent strain after 12 days at 4 degrees C, suggesting a specific defect in the ability of these mutant strains to adapt to 4 degrees C after growth at 37 degrees C. Our data indicate (i) selected or factors and two-component regulators may contribute to cold adaptation even though two-component regulatory systems, alternative or factors, and the negative regulators CtsR and HrcA appear to have limited contributions to L. monocytogenes growth at 4 degrees C in rich media, and (ii) inoculum concentration and pregrowth conditions affect the L. monocytogenes cold-growth phenotype.

AB  - Sunflower breeders, working for a model of sunflower, must know the main characteristics of the environment for which they are developing the hybrids, starting from soil type, potential growing season length, mean, minimum and maximum temperatures (per month) and the amount and distribution of rainfall, during the year.
   The creation of hybrids with high potential of productivity, must take into consideration the high adaptive potential to the ecological environment.
   We studied a set of 18 sunflower hybrids, in two years (2018 and 2109), in four locations, situated in different areas of Romania: Cogealac (south Romania), Simleu Silvaniei (western Romania), Negresti (eastern Romania) and Mircea Voda (south-eastern Romania). The hybrids were cultivated in two randomized replications.
   Comparing the two years, 2018 and 2019, regarding the air temperature and the amount of rainfall, in sunflower vegetation period, year 2018 was generally dryer, compared with 2019.
   Results showed that the seed yield for the eighteen hybrids was different by year and by location. In 2018 the difference between locations was not so high compared with 2019. The highest seed yield in 2019 was obtained by almost all hybrids, in two locations (Negresti and Mircea Voda). The lowest seed yield was obtained by all hybrids in Cogealac location, due to drought and also to the high infestation with broomrape parasite.

AB  - Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is an important turfgrass species used for lawns, sports fields, and recreational areas. Insufficient tolerance to subfreezing temperatures compromises its persistence in northern climates. A recurrent selection method, entirely performed indoors, was applied to two initial genetic backgrounds to generate populations putatively more tolerant to freezing (TF populations). The objective of the present study was to assess physiological and molecular responses after four cycles of selection (TF1-TF4). Freezing tolerance and cold-induced metabolites were monitored in plants hardened to natural variations in temperatures in fall and winter in an unheated greenhouse. Recurrent selection improved freezing tolerance expressed as the lethal temperature for 50% of the plants (LT50) and the vigor of regrowth after freezing. Significant changes in the levels of total and individual cold-induced carbohydrates (fructans) and amino acids (glutamine and proline) in crowns of hardened plants occurred in response to selection. Both groups of metabolites showed an opposite response to selection. The observation of DNA polymorphisms and progressive genetic differentiation between the initial populations and advanced cycles of selection suggests an impact of selection on allelic composition. Recurrent selection had a positive impact on freezing tolerance of perennial ryegrass through modifications in the molecular and genetic makeup of the populations.

AB  - Species distributed across climatic gradients will typically experience spatial variation in selection, but gene flow can prevent such selection from causing population genetic differentiation and local adaptation. Here, we studied genomic variation of 415 individuals across 34 populations of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) in central Italy. This species is highly abundant throughout this region and populations belong to a single genetic lineage, yet there is extensive phenotypic variation across climatic regimes. We used redundancy analysis to, first, quantify the effect of climate and geography on population genomic variation in this region and, second, to test if climate consistently sorts specific alleles across the landscape. Climate explained 5% of the population genomic variation across the landscape, about half of which was collinear with geography. Linear models and redundancy analyses identified loci that were significantly differentiated across climatic regimes. These loci were distributed across the genome and physically associated with genes putatively involved in thermal tolerance, regulation of temperature-dependent metabolism and reproductive activity, and body colouration. Together, these findings suggest that climate can exercise sufficient selection in lizards to promote genetic differentiation across the landscape in spite of high gene flow.

AB  - Modern humans have occupied almost all possible environments globally since exiting Africa about 100,000 years ago. Both behavioral and biological adaptations have contributed to their success in surviving the rigors of climatic extremes, including cold, strong ultraviolet radiation, and high altitude. Among these environmental stresses, high-altitude hypoxia is the only condition in which traditional technology is incapable of mediating its effects. Inhabiting at >3,000-m high plateau, the Tibetan population provides a widely studied example of high-altitude adaptation. Yet, the genetic mechanisms underpinning long-term survival in this environmental extreme remain unknown. We performed an analysis of genome-wide sequence variations in Tibetans. In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1. For these two genes, Tibetans show unusually high divergence from the non-Tibetan lowlanders (Han Chinese and Japanese) and possess high frequencies of many linked sequence variations as reflected by the Tibetan-specific haplotypes. Further analysis in seven Tibetan populations (1,334 individuals) indicates the prevalence of selective sweep across the Himalayan region. The observed indicators of natural selection on EPAS1 and EGLN1 suggest that during the long-term occupation of high-altitude areas, the functional sequence variations for acquiring biological adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia have been enriched in Tibetan populations.

AB  - Subtropical forests face pressure from both rapidly changing climate and increasing harvest activity in southern China. However, the interactive effects of various spatial processes on forests are not well known. The objective of the present study was to answer the question of how forest aboveground biomass (AGB) changes under alternative climate change and harvesting scenarios and to determine whether there will be a tipping point for forest AGB before 2300. Our simulation results show that, although total forest AGB did not reach a tipping point before 2300 under possible climate change and harvesting scenarios, the slope of the total forest AGB showed a decreasing trend around 2100 and 2200. Moderate climate warming was conducive to AGB accumulation, except for in the high emissions Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) scenario. Our results also indicate that timber harvesting is adaptable to the accumulation of biomass under climate change scenarios. Harvesting intensity was a key variable affecting forest AGB more than harvesting frequency. Our findings will help develop more sustainable forest management strategies that can adapt to potential climate change scenarios, as well as determining the effectiveness of implementing alternative forest harvesting policies.

AB  - Mutation breeding is one of the breeding methods used successfully in durum wheat for selecting lines with increased agronomic values. This study was carried out to determine gamma rays effect and interaction between gamma-rays and the genotype of treated variety of winter wheat in mutations induction. We used physical mutagens: gamma-rays in doses 100, 150, 200, 250 Gy.
   Seeds of eight winter wheat varieties were exposed with gamma-rays. Insensitive and most sensitive for mutagen actions varieties have been developed. Thirty-six different types mutated traits were observed. Among them there were seven valuable for breeding process. Mutations rate was waved from 0,4 to 30 %.
   Medium dose of gamma rays (100 Gy) is recommended for winter wheat mutation breeding and high dose (200 Gy) for obtaining genetic-value mutants (parent components for crossbreeding with some valuable traits like as semi-dwarf, early-heading and other). For high-productivity lines were identified. Positive desirable mutants will be selected and be incorporated in future breeding programs.
   We have shown that varieties obtained by gamma radiation are less sensitive to this mutagen. Their re-exposure is inappropriate by same mutagen. However, the varieties which obtained by field hybridization or treatment by mutagens of another nature (chemical agents, temperature) indicate a higher level of mutation rate and variability of traits.

AB  - We describe the use of emulsion liquid membrane technology to perform chiral separations on low molecular weight species. We have reviewed liquid membrane technology in the context of existing process scale chiral separations. We illustrate the potential of this new technique by presenting our results on the selective extraction of phenylalanine enantiomers, using copper(II) N-decyl-(L) -hydroxyproline as a chiral selector in an emulsion liquid membrane configuration. This is compared with an analogous batch solvent extraction system. Initial batch enantiomeric excesses of greater than 40% were observed with the emulsion liquid membrane system compared with around 25% for the solvent extraction system. It was also noted that the system is not limited by the equilibrium capacity constraints of the solvent extraction system. We have shown that kinetic chiral liquid membrane technology offers high productivity and flexibility compared with analogous process scale chiral technologies. Recent transfer of highly specific chiral reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic chemistries have shown that ''one-stop'' enantiomeric excesses of commercial interest (>95%) are achievable using kinetic chiral liquid membrane systems. Solvent and temperature selection strategies also have been outlined as means of increasing the enantioselectivity of existing liquid membrane extraction chemistries. Chirality 9:261-267, 1997.

AB  - The incorporation of additives into polymers like bisphenol A polysulfone (PSF) can provide an attractive alternative for modifying their permselective properties for gas separation, provided the additive is appropriately selected. In this work, three series of additives based on naphthalene, bisphenol A, and fluorene structures were incorporated into PSF and their effect on gas transport properties was measured. The results show that these additives increase selectivity and reduce permeability of PSF when incorporated at low concentrations. The largest increases in selectivity for the gas pairs He/CH4, H-2/CH4, and O-2/N-2 are caused by those additives that cause the largest reductions in the glass transition temperature and fractional free volume, and typically, they are made up of planar molecules containing polar or small asymmetric protuberances. The productivity-selectivity balance response of the modified PSF membranes reveals that the naphthalene-based additives containing asymmetric groups of atoms lead to membranes with higher selectivity and with only small losses in permeability relative to the unmodified PSF membranes. The addition of 20 wt % of the glassy additive Kenflex A into PSF causes a fourfold increase in the selectivity of PSF to He/CH, at the expense of a 37% reduction in the permeability of helium.

CP  - National Conference on Ironmaking Resources and Reserves Estimation
AB  - Laboratory scale determination of metallurgical characteristics of iron ores plays a major role in the evaluation of new orebodies, flowsheet development, plant design, process optimisation and quality, control.
   An important single factor affecting the productivity and efficiency of a blast furnace and DRI operation is the quality of the feedstocks charged in furnace.
   It has been the endeavour in the past few decades to evolve tests, in the light of the understanding of the physical chemistry of the blast furnace process, to assess the metallurgical characteristics of iron ores. It has been realised that it is virtually impossible to simulate conditions inside the blast furnace in evolving these tests. Laboratory tests, however have been devised by the International Standards Organization (ISO) to investigate, identity, and quantify, on a relative basis, an increasing number of burden properties to assess the extent of suitability of feedstocks for the blast furnace.
   This paper describes the laboratory test methods used for the resource evaluation and relative pre-determination of the criteria where the effects of temperature, gas composition and physical load in the blast furnace are duly considered. The correlation between the burden material tests and blast furnace performance is shown. Possible test methods for the direct reduction process plant are also presented and discussed.

AB  - Overdominance is often invoked to account for the extensive polymorphisms found in natural populations of organisms; overcompensation, however, may be equally or more important. Overcompensation occurs when limiting resources are better exploited by a genetically mixed than by a uniform population, and is often causally related to frequency-dependent selection. We have designed experiments to test whether overcompensation occurs in Drosophila melanogaster, using the Sod locus as a marker. Tests are made at each of two densities and two temperatures for cultures with desired genetic compositions. Both temperature and density have statistically significant effects on the per-female productivity of the cultures. More important, there are strong effects due to overcompensation. Cultures that are more polymorphic are also more productive than less polymorphic ones even when the level of individual heterozygosity is the same in all. There is also overdominance for the Sod locus: the heterozygotes are more productive than either homozygote at every temperature and density, and the differences are statistically significant in several cases. These results corroborate previous studies showing that overdominance may contribute to the maintenance of the Sod polymorphisms. Moreover, our results indicate that the significance of overcompensation as a mechanism to account for polymorphism in natural populations deserves further investigation.

AB  - Temperature affects almost all aspects of the fish life. To cope with low temperature, fish have evolved the ability of cold acclimation for survival. However, intracellular signaling events underlying cold acclimation in fish remain largely unknown. Here, the formation of cold acclimation in zebrafish embryonic fibroblasts (ZF4) is monitored and the phosphorylation events during the process are investigated through a large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic approach. In total, 11 474 phosphorylation sites are identified on 4066 proteins and quantified 5772 phosphosites on 2519 proteins. Serine, threonine, and tyrosine (Ser/Thr/Tyr) phosphorylation accounted for 85.5%, 13.3%, and 1.2% of total phosphosites, respectively. Among all phosphosites, 702 phosphosites on 510 proteins show differential regulation during cold acclimation of ZF4 cells. These phosphosites are divided into six clusters according to their dynamic changes during cold exposure. Kinase-substrate prediction reveals that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) among the kinase groups is predominantly responsible for phosphorylation of these phosphosites. The differentially regulated phosphoproteins are functionally associated with various cellular processes such as regulation of actin cytoskeleton and MAPK signaling pathway. These data enrich the database of protein phosphorylation sites in zebrafish and provide key clues for the elucidation of intracellular signaling networks during cold acclimation of fish.

AB  - As a key input parameter in laboratory-scale numerical simulations of the hydrate dissociation process, effective and intrinsic permeability is among the most important factors controlling the hydrate dissociation dynamics and the productivity of hydrate-bearing porous media. A wide variety of permeability models have been developed to capture the effective permeability variations due to hydrate dissociation. The choice of the appropriate application-orientated permeability model is predominantly empirically based without reliable criteria. In this paper, we summarize the classical and popular permeability models associated with hydrate dissociation. Based on systematic numerical sensitivity analysis of modeling outputs (e.g., gas production rate, cumulative gas production volume, hydrate dissociation front characteristics, temperature, and pressure evolution) to alternative permeability model types and permeability model parameters, we demonstrate that there exists an equivalency and replaceability relationship between different permeability models in producing consistent modeling outputs. According to their equivalency and replaceability, various permeability models can be correlated to the frequently used Masuda model, which accordingly largely simplifies the selection of permeability models. This study also suggests the most representative parameter values for the Masuda model at low, medium, and high intrinsic permeabilities, which offers an efficient way to reduce uncertainties in modeling input.

CP  - 7th World Soybean Research Conference/6th International Soybean Processing and Utilization Conference/3rd Brazilian Soybean Congress
AB  - Soybean occupies a prominent position in the Brazilian economy, which justifies the search for new information to optimize its cultivation and reduce the risks of damage. The expression of the maximum yield of a plant is determined mainly for its genetic characteristics and the adaptation level to the predominant environmental conditions, factors that can also be affected by human management. Among the factors involved in crop production, climate appears to be the most difficult to control and the factor with the greatest impact on maximum yields. The principal climatic factors determining maximum yield are temperature, solar radiation and water, although others such as wind, photoperiod and atmospheric humidity can also play a role. Of the climatic elements, the most restrictive is water. The variability of water availability during the crop growth season is the main limitation to the expression of maximum soybean yield potential. The adoption of appropriate crop management practices can help minimize the negative effects of water shortage grain yields and farm revenue. However, any intervention in the production system must strive to obtain a optimum economical returns, based on sound technical knowledge. In the future, much of the potential increases in soybean yields will probably be related to the tolerance of new varieties to short drought periods. The adoption of Management practices, that increases water storage and/or plat available water in the soil, will also contribute greatly to, improve soybean productivity.

AB  - The low frequency depolarized Raman spectra of 100 mg/ml aqueous solutions of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) have been collected in the 25-85 degrees C range. Short and long exposures to high temperatures have been used to modulate the competition between the thermally induced reversible and irreversible denaturation processes. A peculiar temperature evolution of spectra is evidenced under prolonged exposure of the protein solution at temperatures higher than 65 degrees C. This result is connected to the self-assembling of polypeptide chains and testifies the sensitivity of the technique to the properties of both protein molecule and its surrounding. Solvent free spectra have been obtained after subtraction of elastic and solvent components and assigned to a genuine vibrational contribution of hydrated HEWL. A straight similarity is observed between the solvent-free THz Raman feature and the vibrational density of states as obtained by molecular dynamics simulations; according to this, we verify the relation between this spectroscopic observable and the effective protein volume, and distinguish the properties of this latter respect to those of the hydration shell in the pre-melting region.

AB  - Phytase production by Bacillus sp. (HCYL03) isolated from soil was investigated by solid-state fermentation (SSF) using wheat bran as substrate. After screening, morphological and molecular identification, Bacillus sp. (HCYL03) was selected for experiments due to high phytase activity. The SSF conditions were optimized by using one-variable-at-a-time strategy. A Box-Behnken design was employed to investigate the optimization of the most significant variables affecting the enzyme production. Maximum enzymes production was observed after 72 hrs with inoculums 2mL at 45 degrees C and pH 5. Maximum partial purification was obtained with 60% ammonium sulfate. Protein contents in crude extract and partially purified enzyme were found to be 9.58 and 3.95 mg/mL, respectively. Optimum temperature and pH of the partially purified phytase after characterization were found to be 45 degrees C and 5, respectively. The study of different metal ions sources revealed that Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions registered the highest enzyme productivity) but Zn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Mn(2+)and Fe2+ ions exhibited inhibitory effect on phytase activity. Briefly, the Bacillus sp. (HCYL03) production of phytase utilizing the low-cost agro-residue wheat bran as substrate is an innovative and cheap way for the production of this important enzyme and opens a new way for researchers to investigate this dome.

AB  - Lines of the fly Drosophila melanogaster were selected for increased knockdown resistance to heat (39 degrees C) in a long tube. One set of lines was selected following prior heat hardening (1 h at 37 degrees C) and another without hardening, Each set consisted of three replicate selection lines and three unselected controls, Lines were tested for correlated responses to selection, in order to define the nature of knockdown resistance, Selection had a Large effect on knockdown resistance, but selected lines did not differ from controls for knockdown time in small vials, survival, or recovery time following exposure to heat, Selection with and without hardening influenced the hardening response in the long tube, but not in small vial assays of resistance, The hardened selection lines had decreased resistance to ethanol and a reduced dry weight, whereas the non-hardened lines did not show these changes, The same correlated responses were also evident in two generation experiments on unselected flies, Both sets of lines showed a reduction in activity when tested at 37 degrees C, but not at 25 degrees C, These results indicate that different measures of heat resistance are surprisingly unrelated, and suggest that subtle features of the selective environment influence responses and correlated responses to selection.

AB  - Labour productivity influenced by work-in-process, labour skills, machineries and working environment. This study identified factors affecting the labour during sorting and grading of cinnamon. Five factors used as independent variables, namely working motivation (X1), working environment (X2), salary (X3), age (X4) and workload (X5). Factors then correlated with labour performance (Y) as dependent variable. Samples were randomly selected from respondents, of the Rasdi Fo & Co. Personal characterization calculated from employee's years of service. Results then grouped according to the labour experienced, and statistical analyses were set according to F test, t test, power function, and influence factors. These methods used to analyse the working environment, in correlation to the employee performance, room temperature, humidity, lighting, and noise levels. From the results, X2, X3, X4 and X5 had no significant effect, while Y can be described as a function of 2,06(X1(0.326))(X2(0.016))(X3(0.170))(X4(0.479))(X5(-0.172)). Maximum room temperature recorded at 38.4 degrees C, while minimum temperature recorded at 29.3 degrees C, lower than the ideal level. Maximum and minimum humidity (RH) was 91.3 % and 59.2 %, respectively. The RH in working environment exceed normal level. The noise level recorded between 48.8 dBA and 78.4 dBA, which classified as normal without ear protection.

AB  - The analysis of this study focused on the tea growing areas of Northeast India to provide predictions for future climate scenarios and its impact on tea production by 2050. The applied methodology involves a combination of current climate data with future climate change predictions from different models for 2050 as derived by WorldClim and IPCC4 (CIAT recommended). The results showed the possibility of an increase in average temperature by 2 degrees C in 2050, while not much variation is observed in the rainfall pattern. A change in tea production period is also expected by 2050 making tea planters look for alternative crops as an adaptive measure to keep the industry on its feet. With such expected impacts on tea production, the planters would need to make changes in their management practices to adapt to the evolving conditions and environment. In this study, the climate data were used as input to DIVA GIS Model. Monthly climate data were fed into Cranfield University Plantation Productivity Analysis for Tea Model (CUPPA Tea Model) to simulate observed and predicted yields. The study further shows that the overall climate will become less seasonal in terms of variation through the years followed by expected variations in monthly precipitation during the peak production months.

AB  - In view of the opportunities for new pipelines and a shortage of skilled labour, pipeline construction companies are exploring the use of new, more efficient, high-productivity welding procedures. However, in welding high strength steels, it is essential that the high strength and toughness be maintained in both the girth weld metal and the associated heat affected zone (HAZ) regions, particularly in strain-based designs in which significant longitudinal strains are anticipated. The measured toughness of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) is affected by base metal chemistry, welding procedure and the accuracy of locating the pre-test machined notch at the targeted zone, among other factors. In this study, the welding of X80 (Grade 550) linepipe by single torch, dual torch and tandem gas metal arc welding (GMAW) techniques has been examined. Both Charpy and CTOD testing have been employed to assess the toughness of the HAZ. It will also be demonstrated, that the measured CTOD value is dependent on the percentage sampled of the near-fusion line HAZ. Proper selection of the welding procedure to maintain a relatively fine grain size can significantly enhance the measured CTOD values.

AB  - While Population III (Pop III) stars are typically thought to be massive, pathways towards lower mass Pop III stars may exist when the cooling of the gas is particularly enhanced. A possible route is enhanced HD cooling during the merging of dark-matter haloes. The mergers can lead to a high ionization degree catalysing the formation of HD molecules and may cool the gas down to the cosmic microwave background temperature. In this paper, we investigate the merging of mini-haloes with masses of a few 10(5) M-aS (TM) and explore the feasibility of this scenario. We have performed three-dimensional cosmological hydrodynamics calculations with the enzo code, solving the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas by employing the astrochemistry package krome. Our results show that the HD abundance is increased by two orders of magnitude compared to the no-merging case and the halo cools down to similar to 60 K triggering fragmentation. Based on Jeans estimates, the expected stellar masses are about 10 M-aS (TM). Our findings show that the merging scenario is a potential pathway for the formation of low-mass stars.

AB  - Multi-well patterns and complex structural wells can enlarge the contact area between the wellbore and natural gas hydrate (NGH) to improve productivity significantly, but the construction cost of drilling is still too high. The previous study has proposed a self-entry exploitation device (SEED) with an enlarged device diameter, allowing more NGHs to dissociate simultaneously. While for conventional wellbore, a large-diameter casing may be applied in NGH development to enlarge the wellbore diameter of the production section. This work continued to study the influences of enlarged device/wellbore diameter on gas production characteristics, temperature-pressure evolutions, and the dissociation front movement pattern. The sensitivity analysis was also carried out by various reservoir and depressurization parameters under different wellbore diameters. Results show that the enlarged wellbore diameter can enlarge the drainage area and increase the dissociation efficiency. The tem-perature and pressure around the wellbore remain relatively stable, meeting the conditions for long-term pro-duction. Also, the dissociation front moves farther away faster as the wellbore diameter enlarges, accelerating NGH dissociation at distant wells. Finally, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the enlarged wellbore diameter enhances gas production significantly in unfavorable production parameters: poor production pressure, low permeability, low NGH saturation, and narrow reservoir thickness.

AB  - Fusel oil was used as a source of isoamyl alcohol in the synthesis of biolubricant by esterification with oleic acid catalyzed by different sources of lipase immobilized on poly(styrene/divinylbenzene) copolymer resin. In preliminary tests, Rhizopus oryzae lipase showed satisfactory performance, providing high molar conversion of the starting materials (>90% in 24 h of reaction), and was selected for subsequent experiments. The optimal conditions for isoamyl oleate production by immobilized R. oryzae lipase were 1:1.5 ratio of fusel oil to oleic acid and reaction temperature of 45 degrees C. Continuous runs were carried out in a two-stage packed-bed reactor coupled to a water extraction column filled with molecular sieves. Each reactor stage was loaded with 2.6 g of immobilized lipase and then fed with fusel oil and oleic acid at a 1:1.5 molar ratio in the presence of isooctane. The performance of the proposed system was tested at a space time of 10.2 h, resulting in a mean ester productivity of 292.20 +/- 18.46 mu mol g-1 min-1 and biocatalyst half-life of 179.6 h. The properties of purified samples were in accordance with standard requirements for biolubricants.

AB  - Monochamus alternatus, the dominant vector of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Aphelenchida: Aphelenchoididae), has caused immense damage to forest resources. In China, this vector was native to the southern regions but has spread northward recently. To adapt to more challenging environments in the northern winter, M. alternatus has evolved an intricate strategy for overwintering, which remains largely unknown. Herein, we compared the transcriptome data of the overwintering and non-overwintering larvae of M. alternatus larvae to investigate the molecular mechanisms in overwintering. A total of 53.10 GB clean bases and 28, 245 unigenes were obtained by RNA-seq. Analysis of 2597 upregulated and 2429 downregulated unigenes, as well as the enrichment of DEGs showed that many genes and pathways were jointly involved in the overwintering period. Besides, the accuracy of the RNA-seq data was tested by using qPCR experiment involving 13 selected genes. The results revealed that the overwintering process relied largely on the energy allocation trade-off. Specifically, overwintering M. alternatus inhibited energy-intensive activities, such as growth and molting, detoxification, and trehalose transport, and the reserved energy was skewed towards the synthesis of antifreeze compounds and immune response to cope with the deleterious effects of winter.

AB  - Steelmaking has been experiencing continuous challenges and advances concerning process methods and control models. Integrated steelmaking begins with the hot metal, a crude liquid iron that is produced in the blast furnace (BF). The hot metal is then pre-treated and transferred to the basic lined oxygen furnace (BOF) for refining, experiencing a non-easily predictable temperature drop along the BF-BOF route. Hot metal temperature forecasting at the BOF is critical for the environment, productivity, and cost. An improved multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model is proposed for hot metal temperature forecasting. Selected process variables and past temperature measurements are used as predictors. A moving window approach for the training dataset is chosen to avoid the need for periodic re-tuning of the model. There is no precedent for the application of MARS techniques to BOF steelmaking and a comparable temperature forecasting model of the BF-BOF interface has not been published yet. The model was trained, tested, and validated using a plant process dataset with 12,195 registers, covering one production year. The mean absolute error of predictions is 11.2 degrees C, which significantly improves those of previous modelling attempts. Moreover, model training and prediction are fast enough for a reliable on-line process control.

AB  - Polymer membranes have been explored for the analysis of ions that do not require plasticizers and with photo-curable properties, This work was focused on investigating the viability of the methacrylic-acrylic copolymers as new self-plasticizing membrane matrixes for ion-selective electrodes or other ion-sensor applications, Copolymers with glass transition temperatures ranging from -20 to -44 degrees C could be prepared without added plasticizer and were found to be functional as ion-selective membranes, Both free-radical solution polymerization and photopolymerization could be used, and "self-plasticizing" behavior of copolymers was observed with a high alkylacrylate (R = C-4) content. This was found to be compatible with most commercially available ionophores, and sensors for potassium, sodium, calcium and pH were fabricated entirely by photocure procedures; single-step procedures for the immobilization of benzo-15-crown-5 ionophore on these self-plasticizing copolymer matrixes were also developed. Even though the ionophore was immobilized, potentiometric studies revealed that the ionophore remained functional, and thus, these copolymers have the advantage of suffering neither leaching of ionophore nor plasticizers. All these sensors exhibited a Nernstian or near Nernstian response with selectivity comparable to plasticized PVG membranes or other plasticized and photocurable polymer membranes. The long-term response of the potassium sensor with immobilized ionophore and the sodium sensor showed little deterioration for as long as one month and three months, respectively, under continuous use.

AB  - 4',5'-Diiodofluorescein dextran has been synthesized by iodination of fluorescein dextran and it was used as a sensitizer in photodynamic killing of amoebae of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Amoebae from axenic strain AX2 incubated in the presence of 4',5'-diiodofluorescein dextran efficiently internalized the molecule by fluid-phase pinocytosis. Subsequently, illumination of cells showed dose- and time-dependent loss of viability. The tertiary amine, 2,4-diaza[2,2,2]bicyclooctane, significantly decreased phototoxicity, whereas the presence of D2O increased phototoxicity. These effects were fully consistent with a role for excited-state singlet oxygen generated inside the endosomal compartments in the mechanism of photoinjury. A strategy was developed to enrich for temperature-sensitive Dictyostelium endocytosis mutants in a nitrosoguanidine mutagenized population. Incubation with 4',5'-diiodofluorescein dextran at 27-degrees-C to load endosomal compartments was followed by light treatment to kill parent-type cells selectively. In contrast, mutants unable to internalize the fluid-phase marker would survive the treatment. Six temperature-sensitive clones were selected that grew normally at 21-degrees-C but did not grow at 27-degrees-C. They all showed markedly decreased fluid-phase pinocytosis capacity at nonpermissive temperature as compared to their activity at 21-degrees-C. These mutant strains should be useful in studies designed to characterize endocytosis mechanisms in Dictyostelium.

AB  - Total hip replacement (THR) that is widely used today is the cemented type, which its application will lead to aseptic loosening. To avoid the occurrence of aseptic loosening, THR coated with hydroxyapatite (HA) is required because HA is osteoconductive which can stimulate the growth of osteoblasts. This study aims to determine the optimum sinter temperature which produce HA coating suitable as implant material. To achieve these objectives, the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) conducted coating method at concentrations of HA 1,0M, voltage of 100V for 30 minutes and then sintered at temperatures are 550 degrees C, 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C respectively detention for 10 minutes. The results showed that the treatment of sintering after the coating process through the EPD method affect the characteristics of the layer thus formed. Sintering process affects the crystallinity of the HA layer. The higher the sintering temperature the higher its crystallinity. The higher the crystallinity the stronger the HA layer attached to the substrate cobalt alloy. Based on this research, the selected sintering temperature was 900 degrees C for 10 minutes which produced a layer of HA with the best characteristics that meet the standard of implant prosthesis, the crystallinity of 89.4%, thick layer of 70.80 +/- 4.18 mu m, adhesion strength of 21.87 +/- 0.23 MPa, the corrosion rate of 0.025 mpy and 70.3% cell viability.

AB  - Initial stage of oxynitridation process of Si substrate is of crucial importance in fabricating the ultrathin gate dielectric layer of high quality in advanced MOSFET devices. The oxynitridation reaction on a relaxed Si(001) surface is investigated via reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A total of 1120 events of a single nitric oxide (NO) molecule reaction at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 K are statistically analyzed. The observed reaction kinetics are consistent with the previous experimental or calculation results, which show the viability of the reactive MD technique to study the NO dissociation reaction on Si. We suggest the reaction pathway for NO dissociation that is characterized by the inter-dimer bridge of a NO molecule as the intermediate state prior to NO dissociation. Although the energy of the inter-dimer bridge is higher than that of the intra-dimer one, our suggestion is supported by the ab initio nudged elastic band calculations showing that the energy barrier for the inter-dimer bridge formation is much lower. The growth mechanism of an ultrathin Si oxynitride layer is also investigated via consecutive NO reactions simulation. The simulation reveals the mechanism of self-limiting reaction at low temperature and the time evolution of the depth profile of N and O atoms depending on the process temperature, which would guide to optimize the oxynitridation process condition.

AB  - P>1. Climate extremes are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude as a consequence of global warming.
   2. Managed permanent grasslands cover a large surface in Europe and contribute substantially to agricultural production. These managed plant communities are dominated by perennial clonal species. Their capacity to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions may be limited.
   3. We hypothesize that those plant populations that have already been exposed to conditions that are expected to occur due to future climate change, particularly conditions that would be 'extreme' in the target area, are able to cope better with these conditions.
   4. For a common-garden experiment we selected ecotypes (provenances as supported by accessions in seed banks) of important European grass species: Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca pratensis, Holcus lanatus and Alopecurus pratensis. Southern target locations of ecotypes (populations) were identified based on climate model projections for the local site in Northern Bavaria, Germany.
   5. In a controlled experiment, the plants were exposed to warming and extreme drought. Drought conditions(16-19 days, depending on the species) were imposed starting from the end of May in combination with and without an increase in the average temperature from May to September 2009 (+1.5 K compared with control; +2.5 K compared with ambient conditions outside of the experimental units).
   6. Ecotypes and drought manipulation had significant impacts on biomass production and tissue die-back. Significant interactions between ecotype and drought indicated a different drought tolerance of the ecotypes in some cases. The warming treatment yielded a less significant response. The local ecotype generally did not perform significantly worse than the presumably better-adapted southern ecotypes.
   7. Synthesis. The selection of ecotypes that are adapted to more extreme climatic conditions could be an option for maintaining future ecosystem functioning in temperate managed grasslands, as was indicated by the clear differences between ecotypes in our experiment. Based on our data, however, performance cannot be predicted from climatic origin. Therefore, we recommend enhancing the genetic variability within populations of species in general.

AB  - Climate change is projected to have negative implications for forest ecosystems and their dependent communities and industries. Adaptation studies of forestry practices have focused on maintaining the provisioning of ecosystem services; however, those practices may have implications for climate change mitigation as well by increasing biological sinks or reducing emissions. Assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change are therefore needed; however, they have not been done for the world's northern coniferous forests. Diversifying the forest by planting tree species more likely suited to a future climate is a potential adaptation strategy to increase resilience. The efficacy of this strategy to reduce the risks of climate change is uncertain, and other ecosystem services provided by the forest are also likely to be affected. We used a spatially explicit forest landscape modeling framework (LANDIS-II) to simulate the effects of planting a range of native tree species in colder areas than where they are currently planted in a managed temperate coniferous forest landscape in British Columbia, Canada. We investigated impacts on carbon pools, fluxes, tree species diversity, and harvest levels under different climate scenarios for 100 yr (2015-2115) and found that the capacity of our forest landscape to sequester carbon would largely depend on the precipitation rates in the future, rather than on temperature. We further found that, irrespective of the climate prediction model, current planting standards led to relatively low levels of resilience as indicated by carbon fluxes and stocks, net primary productivity (NPP), and species diversity. In contrast, planting a mix of alternative tree species was generally superior in increasing the resilience indicators: carbon stocks and fluxes, NPP, and tree species diversity, but not harvest rates. The second best novel planting regime involved adding Pinus contorta to the stocking standard in three ecoregions; however, that species is susceptible to a high number of insects and pathogens. We conclude that although the capacity of temperate coniferous forest landscapes to sequester carbon in the future is largely dependent on the precipitation regime, negative effects may be counteracted to some extent by increasing resilience through tree species diversity in forests.

AB  - This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks.
   Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged.
   Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit.

AB  - Distinctive aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon of thiolate-protected silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) has been revealed; these AgNCs have shown great potential for exploitation and utilization, but their applications as a bright luminogen in the chemosensing and bioimaging areas are greatly limited by their ultralow brightness in an aqueous solution. Herein, we report facile fabrication of hydrophobicity-guided self-assembled particles of silver nanoclusters with aggregation-induced emission. A hydrophobic ligand, thiosalicylic acid, was adopted to prepare AgNCs via a one-step way, and thiosalicylic acid-capped AgNCs showed significant AIE behavior. This AIE property of AgNCs enables them to selectively respond to multiple external stimuli such as solvent polarity, pH and environmental temperature. The hydrophobic nature of thiosalicylic acid as capping ligands of AgNCs drives a self-assembly process of AgNCs in an aqueous solution that results in the formation of self-assembled particles of AgNCs with bright luminescence. Sensitive detection of mercuric ion based on the highly luminescent AgNC AIE particles was achieved in terms of a strong quenching effect of mercuric ion. Cellular viability and luminescence imaging performance of the AgNC AIE particles on living cells were also evaluated for the first time.

AB  - Species relative importance distribution pattern changes of the ground-beetle assemblages were analyzed along elevation strata of Tenerife Island. The species importance estimates were expressed in terms of (i) activity density, as total catching of ground-beetle adults obtained with pitfall traps over each elevation stratum for one year, and (ii) biomass, as the total number of specimens caught multiplied by a mean dry weight in milligrams for the species. The K-dominance curves indicated moderate or insignificant perturbances, and patterns were sigmoidal following a truncated log-normal slightly skewed to the right, by using the Kolmogoroff-Smirnov test. The results also showed perceptible deviations from the truncated log-normal pattern (p < 0.05) mainly with biomass data. The disturbance through successional progress and perturbances by environmental warming and cooling could be assumed by deviations from the log-normal distribution among species. Thus, assuming that the assemblages of strata exhibited generally low similarity, the results will be arranged around the following four tracks: (1) the assemblage progressed toward highest abundances, dominance and a low-diversity equilibrium state in the cloud montane stratum, (2) the assemblage was subject to severe warming and dryness, lowest abundances with dominance in biomass, such that log-normal pattern was not shown in the basal stratum, (3) a non-equilibrium state in summer-xeric montane stratum maintained the highest diversity and an archetypical log-normal pattern was described for assemblage, and (4) assemblage stressed by cold semi-arid climate showed a certain tendency to log-normality and decrease in the diversity for the summit stratum. These results indicate that variation in ground-beetle assemblages by way of advanced evolutionary and adaptive trade-offs can best be understood as consequences of selective pressures by adverse climatic changes - perturbances - or seasonal climatic fluctuations and population dynamics - disturbances - according to the elevation stratum, which can generate different deviations from the log-normal pattern; these are more directly related to magnitude and frequency of local natural disturbance regimes and the productivity of the ecosystem.

AB  - During the last decade, the ecological theory of adaptive radiation, and its corollary "ecological speciation", has been a major research theme in evolutionary biology. Briefly, this theory states that speciation is mainly or largely the result of divergent selection, arising from niche differences between populations or incipient species. Reproductive isolation evolves either as a result of direct selection on mate preferences (e.g. reinforcement), or as a correlated response to divergent selection ("by-product speciation"). Although there are now many tentative examples of ecological speciation, I argue that ecology's role in speciation might have been overemphasised and that non-ecological and non-adaptive alternatives should be considered more seriously. Specifically, populations and species of many organisms often show strong evidence of niche conservatism, yet are often highly reproductively isolated from each other. This challenges niche-based ecological speciation and reveals partial decoupling between ecology and reproductive isolation. Furthermore, reproductive isolation might often evolve in allopatry before ecological differentiation between taxa or possibly through learning and antagonistic sexual interactions, either in allopatry or sympatry. Here I discuss recent theoretical and empirical work in this area, with some emphasis on odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) and suggest some future avenues of research. A main message from this paper is that the ecology of species differences is not the same as ecological speciation, just like the genetics of species differences does not equate to the genetics of speciation.

AB  - We develop a new deep potential-range correction (DPRc) machine learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are important in mechanistic studies of RNA- cleaving enzymes. Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2 semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6 angstrom. We further find that the model's initial training benefits from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure, so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.

AB  - We present a detailed mineralogical, petrological and melt inclusion study of unusually fresh, primitive olivine + clinopyroxene phyric Lower Pillow Lavas (LPL) found near Analiondas village in the northeastern part of the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus). Olivine phenocrysts in these primitive LPL show a wide compositional range (Fo(82-92)) and have higher CaO contents than those from the Upper Pillow Lavas (UPL). Cr-spinel inclusions in olivine are significantly less Cr-rich (Cr/Cr + Al = 28-67 mol%) compared to those from the UPL (Cr# = 70-80). These features reflect differences in melt compositions between primitive LPL and the UPL, namely higher CaO and Al2O3 and lower FeO* compared to the UPL at a given MgO. LPL parental melts (in equilibrium with Fo(92)) had similar to 10.5 wt% MgO and crystallization temperatures similar to 1210 degrees C, which are significantly lower than those previously published for the UPL (14-15 wt% MgO and similar to 1300 degrees C for Fo(92)). The fractionation path of LPL parental melts is also different from that of the UPL. It is characterized initially by olivine + clinopyroxene cotectic crystallization joined by plagioclase at similar to 9 wt% MgO, whereas UPL parental melts experienced a substantial interval of olivine-only crystallization. Primitive LPL melts were formed from a mantle source which was more fertile than that of tholeiites from well-developed intra-oceanicarcs, but broadly similar in its fertility to that of Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) and Back Are Basin Basalts (BABE). The higher degrees of melting during formation of the LPL primary melts compared to average MORE were caused by the presence of subduction-related components (H2O). Our new data on the LPL coupled with existing data for the UPL support the existing idea that the LPL and UPL primary melts originated from distinct mantle sources, which cannot be related by progressive source depletion. Temperature differences between these sources (similar to 150 degrees C), their position in the mantle (similar to 10 kbar for the colder LPL source vs 15-18 kbar for the UPL source), and temporal succession of Troodos volcanism, all cannot be reconciled in the framework of existing models of mantle wedge processes, thermal structure and evolution, if a single mantle source is invoked. Possible tectonic settings for the origin of the Troodos ophiolite (forearc regions of intra-oceanic island are, propagation of backarc spreading into are lithosphere) are discussed.

AB  - Background: Most research on Ocean Acidification (OA) has largely focused on the process of calcification and the physiological trade-offs employed by calcifying organisms to support the building of calcium carbonate structures. However, there is growing evidence that OA can also impact upon other key biological processes such as survival, growth and behaviour. On wave-swept rocky shores the ability of gastropods to self-right after dislodgement, and rapidly return to normal orientation, reduces the risk of predation.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The impacts of OA on this self-righting behaviour and other important parameters such as growth, survival, shell dissolution and shell deposition in Concholepas concholepas (loco) were investigated under contrasting pCO(2) levels. Although no impacts of OA on either growth or net shell calcification were found, the results did show that OA can significantly affect self-righting behaviour during the early ontogeny of this species with significantly faster righting times recorded for individuals of C. concholepas reared under increased average pCO(2) concentrations (+/- SE) (716 +/- 12 and 1036 +/- 14 mu atm CO2) compared to those reared at concentrations equivalent to those presently found in the surface ocean (388 +/- 8 mu atm CO2). When loco were also exposed to the predatory crab Acanthocyclus hassleri, righting times were again increased by exposure to elevated CO2, although self-righting times were generally twice as fast as those observed in the absence of the crab.
   Conclusions and Significance: These results suggest that self-righting in the early ontogeny of C. concholepas will be positively affected by pCO(2) levels expected by the end of the 21st century and beginning of the next one. However, as the rate of self-righting is an adaptive trait evolved to reduce lethal predatory attacks, our result also suggest that OA may disrupt prey responses to predators in nature.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation in nature requires the identification of the functional allelic variation underlying adaptive phenotypes. The manner in which organisms respond to temperature extremes is an adaptation in many species. In the current study, we investigate the role of molecular variation in senescence marker protein-30 (Smp-30) on natural phenotypic variation in cold tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster. Smp-30 encodes a product that is thought to be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ ion homeostasis and has been shown previously to be differentially expressed in response to cold stress. Thus, we sought to assess whether molecular variation in Smp-30 was associated with natural phenotypic variation in cold tolerance in a panel of naturally derived inbred lines from a population in Raleigh, North Carolina. We identified four non-coding polymorphisms that were strongly associated with natural phenotypic variation in cold tolerance. Interestingly, two polymorphisms that were in close proximity to one another (2 bp apart) exhibited opposite phenotypic effects. Consistent with the maintenance of a pair of antagonistically acting polymorphisms, tests of molecular evolution identified a significant excess of maintained variation in this region, suggesting balancing selection is acting to maintain this variation. These results suggest that multiple mutations in non-coding regions can have significant effects on phenotypic variation in adaptive traits within natural populations, and that balancing selection can maintain polymorphisms with opposite effects on phenotypic variation.

AB  - Soil freezing is a disturbance of the below ground environment, potentially resulting in increased losses of NO3- and surface water acidification. Here, we report the effects of soil freezing on interannual variation in stream chemistry at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Data from 1970 to 1997 of soil frost depth, snow cover, precipitation, air temperature, and stream discharge and chemistry were used in a stepwise linear regression model to select the variables that best predicted deviations of annual stream concentrations from 4-year running averages. Variables quantifying soil freezing severity were selected as significant predictors of short-term fluctuations in stream K+, NO3-, Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations from 1970 to 1989, explaining 59 and 47% of the short-term variability in K+ and NO3, respectively. Fine-root mortality and disturbance of root-soil-mic robe interactions, with subsequent effects on decomposition and nutrient uptake, likely contributed to the mobilization of K+ and NO3- to streamwater following severe soil freezing events. The relationship between soil freezing and stream chemistry, however, weakened during the period 1990-1997. Because soil freezing has had inconsistent effects on stream chemistry during the period 1970-1997, it is unclear whether future changes in the frequency, duration, and depth of soil freezing events as the result of changes in the snow cover regime under a warmer climate will have significant impacts on the losses of NO3 and nutrient-base cations from temperate northern ecosystems.

AB  - Stream temperature is an important determinant of fish growth, migration, and survival and can thus impact the structure and function of stream ecosystems. Many streams in Michigan and elsewhere in North America receive groundwater inputs that help regulate instream conditions by stabilizing discharge as well as stream temperature. However, groundwater withdrawal can cause reductions in streamflow which typically results in increased summer stream temperatures. Other atmospheric and hydrologic variables (i.e., overland discharge) also impact the rate at which stream temperature changes as it flows downstream. We deployed paired up- and downstream water pressure and temperature loggers within 21 stream reaches throughout the state of Michigan to quantify and model relationships between stream discharge, air temperature, and longitudinal change in stream temperature (i.e., temperature gradient). Using multimodel selection criteria, we evaluated the performance of a hierarchical suite of models that predict temperature gradient as a function of potential driving variables. The multimodel selection criteria identified a best-fitting model that was able to model the diurnal, seasonal, and annual variations in rates of longitudinal temperature fluctuations across most sample streams. Partial regression analysis indicated that proxy variables representing solar radiation at the stream surface were generally the most influential predictors of longitudinal changes in stream temperature, but air temperature and components of streamflow including groundwater input were significant predictors and important in many streams.

AB  - Yakutia is a part of eastern Siberia, located in north-eastern Russia. The climate of this area is very harsh even by Siberian standards, and is characterized by the absolute temperature minimum, which is below -64.4 degrees C, and a long period of low temperatures reaching to a range between -47 and -55 degrees C. Despite such a severe climate, the fauna and flora of Yakutia present a considerably rich biodiversity, suggesting a high adaptation potential of the organisms in this area. In this study, 30 local species of insects belonging to Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera were selected to investigate cold adaptation. The identification of the cold adaptation strategy was based on the measurement of the insect body supercooling point (SCP) and hemolymph ice-nucleating activity. According to the data collected, there is a high incidence of freeze tolerant species among the insects found in Yakutsk area (Yakutsk, 62 degrees latitude, 130 degrees longitude): 93.3% of them were freeze tolerant, and only 6.7% were freeze avoiding. It is suggested that the evolution of cold hardiness in this region preferably develops for the selection of the strong freeze tolerance that allow the insects to survive extreme cold conditions.

AB  - In this study, thermo-tolerant strain of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) was developed using gradual increase in temperature to induce Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE). Viable colony count of 1.87 +/- 0.98 log cfu/mL was achieved at 52 degrees C, using MRS agar supplemented with 2% lactose. Changes in bacteria morphology were discovered, from rod (control) to filament (52 degrees C) to cocci after frozen storage (-80 degrees C). When milk was inoculated with thermo-tolerant L. bulgaricus, lactic acid production was absent, leaving pH at 6.84 +/- 0.13. This has caused weakening of the protein network, resulting in high whey separation and lower water-holding capacity (37.1 +/- 0.35%) compared to the control (98.10 +/- 0.60%). Significantly higher proteolytic activity was observed through free amino acids analysis by LC-MS. Arginine and methionine (237.24 +/- 5.94 and 98.83 +/- 1.78 mu g/100 g, respectively) were found to be 115- and 275-fold higher than the control, contributing to changing the aroma similar to cheese. Further volatile analysis through SPME-GC-MS has confirmed significant increase in cheese-aroma volatiles compared to the control, with increase in diacetyl formation. Further work on DNA profiling, metabolomics and peptidomics will help to answer mechanisms behind the observed changes made in the study.

AB  - For ectothermic animals, selection of a suitable microhabitat is affected by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. Also important is the trade-off between those microhabitats with optimal microclimatic conditions and food availability vs. those with the lowest level of competition and lowest risk of predation. Central European species of groundhoppers (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) live in locations with small-scale mosaics of patches formed by bare ground, moss cushions and vascular plants (grasses and forbs). Our research focused on the effects of selected weather components (current temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and sunlight) on specific microhabitat selection by adults (during the reproductive season) and by the last-instar nymphs (during the non-reproductive season) of the groundhopper Tetrix tenuicornis. Using experimental conditions, we determined that microhabitat use by T. tenuicornis is sex-specific and that microhabitat preference differs between adults and nymphs. We suppose that microhabitats are used according to groundhopper current needs in relation to each habitat's suitability for maintaining body temperature, food intake and reproductive behaviour. Microhabitat preferences were significantly associated with temperature and atmospheric pressure. Changes in atmospheric pressure signal changes in weather, and insects respond to increases or decreases in pressure by adjusting their behaviour in order to enhance survival. We propose that, under low atmospheric pressure, T. tenuicornis actively seeks microhabitats that provide increased protection from adverse weather.

AB  - From the crystal field analysis of optical absorption spectra on monoclinic S.G. P2(1)/c MgNd(BO2)(5), where Nd3+ occupies a single crystallographic position with no symmetry elements, energy level schemes and an expression of the associated wavefunctions for the 4f(3) configuration of Nd3+ have been derived, considering approximate C-2v and C-s (C-2) symmetries. Despite of the low symmetry of Nd3+, resulting rms deviations between calculated and experimental levels are very satisfactory. The composition of the crystal field wavefunctions from both sets of phenomenological free-ion and crystal field parameters has been checked through a calculation of the thermal evolution of the paramagnetic susceptibility chi, according to the Van Vleck formula. The same simulation was performed with crystal field parameters (CFPs) resulting from the ab initio simple overlap model (SOM), considering the Nd3+ real point symmetry, C-1. Over the whole measured range, 1.7-375 K, and especially at low temperatures, a very good reproduction of the experimental chi vs. T is yielded by each of the experimental and SOM calculated collections of CFPs. The oversimplified SOM model seems thus to be useful providing reasonable estimations of crystal field strength parameters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does K2CaSiO4 Exist? A Phase-Analytical Study in the System K2O-CaO-SiO2 with Implications for the Characterization of Residual Materials
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
LA  - English
AB  - K2CaSiO4 or K2O x CaO x SiO2 has been reported to be a major constituent of residual materials that are of interest for the field of applied mineralogy, including ashes from biomass combustion as well as fertilizers produced from the residues of oil-shale industry or from steelmaking slags. Unfortunately, contradictory results concerning basic crystallographic and physicochemical data of this compound have been described in the literature. In a series of solid-state reactions we tried to prepare this material for a more detailed investigation. The temperature regime for the subsolidus synthesis experiments was selected according to previous studies where the occurrence of this so-called "1:1:1" phase had been reported. The samples were characterized by thermal and X-ray fluorescence analysis as well as X-ray powder diffraction. Our results indicate that "K2CaSiO4" does not exist as a crystalline phase in the ternary system K2O-CaO-SiO2 and that the 1: 1: 1 compound, mentioned in earlier studies is actually misinterpreted K2Ca2Si2O7. Furthermore, the start of melt formation of an oxide mixture with composition K2O x CaO x SiO2 has been determined to be 1170 degrees C, which is dramatically lower than the value of 1630 degrees C mentioned in the only available comprehensive but more than 80 years old phase analytical study on potassium calcium silicates.

AB  - Bacteria can be adapted to adverse and detrimental conditions that induce general and specific responses to DNA damage as well as acid, heat, cold, starvation, oxidative, envelope, and osmotic stresses. The stress-triggered regulatory systems are involved in bacterial survival processes, such as adaptation, physiological changes, virulence potential, and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility to several antibiotics is reduced due to the activation of stress responses in cellular physiology by the stimulation of resistance mechanisms, the promotion of a resistant lifestyle (biofilm or persistence), and/or the induction of resistance mutations. Hence, the activation of bacterial stress responses poses a serious threat to the efficacy and clinical success of antibiotic therapy. Bacterial stress responses can be potential targets for therapeutic alternatives to antibiotics. An understanding of the regulation of stress response in association with antibiotic resistance provides useful information for the discovery of novel antimicrobial adjuvants and the development of effective therapeutic strategies to control antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Therefore, this review discusses bacterial stress responses linked to antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria and also provides information on novel therapies targeting bacterial stress responses that have been identified as potential candidates for the effective control of Gram-negative antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

AB  - We review the variety of morphological, physiological and behavioral modifications that annelids have acquired to cope with environments either unsuitable for, or on the limits of, survival for most animals. We focus on polychaetes (excluding sipunculans and echiurans) and clitellates (oligochaetes and leeches) and source information mostly from the primary literature. We identified many modifications common to both polychaetes and clitellates, and others that are specific to one or the other group. For example, certain land-adapted polychaetes show reduction in nuchal organs, epidermal ciliation and receptor cells, and other coastal polychaetes use adhesive glands and glue-reinforced tubes to maintain position in surf zones, while oligochaetes, with their simple body plans, appear to be 'pre-adapted' to life underground. Modifications common to both groups include the ability to construct protective cocoons, make cryoprotective substances such as antifreeze and heat shock proteins, develop gills, transform their bodies into a home for symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria, metabolize contaminants, and display avoidance behaviors. Convergent evolution in both directions has enabled annelids to transition from salt water to freshwater, sea to land via beaches, freshwater to soil, and surface water to subterranean water. A superficially simple worm-like body and a mostly benthic/burrowing lifestyle has facilitated radiation into every conceivable environment, making annelids among the most common and diverse animal groups on the planet.

AB  - Climate adaptation is surprisingly rarely reported as a cause for the build-up of reproductive isolation between diverging populations. In this review, we summarize evidence for effects of climate adaptation on pre- and postzygotic isolation between emerging species with a particular focus on pied (Ficedula hypoleuca) and collared (Ficedula albicollis) flycatchers as a model for research on speciation. Effects of climate adaptation on prezygotic isolation or extrinsic selection against hybrids have been documented in several taxa, but the combined action of climate adaptation and sexual selection is particularly well explored in Ficedula flycatchers. There is a general lack of evidence for divergent climate adaptation causing intrinsic postzygotic isolation. However, we argue that the profound effects of divergence in climate adaptation on the whole biochemical machinery of organisms and hence many underlying genes should increase the likelihood of genetic incompatibilities arising as side effects. Fast temperature-dependent co-evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes may be particularly likely to lead to hybrid sterility. Thus, how climate adaptation relates to reproductive isolation is best explored in relation to fast-evolving barriers to gene flow, while more research on later stages of divergence is needed to achieve a complete understanding of climate-driven speciation.

During supercooling, no evidence of cell dehydration was recognized. cell walls were uncollapsed, no plasmolysis occurred, no ultrastructural changes in the plasma membranes or in cytoplasmic structures occurred, and high survival rates were maintained. Osmotic manipulation with hypertonic solutions of sorbitol did, however, cause dehydration of ray parenchyma cells, in which shrunken protoplasts and plasmolysis were observed. Freeze-fracture replicas showed that, in summer samples, osmotic dehydration produced aparticulate domains accompanied by fracture-jumps in the plasma membranes, which are known as a symptom of dehydration-induced injury, but no such effects were seen in winter samples. By contrast, in winter samples, osmotic dehydration produced conformational changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, which are known as a feature of dehydration tolerance, however, these changes were not seen in the summer samples. These results indicate that the ray parenchyma cells in S. obassia have the ability to tolerate dehydration in winter and lose this ability in summer. Such tolerance is similar to the dehydration tolerance in plant cells that adapt to freezing by extracellular freezing.

AB  - Primitive melt inclusions in chrome spinel from the Ogasawara Archipelago (Japan) compose two discrete groups of high-SiO2, high-MgO (high-Si) and low-SiO2, low-MgO (low-Si) boninitic suites, with ultra-depleted dish-and V-shaped, and less-depleted flat, rare earth element patterns. The most magnesian melt inclusions of each geochemical type were used to estimate the temperature-pressure conditions for primary boninites, which range from 1345 degrees C at 0.56 GPa to 1421 degrees C at 0.85 GPa for the 48-46 Ma low-Si and high-Si boninites, and 1381 degrees C at 0.85 GPa for the 45 Ma low-Si boninite. The onset of the Pacific slab subduction at 52 Ma forced upwelling of depleted mid-oceanic ridge basalt mantle (DMM) to yield proto-arc basalt (PAB). With the rise of DMM, refractory harzburgite ascended without melting. At 48-46 Ma, introduction of slab fluids induced melting of the PAB residue and high-temperature harzburgite, resulting in the low-Si and high-Si boninites, respectively. Meanwhile, convection within the mantle wedge brought the less-depleted residue of PAB and DMM into the region fluxed by slab fluids, which melted to yield the less-depleted low-Si boninite at 45 Ma, and fertile arc basalts, respectively.

AB  - Hrad Vallis is an Amazonian-age outflow channel located in the northwestern part of the Elysium Volcanic Province of Mars. The formation of Hrad Vallis may have been associated with catastrophic aqueous floods and volcanism, which makes determining its emplacement history important for constraining the planet's hydrological and thermal evolution during the Amazonian Period. Through geological mapping, geomorphologic analysis, and numerical simulations we assess whether Hrad Vallis formed in association with mudflows (i.e., lahars), effusive volcanism, or a combination of both processes. Among the three youngest flows in the region, the lower and upper flow units are inferred to be the products of catastrophic aqueous floods, whereas the middle unit is interpreted to be phoehoe-like lava flow formed through the process of inflation over the course of decades. The latter flow unit is similar to terrestrial lava-rise plateaus, but its emplacement may have involved interactions with surficial ice deposits, which affected the flow path and resulted in a range of lava-water interactions. We conclude that Hrad Vallis had a complex history involving episodes of both aqueous flooding and effusive volcanism and that the interactions between lava and ice in these regions may have generated ephemeral hydrothermal systems with potential astrobiological significance.
   Plain Language Summary Major outflow channels on Mars may have been carved by either catastrophic aqueous floods or turbulent lava flows. Addressing the ambiguous origin of these channels is therefore important for constraining the hydrological and volcanic history of the planet. This study focuses on Hrad Vallis, which is a geologically recent (Amazonian-age) outflow channel located within the Elysium Volcanic Province, through a combination of mapping and modeling. We find evidence for both aqueous flooding and effusive volcanism associated with this channel, indicating a complex hydrologic and geologic history. However, lava flows in this region are interpreted to be the products of phoehoe-like lava flow emplacement, similar to terrestrial lava flows on Earth in New Mexico and Hawaii, and not highly turbulent flows as previously suggested. The identification of similar to 50m thick phoehoe-like lava flows near Hrad Vallis implies a gradual formation process over the course of decades, and heat from these lava flows may have interacted with ground ice to produce meltwater and steam. Lava-water interactions on Mars are important because they could generate habitable environments for microbial organisms that have adapted for survival within hydrothermal systems.

AB  - The complete (or near complete) differentiation of a chondritic parent body is believed to result in an object with an Fe-Ni core, a thick olivine-dominated mantle and a thin plagioclase/pyroxene crust. Compositional groupings of iron meteorites give direct evidence that at least 60 chondritic parent bodies have been differentiated and subsequently destroyed. A long standing problem has been that our meteorite collections, and apparently our asteroid observations as well, show a great absence of olivine-dominated metal-free mantle material. While the basaltic achondrites (HED meteorites) represent metal-free pyroxene-dominated crustal samples, the isotopic and geochemical evidence implies that this class is derived from only one parent body (perhaps Vesta). Thus the meteoritic (and perhaps astronomical) evidence also suggests a great absence of crustal material resulting from the collisional disruption of numerous parent bodies.
   One explanation for the rarity of olivine-dominated metal-free and basaltic asteroids that fits all the available evidence is that all differentiated parent bodies, with the exception of Vesta, were either disrupted or had their crusts and mantles stripped very early in the age of the solar system. The resulting basaltic and olivine-dominated metal-free fragments were continually broken down until their sizes dropped at least below our current astronomical measurement limit (similar to 5-10 km for inner-belt objects) and perhaps completely comminuted such that meteorite samples are no longer delivered. Because of their greater strengths and longer survival time in interplanetary space, only the iron and the stony-iron meteorites remain as the final tracers of this differentiation and collisional history. However, other scenarios remain plausible such as those which invoke ''space weathering'' processes that effectively disguise the distinctive basaltic and olivine spectra of possible remnant crustal and mantle material within the main asteroid belt.

AB  - Development of infection of 4 strains of nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) in third instar Diatraea saccharalis larvae at 10 different temperatures was compared. Two wild strains, the Anticarsia gemmatalis MNPV (AgMNPV) and the Trichoplusia ni MNPV (TnMNPV), and two selected strains, AgMNPV-D10 and TnMNPV-D11 were inoculated in 11-day-old D. saccharalis larvae and kept in temperatures of 17, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37 and 39-degrees-C. The results showed that larval mortality increased with temperature, and the increase of temperature caused also the reduction of lethal time 50% (LT50) values. The maximal polyhedral production was obtained at 28-degrees-C for the 4 viral strains and a drastic reduction in the number of polyhedra was observed even for a difference of 2-degrees-C above or below this ideal temperature. The selected strains showed a 10-fold increase in polyhedra yield when compared to the wild type strains.

AB  - Aiming at meeting consumers' requirements for healthy foods, dietary needs (vegetarianism, lactose- and gluten-free), as well as the nutrition recommendations of the Health Authorities in terms of protein, fibers and bioactive compounds, the present study proposes a novel yogurt-style snack made with plant-derived ingredients. The biotechnological protocol includes the fermentation of a thermal-treated blend of cereal and legume flours by the selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB)Lactoplantibacillus plantarumDSM33326 andLevilactobacillus brevisDSM33325. The yogurt-style snack was characterized by protein and fiber concentration of 3 and 4%, respectively, and a low-fat content. Compared to the unfermented control, the yogurt-style snack was characterized by a significant higher concentration of free amino acids and lower contents of the antinutritional factors, i.e., phytic acid, condensed tannins, saponins and raffinose (up to 90%) mainly due to the LAB metabolic activity. Hence, anin-vitroprotein digestibility of 79% and improvements of all the nutritional indexes related to the quality of the protein fraction (e.g., GABA) were achieved at the end of fermentation. According to the Harvard Medical School recommendations, the novel snack can be potentially classified as low-glycemic index food (53%). Antioxidant properties of the fermented snack were also improved by means of increased the total phenol content and radical scavenging activity. High survival rate of the starter LAB and a commercial probiotic (added to the snack) was found through 30 days storage under refrigerated conditions. The biotechnological protocol to make the novel snack here proposed is suitable for the large-scale application in food industry, giving a platform product with a peculiar and appreciated sensory profile.

AB  - This review outlines a holistic framework for studying ATP synthase and emphasizes the importance of considering interactions with the lipid environment in shaping the function and evolutionary history of membrane proteins.
   The synthesis of ATP, life's "universal energy currency," is the most prevalent chemical reaction in biological systems and is responsible for fueling nearly all cellular processes, from nerve impulse propagation to DNA synthesis. ATP synthases, the family of enzymes that carry out this endless task, are nearly as ubiquitous as the energy-laden molecule they are responsible for making. The F-type ATP synthase (F-ATPase) is found in every domain of life and has facilitated the survival of organisms in a wide range of habitats, ranging from the deep-sea thermal vents to the human intestine. Accordingly, there has been a large amount of work dedicated toward understanding the structural and functional details of ATP synthases in a wide range of species. Less attention, however, has been paid toward integrating these advances in ATP synthase molecular biology within the context of its evolutionary history. In this review, we present an overview of several structural and functional features of the F-type ATPases that vary across taxa and are purported to be adaptive or otherwise evolutionarily significant: ion channel selectivity, rotor ring size and stoichiometry, ATPase dimeric structure and localization in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and interactions with membrane lipids. We emphasize the importance of studying these features within the context of the enzyme's particular lipid environment. Just as the interactions between an organism and its physical environment shape its evolutionary trajectory, ATPases are impacted by the membranes within which they reside. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of membrane proteins-including ATP synthase-requires such an integrative approach.

AB  - The long-term evolution of continental magmatic arcs is episodic, where a few transient events of high magmatic flux or flare-ups punctuate the low-flux magmatism or "steady state" that makes up most of the arc history. How this duality manifests in terms of differences in crustal architecture, magma dynamics and chemistry, and the time scale over which transitions occur is poorly known. Herein we use multiscale geochemical and isotopic characteristics coupled with geothermobarometry at the Purico-Chascon Volcanic Complex (PCVC) in the Central Andes to identify a transition from flare-up to steady state arc magmatism over similar to 800 kyr during which significant changes in upper crustal magmatic dynamics are recorded.
   The PCVC is one of the youngest volcanic centers related to a 10-1 Ma ignimbrite flare-up in the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex of the Central Andes. Activity at the PC,VC initiated 0.98 +/- 0.03 Ma with the eruption of a large 80-100 km(3) crystal-rich dacite ignimbrite. High, restricted Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios between 0.7085 and 0.7090 in the bulk rock and plagioclase crystals from the Purico ignimbrite, combined with mineral chemistry and phase relationships indicate the dacite magma accumulated and evolved at relatively low temperatures around 800-850 degrees C in the upper crust at 4-8 km depth. Minor andesite pumice erupted late in the ignimbrite sequence records a second higher temperature (965 degrees C), higher pressure environment (17-20 km), but with similar restricted radiogenic bulk rock Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7089-0.7091 to the dacites. The compositional and isotopic characteristics of the Purico ignimbrite implicate an extensive zone of upper crustal mixing, assimilation, storage and homogenization (MASH) between 30 and 4 km beneath the PCVC 1 Ma.
   The final eruptions at the PCVC <0.18 +/- 0.02 Ma suggest a change in the magmatic architecture beneath the PCVC. These eruptions produced three small <6 km3 crystal-rich dacite lava domes with radiogenic bulk rock Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios ranging from 0.7075 to 0.7081, that contain abundant basaltic-andesite inclusions with relatively low bulk rock Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.7057-0.7061. Plagioclase and amphibole in the host lava of Cerro Chascon, the largest of the domes, record two distinct magmatic environments; an upper crustal environment identical to that recorded in the Purico ignimbrite, and a second deeper, similar to 15-20 km depth, higher temperature (similar to 922-1001 degrees C) environment. This deeper environment is recorded in textures and compositions of distinct mineral phases, and in intracrystalline isotope ratios. Plagioclase cores in the host dacite lava and mafic inclusions have in situ Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic compositions of 0.7083 to 0.7095, broadly similar to plagioclase from the Purico ignimbrite. in contrast, plagioclase rims and microphenocrysts in the mafic inclusions are isotopically distinct with lower Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios (0.7057 to 0.7065 and 0.7062 to 0.7064, respectively) that overlap with the regional isotopic "baseline" compositions that are parental to the modern arc lavas.
   The textural and compositional characteristics of the PCVC attest to two distinct stages in its history. At similar to 1 Ma the system was broadly homogeneous and dominantly dacitic recording extensive upper crustal magmatism. By similar to 0.2 Ma the PCVC had transitioned to a more compositionally heterogeneous, smaller volume, mixed dacite to basaltic-andesite system, coinciding with the appearance of less-enriched "baseline" compositions. The evolution of PCVC is a microcosm of the Central Andean arc in this region where, from 10 to 1 Ma, upper crustal MASH processes resulted in the production and eruption of large volumes of homogeneous crystal-rich dacite during a regional ignimbrite flare-up. Since similar to 1 Ma, decreasing explosivity, smaller eruptive volumes, increasing heterogeneity, and the emergence of less isotopically enriched basaltic-andesite to dacite composite volcanoes signal a return to steady-state arc volcanism.
   We posit that the transition from flare-up to steady state captured at the PCVC tracks the waning of the arc scale "thermal engine". High magmatic fluxes during the flare-up would lead to elevated geothermal gradients and efficient crustal processing leading to a dominantly "crustal" magmatism feeding the large volume Purico ignimbrite. This upper crustal MASH zone would act as an efficient filter to any parental compositions precluding them from the eruption record. As magmatic flux and thermal energy wanes, crustal isotherms would relax leading to greater thermal contrast between parental magmas, upper crust, and remnant felsic magmas stored in the upper crust. These changes are manifested in the preservation of textural and compositional heterogeneity and the survival of less isotopically enriched magmas in the upper crust. The chemical imprint of these arc-scale changes in magma dynamics is recorded at all scales from bulk rock to intra-crystalline. The distinct magma dynamics and chemical signatures of the two modes of arc magmatism detailed here should provide a model for investigations of mature continental arc evolution through time and space.

AB  - Globally, the East Asian monsoon region is one of the richest environments in terms of biodiversity. The region is undergoing rapid human development, yet its river ecosystems have not been well studied. Global warming represents a major challenge to the survival of species in this region and makes it necessary to assess and reduce the potential consequences of warming on species of conservation concern. We projected the effects of global warming on stream insect (Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera [EOPT]) diversity and predicted the changes of geographical ranges for 121 species throughout South Korea. Plecoptera was the most sensitive (decrease of 71.4% in number of species from the 2000s through the 2080s) order, whereas Odonata benefited (increase of 66.7% in number of species from the 2000s through the 2080s) from the effects of global warming. The impact of global warming on stream insects was predicted to be minimal prior to the 2060s; however, by the 2080s, species extirpation of up to 20% in the highland areas and 2% in the lowland areas were predicted. The projected responses of stream insects under global warming indicated that species occupying specific habitats could undergo major reductions in habitat. Nevertheless, habitat of 33% of EOPT (including two-thirds of Odonata and one-third of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) was predicted to increase due to global warming. The community compositions predicted by generalized additive models varied over this century, and a large difference in community structure in the highland areas was predicted between the 2000s and the 2080s. However, stream insect communities, especially Odonata, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, were predicted to become more homogenous under global warming. Impacto Potencial del Calentamiento Global sobre la Diversidad y la Distribucion de Insectos de Arroyo en Corea del Sur
   Resumen A nivel global, la region de monzon del este de Asia es uno de los ambientes mas ricos en cuanto a la biodiversidad. La region esta sufriendo un rapido desarrollo humano y sus ecosistemas fluviales no han sido bien estudiados aun. El calentamiento global representa un obstaculo mayor en la supervivencia de las especies en esta region y hace necesario estudiar y reducir las consecuencias potenciales del calentamiento sobre las especies de importancia para la conservacion. Proyectamos los efectos del calentamiento global sobre la diversidad de insectos de arroyo (Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera y Trichoptera [EOPT]) y predijimos los cambios de los rangos geograficos para 121 especies a lo largo y ancho de Corea del Sur. Plecotpera fue el orden mas sensible (disminucion del 71.4% en el numero de especies desde el 2000 hasta la decada de 2080), mientras que Odonata se beneficio de los efectos del calentamiento global (incremento del 66.7% desde el 2000 hasta la decada de 2080). El impacto del calentamiento global sobre insectos de arroyo se predijo seria minimo antes de 2060; sin embargo, para 2080, se predijo una extirpacion de especies hasta de 20% en las areas de tierras altas y del 2% en las areas de tierras bajas. Las respuestas proyectadas de insectos de arroyo bajo el calentamiento global indicaron que las especies que ocupan habitats especificos podrian sufrir una reduccion mayor en el habitat. Sin embargo, se predijo que el habitat del 33% de EOPT (incluyendo dos tercios de Odonata y un tercio de Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera y Trichoptera) incrementaria debido al calentamiento global. Las composiciones de la comunidad predichas por modelos aditivos generalizados vario en este siglo y una gran diferencia en la estructura de la comunidad en las areas de tierras altas se predijo entre 2000 y 2080. Sin embargo, se predijo que las comunidades de insectos de arroyo, especialmente Odonata, Plecoptera y Trichoptera, se volverian mas homogeneas bajo el calentamiento global.

AB  - A novel, solvent-deficient precipitation (SDP) method for catalyst preparation in general and for preparation of iron FT catalysts in particular is reported. Eight catalysts using a 2(3) factorial design of experiments to identify the key preparation variables were prepared. The catalysts were characterized by electron microprobe, N-2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, and ICP. Results show that the morphology of the catalysts, i.e., surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, crystallite sizes, and promoter distribution are significantly influenced by (1) whether or not the precursor catalyst is washed, (2) the promoter addition step, and (3) the drying condition (temperature). Consequently, the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts determined from fixed-bed testing are also affected by these three variables. Unwashed catalysts prepared by a one-step method and dried at 100 degrees C produced the most active catalysts for FT synthesis. The catalysts of this study prepared by SDP compared favorably in activity, productivity, and stability with Fe FT catalysts reported in the literature. It is believed that this facile SDP approach has promise for development of future FT catalysts, and also offers a potential alternate route for the preparation of other catalysts for various other applications.

AB  - The transesterification reaction to produce methanol and butyl acetate has great interest in the chemical industry. The separation of these two compounds from the reaction media increases the productivity, thus, a hybrid configuration composed of reaction-pervaporation is of interest. In this work, 10 commercial specialty membranes (PolyAn and Sulzer Pervap membranes) have been studied in a pervaporation setup at three temperatures (30, 40 and 50 degrees C) and a feed concentration ranging between 20 and 80 mol% methanol/butyl acetate in order to determine their performance in terms of permeance, selectivity and the McCabe-Thiele separation diagram. From the results, it can be observed that most of the membranes are butyl acetate selective, with selectivities up to 307 and permeances of butyl acetate up to about 80,000 GPU. In general, an increase in temperature decreases the permeance of butyl acetate through the PolyAn membranes and it has a dramatic effect on the Pervap 1201 membrane since the selectivity to butyl acetate decays from 300 at 30 degrees C to around 0.2 at 50 degrees C. The Pervap 2255-50 membrane presents an increase of selectivity as the temperature increases. On this basis the potential of developing a pervaporation membrane reactor for production of butyl acetate by transesterification is assessed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among industrial chemical processes, ethylene oxide manufacture emits the largest amount of CO2 (similar to 2-3 million tons/yr), as byproduct from the burning of both the ethylene (feed) and ethylene oxide. Further, the conventional silver-based catalytic process presents safety challenges due to the formation of explosive ethylene oxide/O-2 mixtures in the gas phase. By judicious choice of the catalyst (methyltrioxorhenium), oxidant (H2O2) and reaction medium (methanol/water), a homogeneous liquid phase catalytic system has been demonstrated that eliminates CO2 formation while producing ethylene oxide at > 90% selectivity at near-ambient temperatures. Given its high volatility, the ethylene oxide is easily recovered from the reaction phase by distillation. The vicinity of the gaseous ethylene feed to its critical temperature (9 degrees C) is exploited to significantly increase its solubility in the liquid reaction phase by facile compression beyond the critical pressure of ethylene (similar to 50 bar). Since H2O2 is stable at typical reaction temperatures (40 degrees C or less), potentially explosive ethylene oxide/O-2 mixtures are avoided in the gas phase. In addition to the potential of arresting the carbon footprint of a large-scale industrial process, the demonstrated process concept shows how gas-expanded liquids can be generally exploited in homogeneous catalysis to enhance productivity.

AB  - Development of a robust HPLC method for pharmaceutical analysis can be very challenging and time-consuming. In our laboratory, we have developed a new workflow leveraging ACD/Labs software tools to improve the performance of HPLC method development. First, we established ACD-based analytical method databases that can be searched by chemical structure similarity. By taking advantage of the existing knowledge of HPLC methods archived in the databases, one can find a good starting point for HPLC method development, or even reuse an existing method as is for a new project. Second, we used the software to predict compound physicochemical properties before running actual experiments to help select appropriate method conditions for targeted screening experiments. Finally, after selecting stationary and mobile phases, we used modeling software to simulate chromatographic separations for optimized temperature and gradient program. The optimized new method was then uploaded to internal databases as knowledge available to assist future method development efforts. Routine implementation of such standardized workflows has the potential to reduce the number of experiments required for method development and facilitate systematic and efficient development of faster, greener and more robust methods leading to greater productivity. In this article, we used Loratadine method development as an example to demonstrate efficient method development using this new workflow. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the possibility of the use of zeolites in agriculture. Zeolites are a large group of aluminosilicate minerals with different chemical composition. Due to their unique physical and chemical properties (high sorption capacity, ion-exchange selectivity and structural thermal stability), they can be used for example in the production of mineral fertilizers. Their addition increases plant production levels and improves soil properties. Also, zeolite can be used for the remediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals.

AB  - A fat-containing waste produced from the margarine manufacturing process was tested as a low cost carbon source for cultivation of different polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) producing bacterial strains, including Cupriavidus necator, Comamonas testosteroni and several Pseudomonas strains. The margarine waste was mainly composed of free fatty acids (76 wt.%), namely mystiric, oleic, linoleic and stearic acids. In preliminary shake flask experiments, several strains were able to grow on the margarine waste, but C necator reached the highest PHA content in the biomass (69 wt.%). This strain was selected for batch bioreactor experiments, wherein it reached a cell dry weight of 11.2 g/L with a polymer content of 56 wt.%. The culture produced 6.4 g/L of polyhydroxybutyrate, P3(HB), within 20 h of cultivation, which corresponds to a volumetric productivity of 0.33 g(pha)/L h. The P3(HB) polymer produced by C. necator from the margarine waste had a melting point of 173.4 degrees C, a glass transition temperature of 7.9 degrees C and a crystallinity of 56.6%. Although the bioprocess needs to be optimized, the margarine waste was shown to be a promising substrate for P(3HB) production by C necator, resulting in a polymer with physical and chemical properties similar to bacterial P(3HB) synthesized from other feedstocks.

AB  - A one-stage syngas-to-fuel process was carried out by integrating Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) with hydrocracking (HC) in a micro-reactor to verify the feasibility of a related process simplification with a view to small-scale X-to-liquid (XtL) plants. Different approaches to the integration of the two process steps and the influence of the operating conditions were investigated targeting liquid fuel synthesis (C-5-C-20). It was proven that FTS plays the determining role in the integrated process and HC only exhibits a promoting function. Good performance was obtained in both sequential and mixed-bed systems. With an increase of temperature the liquid fuel selectivity reaches a plateau value of around 70% at 230-250 degrees C, depending on the integration pattern and syngas space velocity. H-2/CO ratio and pressure only have limited influence on the fuel selectivity. FTS was enhanced in the mixed-bed configuration. Meanwhile, consistent hydrocarbon distribution was obtained for both integration patterns when reaching the plateau fuel selectivity. The catalyst stability in both configurations was analyzed, and a reasonable and comparable long-term stability was obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mn was used as a promoter for Fe nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The prepared catalysts were the unpromoted Fe/rGO catalysts along with two Mn promoted catalysts FeMn16 and FeMn29. These catalysts were used as Fischer-Tropsch catalysts in a Fixed Bed Reactor (FBR). The operating conditions of the reactor, namely temperature, pressure and space velocity, were varied to evaluate the catalyst performance and the olefin productivity. The olefins were produced in maximum yields of 34.5% and 31.3% with FeMn29 at 320 and 340 degrees C respectively. The ratio of light to heavy olefins was three times higher at 340 degrees C. The catalysts showed good stability up to 50 h of interrupted operation while varying the conditions at each interruption. The performance of the catalysts in the FBR was compared with a previous investigation carried out in an SBR under identical conditions with the same catalysts. The FBR was found to be more Mn tolerant than the SBR, giving very high conversion activity with high Mn concentrations (FeMn29). The FBR produced olefins in much higher yields than the SBR. The SBR was more selective to light olefins at low temperatures and high Mn loading levels, while the FBR produced light olefins at higher selectivities at high temperatures and high Mn concentrations.

AB  - The threat of global climate change has caused concern among scientists because crop production could be severely affected by changes in key climatic variables that could compromise food security both globally and locally. Although it is true that extreme climatic events can severely impact small farmers, available data is just a gross approximation at understanding the heterogeneity of small scale agriculture ignoring the myriad of strategies that thousands of traditional farmers have used and still use to deal with climatic variability. Scientists have now realized that many small farmers cope with and even prepare for climate change, minimizing crop failure through a series of agroecological practices. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to the high level of on-farm biodiversity, a typical feature of traditional farming systems.
   Based on this evidence, various experts have suggested that rescuing traditional management systems combined with the use of agroecologically based management strategies may represent the only viable and robust path to increase the productivity, sustainability and resilience of peasant-based agricultural production under predicted climate scenarios. In this paper we explore a number of ways in which three key traditional agroecological strategies (biodiversification, soil management and water harvesting) can be implemented in the design and management of agroecosystems allowing farmers to adopt a strategy that both increases resilience and provides economic benefits, including mitigation of global warming.

AB  - It is agreed that climate (precipitation and temperature) influences the distribution of plant species. Near the margins of a species' natural range, climate becomes limiting to physiological processes. There, climate change may be expected to have a significant impact on tree growth and the species' ranges may be altered.
   In order to assess what influence climate change could exert on the distribution of pine species at their margin, radial growth trends in ring-width chronologies over the last century were analysed. In the French Mediterranean area where climate change is characterized by increased temperature, forest plots were selected along an altitudinal transect on the north-facing slope of the Sainte-Baume mountain (Bouches-du-Rhone, France) where the ranges of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus halepensis overlap.
   Two growth patterns were identified. For P. halepensis, radial growth has increased at all altitudes indicating that climate change has improved growth conditions of this species near the margin of its ecological range. For P. sylvestris, radial growth has increased only at low altitudes and even decreased at high altitudes.
   It must be deduced that the growth changes observed cannot be generalised either at the species level or at the geographical level and must be interpreted with great caution.

AB  - Defect-free blades with fine microstructure and excellent high temperature performance are needed by aero-turbine. The curved shape of SX (single grain) blade is usually very complicated, and its section varies sharply at the platform, the tip shroud, etc. Thus, stray grains are difficult to avoid during directional solidification. In order to optimize the process parameter, the physical model and the mathematical model of directional solidification of SX blade were established based on Panda thermodynamic database and finite element. The temperature field, the evolution of mushy zone and the SDAS (secondary dendrite arm spacing) during solidification of SX sample by different process were simulated, and the discipline and mechanism of defect formation were investigated. The numerical results agree well with the experimental. The calculated results indicate that with the higher withdrawal rate, the SDAS gets smaller but stray grains tend to occur; with the lower withdrawal rate, the possibility of stray grains gets lower but the SDAS gets larger. The directional solidification of complicated thin-walled hollow real SX blade was simulated as well. The results show that the SDAS is nearly uniform in the blade, stray grains may appear at the platform when the withdrawal rate is up to 3.5 mm/min. By the process with varying withdrawal rate, the stray grain can be avoided while most of secondary dendrite can be refined, thus improving the productivity and percent of pass.

AB  - A novel homogeneous system for the selective, low-temperature, catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol is reported. The net reaction catalyzed by mercuric ions, Hg(II), is the oxidation of methane by concentrated sulfuric acid to produce methyl bisulfate, water, and sulfur dioxide. The reaction is efficient. At a methane conversion of 50%, 85% selectivity to methyl bisulfate (similar to 43% yield, the major side product is carbon dioxide) was achieved at a molar productivity of 10(-7) mol/cm(3) s and Hg(II) turnover frequency of 10(-3) s(-1). Separate hydrolysis of methyl bisulfate and reoxidation of the sulfur dioxide with air provides a potentially practical scheme for the oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen. This yield is the highest single-pass yield of methanol so far reported for a catalytic methane oxidation. The primary steps of the Hg(II)-catalyzed reaction were individually examined, and the essential elements of the mechanism were identified. The Hg(II) ion reacts with methane by an electrophilic displacement mechanism to produce an observable species, CH3HgOSO3H. Under the reaction conditions, CH3HgOSO3H readily decomposes to CH3OSO3H and the reduced mercurous species, Hg-2(2+). The catalytic cycle is completed by the reoxidation of Hg-2(2+) with H2SO4 to regenerate Hg(II) and by-products SO2 and H2O. Thallium(III), palladium(II), and the cations of platinum and gold also oxidize methane to methyl bisulfate in sulfuric acid.

AB  - In this research, an ANOVA analysis and a response surface methodology are applied to analyze the equilibrium of methanol reaction from pure carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In the ANOVA analysis, carbon monoxide composition in the feed, reaction temperature, recycle and water removal through a zeolite membrane are the analyzed factors. Carbon conversion, methanol yield, methanol productivity and methanol selectivity are the analyzed responses. Results show that main factors have the same effect on responses and a common significant interaction is not present. Carbon monoxide composition and water removal have a positive effect, while temperature and recycle have a negative effect on the system. From central composite design, an optimal solution is found in order to overcome thermodynamic limit: the reactor works with a membrane at lower temperature with carbon monoxide composition in the feed equal to 10 mol % and without recycle. In these conditions, carbon conversion, methanol yield, methanol selectivity, and methanol production are, respectively, higher than 60%, higher than 60%, between 90% and 95% and higher than 0.15mol/h when considering a feed flow rate of 1 mol/h. A comparison with a traditional reactor is also developed: the membrane reactor ensures to have a carbon conversion higher of the 29% and a methanol yield higher of the 34%. Future researches should evaluate an economic analysis about the optimal solution.

AB  - The effect of projected future changes in temperature, wind speed, precipitation and particulate organic carbon on concentrations of persistent organic chemicals in the Baltic Sea regional environment is evaluated using the POPCYCLING-Baltic multimedia chemical fate model. Steady-state concentrations of hypothetical perfectly persistent chemicals with property combinations that encompass the entire plausible range for non-ionizing organic substances are modelled under two alternative climate change scenarios (IPCC A2 and B2) and compared to a baseline climate scenario. The contributions of individual climate parameters are deduced in model experiments in which only one of the four parameters is changed from the baseline scenario. Of the four selected climate parameters, temperature is the most influential, and wind speed is least. Chemical concentrations in the Baltic region are projected to change by factors of up to 3.0 compared to the baseline climate scenario. For chemicals with property combinations similar to legacy persistent organic pollutants listed by the Stockholm Convention, modelled concentration ratios between two climate change scenarios and the baseline scenario range from factors of 0.5 to 2.0. This study is a first step toward quantitatively assessing climate change-induced changes in the environmental concentrations of persistent organic chemicals in the Baltic Sea region.

AB  - Alpine grassland is the typical vegetation in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which has important ecological service functions, and also supports the development of alpine stock farming. In recent years, under both the natural and human disturbance, alpine grasslands in this area have appeared to different degrees of desertification. A diagnosis of the desertification degree serves as the basis for grassland ecological restoration. This study constructs a comprehensive index based on remote sensing called alpine grassland desertification index (AGDI) to monitor the areas and degree of desertification. The most relevant indicators of desertification, namely, vegetation fraction, aboveground biomass, soil moisture, and land surface temperature, were selected to establish AGDI. The geographical detector is used to reselect and assess these indicators. The results show that the overall verification accuracy of AGDI is 82.05%. In particular, the accuracy of identifying severe desertification is the highest. Our study confirms that the desertification of alpine grasslands in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is characterized by fragmentation. Thus, Landsat-8 OLI data with a spatial resolution of 30 m is more suitable than MODIS data for alpine grasslands desertification monitoring. The research results can provide a methodological reference for monitoring desertification of alpine grasslands and other grassland regions in the world.

AB  - The separation of quaternary mixtures of lactobionic acid, lactose, sorbitol and fructose using a gel-type ion-exchange resin loaded with H+, K+ and Ca2+ ions has been investigated. This separation is relevant in order to improve the productivity of lactobionic acid obtained from the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by Glucose-fructose oxidoreductase and glucono-delta-lactonase enzymes. Measurement of the single-component equilibrium isotherms for all four species was carried out in a preparative column packed with the selected resin at temperatures of 293, 313 and 333 K using the frontal analysis and column adsorption-desorption method. Mass transfer coefficients for all species at different temperatures have been estimated by solving the dynamic model of the chromatographic column. From pulse tests of single-component and mixture solutions, the K+ loaded resin was found to be suitable for this quaternary separation. The unfavourable adsorption isotherm for the lactobionic acid is described by the anti-Langmuir model. Other compounds have shown linear equilibrium in the concentration range up to 130 g L-1. Binary and quaternary fixed-bed experiments were well described by the dynamic model using the parameters obtained from the single-component adsorption data. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The synthesis of isobutanol via the Guerbet condensation between methanol and ethanol was studied by using sodium methoxide (MeONa) as soluble basic component and copper-based catalysts as heterogeneous dehydrogenating/hydrogenating metal species. The effect of the nature of the catalyst and the relative amount of its individual components with respect to the reacting alcohols as well as of temperature on productivity and selectivity of the process was investigated. The collected data indicated that the copper chromite/MeONa was more active than Cu-Raney/MeONa system. The reaction was shown to proceed with the formation only of n-propanol and isobutanol. Ethanol conversion up to 61% with selectivity to isobutanol up to 98.4% was obtained. The same catalytic systems were also employed in the reaction of the methanol/ethanol/n-propanol ternary mixture. Again copper chromite/MeONa resulted more active than the Cu-Raney/MeONa system. Finally, experiments were carried out on methanol/n-propanol mixtures in the presence of the copper chromite/MeONa catalytic system by recycling both the recovered solid copper component and the liquid reaction mixture for evidencing eventual copper leaching by MeONa. On the basis of the obtained results it was concluded that in the Guerbet reaction copper chromite works as heterogeneous catalyst. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Inspired by the biomimetic modification strategy of dopamine self-polymerization technique, molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (MINCMs) with thermo-responsive rebinding and separation perfor-mance were synthesized and evaluated. Herein, the Au/SiO2-based multilevel structure had been successfully obtained onto the polydopamine (pDA) modified membrane surfaces. Afterward, the poly(Nisopropylacrylamide)-based biomolecule-imprinted sites were adequately constructed by developing a photoinitiated atom transfer radical polymerization (pATRP) imprinting strategy using the high-biocompatible ovalbumin (Ova, pI 4.6) as template molecule. Therefore, thermo-responsive 'specific recognition sites' toward Ova were then achieved on the as-prepared MINCMs after the well-designed imprinting process. When the external temperature was set at 37 degrees C, excellent ovalbumin rebinding capacity (33.26 mg/g), selectivity factor (3.06) and structural stability were obtained. Importantly, as to the controllable biocompatibility research of this work, the bare glass and Ova-bound-MINCMs (the MINCMs were bound with Ova) showed basically the same cell adhesion behaviors and viability, indicating the excellent biocompatibility of the Ovabound-MINCMs. Additionally, efficient and rapid regulation of cell adhesion/detachment on ovalbuminbound MINCMs could be still obtained even after 10 cycles of temperature-switch process, which indicated that the as-prepared MINCMs had strong ability to work under high intensity and long continuous operation.

AB  - Analog prediction systems developed in the United States and the former Soviet Union are compared for U.S. seasonal temperature prediction. Of primary interest is the viability of the Russian ''optimization'' concept for a priori selection of U.S. seasonal analog forecast predictors. Optimization is a specific technique for choosing predictor variables for analog matching on a forecast-by-forecast basis. Validation of this procedure would lead to more efficient design of analog prediction models and the elimination of some subjectivity in the process that inevitably results in overstatements in realizable skill. The procedure's effectiveness was tested using predictor and predictand datasets from the U.S. system in a cross-validation framework. Skills of different models were assessed on the basis of 40 seasonal forecasts at 92 U.S. stations.
   The Russian system (called GRAN for ''Group Analog'') was first run without optimization using the a posteriori selected predictors used in the U.S. system. A version of the U.S. system (without use of antianalogs) that is conceptually very similar to GRAN without optimization was run for comparison in this calibration step. The results reveal that these systems perform in a nearly identical manner when predictor and predictand datasets are the same. Next GRAN forecasts were made using all available predictors and then using only predictors selected via optimization. The results not only show that objective a priori predictor selection by optimization is just as effective (in terms of skill) as subjective a posteriori selection but also suggest it may produce superior results in summer forecasts.

AB  - End energy user is dependent on fossil fuel-based main-grid and contributes toward greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions. Changing its energy source will change the dynamics of the power plant, contribution towards GHG production. This case study aims to highlight the minute but positive role of a single end energy user, invisible to the main grid in GHG mitigations through photovoltaic energy source, selected among Pakistan's top 10 most populous cities as per census 2017. Quetta is a selected city in Pakistan as the best fit location based on annual average daily solar radiations (AADSR) data retrieved from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) meteorological data. Helioscope software is used to select -15 degrees tilt and 180 degrees azimuthal angles, which further increased Quetta's AADSR value from 5.54 kWh/m(2)/d to 5.93 kWh/m(2)/d. For research significance, a realistic approach is undertaken by proper selection of solar panel type based on Quetta's annual average temperature, load categorization, user selection and inputs from a solar energy expert. Finally, initial cost, investment and GHG mitigation analysis are carried out in RETScreen Expert software, which validates the minute but the prominent role of a single, end energy user by mitigating 122 tons of CO2 in 25-year project life span. Further, the proposed project favors end-user financially by recovering its $4501 initial cost in less than four years by effectively meeting its energy demand and saving $1195 per annum.

AB  - Lynn (1987, 1991ab) hypothesized that the Eurasian ecological niche is the selective agent responsible for racial differences in intelligence. More specifically, the difficulties of survival in cold northern latitudes necessitated increased intelligence. This explanation could account for the lower IQ scores of Negroid populations relative to Caucasoid and Mongoloid populations. However, the IQ scores of Amerindians, who are Mongoloids, was inconsistent with that hypothesis. In order to account for that anomaly, Lynn argued that Amerindians are the descendants of an archaic Mongoloid population that crossed the Bering Land Bridge before the main Wurm glaciation, and thus, escaped the selective forces that impelled further increases in Asiatic Mongoloid intelligence. The anthropological evidence, however, fails to support Lynn's hypothesis. It is suggested instead that disease and war were dysgenic selective forces affecting the current IQ scores of Amerindians.

AB  - Global climate cooled from the early Eocene hothouse (similar to 52-50 Ma) to the latest Eocene (similar to 34 Ma). At the same time, the tectonic evolution of the Southern Ocean was characterized by the opening and deepening of circum-Antarctic gateways, which affected both surface- and deep-ocean circulation. The Tasmanian Gateway played a key role in regulating ocean throughflow between Australia and Antarctica. Southern Ocean surface currents through and around the Tasmanian Gateway have left recognizable tracers in the spatiotemporal distribution of plankton fossils, including organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts. This spatiotemporal distribution depends on both the physicochemical properties of the water masses and the path of surface-ocean currents. The extent to which climate and tectonics have influenced the distribution and composition of surface currents and thus fossil assemblages has, however, remained unclear. In particular, the contribution of climate change to oceanographic changes, superimposed on long-term and gradual changes induced by tectonics, is still poorly understood.
   To disentangle the effects of tectonism and climate in the southwest Pacific Ocean, we target a climatic deviation from the long-term Eocene cooling trend: the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; similar to 40 Ma). This 500 kyr phase of global warming was unrelated to regional tectonism, and thus provides a test case to investigate the ocean's physicochemical response to climate change alone. We reconstruct changes in surface-water circulation and temperature in and around the Tasmanian Gateway during the MECO through new palynological and organic geochemical records from the central Tasmanian Gateway (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1170), the Otway Basin (southeastern Australia), and the Hampden Beach section (New Zealand). Our results confirm that dinocyst communities track specific surface-ocean currents, yet the variability within the communities can be driven by superimposed temperature change. Together with published results from the east of the Tasmanian Gateway, our new results suggest a shift in surface-ocean circulation during the peak of MECO warmth. Simultaneous with high sea-surface temperatures in the Tasmanian Gateway area, pollen assemblages indicate warm temperate rainforests with paratropical elements along the southeastern margin of Australia. Finally, based on new age constraints, we suggest that a regional southeast Australian transgression might have been coincident with the MECO.

AB  - Effects of land use on temperatures during severe heat waves have been rarely studied. This paper examines land use-temperature associations during the 2011 heat wave in Greater Houston. We obtained high resolution of satellite-derived land use data from the US National Land Cover Database, and temperature observations at 138 weather stations from Weather Underground, Inc (WU) during the August of 2011, which was the hottest month in Houston since 1889. Land use regression and quantile regression methods were applied to the monthly averages of daily maximum/mean/minimum temperatures and 114 land use-related predictors. Although selected variables vary with temperature metric, distance to the coastline consistently appears among all models. Other variables are generally related to high developed intensity, open water or wetlands. In addition, our quantile regression analysis shows that distance to the coastline and high developed intensity areas have larger impacts on daily average temperatures at higher quantiles, and open water area has greater impacts on daily minimum temperatures at lower quantiles. By utilizing both land use regression and quantile regression on a recent heat wave in one of the largest US metropolitan areas, this paper provides a new perspective on the impacts of land use on temperatures. Our models can provide estimates of heat exposures for epidemiological studies, and our findings can be combined with demographic variables, air conditioning and relevant diseases information to identify 'hot spots' of population vulnerability for public health interventions to reduce heat-related health effects during heat waves.

AB  - We determined individual nest placement patterns for female leatherbacks nesting at Awa:la-Ya:lima:po, French Guiana, by measuring distance from the nest to several landscape features, such as the highest spring tide line (HSTL) and the vegetation line. Distance from the nest to the HSTL differed significantly between females, indicating the existence of individual nesting patterns. There was a significant repeatability of nest site choice relative to the HSTL, indicating that females showed within-individual consistency in their nest placement. Despite individual preferences, there was much within-individual variation and a lack of predictability in the nesting patterns; that is, the locations of subsequent nests could not be predicted based on knowledge of previous nest choices, indicating a certain degree of scatter. The significant repeatability suggests that nest choice behaviour in female leatherbacks is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. We tested sea-finding ability of hatchlings, a potential consequence of nest site choice, in Matapica, Suriname, by using orientation arenas to quantify the strength and direction of travel after emergence. The orientation tests showed that hatchlings were unable to move seaward in vegetated arenas, providing evidence that vegetation acts as a strong selective pressure driving nest placement seaward. It appears that leatherbacks have adopted a regional rather than a local optimum for nest placement patterns, possibly resulting from their weak beach fidelity and the frequent erosion and destruction of their nesting beaches. We discuss the evolutionary and conservation implications for this species in the context of current environmental changes. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Recruitment in fish populations is characterized by a high temporal variability and a considerable stochasticity. It has therefore been suggested that fish populations should be likely candidates for coexistence based on the storage mechanism. Many characteristics of fish populations such as high variability in year class strength and mortality biased towards smaller (younger) individuals are also elements that make coexistence based on the storage mechanism likely. At the same time, considerable experimental evidence usually associated with deterministic competition models, such as density dependence in individual growth rates, density dependence in populations densities, and competition-related niche dynamics, is also present. We use temporal variation in temperature, an environmental variable involving both a stochastic and a regular (seasonal) component, to illustrate how both coexistence based on a storage mechanism and patterns expected from deterministic competition models may co-occur. Temperature is as important in fish as in other poikilothermic organisms, since the carrying capacity of the population will vary with temperature through the latter's effect on the metabolic requirements of individuals. Seasonal variation in temperature will, through its effect on metabolic demands, also cause favourable periods to alternate with unfavourable periods, i.e. environmental effects covary with competition effects as assumed in lottery models. We suggest that seasonal variation in temperature will promote coexistence and at the same time allow competition to be a regular event with significant evolutionary potential. Experimental and field evidence that supports the idea of a seasonal variation in resourse limitation strongly coupled to temperature is provided.

AB  - Green infrastructure has recently risen to international prominence for its purported capacity to enhance urban sustainability, and particularly to modulate ambient temperatures in the context of climate change. We assess whether residents in a sub-tropical Australian city perceive green infrastructure as an effective climate adaptation response for reducing vulnerability to heat stress. Gold Coast City has pursued urban densification policies, such as reducing block sizes and increasing building heights, to accommodate rapid population growth. Little attention has been given to the combined impact of local heat island effects and global climate change upon lower-income residents in the city's suburban fringe, including rising energy costs associated with cooling homes. The study has three aims: to assess whether social disadvantage is associated with (1) concern about climate change impacts; (2) perceptions about the potential of green infrastructure to offer potential climate adaptive benefits; and (3) the desire for more urban greening in a working class suburb. We used a mail-back survey to elicit information related to cooling dwellings, awareness of, and concern about, climate change impacts, perceptions of the benefits of green infrastructure, and desire for more urban greening. Results indicate that despite their vulnerability to heat stress, comparatively disadvantaged residents are no more concerned about climate change; nor are they any more inclined to encourage local government to enhance neighbourhood greenery. These residents are, if anything, less likely to perceive benefits of urban greening. Our findings indicate that cultivating support for green infrastructure in disadvantaged neighbourhoods will require parallel efforts to redress inequality.

AB  - Human and natural systems have adapted to and evolved within historical climatic conditions. Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter these conditions such that onset of unprecedented climatic extremes will outpace evolutionary and adaptive capabilities. To assess whether and when future climate extremes exceed their historical windows of variability within impact-relevant socioeconomic, geopolitical, and ecological domains, we investigate the timing of perceivable changes (time of emergence; TOE) for 18 magnitude-, frequency-, and severity-based extreme temperature (10) and precipitation (8) indices using both multimodel and single-model multirealization ensembles. Under a high-emission scenario, we find that the signal of frequency- and severity-based temperature extremes is projected to rise above historical noise earliest in midlatitudes, whereas magnitude-based temperature extremes emerge first in low and high latitudes. Precipitation extremes demonstrate different emergence patterns, with severity-based indices first emerging over midlatitudes, and magnitude- and frequency-based indices emerging earliest in low and high latitudes. Applied to impact-relevant domains, simulated TOE patterns suggest (a) unprecedented consecutive dry day occurrence in >50% of 14 terrestrial biomes and 12 marine realms prior to 2100, (b) earlier perceivable changes in climate extremes in countries with lower per capita GDP, and (c) emergence of severe and frequent heat extremes well-before 2030 for the 590 most populous urban centers. Elucidating extreme-metric and domain-type TOE heterogeneities highlights the challenges adaptation planners face in confronting the consequences of elevated twenty-first century radiative forcing.

AB  - In some fishes, water chemistry or temperature affects sex determination or creates sex-specific selection pressures. The resulting population sex ratios are hard to predict from laboratory studies if the environmental triggers interact with other factors, whereas in field studies, singular observations of unusual sex ratios may be particularly prone to selective reporting. Long-term monitoring largely avoids these problems. We studied a population of grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in Lake Thun, Switzerland, that has been monitored since 1948. Samples of spawning fish have been caught about 3 times/week around spawning season, and water temperature at the spawning site has been continuously recorded since 1970. We used scale samples collected in different years to determine the average age of spawners (for life-stage specific analyses) and to identify the cohort born in 2003 (an extraordinarily warm year). Recent tissue samples were genotyped on microsatellite markers to test for genetic bottlenecks in the past and to estimate the genetically effective population size (Ne). Operational sex ratios changed from approximately 65% males before 1993 to approximately 85% males from 1993 to 2011. Sex ratios correlated with the water temperatures the fish experienced in their first year of life. Sex ratios were best explained by the average temperature juvenile fish experienced during their first summer. Grayling abundance is declining, but we found no evidence of a strong genetic bottleneck that would explain the apparent lack of evolutionary response to the unequal sex ratio. Results of other studies show no evidence of endocrine disruptors in the study area. Our findings suggest temperature affects population sex ratio and thereby contributes to population decline.

AB  - Cold acclimation is important for crop survival in environments undergoing seasonal low temperatures. It involves the induction of defensive mechanisms including the accumulation of different cryoprotective molecules among which are dehydrins (DHN). Recently several sequences coding for dehydrins were identified in white clover (Trifolium repens). This work aimed to select the most responsive to cold stress DHN analogues in search for cold stress diagnostic markers. The assessment of dehydrin transcript accumulation via RT-PCR and immunodetection performed with three antibodies against the conserved K-, Y-, and S-segment allowed to outline different dehydrin types presented in the tested samples. Both analyses confirmed that YnKn dehydrins were underrepresented in the controls but exposure to low temperature specifically induced their accumulation. Strong immunosignals corresponding to 37-40 kDa with antibodies against Y- and K-segment were revealed in cold-stressed leaves. Another 'cold-specific' band at position 52-55 kDa was documented on membranes probed with antibodies against K-segment. Real time RT-qPCR confirmed that low temperatures induced the accumulation of SKn and YnSKn, transcripts in leaves and reduced their expression in roots. Results suggest that a YnKn dehydrin transcript with GenBank ID: KC247805 and the immunosignal at 37-40 kDa, obtained with antibodies against Y- and K-segment are reliable markers for cold stress in white clover. The assessment of SKn (GenBank ID: EU846208) and YnSKn (GenBank ID: KC247804) transcript levels in leaves could serve as additional diagnostic tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Campylobacter jejuni has a large adaptive potential due to enormous genetic exchange. Factors regulating natural transformation in this food-borne pathogen are largely unknown but of interest for the application of sustained reduction strategies in the food-processing industry. Using a single cell DNA uptake assay, we visualized that recognition of methylated C. jejuni DNA was essential for the first step of DNA uptake into a DNase resistant state. Transformation rates using a resistance marker correlated with the fraction of competent bacteria, harboring one to maximally four locations of active DNA uptake, not necessarily being located at the cell pole. Competence developed with rising pH between 6.5 and 7.5 under microaerobic conditions and was nearly insensitive towards growth temperatures between 32 degrees C and 42 degrees C, CO2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 50% and growth rates. However, competence development was abolished at pH 5 or under aerobic stress conditions, in which the bacteria ceased growth but fully survived. The DNA uptake machinery in competent bacteria shut down at slightly acidic pH and was reversibly switched on upon neutralization. It was dependent on the proton motive force and, in contrast to competence development, slightly enhanced under aerobic conditions. The results suggest that natural transformation in C. jejuni occurs in the neutral and microaerobic intestinal environment for enhanced genetic diversity and pre-adaption before host switch. In addition, highly competent bacteria might be shed into the environment, still able to acquire genetic material for increased survival.

AB  - A new correlation for solution gas-oil ratio (R-s) for gas condensate reservoir was developed in this paper by using genetic programming algorithm of a commercial software (Discipulus) program. Matching PVT experimental data with an equation of state model, a commercial simulator (Eclipse simulator) was used to calculate the solution gas-oil ratio (R-s) values used in this study. More than 1,800 solution gas-oil ratio (R-s) values obtained from the analysis of eight gas condensate fluid PVT laboratory reports, selected under a wide range of reservoir temperature and pressure, composition and condensate yield, were used. Comparisons of the results showed that currently published correlations of gas-oil ratio (R-s) for gas condensate gave poor estimates of its value (the average absolute error for Standing correlation was 63.48 with a standard deviation (SD) equal to 0.724, the average absolute error for Glaso correlation was 61.19 % with a SD equal to 0.688, the average absolute error for Vasques and Beggs correlation was 52.22 % with a SD equal to 0.512, the average absolute error for Marhoun correlation was 56.34 % with a SD equal to 0.519 and the average absolute error for Fattah et al. correlation was 18.6 % with a SD equal to 0.049). The proposed new correlation improved extensively the average absolute error for gas condensate fluids. The average absolute error for the new correlation was 10.54 % with a SD equal to 0.035. Also, the hit-rate (R-2) of the new correlation was 0.9799 and the fitness variance was 0.012. The importance of the new correlation comes from depending only on readily available production data in the field and can have wide applications when representative PVT lab reports are not available.

AB  - Within a similar to 60-Myr interval in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, a major mass extinction took place at the end of Triassic, and several biotic and environmental events of lesser magnitude have been recognized. Climate warming, ocean acidification, and a biocalcification crisis figure prominently in scenarios for the end-Triassic event and have been also suggested for the early Toarcian. Radiolarians, as the most abundant silica-secreting marine microfossils of the time, provide a control group against marine calcareous taxa in testing selectivity and responses to changing environmental parameters. We analyzed the origination and extinction rates of radiolarians, using data from the Paleobiology Database and employing sampling standardization, the recently developed gap-filler equations and an improved stratigraphic resolution at the substage level. The major end-Triassic event is well-supported by a late Rhaetian peak in extinction rates. Because calcifying and siliceous organisms appear similarly affected, we consider global warming a more likely proximate trigger of the extinctions than ocean acidification. The previously reported smaller events of radiolarian turnover fail to register above background levels in our analyses. The apparent early Norian extinction peak is not significant compared to the long-term trajectory, and is probably a sampling artifact. The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, previously also thought to have caused a significant radiolarian turnover, did not significantly affect the group. Radiolarian diversity history appears unique and complexly forced, as its trajectory parallels major calcareous fossil groups at some events and deviates at others.

AB  - Studying the genetic signatures of climate-driven selection can produce insights into local adaptation and the potential impacts of climate change on populations. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is an interesting species to study local adaptation because it originated in tropical/subtropical climatic regions and subsequently spread into temperate regions. However, little is known about the genetic basis of its adaptation to temperate climates. Here, we resequenced the whole genomes of ten individual bees from a newly discovered population in temperate China and downloaded resequenced data from 35 individuals from other populations. We found that the new population is an undescribed subspecies in the M-lineage of A. mellifera (Apis mellifera sinisxinyuan). Analyses of population history show that long-term global temperature has strongly influenced the demographic history of A. m. sinisxinyuan and its divergence from other subspecies. Further analyses comparing temperate and tropical populations identified several candidate genes related to fat body and the Hippo signaling pathway that are potentially involved in adaptation to temperate climates. Our results provide insights into the demographic history of the newly discovered A. m. sinisxinyuan, as well as the genetic basis of adaptation of A. mellifera to temperate climates at the genomic level. These findings will facilitate the selective breeding of A. mellifera to improve the survival of overwintering colonies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell survival upon cryopreservation is affected by the cooling rate. However, it is difficult to model the heat transfer process or to predict the cooling curve of a cryoprotective agent (CPA) solution due to the uncertainty of its convective heat transfer coefficient (h). OBJECTIVE: To measure the h and to better understand the heat transfer process of cryovials filled with CPA solution being plunged in liquid nitrogen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The temperatures at three locations of the CPA solution in a cryovial were measured. Different h values were selected after the cooling process was modeled as natural convection heat transfer, the film boiling and the nucleate boiling, respectively. And the temperatures of the selected points are simulated based on the selected h values. h was determined when the simulated temperature best fitted the experimental temperature. RESULTS: When the experimental results were best fitted, according to natural convection heat transfer model, h(1)= 120 W/(m(2).K) while due to film boiling and nucleate boiling regimes h(f) = 5 W/(m(2).K) followed by h(n)= 245 W/(m(2).K). These values were verified by the differential cooling rates at the three locations of a cryovial. CONCLUSION: The heat transfer process during cooling in liquid nitrogen is better modeled as film boiling followed by nucleate boiling.

AB  - In order to overcome the drawbacks of conventional heating for performing surface modification process, such as long synthesis time, low of ciency, and adsorption capacity, we reported a novel approach by introducing a microwave (MW) assisted method to prepare a thio-functionalized fibrous adsorbent (PAN(mw)-Thio) for the enhanced and selective removal of Hg2+ and Cd2+ from water in this study. The properties and morphologies of the adsorbent prepared by the MW-assisted method and conventional heating were compared through FTIR, XRD, SEM characterization, and mechanical tests, and the results revealed that the MW assisted method is a satisfactory technology to enable a higher sulfur content and reinforced mechanical property for the adsorbent. The selective adsorption experiment indicated that PANmw-Thio fibers possess higher affinity toward both Hg2+ and Cd2+ in the mixed solution with Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. The optimum pH value for the adsorption of Hg2+ and Cd2+ was found to be 7 with maximum adsorption capacities of 322.8 mg.g(-1)and 350.6 mg.g(-1), respectively. The pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model have revealed good fitness with the experimental data. The XPS analysis of the PANmw-Thio fibers before and after metal adsorption demonstrated the chelation adsorption mechanism between metal ions and sulfur, and parts of the metals were believed to be converted to metallic sulfate or sulfides on the surface of the fibrous adsorbent. This fibrous adsorbent could still retain more than 80% of its original adsorption capacity when regenerated by HCl solution. The facile and rapid preparation protocol, high adsorption capacity and highly retained mechanical property of PANmw-Thio indicates its possible application in selective removal of He and Cd2+ ions from water.

AB  - With rapid and less predictable environmental change emerging as the 'new norm', understanding how individuals tolerate environmental stress via plastic, often reversible changes to the phenotype (i.e., reversible phenotypic plasticity, RPP), remains a key issue in ecology. Here, we examine the potential for better understanding how organisms overcome environmental challenges within their own lifetimes by scrutinizing a somewhat overlooked aspect of RPP, namely the rate at which it can occur. Although recent advances in the field provide indication of the aspects of environmental change where RPP rates may be of particular ecological relevance, we observe that current theoretical models do not consider the evolutionary potential of the rate of RPP. Whilst recent theory underscores the importance of environmental predictability in determining the slope of the evolved reaction norm for a given trait (i.e., how much plasticity can occur), a hitherto neglected possibility is that the rate of plasticity might be a more dynamic component of this relationship than previously assumed. If the rate of plasticity itself can evolve, as empirical evidence foreshadows, rates of plasticity may have the potential to alter the level predictability in the environment as perceived by the organism and thus influence the slope of the evolved reaction norm. However, optimality in the rate of phenotypic plasticity, its evolutionary dynamics in different environments and influence of constraints imposed by associated costs remain unexplored and may represent fruitful avenues of exploration in future theoretical and empirical treatments of the topic. We conclude by reviewing published studies of RPP rates, providing suggestions for improving the measurement of RPP rates, both in terms of experimental design and in the statistical quantification of this component of plasticity.

AB  - Rehabilitation of polluted soils with petroleum products requires a re-vegetation strategy to obtain a green mass cover that can quickly and efficiently cover the polluted soil. For the gradual recovery of the destroyed soil, it was necessary: 1. adequate soil treatments with fertilizer i.e. sewage sludge and fly ash as amendment, 2. plant species selection, 3. agronomical works in accordance with geographical position and climatic conditions. Fertilizers and fly ash create conditions for plant installation, by nutrients insurance. Our experiment was conducted in pots with 91.73 +/- 11.12 [gKg(-1) D.M (dry matter)] total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) polluted soil, fertilised with sewage sludge and fly ash 60 [that] derived from the burning of fossil fuels in thermal power plants. The selected plant species for bio-remediation is Lolium perenne. The selected plant species Lolium perenne is installed on 50-90% of the land surface giving 8 successive crops of grass in the warm season. The TPH reductions of polluted and treated soil were 38.4-56.3 [%]. The biomass did not bioaccumulate chromium at the detection limit. The amounts of cadmium, lead and zink bioaccumulated in the aerial parts were below acceptable limits. The obtained biomass can be used as animal feed or for bedding in shelters. The soil remediation efficiencies of 91.73 +/- 11.12 [gKg(-1) D.M] were directly proportional to the amount of fly ash used.

AB  - Selective laser melting is a promising powder-bed-based additive manufacturing technique for titanium alloys: near net-shaped metallic components can be produced with high resource-efficiency and cost savings. For the most commercialized titanium alloy, namely Ti-6Al-4V, the complicated thermal profile of selective laser melting manufacturing (sharp cycles of steep heating and cooling rates) usually hinders manufacturing of components in a one-step process owing to the formation of brittle martensitic microstructures unsuitable for structural applications. In this work, an intensified intrinsic heat treatment is applied during selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V powder using a scanning strategy that combines porosity-optimized processing with a very tight hatch distance. Extensive martensite decomposition providing a uniform, fine lamellar alpha + beta microstructure is obtained along the building direction. Moreover, structural evidence of the formation of the intermetallic alpha(2)-Ti3Al phase is provided. Variations in the lattice parameter of beta serve as an indicator of the microstructural degree of stabilization. Interconnected 3D networks of beta are generated in regions highly affected by the intensified intrinsic heat treatment applied. The results obtained reflect a contribution towards simultaneous selective laser melting-manufacturing and heat treatment for fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V parts.

AB  - The influence of drying temperature, sample slice thickness, and pretreatment on quality attributes like rehydration ratio, scavenging activity, color (in terms of nonenzymatic browning), and texture (in terms of hardness) of culinary banana (Musa ABB) has been evaluated in the present study. A comparative approach was made between artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM) to predict various parameters for vacuum drying of culinary banana. The effect of process variables on responses during dehydration were investigated using general factorial experimental design. This design was used to train feed-forward back-propagation ANN. The predictive capabilities of these two methodologies for optimization of process parameters were compared in terms of relative deviation (R-d). Results revealed that a properly trained ANN model is found to be more accurate in prediction as compared to RSM. The optimum condition selected from ANN/GA responses on the basis of highest fitness value revealed that culinary banana slices of 6mm thickness pretreated with 1% citric acid and dried at 76 degrees C resulted in a maximum rehydration ratio of 6.20, scavenging activity of 48.63% with minimum nonenzymatic browning of 25%, and hardness of 43.63N. Results further revealed that, in the case of rehydration ratio, temperature and pretreatment showed a positive effect while thickness had a negative effect. On the contrary, for scavenging activity, temperature showed the highest negative effect followed by slice thickness and positive effect with pretreatment. For nonenzymatic browning, thickness showed the highest negative effect but temperature and pretreatment showed a positive effect. Similarly, for hardness, all three parameters showed a negative effect.

AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are involved in colour and flavour formation of fermented meats. Their communities are established either spontaneously, as in some artisan-type products, or using a starter culture. The latter usually consists of Staphylococcus carnosus and/or Staphylococcus xylosus strains, although strains from other CNS species also have potential for application. However, it is not entirely clear how the fitness of alternative starter cultures within a fermented meat matrix compares to conventional ones and how this may be affected by processing conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of two key processing conditions, namely temperature and acidity, on the competitiveness of a cocktail of five different strains of CNS belonging to species that are potentially important for meat fermentation (Staphylococcus xylosus 2S7-2, S. carnosus 833, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus equorum DFL-S19, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus FPS1). To this end, fermented meat models consisting of cured meat batters with initial pH values of 5.3, 5.5, or 5.7 were inoculated with these strains, stuffed in containers, and incubated at 23, 30, or 37 degrees C. Both the pH level and the temperature influenced the composition of the CNS communities, giving a competitive advantage to the best adapted species. Staphylococcus xylosus preferred low temperature and mild acidity, whereas an elevated temperature selected for S. epidermidis and a low pH for S. carnosus. Under the conditions tested, S. saprophyticus and S. equorum were outcompeted by the three other CNS species. Hence, CNS communities in fermented meats are not only established based on the initial presence of specific species in the meat batter but also by their subsequent adaptation to the processing conditions during fermentation, potentially overruling the use of starter cultures.

AB  - Habitat specialists maximize their fitness by using a subset of the habitats that are potentially available to them and fare poorly if they move elsewhere. The factors that constrain habitat use are diverse and often difficult to identify, but are important to distinguish if we are to understand the trade-offs that drive species to become specialists. In the present study, we investigated habitat use in a fossorial skink, Lerista labialis, and explore the factors that confine it to the crests of sand dunes in the Simpson Desert, central Australia. Models positing that L. labialis selects dune crests because of their sparse cover of vegetation, more favourable temperatures, and greater abundance of preferred prey, received no support. Instead, a model positing that dune crests provide soft and less compacted sand that facilitates movement by L. labialis, was strongly supported. Sand on the crests was consistently softer that that on the sides and swales of the dunes; the skinks preferred soft rather than hard sand for movement in captivity, and were captured more often on experimentally softened sand than on compacted sand in the field. There was no evidence that L. labialis responds to attributes of the substrate other than softness because captive animals used loose sand from the dune crests, sides, and swales equally. We suggest that the dune crest environment allows L. labialis to reduce the energetic costs of locomotion, provides priority of access to the subterranean galleries of its termite prey, and also a secure refuge from surface-active predators and extreme surface temperatures.

AB  - Warmer climate and more frequent extreme droughts will posemajor threats to forest ecosystems. Past demography processes due to post-glacial recolonization and adaptation to local environmental conditions are among themain contributors to genetic differentiation processes among provenances. Assessing the intra-specific variability of tree growth responses to such changes is crucial to explore a species' potential to cope with climate warming. We combined growth-related traits derived from tree-ring width series with neutral genetic information of 18 European provenances of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) growing in two common garden experiments in Switzerland.
   Analyses based on neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed that the studied provenances grouped into three longitudinal clusters. These three genetic clusters showed differences in growth traits (height and DBH), with the provenances from the eastern cluster exhibiting the highest growth. The Pyrenees cluster showed significantly lower recovery and resilience to the extreme drought of 2003 as well as lower values of growth autocorrelation. QST-FST and correlation analyseswith climate of provenance origin suggest that the differences among provenances found in some traits result from natural selection.
   Our study suggests that the last post-glacial re-colonization and natural selection are themajor drivers explaining the intra-specific variability in growth of silver fir across Europe. These findings highlight the importance of combining dendroecology and genetic analyses on fitness-related traits to assess the potential of a species to cope with global environmental change and provide insights to support assisted gene flow to ensure the persistence of the species in European forests.

AB  - Active control algorithms for space telescopes are less mature than those for large ground telescopes due to differences in the wavefront control problems. Active wavefront control for space telescopes at L2, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), requires weighing control costs against the benefits of correcting wavefront perturbations that are a predictable byproduct of the observing schedule, which is known and determined in advance. To improve the control algorithms for these telescopes, we have developed a model that calculates the temperature and wavefront evolution during a hypothetical mission, assuming the dominant wavefront perturbations are due to changes in the spacecraft attitude with respect to the sun. Using this model, we show that the wavefront can be controlled passively by introducing scheduling constraints that limit the allowable attitudes for an observation based on the observation duration and the mean telescope temperature. We also describe the implementation of a predictive controller designed to prevent the wavefront error (WFE) from exceeding a desired threshold. This controller outperforms simpler algorithms even with substantial model error, achieving a lower WFE without requiring significantly more corrections. Consequently, predictive wavefront control based on known spacecraft attitude plans is a promising approach for JWST and other future active space observatories. (C) The Authors.

AB  - Background Bisphenol A is an important organic chemical as an intermediate, final and inert ingredient in manufacturing of many important products like polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins, flame retardants, food-drink packaging coating, and other. BPA is an endocrine disruptor compound that mimics the function of estrogen causing damage to reproductive organs. Bacterial degradation has been consider as a cost effective and eco-friendly method for BPA degradation compared with physical and chemical methods. This study aimed to isolate and identify bacterial strain capable to degrade and tolerate high concentrations of this pollutant, studying the factors affecting the degradation process and study the degradation mechanism of this strain. Results YC-AE1 is a Gram negative bacterial strain isolated from soil and identified as Pseudomonas putida by 16S rRNA gene sequence and BIOLOG identification system. This strain found to have a high capacity to degrade the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A (BPA). Response surface methodology using central composite design was used to statistically optimize the environmental factors during BPA degradation and the results obtained by significant model were 7.2, 30 degrees C and 2.5% for optimum initial pH, temperature and inoculum size, respectively. Prolonged incubation period with low NaCl concentration improve the biodegradation of BPA. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed high coefficient of determination, R-2 and Adj-R-2 which were 0.9979 and 0.9935, respectively. Substrate analysis found that, strain YC-AE1 could degrade a wide variety of bisphenol A-related pollutants such as bisphenol B, bisphenol F, bisphenol S, Dibutyl phthalate, Diethylhexyl phthalate and Diethyl phthalate in varying proportion. Pseudomonas putida YC-AE1 showed high ability to degrade a wide range of BPA concentrations (0.5-1000 mg l(- 1)) with completely degradation for 500 mg l(- 1) within 72 h. Metabolic intermediates detected in this study by HPLC-MS were identified as 4,4-dihydroxy-alpha-methylstilbene, p-hydroxybenzaldeyde, p-hydroxyacetophenone, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 4-hydroxyphenacyl alcohol, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol, 1,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoate. Conclusions This study reports Pseudomonas putida YC-AE1 as BPA biodegrader with high performance in degradation and tolerance to high BPA concentration. It exhibited strong degradation capacity and prominent adaptability towards a wide range of environmental conditions. Moreover, it degrades BPA in a short time via two different degradation pathways.

TI  - Effect of monocropping on maize yield on meadow soil in long-term fertilization experiments
T2  - NOVENYTERMELES
LA  - Hungarian
AB  - The yield changes' of maize produced in crop-rotation and monoculture were studied on the basis of data collected from filed experiments on meadow soil. The experiments are part of the National Long-Term Fertilization Experiment started in 1966.
   Applied crop-rotations in the experiment: a) triculture: pea - wheat - maize - maize;
   b) biculture: wheat - maize - wheat;
   c) monoculture: since 1966.
   The soil characteristics of the experiments are: difficult tillage, slow mineralization of N in the springtime and considerable absorption of P, K.
   The study covers the period between 1982-1993. I present the amounts of the yearly precipitation (Table 1.) and precipitation fallen in the vegetation period of maize compared to the average. Heavy drought occurred in 1982-83-86-90-93. During the examined 12 years the precipitation was 1600.7 mm less than the 50-years average. Because of the global warming half of the examined years were droughty.
   Maize can tolerate the partial monoculture considerably well, but after 10-15 years of monocropping the yield decreases by 1-3 t/ha in droughty years compared to the yields achieved in crop rotation. Monocultural maize yields decreased significanty in 1983,'90,'92,'93.
   The best forecrop for maize was the wheat. The forecrop influences the requierement for fertilizer. The best yields were obtained as follows: after wheat in triculture (pea-wheat-maize) with a dose of 50-60 kg/ha N, in biculture (wheat-maize) with a dose of 60-80 kg/ha N, after maize in biculture with a dose of 80-100 kg/ha N, and in monoculture with a dose of 100-120 kg/ha N.
   In monoculture cropping the number of bacteria in the soil decreased significantly. The number of bacteria in 1 g soil was 59 million after wheat, 285 million after maize, and only 16 million in monoculture cropping, which can effect the soil life considerably.
   In monoculture cropping the Zn content of the grain decreased by 4-5 mg/kg which can limit the yield or cause losses in nutritive value.
   The yield decrease of monocultural maize can be explained by the impoverishment of the soil water supply. Thus the monocropping of maize, particularly in areas with poor rainfall, must be placed into crop-rotation after 10-15 years of monoculture. The risk of monocropping should be decreased by using partial monoculture, a hybrid with good adaptability, 5-10 thousand less plant density per hectare and irrigation if the conditions are given.

AB  - The exposure of cells to low doses of stress induces adaptive survival responses that protect cells against subsequent exposure to toxic stress. The ability of cells to resist subsequent toxic stress following exposure to low dose heat stress at 40 degrees C is known as mild thermotolerance. Mild thermotolerance involves increased expression of heat shock proteins and antioxidants, but the initiating factors in this response are not understood. This study aims to understand the role of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway in acquisition of mild thermotolerance at 40 degrees C, and secondly, whether the Nrf2 pathway could be involved in the protective effect of thermotolerance against heat-shock (42 degrees C)-induced apoptosis. During cell preconditioning at 40 degrees C, protein expression of the Nrf2 transcription factor increased after 15-60 min. In addition, levels of the Nrf2 targets MnSOD, catalase, heme oxygenase-1, glutamate cysteine ligase and Hsp70 increased at 40 degrees C. Levels of these Nrf2 targets were enhanced by Nrf2 activator oltipraz and decreased by shRNA targeting Nrf2. Levels of pro-oxidants increased after 30-60 min at 40 degrees C. Pro-oxidant levels were decreased by oltipraz and increased by knockdown of Nrf2. Increased Nrf2 expression and catalase activity at 40 degrees C were inhibited by the antioxidant PEG-catalase and by p53 inhibitor pifithrin-oc. These results suggest that mild thermotolerance (40 degrees C) increases cellular pro-oxidant levels, which in turn activate Nrf2 and its target genes. Moreover, Nrf2 contributes to the protective effect of thermotolerance against heat-shock (42 degrees C)-induced apoptosis, because Nrf2 activation by oltipraz enhanced thermotolerance, whereas Nrf2 knockdown partly reversed thermotolerance. Improved knowledge about the different protective mechanisms that mild thermotolerance can activate is crucial for the potential use of this adaptive survival response to treat stress-related diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary Atlantic salmon is a diadromous species that has the particularity that it returns to reproduce to its river of birth. This means that, in most cases, each river can be considered a population and that these populations can be adapted to the characteristics of the river. The Atlantic Salmon in the rivers of the Iberian Peninsula has been in decline since the 80's of the last century. At that time, to alleviate the decline in the number of individuals, the rivers were stocked with salmon from Scotland and other northern European rivers, but the result was not positive. In this work, we studied eight salmon populations using a 220,000 high-density SNP array (Affymetrix) specific to Atlantic salmon. Our results revealed potential evidence of local adaptation for North Spanish and Scottish populations, which may be the cause of the failure of restocking programs. In addition, by performing a review of previous studies, we demonstrated that, as suggested, NADP-dependent malic enzyme-2 is a candidate for local adaptation in salmon from the Iberian Peninsula. Pollution and other anthropogenic effects have driven a decrease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Iberian Peninsula. The restocking effort carried out in the 1980s, with salmon from northern latitudes with the aim of mitigating the decline of native populations, failed, probably due to the deficiency in adaptation of foreign salmon from northern Europe to the warm waters of the Iberian Peninsula. This result would imply that the Iberian populations of Atlantic salmon have experienced local adaptation in their past evolutionary history, as has been described for other populations of this species and other salmonids. Local adaptation can occur by divergent selections between environments, favoring the fixation of alleles that increase the fitness of a population in the environment it inhabits relative to other alleles favored in another population. In this work, we compared the genomes of different populations from the Iberian Peninsula (Atlantic and Cantabric basins) and Scotland in order to provide tentative evidence of candidate SNPs responsible for the adaptive differences between populations, which may explain the failures of restocking carried out during the 1980s. For this purpose, the samples were genotyped with a 220,000 high-density SNP array (Affymetrix) specific to Atlantic salmon. Our results revealed potential evidence of local adaptation for North Spanish and Scottish populations. As expected, most differences concerned the comparison of the Iberian Peninsula with Scotland, although there were also differences between Atlantic and Cantabric populations. A high proportion of the genes identified are related to development and cellular metabolism, DNA transcription and anatomical structure. A particular SNP was identified within the NADP-dependent malic enzyme-2 (mMEP-2*), previously reported by independent studies as a candidate for local adaptation in salmon from the Iberian Peninsula. Interestingly, the corresponding SNP within the mMEP-2* region was consistent with a genomic pattern of divergent selection.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global threat due to the ability of bacteria to quickly evolve in response to the selection pressure induced by anti-infective drugs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics against resistant bacteria. In this review, we discuss pathways involving bacterial protein biogenesis as attractive antibacterial targets since many of them are essential for bacterial survival and virulence. We discuss the structural understanding of various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis, which in turn can be utilized for rational antibiotic design. We highlight efforts made towards developing inhibitors of these pathways with insights into future possibilities and challenges. We also briefly discuss other potential targets related to protein biogenesis.

AB  - Cells of a diploid line obtained from embryos with the Down's syndrome, known to be unable to repair gamma-induced DNA damage, were treated with natural (garlic extract, retinol) and synthetic (crown compound) antimutagens and with adapting factors (heat shock, low CdCl2 concentrations, 10(-8) M). The protective effect was evaluated by registering DNA breaks and cell survival, and the protection coefficients were calculated. The most effective results were obtained with the use of the garlic extract and retinol. No protection of the DNA structure was observed when cells were treated with low concentrations of cadmium chloride and then with high concentrations, i. e., no adaptive response (AR) was formed under these conditions. The spectrum of proteins in treated and control cells as well as detoxication genes (GSTM1, GSTT1, CYP1A1) were determined.

AB  - Introduction Atractylodes Macrocephala Rhizoma (AMR) is a traditional Chinese medicine containing several sesquiterpenoids with a series of effects. These bioactive compounds may be used as chemical markers for the quality control of AMR. It is necessary to optimise the extraction method and conditions in order to improve extraction productivity. Objective To develop a simple and effective method for the extraction of sesquiterpenoids from AMR and then to simultaneously determine four sesquiterpenoids, selina-4 (14), 7(11)-dien-8-one (SA), atractylenolide II (AII), atractylenolide III (AIII) and atractylenolide VII (AVII), in AMR. Methodology Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was optimised by central composite design (CCD) to obtain the maximum efficiency. The gas chromatography method was validated and applied for the quantification of four sesquiterpenoids. Results The optimum values of factors were: particle size (120?mesh), extraction time (26?min), extraction temperature (39 degrees C) and 31?mL of chloroform. The selectivity, linear range, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), accuracy, precision and repeatability of the method developed indicated its validity. The application of the method showed that the contents of four sesquiterpenoids in AMR were rather variable. Conclusion The results indicated that the described GC method could be used for the quality control of AMR and its related preparations. Meanwhile, this research revealed that UAE under optimum conditions could be considered as a powerful tool for the extraction of phytochemicals from plants. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper represents an overview of the elements of the user-friendly simulation system, developed for computational analysis and optimization of the quality and productivity of the electromagnetically direct-chill cast semi-products from aluminium alloys. The system also allows the computational estimation of the design changes of the casting equipment. To achieve this goal, the electromagnetic and the thermofluid process parameters are coupled to the evolution of Lorentz force, temperature, velocity, concentration, strain and stress fields as well as microstructure evolution. This forms a multi-physics and multi-scale problem of great complexity, which has not been demonstrated before. The macroscopic fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, and electromagnetic solution framework is based on local strong-form meshless formulation, involving the radial basis functions and monomials as trial functions, and local collocation or weighted least squares approximation. It is coupled to the micro-scale by incorporating the point automata solution concept. The entire macro-micro solution concept does not require meshing and space integration. The solution procedure can be easily and efficiently automatically adapted in node redistribution and/or refinement sense, which is of utmost importance when coping with fields exhibiting sharp gradients, which occur in the phase-change problems. The simulation system is coded from scratch in modern Fortran. The elements of the experimental validation of the system and the demonstration of its use for round billet casting in IMPOL Aluminium Industry are shown.

AB  - Global diversity patterns are thought to result from a combination of environmental and historical factors. This study tests the set of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses proposed to explain the global variation in present-day coretop diversity in the macroperforate planktonic foraminifera, a clade with an exceptional fossil record. Within this group, marine surface sediment assemblages are thought to represent an accurate, although centennial to millennial time-averaged, representation of recent diversity patterns. Environmental variables chosen to capture ocean temperature, structure, productivity and seasonality were used to model a range of diversity measures across the world's oceans. Spatial autoregressive models showed that the same broad suite of environmental variables were important in shaping each of the four largely independent diversity measures (rarefied species richness, Simpson's evenness, functional richness and mean evolutionary age). Sea-surface temperature explains the largest portion of diversity in all four diversity measures, but not in the way predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology. Vertical structure could be linked to increased diversity through the strength of stratification, but not through the depth of the mixed layer. There is limited evidence that seasonal turnover explains diversity patterns. There is evidence for functional redundancy in the low-latitude sites. The evolutionary mechanism of deep-time stability finds mixed support whilst there is relatively little evidence for an out-of-the-tropics model. These results suggest the diversity patterns of planktonic foraminifera cannot be explained by any one environmental variable or proposed mechanism, but instead reflect multiple processes acting in concert.

AB  - Probiotics used in aquaculture are mostly from non-fish sources, as a result ineffective in eliciting the desired effects in aquatic animals. In this study, threeBacillusspecies were isolated from the digestive tract of freshwater fishOreochromis niloticusand characterised based on their morphological, biochemical and evolutionary relationships. Their probiotic potentials were evaluated based on their ability to tolerate low pH, bile salt concentration, high temperatures, adhesion ability (auto-aggregation and hydrophobicity), haemolytic activity and antimicrobial activity including biosafety assay. ThreeBacillusstrains identified asBacillus velezensisTPS3N (MK130897),Bacillus subtilisTPS4 (MK130899) andBacillus amyloliquefaciensTPS17 (MK130898) were designated as TPS3N, TPS4 and TPS17, respectively. TPS3N and TPS17 were alpha-haemolytic, while TPS4 was gamma-haemolytic. The three isolates had higher viability ability after exposure to higher temperatures (80 degrees C, 90 degrees C and 100 degrees C) and were resistant to low pH (1) and bile salt concentration (0.5%) as well as high cell surface hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation. The three isolates were compatible with one another and thus can be used in consortia. These strains were susceptible to gentamicin, cephalexin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, kanamycin, amikacin, penicillin, cefoperazone, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin (except TPS4) and furazolidone (except TPS17). The antimicrobial assessment showed that among the three isolates, TPS3N and TPS17 exhibited good antimicrobial activity against the three fish pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae,Aeromonas hydrophila,Vibrio harveyi), while TPS4 was effective againstStreptococcus agalactiaeonly. The results of this work suggest thatBacillusstrains TPS3N, TPS4 and TPS17 could be considered as potential probiotics in tilapia aquaculture.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of activation gas type (CO, syngas and H-2), activation temperature and pressure on FTS activity and selectivity. A series of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reactions in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for 400-1000 h were carried using a Fe/K/Si = 100/1.25/5.1 (atomic ratio) catalyst. The highest CO conversion was obtained for a CO activated catalyst while hydrogen activation yielded the lowest, regardless of the activation temperature. A higher activation temperature yielded a higher peak CO conversion during the induction period. FTS activity for syngas pretreatment showed a dependency on the activation pressure. In addition to the FTS activity, CO activation showed the best overall hydrocarbon productivity. The lowest hydrocarbon production rate was obtained with the H activated catalyst. Carbon monoxide activation also yielded the lowest methane selectivity and activation temperature did not affect the CH4 selectivity in the range of 230-270 degreesC. Activation temperature had little effect on the formation of olefin (C-2-C-20) and the olefin fraction decreased in the order of H-2>syngas>CO activation. The induction period was present following each of the three pretreatments: CO, H-2, or syngas with the same H-2/CO ratio as used during the synthesis period. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The strategy for growth of nuclear power in India was planned nearly sixty years ago, noting the rather small uranium and large thorium reserves in the country. This has prompted India to adopt the well-known three stage programme. The first stage is primarily based on the Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs). The evolution of technology of PHWRs is discussed in the first part of this paper. India has constructed eighteen PHWRs, has achieved impressive availability factors and some of these reactors have achieved annual capacity factors of nearly hundred percent in the recent past. Having installed a nuclear power generation capacity of 6780 MWe (4460 MWe from PHWRs, 2000 MWe from PWRs and 320 MWe from BWRs), India is now poised to launch a major expansion programme. This will be based on the increased availability of uranium from import and from the augmented domestic supply. In the immediate future, the nuclear power capacity will grow by installing a series of indigenous PHWRs in addition to, light water reactors built under international civil nuclear cooperation agreements. The growth of nuclear capacity in this period is aimed at increasing the share of nuclear power in meeting the base-load demand of non-carbon electricity required for the rapid economic growth in the country.
   India embarked on its second stage programme with the successful operation of a research reactor named Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR). Based on the experience of FBTR and following the development of all the required enabling technologies in India, the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) of 500 MWe (gross) capacity has been designed, constructed and is now at an advanced stage of commissioning. A large increase in the nuclear power generation capacity is envisaged through deployment of fast breeder reactors. These reactors will not only help in building up nuclear power capacity but also, in due course, enable conversion of thorium into fissile U-233, which will fuel the reactors in the third stage of India's nuclear programme. The adoption of the closed fuel cycle for both thermal and fast reactors has dual objectives: multiplying the fissile inventory by fertile to fissile conversion and reducing the burden of long lived radioactive waste-both being essential for attaining near sustainability of nuclear power.
   India has designed an Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). This reactor can use one of the following fuels:
   (i) Low enriched uranium dioxide-thorium dioxide based mixed oxide (MOX) fuel primarily in once through mode.
   (ii) Plutonium dioxide thorium dioxide MOX fuel in the closed fuel cycle mode. Eventually when enough of U-233 is generated the reactor can operate with the U-233 thorium MOX fuel.
   A large number of passive safety features are incorporated in this design.
   As a part of the long term objective of the development of Accelerator Driven Sub-critical Systems (ADSS), work on the development of high power linear accelerator has been initiated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bacteria have evolved an array of adaptive mechanisms enabling them to survive and grow in the presence of different environmental stresses. These mechanisms include either modifications of the membrane or changes in the overall energy status, cell morphology, and cell surface properties. Long-term adaptations are dependent on transcriptional regulation, the induction of anabolic pathways, and cell growth. However, to survive sudden environmental changes, bacterial short-term responses are essential to keep the cells alive after the occurrence of an environmental stress factor such as heat shock or the presence of toxic organic solvents. Thus far, two main short-term responses are known. On the one hand, a fast isomerization of cis into trans unsaturated fatty leads to a quick rigidification of the cell membrane, a mechanism known in some genera of Gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, a fast, effective, and ubiquitously present countermeasure is the release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from the cell surface leading to a rapid increase in cell surface hydrophobicity and finally to the formation of cell aggregates and biofilms. These immediate response mechanisms just allow the bacteria to stay physiologically active and to employ long-term responses to assure viability upon changing environmental conditions. Here, we provide insight into the two aforementioned rapid adaptive mechanisms affecting ultimately the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - While ocean acidification is a global issue, the severity of ecosystem effects is likely to vary considerably at regional scales. The lack of understanding of how biogeographically separated populations will respond to acidification hampers our ability to predict the future of vital ecosystems. Cold-water corals are important drivers of biodiversity in ocean basins across the world and are considered one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to ocean acidification. We tested the short-term physiological response of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa to three pH treatments (pH = 7.9, 7.75 and 7.6) for Gulf of Mexico (USA) and Tisler Reef (Norway) populations, and found that reductions in seawater pH elicited contrasting responses. Gulf of Mexico corals exhibited reductions in net calcification, respiration and prey capture rates with decreasing pH. In contrast, Tisler Reef corals showed only slight reductions in net calcification rates under decreased pH conditions while significantly elevating respiration and capture rates. These differences are likely the result of environmental differences (depth, pH, food supply) between the two regions, invoking the potential for local adaptation or acclimatization to alter their response to global change. However, it is also possible that variations in the methodology used in the experiments contributed to the observed differences. Regardless, these results provide insights into the resilience of L. pertusa to ocean acidification as well as the potential influence of regional differences on the viability of species in future oceans.

AB  - Drought or water deficit stress is one of the main environmental stresses affecting plants, resulting in reduced productivity and crop loss. Black pepper, a major spice cultivated across the globe, is drought sensitive and water stress often results in plant death. The present study compared the difference in physiological parameters: relative water content (RWC) and cell membrane leakage, and also analyzed the differential expression of 11 drought responsive genes in drought tolerant and drought sensitive black pepper genotypes. Tolerant black pepper genotype exhibited significantly higher RWC and lower cell membrane leakage 10 days after stress induction than the sensitive genotype. The relative expressions of the 11 selected drought responsive genes were normalized against ubiquitin and RNA-binding protein which was identified as the most stable reference genes in black pepper under the present experimental condition using the RefFinder software. Dehydrin showed the highest transcript accumulation in both the black pepper genotypes under drought stress condition and the relative expression of the gene was higher in the tolerant genotype compared to the susceptible. Similar pattern of higher relative expression was also observed in the stress responsive gene, osmotin. The membrane protein aquaporin and the transcription factor bZIP were relatively down-regulated in the tolerant genotype. The differential expression of these important drought responsive genes in tolerant genotype of black pepper indicates its further usefulness in developing varieties with improved water stress tolerance.

AB  - Azelaic acid (AzA) and its derivatives have been known to be effective in the treatment of acne and various cutaneous hyperpigmentary disorders. The esterification of azelaic acid with lauryl alcohol (LA) to produce dilaurylazelate using immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (Novozym 435) is reported. Response surface methodology was selected to optimize the reaction conditions. A well-fitting quadratic polynomial regression model for the acid conversion was established with regards to several parameters, including reaction time and temperature, enzyme amount, and substrate molar ratios. The regression equation obtained by the central composite design of RSM predicted that the optimal reaction conditions included a reaction time of 360 min, 0.14 g of enzyme, a reaction temperature of 46 degrees C, and a molar ratio of substrates of 1:4.1. The results from the model were in good agreement with the experimental data and were within the experimental range (R-2 of 0.9732). The inhibition zone can be seen at dilaurylazelate ester with diameter 9.0 +/- 0.1 mm activities against Staphylococcus epidermidis S273. The normal fibroblasts cell line (3T3) was used to assess the cytotoxicity activity of AzA and AzA derivative, which is dilaurylazelate ester. The comparison of the IC50 (50% inhibition of cell viability) value for AzA and AzA derivative was demonstrated. The IC50 value for AzA was 85.28 mu g/mL, whereas the IC50 value for AzA derivative was more than 100 mu g/mL. The 3T3 cell was still able to survive without any sign of toxicity from the AzA derivative; thus, it was proven to be non-toxic in this MTT assay when compared with AzA.

AB  - Optimal placement of sensors in protected cultivation systems to maximize monitoring and control capabilities can guide effective decision-making toward achieving the highest levels of productivity and other desirable outcomes. Reinforcement learning, unlike conventional machine learning methods such as supervised learning does not require large, labeled datasets thereby providing opportunities for more efficient and unbiased design optimization. With the objective of determining the optimal locations of sensors in a greenhouse, a multi-arm bandit problem was formulated using the Beta distribution and solved by the Thompson sampling algorithm. A total of 56 two-in-one sensors designed to measure both internal air temperature and relative humidity were installed at a vertical distance of 1 m and a horizontal distance of 3m apart in a greenhouse used to cultivate strawberries. Data was collected over a period of seven months covering four major seasons, February (winter), March, April, and May (spring), June and July (summer), and October (autumn) and analyzed separately. Results showed unique patterns for sensor selection for temperature and relative humidity during the different months. Furthermore, temperature and relative humidity each had different optimal location selections suggesting that two-in-one sensors might not be ideal in these cases. The use of reinforcement learning to design optimal sensor placement in this study aided in identifying 10 optimal sensor locations for monitoring and controlling temperature and relative humidity.

AB  - In the present work, the viability of the selective fractionation of carbohydrate mixtures (lactose-lactulose) using supercritical CO2 has been evaluated. As a first step towards the optimization of the fractionation process, the composition of the co-solvent used in the supercritical phase was studied by considering different ethanol:water mixtures, which undoubtedly determined the selectivity of the extraction process. The co-solvent which provided a purity higher than 95% in lactulose (a mixture ethanol:water 95:5) was selected to perform the optimization of the extraction conditions able to provide high extraction recoveries. Optimization was carried out using a full factorial (2 levels) design and considering as factors the extraction pressure (from 100 to 300 bar), the extraction temperature (from 60 to 100 degrees C and the modifier flow rate (from 0.2 to 0.4 mL/min, which corresponded to a total co-solvent percentage ranging from 4 to 18 vol.%). The responses evaluated were the amount (mg) of lactulose and lactose extracted and their recoveries (%). The statistical analysis of the results provided mathematical models for each response variable. The corresponding parameters were estimated by multiple linear regression (NILR) and high determination coefficients (higher than 0.98) were obtained. Then, the mathematical model was employed to predict the behavior of the different responses selected, as a function of the main variables involved in the process. The optimum conditions for selectively extracting lactulose with high recoveries were 100 bar, 100 degrees C and 0.2 mL/min of co-solvent (4% modifier in the supercritical phase); at these conditions, a 45% recovery was achieved with a purity higher than 95%.

AB  - The processing of rice (Oryza sativa L.) generates large quantities of lignocellulosic wastes termed rice husks (RH). Numerous researchers have proposed biomass gasification as the panacea to the waste disposal and management challenges posed by RH. However, a comprehensive analysis of RH gasification is required to examine the research landscape and future directions on the area. The research landscape and global developments on RH gasification from 1995 to 2019 are examined through bibliometric analysis of 228 publications extracted from the Web of Science. Bioresource Technology is considered the most influential journal on the topic, whereas China is the most productive nation due to government policies and research funding. The most productive organization is the Harbin Institute of Technology, which is due to the significant contributions of Zhao YiJun and co-workers. Keyword analysis revealed three crucial research themes: gasification, biomass, and rice husks. The literature revealed that the syngas yield, distribution, and performance of RH gasification are significantly influenced by temperature, equivalence ratio, selected reactor, and gasifying medium. The techno-economic analysis of RH gasification revealed that government interventions such as high sales rates and low investment costs could enhance the commercial viability of the technology. Furthermore, the integration of RH gasification with carbon capture utilization and storage could promote the decarbonization of power plants, negative emissions, and net-zero climate goals. Overall, the paper provides valuable information for future researchers to identify strategic collaborators, journal publications, and research frontiers yet unexplored.

AB  - Deuterium broad-line NMR experiments performed on crystalline tetragonal urea over a temperature range of 30-120-degrees-C allowed us to measure the rate of cis-trans isomerization as well as a previously described ''whole body'' two-site flip about the carbonyl. To follow the cis-trans rate, we found it useful to employ a selective inversion-recovery experiment using a DANTE sequence applied at parallel edge of the powder pattern followed by a variable mixing time and quadrupolar echo detection. T1 anisotropy and line shape experiments were also used to measure the whole body flip and the cis-trans isomerization. The barriers of 15.5 +/- 1.2 and 18.5 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol for the whole body motion and the cis-trans isomerization, respectively, are of the same order as previously suggested values and much higher than the corresponding solution values measured in protic and aprotic media. Both motions display modest or undetectable isotope effects when deuterons are replaced with protons and the residual deuterons are probed. We also estimate a barrier of 21.7 +/- 2 kcal/mol for the cis-trans isomerization in rhombohedral acetamide, which is a much higher than the value in solution. Thus, we demonstrate the viability of this approach in addressing very slow motions even for samples characterized by long spin-lattice relaxation times and poor signal to noise. The significant difference in the barrier heights between acetamide and urea in the solid state as compared with previous solution measurements is also discussed in relation to hydrogen bonding.

AB  - Parasite intensity dynamics can be strongly affected by ecosystem abiotic components. We conducted this study to investigate how the intensity of Argulus sp. is influenced by physicochemical factors in three water bodies - river, fish farm, and reservoir - and to find the occurrence of Argulus sp. under different conditions. Argulus sp. specimens were collected using different methods - gill-netting 30 x 1.5 m, 40 mm mesh monofilament net and set from a small boat, beach seining and plankton net - from July 2010 until Jun 2011 at Guangdong province, China. Main water parameters taken for the assessment consisting of temperature, pH, DO, biochemical oxygen demand of 5 days (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH (4) (+) , total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). The results show that the ratio of female to male Argulus sp. during the studied period was 2.3:1. The presence and intensity of Argulus sp. were temperature-dependent and variable; pH values were lower than standers with high intensity of Argulus sp. Argulus sp. has the ability to live in low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. Relatively high concentrations of BOD5, COD, NH (4) (+) , TN and TP were detected with related variable intensity of Argulus sp., which is supposed to be a freshwater fish ectoparasite found in polluted ecosystems. It is concluded that the fish ectoparasite Argulus sp. have a strong potency of genetic adaptation impacted by environmental factors. However, this needs further study in order to gain insight into the question of the likelihood of adaptation to abiotic factors' variation.

AB  - Magnetic Cooper-pairing mechanisms have been proposed for heavy-fermion and cuprate superconductors; however, strong electron correlations(1) and complications arising from a pseudogap(2-4) or competing phases(5) have precluded commonly accepted theories. In the iron arsenides, the proximity of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the phase diagram(6,7), the apparently weak electron-phonon coupling(8) and the 'resonance peak' in the superconducting spin-excitation spectrum(9-11) have also fostered the hypothesis of magnetically mediated Cooper pairing. However, as most theories of superconductivity are based on a pairing boson of sufficient spectral weight in the normal state, detailed knowledge of the spin-excitation spectrum above the superconducting transition temperature T-c is required to assess the viability of this hypothesis(12,13). Using inelastic neutron scattering we have studied the spin excitations in optimally doped BaFe1.85Co0.15As2 (T-c = 25 K) over a wide range of temperatures and energies. We present the results in absolute units and find that the normal-state spectrum carries a weight comparable to that in underdoped cuprates(14,15). In contrast to cuprates, however, the spectrum agrees well with predictions of the theory of nearly antiferromagnetic metals(16), without the aforementioned complications. We also show that the temperature evolution of the resonance energy monotonically follows the closing of the superconducting energy gap Delta, as expected from conventional Fermi-liquid approaches(17,18). Our observations point to a surprisingly simple theoretical description of the spin dynamics in the iron arsenides and provide a solid foundation for models of magnetically mediated superconductivity.

AB  - In selective retina treatment (SRT) spatial confined tissue damage in the absorbing retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is obtained by applying microsecond laser pulses. The damage in the RPE is caused by transient microbubbles forming around laser heated melanin granules inside the cells. For treatment of RPE related diseases, SRT is thought to share the therapeutic benefits of conventional photocoagulation but without affecting the photoreceptors. A drawback for effective clinical SRT is that the laser-induced lesions are ophthalmoscopically invisible. Therefore, a real-time feedback system for dosimetry is demanded in order to avoid undertreatment or unwanted collateral damage to the adjacent tissue, which is observed at about twofold threshold radiant exposure for RPE damage.
   We demonstrate that interferometry is capable of detecting microbubbles at threshold irradiation for RPE damage. A porcine ex-vivo RPE model, which was irradiated by a Nd:YLF laser (350ns/17OOns@527nm), was employed. The irradiated area was simultaneously probed by a Michelson interferometer. Cell viability assays were performed after irradiation. Cell damage was compared to the interferometric data.
   At threshold for cell damage a change in the interferometric transients was observed due to microbubble formation. Thus, interferometry could serve as a non-contact real-time dosimetry control during selective targeting of the RPE in vivo. From the time resolved motion of the bubble interface, which is determined by interferometry, the maximum bubble size is obtained. This gives an estimation for the damage range in the tissue. Knowledge of the damage range as a function of the irradiation parameters is helpful in optimizing SRT.

AB  - There is a growing capability to project the impacts and economic effects of climate change across multiple sectors. This information is needed to inform decisions regarding the diversity and magnitude of future climate impacts and explore how mitigation and adaptation actions might affect these risks. Here, we summarize results from sectoral impact models applied within a consistent modelling framework to project how climate change will affect 22 impact sectors of the United States, including effects on human health, infrastructure and agriculture. The results show complex patterns of projected changes across the country, with damages in some sectors (for example, labour, extreme temperature mortality and coastal property) estimated to range in the hundreds of billions of US dollars annually by the end of the century under high emissions. Inclusion of a large number of sectors shows that there are no regions that escape some mix of adverse impacts. Lower emissions, and adaptation in relevant sectors, would result in substantial economic benefits.

AB  - The martian surface environment exhibits extremes of salinity, temperature, desiccation, and radiation that would make it difficult for terrestrial microbes to survive. Recent evidence suggests that martian soils contain high concentrations of MgSO4 minerals. Through warming of the soils, meltwater derived from subterranean ice-rich regolith may exist for an extended period of time and thus allow the propagation of terrestrial microbes and create significant bioburden at the near surface of Mars. The current report demonstrates that halotolerant bacteria from the Great Salt Plains (GSP) of Oklahoma are capable of growing at high concentrations of MgSO4 in the form of 2 M solutions of epsomite. The epsotolerance of isolates in the GSP bacterial collection was determined, with 35% growing at 2 M MgSO4. There was a complex physiological response to mixtures of MgSO4 and NaCl coupled with other environmental stressors. Growth also was measured at 1 M concentrations of other magnesium and sulfate salts. The complex responses may be partially explained by the pattern of chaotropicity observed for high-salt solutions as measured by agar gelation temperature. Select isolates could grow at the high salt concentrations and low temperatures found on Mars. Survival during repetitive freeze-thaw or drying-rewetting cycles was used as other measures of potential success on the martian surface. Our results indicate that terrestrial microbes might survive under the high-salt, low-temperature, anaerobic conditions on Mars and present significant potential for forward contamination. Stringent planetary protection requirements are needed for future life-detection missions to Mars.

AB  - Mechanotransduction has demonstrated potential for regulating tissue adaptation in vivo and cellular activities in vitro. It is well documented that ultrasound can produce a wide variety of biological effects in biological systems. For example, pulsed ultrasound can be used to noninvasively accelerate the rate of bone fracture healing. Although a wide range of studies has been performed, mechanism for this therapeutic effect on bone healing is currently unknown. To elucidate the mechanism of cellular response to mechanical stimuli induced by pulsed ultrasound radiation, we developed a method to apply focused acoustic radiation force (ARF) (duration, one minute) on osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and observed cellular responses to ARF using a spinning disk confocal microscope. This study demonstrates that the focused ARF induced F-actin cytoskeletal rearrangement in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, these cells showed an increase in intracellular calcium concentration following the application of focused ARF. Furthermore, passive bending movement was noted in primary cilium that were treated with focused ARF. Cell viability was not affected. Application of pulsed ultrasound radiation generated only a minimal temperature rise of 0.1 degrees C, and induced a streaming resulting fluid shear stress of 0.186 dyne/cm(2), suggesting that hyperthermia and acoustic streaming might not be the main causes of the observed cell responses. In conclusion, these data provide more insight in the interactions between acoustic mechanical stress and osteoblastic cells. This experimental system could serve as basis for further exploration of the mechanosensing mechanism of osteoblasts triggered by ultrasound.

AB  - We report bulk and olivine compositions in 66 stony cosmic spherules (Na2O < 0.76 wt%), 200-800 mu m in size, from the Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica. In porphyritic cosmic spherules, relict olivines that survived atmospheric entry heating are always Ni-poor and similar in composition to the olivines in carbonaceous or unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (18 spherules), and equilibrated ordinary chondrites (one spherule). This is consistent with selective survival of high temperature, Mg-rich olivines during atmospheric entry. Olivines that crystallized from the melts produced during atmospheric entry have NiO contents that increase with increasing NiO in the bulk spherule, and that range from values similar to those observed in chondritic olivines (NiO generally < 0.5 wt%) to values characteristic of olivines in meteoritic ablation spheres (NiO > 2 wt%). Thus, NiO content in olivine cannot be used alone to distinguish meteoritic ablation spheres from cosmic spherules, and the volatile element contents have to be considered. We propose that the variation in NiO contents in cosmic spherules and their olivines is the result of variable content of Fe, Ni metal in the precursor. NiO contents in olivines and in cosmic spherules can thus be used to discuss their parent body. Ni-poor spherules can be derived from C-rich and/or metal-poor precursors, either related to CM, CI, CR chondrites or to chondritic fragments dominated by silicates, regardless of the parent body. Ni-rich spherules (NiO > 0.7 wt%) that represent 55% of the 47 barred-olivine spherules we studied, were derived from the melting of C-poor, metal-rich precursors, compatible with ordinary chondrite or CO, CV, CK carbonaceous chondrite parentages.

AB  - Field egg collections coupled with physical habitat measurements were used to develop, apply, and validate a spatially explicit model to predict the spawning sites of walleyes Sander vitreus in an eastern Lake Ontario tributary. We collected 22,246 walleye eggs using passive traps and measured the attendant habitat variables, including substrate composition and heterogeneity, water depth and velocity, and cumulative spring water temperature. The squared term that we used for water depth in our regressions and selected over linear and polynomial fits better represented the relationship between spawning probability and depth. To predict walleye spawning likelihood, we developed 10 candidate models based on the available spawning data; following an information-theoretic approach, we compared the models by means of Akaike's information criterion. The best model had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.89 and a weight of evidence of 0.32, where the probability of spawning (egg presence) was associated with predominance of course substrate and shallow depth and timing was associated with the accumulated spring water temperature. The model was applied to the study stream and validated by additional egg collections. The model correctly classified egg presence/absence in 66.7% (10 of 15) of egg traps in the initial validation sample. After a high-flow event, classification success decreased to only 20% (3 of 15 traps), probably because of the redistribution of eggs to less suitable habitats in depositional areas. Prediction of walleye spawning distribution allows for reach-scale assessment of critical habitat to help guide spawning habitat restoration efforts.

AB  - Insects have evolved various adaptations that allow them to survive adverse seasons. In terms of cold-hardiness, they may classically be divided into freezing-susceptible versus freezing-tolerant species. But this concept of two alternative cold-hardiness strategies is now amendable, and to better understand these adaptive mechanisms, it is of interest to study freezing resistance in taxonomically related insect species, i.e., belonging to the same family or to a group of closely related organisms sharing similar resources. Freezing susceptibility and freezing tolerance have previously been recorded in the larvae of species in the same guild of the family Cetoniidae, which mainly colonise wood mould in hollow trees. We compared freezing hardiness in five species of Cetoniidae, three species in the subfamily Trichiinae, Gnorimus nobilis (Linne), Trichius fasciatus (Linne), and Osmoderma eremita (Scopoli), and two species in the subfamily Cetoniinae, Cetonia aurata (Linne) and Cetonischema aeruginosa (Drury). Our results mainly show that two contrasting mechanisms are used during winter by third-instar larvae: those of the Trichiinae (apart from O. eremita) are probably characterized by year-round freezing susceptibility, and those of O. eremita and the are probably distinguished by seasonal freezing susceptibility (summer) and seasonal freezing tolerance Cetoniinae are probably distinguished by seasonal freezing susceptibility (summer) and seasonal freezing tolerance (winter). We question the current taxonomic position of the genus Osmoderma. Morphological, ecological, and behavioural arguments may be put forward to support the transfer of O. eremita from the Trichiinae to the Cetoniinae, and we stress that ecophysiological arguments, often neglected in this kind of taxonomic revision, must also be taken into account.

AB  - Temperature is an important factor affecting the growth, development and survival of marine organisms. A short episode of high temperature has been proven to be a severe threat to sustainable shellfish culture. Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri), a shellfish with broad economic and biological value in North China, has frequently experienced heat stress in summer in recent years. To understand the effects of heat stress on shellfish, the metabolism of C. farreri was analyzed after exposure to 27 degrees C for either 6 h or 30 d. After 6 h of heat stress exposure, a total of 326 and 264 significantly different metabolites (SDMs) were identified in gill and mantle tissues, respectively. After 30 d of heat stress exposure, a total of 381 and 341 SDMs were found in the gill and mantle tissues, respectively. These SDMs were mainly related to the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleotides. A decline in pyruvic acid, and an increase in citric acid and fumaric acid in the gills and mantle of C. farreri indicated an alteration in energy metabolism, which may be attributed to increased ATP production in order to overcome the heat stress. Among the SDMs, 33 metabolites, including pyruvic acid, glycine and citric acid, were selected as potential biomarkers for heat stress response in C. farreri. In addition, a decline in glutamine and beta-Alanine levels indicated oxidative stress in C. farreri exposed to heat, as well as an increase in the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). Our findings suggested C. farreri have the potential to adapt to heat stress by regulating energy metabolism and antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Noticeable changes in global temperatures, climate and ocean carbon chemistry are the result of carbon dioxide increase in the atmosphere. This increase has been mitigated by the oceans capacity to absorb one-fourth of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, although this CO2 intake affects oceans carbonate chemistry [i.e., ocean acidification-(OA)]. The detrimental effect of OA in the development and shell formation has been studied in several species of bivalves, although no information is available on the wedge shell Donax trunculus, a gastronomically appreciated species and an important economical resource in several southern European countries. We evaluated the effect of pCO(2) increase on hatching and early life stages of D. trunculus, considering two ocean acidification scenarios (Delta pH -0.3 and Delta pH -0.6). Our results showed that elevated pCO(2) caused a delay in hatching into D-larvae and reduced larvae survival. In the extreme scenario (Delta pH -0.6), some trochophore larvae persisted to day 9 of the experiment and more abnormal larvae were produced than in the Delta pH -0.3 and control treatments. At day 5, normal veligers under extreme acidification were smaller than in other treatments, but by day 9, these differences were attenuated and the average size of normal D-larvae varied inversely to the pH gradient. Possible underlying mechanisms for these complex response patterns are discussed, including the existence of phenotypic plasticity or genetic pre-adaptive capacity in this D. trunculus population to cope with future environmental changes.

AB  - In the present study, the combined treatments of high hydrostatic pressure (100 to 300 MPa) and temperature (-5 to 45 degrees C) were performed according to a central composite design to inactivate Listeria monocytogenes LGB and two strains of Zygosaccharomyces bailii that were artificially added to commercial smoothies (6-7 Log cfu/mL). The response surfaces showed a synergistic effect of temperature and pressure for both species, resulting in the highest cell lethality at 300 MPa and at either 45 degrees C or 5 degrees C and lowest cell lethality when the temperature was closer to room temperature. For some combinations, the L monocytogenes LGB inactivation predicted in this study is in compliance with the FDA requirement of a 5 Log reduction of microorganisms in fruit juices and beverages. The appropriate selection of temperature values in the treatment of smoothies with high hydrostatic pressure permits cold pasteurization at pressure levels well below 300 MPa to be obtained, thus enabling cost reduction to manufacturing plants and making the industrialization of the process favourable. Selective and recovery media counts indicated that the content of injured L. monocytogenes LGB cells in the survivor population reached a maximum value after the most severe treatments. Regarding such a cell fraction, microscopy observations of LIVE/DEAD BacLight and JC-1 staining appear to indicate a widespread presence of plasmolysis in cells with a partially depolarized membrane, providing additional information about their physiological state.

AB  - Insects adjust their life cycles to the seasonally variable environmental conditions, so that growth, development and reproduction coincide with favourable seasons and adverse seasons are passed in a species-specific resistant stage. Life cycle traits are intimately associated with reproductive success, and yet a high degree of phenotypic variability is sometimes observed. Unfortunately, it is normally not known whether this variability is based on genetic differences among individuals or on phenotypic plasticity. A high degree of phenotypic variability was observed in the diapause response of the burnet moth Zygaena trifolii (ESPER, 1783) (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae). It is a "long-day insect" with temperature-influenced photoperiodic responses, and larval diapause may occur at the 3rd or any subsequent larval instar. The observed variability is partly based on genetic differences between individuals. In a selection experiment, the larval instar at which diapause occurs,vas changed within six generations. Diapause instars were dependent on the time of pre-diapause development of larvae, which varied considerably between larvae. A part of the variability in development time is based on additive genetic variance. Genetic variability in life cycle traits closely associated with reproductive success is normally eroded by strong natural selection on such traits. One may speculate, that the maintenance of genetic variability in the diapause response of Z. trifolii may result from temporal changes in selection pressure close to the border of the distribution range, where unsuitable weather conditions prevent successful reproduction in some years.

AB  - The midge, Belgica antarctica Jacobs, is subjected to numerous environmental stressors during its 2-year life cycle on the Antarctic Peninsula, and in response it has evolved a suite of behavioral, physiological, and life-cycle modifications to counter these stressors, but thus far only a limited number of biochemical adaptations have been identified. In this study, we use a metabolomics approach to obtain a broad overview of changes in energy metabolism, amino acids, and polyols in response to three of the midge's major stresses: heat, freezing, and desiccation. Using GC-MS analysis, a total of 75 compounds were identified. Desiccation (50% water loss) elicited the greatest physiological response (as determined by principal components analysis) when compared to untreated controls, with many elevated metabolites from pathways of central carbohydrate metabolism and a decrease in free amino acids. When larvae were frozen (6 h at -10 degrees C), alanine and aspartate increased as well as urea. Freezing also increased three polyols (glycerol, mannitol, erythritol), while desiccation increased only two polyols (glycerol, erythritol). Heating the midges for 1 h at 30 degrees C elevated alpha-ketoglutarate and putrescine while suppressing glycerol, glucose, and serine levels. Freezing and desiccation elicited elevation of four shared metabolites, whereas no shared metabolites were elevated by heat. All three treatments resulted in a reduction in serine, potentially identifying this amino acid as a marker for stress in this species. A number of metabolic changes, especially those in the sugar and polyol pools, are adaptations that have potential to enhance survival during both cold and desiccation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biotic resistance by native predators can limit the geographic range and abundance of non-native species following introduction into an ecosystem. Here we tested the hypothesis that the strength of predation pressure varies with latitude and limits the abundance and northward expansion of the non-native green porcelain crab, Petrolisthes armatus, whose northern range is also hypothesized to be limited by physical tolerances to cold temperatures. We quantified the predation risk of P. armatus across 400km of the crab's invasive range along the coastline of the southeastern US. In addition, we measured the density of large P. armatus, habitat quality, and other environmental factors that may affect the crab's predation risk. Finally, we conducted a size-selective predator exclusion experiment to determine the predator species and size classes that may be consuming P. armatus. Results indicated that neither the density of large P. armatus nor its predation risk varied systematically with latitude. Instead, variation in predation risk was best explained by local site-level differences in habitat quality, the density of large P. armatus, and the mean abundance of predators. The predator exclusion experiment indicated that both small and large size classes of predators are capable of equally strong rates of predation on P. armatus. Together, our results suggest that although native predators readily consume P. armatus, they do not provide biotic resistance against its northward expansion. Instead, it seems likely that other latitudinally differential factors like low winter temperatures that decrease P. armatus survival are more influential in limiting the crab's northern expansion.

AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 levels could have drastic effects on the performance of invasive weeds and their insect herbivores. Despite the importance of biological control as an effective management tool for environmental weeds, there have been few studies on the potential impact of climate change on the future efficacy of biological control. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of elevated CO2 on the performance of tropical soda apple Solanum viarum (Solanaceae) and its biological control agent Gratiana boliviana (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We established three levels of CO2 in environmental growth chambers: ambient (400 ppm), medium (580 ppm) and high (780 ppm). Plants growing at the high level had greater biomass compared to those growing at the ambient and medium levels of CO2. Leaf water content and the amount of leaf nitrogen were reduced at high compared to ambient or medium CO2 levels. G. boliviana immature survival and developmental time were negatively affected at high CO2 but not at medium or ambient levels. Adults were lighter and smaller when reared at the high CO2 level compared to ambient and medium treatments, while adult fecundity was higher at the medium CO2 level. Leaf area consumed by fifth instars was lower when feeding on plants grown at the high CO2 level either inside a Petri dish or on potted plants. These results suggest that beetle performance may be diminished under future climate. However, further studies should incorporate other factors such as temperature and precipitation as well as the evolutionary potential of herbivores and plants to adapt to a changing climate.

AB  - Circadian rhythms of activity were compared in ground-dwelling Tenebrionid beetles from the Kara Kum sand desert: Trigonoscelis gigas Reitter, Trigonoscelis sublaevicollis Reitter, Pisterotarsa gigantea Fish.-W, Sternodes caspicus Pall, Blaps faustii Seidlitz, and Ocnera imbricata Fish.-W For the observations, artificial pens (enclosures) 60 x 60 cm and 80 cm deep were arranged in field conditions and filled with various kinds of sand to simulate natural habitats as closely as possible. The activity of individually marked beetles was assessed visually and recorded every 30 min. The beetle species studied had different types of behavior, from strictly crepuscular to strictly nocturnal. Closely related species sharing one habitat differed in activity pattern-they occupied different time niches; hence their circadian rhythms contribute to reproductive isolation. In contrast, non-closely related species could have similar circadian patterns as a result of convergent evolution. In experiments with T gigas, we failed to stimulate individual variability among beetles in circadian pattern by applying additional light and heat at night. Therefore, the circadian rhythms in field conditions were found to be remarkably stable, which can be explained by our model of the beetle circadian system consisting of two strongly coupled oscillators. However, in laboratory conditions, we previously observed a wide range of individual variability in free-running circadian rhythms. The strong coupling between two putative endogenous circadian oscillators is a crucial tool for beetles to survive in a harsh arid environment. Such organization of the circadian system ensures synchronous activity of beetles despite individual differences, thus preserving the variability of circadian clock properties in a population, which increases chances for survival of a population in a changing environment.

AB  - Introduced European genotypes of Phragmites australis are invasive and widespread in North America. Decades of management using herbicide and other means have failed to control the species and its range and populations continue to expand. Allowing continued invasion threatens native wetland biota and an endemic North American subspecies Phragmites australis americanus. The lack of conventional management to control introduced P. australis triggered research to assess host specificity of two European noctuid moths, Archanara geminipuncta and Archanara neurica. These two species are considered particularly promising potential biocontrol agents for introduced P. australis. Here we provide the complete and approved list of test plants used to assess host specificity of A. geminipuncta and A. neurica. This includes data on neonate larval acceptance and survival under no-choice conditions, and oviposition tests for all plant species tested, including for different Phragmites subspecies currently occurring in North America. We further provide temperature profiles of select cities in the temperate native European distribution of the two noctuids and those in southern US climates. We used these long-term temperature records to assess whether overwintering eggs of A. geminipuncta and A. neurica can survive under climate conditions typical for the Gulf Coast region in North America.

AB  - Pampus argenteus is an aquatic cold-blooded animal, and its growth and survival are greatly affected by ambient temperature. During aquaculture, a sudden change in water temperature may be caused by climate change or other human factors, resulting in acute temperature stress. In this study, de novo transcriptome sequencing technology was used to analyze changes in the gene expressions in the liver of P. argenteus under temperature stress to understand the mechanisms of temperature regulation in P. argenteus. The results showed that 72447398, 69534310, 63698204, 78876728 and 53969050 clean reads were obtained from four cDNA libraries (A: 27 degrees C (control group), B: 22 degrees C and 6 h, C: 32 degrees C and 6 h, D: 22 degrees C and 12 h, E: 32 degrees C and 12 h) of the P. argenteus by Illumina sequencing technology. In A\B, A\C, A\D and A\E pairwise comparison, 353, 431, 1303 and 343 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, respectively. Of these genes, 67 genes were identified among all the pairwise comparisons as the common DEGs. Four genes related to metabolic adaption to temperature were randomly selected to validate the DEGs results by real time PCR. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis indicated some vital genes and pathways associated with metabolism in response to temperature challenge. These results will help us to understand the molecular mechanism underlying temperature regulation in P. argenteus and provide a theoretical basis for the study of related molecular mechanisms in fish under temperature stress.

AB  - Present day Southern Ocean benthic biodiversity is the result of climatic changes based on the break-up of Gondwana in the Cretaceous and the Cenozoic and the physiological potential of the fauna to cope with the climatic deterioration. Though many taxa survived the thermal drop in ocean bottom temperatures, zoogeographic ranges changed and some faunal elements even became extinct, e.g. benthic decapods and teleost fish, opening up new ecological niches and the potential for enormous adaptive radiations within some taxa, like the amphipods and isopods (peracarid crustaceans) and notothenioid fish. Ice-sheet extensions and retreats might have enhanced speciation processes as well as eurybathy. Biodiversity on the Antarctic shelf is high within the polychaetes, molluscs, and echinoderms, and within the amphipods and isopods possibly due to the Cenozoic extinction of the benthic decapods. Moreover, some shelf areas are characterized by accumulations of large suspension feeders like poriferans, bryozoans, ascidians, gorgonians, and hydroids. Palaeoclimatic changes also caused that many taxa of the modem, present day Southern Ocean benthic organisms are characterized by gigantism, slow metabolism, longevity, and a reduced number of offspring combined with late maturation. However, our biological knowledge is mainly confined to Southern Ocean shelf organism; we do not know much about the composition, biodiversity and zoogeography of the Southern Ocean deep sea animals. On this background the deep sea expeditions ANDEEP were born and the background and first results of these are presented herein.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in the seasonal reproductive timing of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) has important implications for the resilience of salmon and for organisms in freshwater and terrestrial communities that depend on salmon resources. Stream temperature has well known associations with salmon spawn timing but how stream and watershed geomorphology relates to the variation in salmon spawn timing is less understood. We used multivariate statistics applied to five environmental variables to compare conditions across 36 watersheds in the Wood River basin in southwest Alaska. We found that the environmental conditions in the first two axes of a principal components analysis (PCA) explained 76% of the variation in summer temperature among streams and 45% of the variation in spawn timing of sockeye salmon. The average habitat characteristics of streams that characterized three spawn timing groups of sockeye salmon were significantly distinct from one another. Sites supporting early spawning populations tend to have steeper and smaller watersheds, while late spawning populations occur in streams draining large, lower gradient watersheds with lakes in the drainage network. Finally, we show that stream temperature and spawn timing among streams have little spatial correlation across the landscape, thereby producing a fine-scale mosaic of spawn timing across the river basin. These results demonstrate that geomorphology and hydrology interact to produce a heterogeneous thermal template for natural selection to influence salmon spawn timing across river basins.

AB  - Radio and acoustic telemetry were used to monitor the seasonal movement of hatchery-reared and wild shortnose sturgeon (622-927 mm total length) in the Savannah River. Diploid, and sterile hatchery-reared shortnose sturgeon, and wild shortnose sturgeon showed apparent similar seasonal patterns of movement within the river. We were unable to detect any significant differences in the seasonal mean river location, minimum daily distance moved, absolute distance moved, displacement or mean territory size among treatments. Fish moved throughout the brackish and freshwater interface area of the Savannah River during the summer months. Coinciding with decreasing fall temperatures, fish of all treatment groups moved downriver into brackish areas of the upper estuary, residing in the Front, Middle, and Back Rivers, where they remained through winter. Upriver movements of some hatchery-reared and wild groups began in early February as river temperatures began to increase. Shortnose sturgeon from each group selected apparent similar thermal, salinity and water depth conditions throughout the year. Hatchery-reared fish may be useful as surrogates for wild fish in behavioural studies. Triploid or surgically-sterilized fish may be used in situ behavioural studies where genetic contamination is a concern. It may be possible to monitor habitats used by released hatchery-reared fish to locate or verify remnant populations of rare or endangered species in systems where they are thought to be extirpated.

AB  - Migmatites comprise a minor volume of the high-grade part of the Damara orogen of Namibia that is dominated by granite complexes and intercalated metasedimentary units. Migmatites of the Southern Central Zone of the Damara orogen consist of melanosomes with garnet+cordierite+biotite+K-feldspar, and leucosomes, which are sometimes garnet- and cordierite-bearing. Field evidence, petrographic observations, and pseudosection modelling suggest that, in contrast to other areas where intrusion of granitic magmas is more important, in situ partial melting of metasedimentary units was the main migmatite generation processes. Pseudosection modelling and thermobarometric calculations consistently indicate that the peak-metamorphic grade throughout the area is in the granulite facies (similar to 5 kbar at similar to 800 degrees C). Cordierite coronas around garnet suggest some decompression from peak-metamorphic conditions and rare andalusite records late, near-isobaric cooling to P-T path is consistent with minor crustal thickening through continent-continent collision followed by limited post-collisional exhumation and suggests that the granulite facies terrane of the Southern Central Zone of the Damara orogen formed initially in a metamorphic field gradient of similar to 35-40 degrees C/km at medium pressures. New high-precision Lu-Hf garnet-whole rock dates are 530 +/- 13 Ma, 522.0 +/- 0.8 Ma, 520.8 +/- 3.6 Ma, and 500.3 +/- 4.3 Ma for the migmatites that record temperatures of similar to 800 degrees C. This indicates that high-grade metamorphism lasted for c. 20-30 Ma, which is compatible with previous estimates using Sm-Nd garnet-whole rock systematics. In previous studies on Damara orogen migmatites where both Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf chronometers have been applied, the dates (c. 520-510 Ma) agree within their small uncertainties (0.6-0.8% for Sm-Nd and 0.1-0.2% for Lu-Hf). This implies rapid cooling after high-grade conditions and, by implication, rapid exhumation at that time. The cause of the high geothermal gradient inferred from the metamorphic conditions is unknown but likely requires some extra heat that was probably added by intrusion of magmas from the lithospheric mantle, i.e., syenites that have been recently re-dated at c. 545 Ma. Some granites derived from the lower crust at c. 545 Ma are the outcome rather than the cause of high-T metamorphism. In addition, high contents of heat-producing elements K, Th, and U may have raised peak temperatures by 150-200 degrees C at the base of the crust, resulting in the widespread melting of fertile crustal rocks. The continuous gradation from centimetre-scale leucosomes to decametre-scale leucogranite sheets within the high-grade metamorphic zone suggests that leucosome lenses coalesced to form larger bodies of anatectic leucogranites, thereby documenting a link between high-grade regional metamorphism and Pan-African magmatism. In view of the close association of the studied high-T migmatites with hundreds of synmetamorphic high-T granites that invaded the terrane as metre- to decametre-wide sills and dykes, we postulate that crystallization of felsic lower crustal magma is, at least partly, responsible for heat supply.
   Late-stage isobaric cooling of these granites may explain the occurrence of andalusite in some samples.

AB  - SLM process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, layer thickness and hatch spacing play a crucial role in the quality of the processed product. In order to find the parameters suitable for SLM process, a finite element model was established to simulate the distribution of temperature field of selective laser melting (SLM) stainless steel 316L (SS316L) parts. After finite element simulation, the optimum factor levels for SLM processing SS316L were as follows: laser power of 100-200 W, scanning speed of 500-1500 mm/s, hatch spacing of 0.04-0.12 mm, and layer thickness of 0.03-0.06 mm. Then, based on a series of experiments, different laser energy densities were divided into three regions corresponding to three melting mechanisms: the partial melting zone (37.88-75.76 J/mm(3)), the full melting zone (75.76-151.52 J/mm(3)), and the over-melting zone (larger than 151.52 J/mm(3)). The surface roughness, density, microstructure and mechanical properties of the SLM SS316L were strongly dependent on the laser energy density. The results showed that an excellent SS316L part with a relative density higher than 99.66% and good mechanical properties could be obtained at a laser energy density of 119.05 J/mm(3) with a laser powder of 200 W, a scanning speed of 700 mm/s, a hatch spacing of 0.08 mm and a layer thickness of 0.03 mm.

AB  - Single-zircon evaporation and ion-microprobe dating of migmatites and anatectic granites in the Pena Negra Complex of Central Iberia reveal that the Variscan anatexis occurred continuously from 352 to 297 Ma, with a maximum at 335-305 Ma. Anatexis began coeval with the main collision of continental masses. A limited melting event, probably related to syncollision crustal-scale shear zones, produced a population of zircons with ages of c. 350 Ma. The production of new zircons decreased to a minimum at c. 343 Ma but then increased swiftly as the internal thermal evolution of the thickened Central Iberian crust led to widespread anatexis in the Pena Negra region at 332 Ma. Shortly after this, the melt resident in the migmatites was locally segregated into small bodies that crystallized as cordierite leucogranites at 321 Ma. Simultaneously, extensional subhorizontal shear zones were preferentially developed over layers of the migmatite series that, owing to their elevated heat production and fertility, had the highest melt fraction. Shearing provoked further anatexis and contributed significantly to the in situ production of high melt-fraction granodiorites and adamellites from the migmatites. This process occurred from 325 to 305 Ma, with a maximum at 309 Ma marking the peak of the Variscan extensional collapse in Central Iberia. After c. 305 Ma the melt fraction decreased quickly, so that the production of new zircons was insignificant at 300 Ma and had stopped completely by 297 Ma.

AB  - The dynamics of organic matter (OM) in prairie soils play an important role in long-term soil productivity and in the global carbon cycle. Temporal fluctuations in OM occur primarily in the readily-decomposable, labile fractions. We analyzed soils from a long-term study on a Brown Chernozem (Aridic Haploboroll) in southwestern Saskatchewan to determine the effect of cropping practices on OM content and composition under arid conditions. Soils (0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm layers) from various rotations of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), winter wheat, flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) and fallow were analyzed for organic C, total N and selected indicators of labile OM [light fraction(LF)-C, LF-N, mineralizable-C, mineralizable-N, microbial biomass(MB)-C and MB-N]. The indicators of labile OM were all more sensitive than total OM to agronomic variables. Treatment effects on air characteristics were usually similar in the 0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm layers, but effects in the surface layer were often more highly significant. Frequency of fallow in the rotation was the dominant factor influencing labile OM. For example, LF-C in the 0-7.5 cm layer of well-fertilized continuously-cropped spring wheat, bare fallow-wheat-wheat and bare fallow-wheat was 3.15, 1.55 and 1.17 mg C kg(-1) soil, respectively. The corresponding values for CO2-C mineralized at 21 degrees C in 30 days were 371, 184 and 158 mg C kg(-1) soil and those for cumulative net N mineralized in 16 weeks at 35 degrees C were 126, 96 and 80 mg N kg(-1) soil. MB-C and MB-N exhibited similar trends (e.g. MB-C was 368, 256 and 257 mg C kg(-1) soil for the three treatments, respectively). Application of N fertilizer and substitution of winter wheat (with chemical fallow) for spring wheat (with tilled bare fallow) tended to increase labile OM, while substitution of flax or lentil for spring wheat had little effect or reduced labile OM. Differences in labile OM appeared to be related, not only to residue inputs, but also to moisture and temperature conditions. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to manipulate the timing of residue inputs and moisture through cropping practices and thereby maintain adequate labile OM concentrations and improve the synchrony of mineralization with crop requirements. Our results also imply that LF and mineralizable fractions may be useful as early indicators of OM change.

AB  - Lepidiumdraba (Brassicaceae) is a major concern for agriculture and biodiversity in the western United States. As current control methods do not provide long-term, sustainable solutions, research has been conducted to find biological control agents. Ceutorhynchusassimilis is one of the currently investigated candidates. Known as oligophagous in the literature, a specialist clade of this root-galling weevil exists in southern Europe. This raised the question of its ability to survive in colder climates in the target range. We investigated the phenology of C.assimilis in the field in southern France (specialist clade) and Romania (generalist clade) and measured various temperature-dependent parameters in the laboratory. In both ranges, weevils were univoltine. Oviposition in autumn started later in France compared to Romania, while mature larvae exited galls (to pupate in the soil) earlier the following year. On average, 25% and 32% of galls from France and Romania were completely below the soil surface, respectively, and this appeared to depend on soil substrate. Weevils transported from France to Romania were able to develop, but at a much lower rate than Romanian weevils. Mortality of overwintering larvae of both clades increased with decreasing temperature and exposure time. At -5 degrees C, lethal times Lt(50) and Lt(95) were 15 and 42days for the specialist clade and 26 and 72days for the generalist clade. A higher proportion of third instar larvae compared to first and second instar larvae survived. Pupation time at different temperatures did not differ between weevils from France or Romania. A climate match model (comparing winter temperatures) indicated that the specialist clade of C.assimilis from France has the potential to establish in some parts of the target range (e.g. Washington, Oregon, California). However, temperature extremes and winters without snow cover will likely limit its establishment unless rapid adaptive evolution takes place.

AB  - Strategies adopted by parasitoids and kleptoparasites co-evolve with the defensive adaptations of their hosts, and vice-versa. Hedychrum rutilans and Hedychrum nobile are brood parasites of, respectively, Philanthus triangulum and Cerceris arenaria, two digger wasps that share most aspects of their nesting biology (solitary females dig aggregated nests in the ground and mass-provision the brood with paralyzed insects). We tested the hypothesis that similarity in the hosts' nesting habits corresponds to similar defensive strategies against these cuckoo wasps. Peak provisioning activity by P. triangulum occurred in late afternoon (and early morning in 1 year) while peak H. rutilans activity was in early afternoon. In contrast, peak provisioning by C. arenaria and peak H. nobile activity occurred in early afternoon. Thus, P. triangulum (as previously found in other populations) appears to have timed its provisioning to avoid its brood parasite whereas C. arenaria did not, rejecting our hypothesis. The daily activity of both chrysidid wasps was positively correlated to air temperature. Host nest density positively affected only H. rutilans activity, in agreement with previous reports for other populations of this species, whereas the daily pattern of activity of the host was the key correlate with the activity of H. nobile. Mortality due to cuckoo wasps was low for both digger wasps, although it was somewhat higher at sites with many nests of P. triangulum. We suggest that perhaps the degree to which digger wasps time their activity to avoid cuckoo wasps is related to the degree of specialization in host choice by their brood parasite. H. rutilans is more highly dependent on P. triangulum, which may have had a greater effect on the timing of provision by its host.

AB  - To identify the summer habitat use by Gulf strain Striped Bass Morone saxatilis in Lake Martin, Alabama, 36 fish greater than 4kg were tracked weekly from June through September in 2009 and 2010. Temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected biweekly from July to October each year and were incorporated into a hypsographic curve to estimate summertime volumes of Striped Bass habitat. Striped Bass moved downstream in the reservoir and deeper in the water column as the summer progressed in both years. Across all temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations (DOCs) measured, fish generally selected cooler temperatures when DOCs were greater than 3.1mg/L, but below that level, fish selected warmer temperatures. By early July each year, quality Striped Bass habitat (21.0 degrees C and 3.2mg/L DOC) comprised 40-50% of the total habitat available in Lake Martin. However, in 2009 all quality habitat was gone from the reservoir by August 1, and total habitat (25.0 degrees C and 1.6mg/L DOC) rapidly decreased until there was no suitable habitat found in Lake Martin by mid-September. The quantity of quality and total habitat declined more rapidly in 2009 than in 2010; although quality habitat was eliminated from the reservoir by the end of August 2010, total habitat persisted throughout the summer. In both years, habitat availability increased when reservoir destratification began. Analysis of historical data indicated that quality habitat was found in the lower portion of the reservoir during the latter half of August in only 6 of 15years; total Striped Bass habitat was available in all but 1 year. The amount of water flowing through the system during the spring and summer was a key determinant of Striped Bass habitat availability by late summer.

AB  - The Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary interval in the northern hemisphere is characterized by the widespread occurrence of black shales. About 60% of all petroleum source rocks comprise sediments of late Jurassic and early Cretaceous age with the origin of such black shales still under discussion. In order to better understand the factors that controlled black shale sedimentation, 78 samples were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils from two sections (Gorodische, Kashpir) of the Volga Basin (NE Russia). Calcareous nannofossils are ideal proxies for deciphering nutrient, temperature and salinity fluctuations. Additionally 58 samples from both sections were also analyzed for clay mineralogy, delta(13)C(org) , TOC and CaCO3 composition. Both sections contain calcareous claystones and intercalated organic rich shales overlain by phosphorite beds. The presence of the calcareous nannofossil species Stephanolithion atmetros throughout both successions allows a biostratigraphic assignment to the S. atmetros Nannofossil Biozone (NJ 17), which corresponds to the Dorsoplanites panderi Ammonite Biozone of the Middle Volgian. The marlstones of the Kashpir section yield a well-preserved rich and diverse nannoflora, whereas all black shale beds are essentially barren of calcareous nannofossils. Only the uppermost black shale layers yield an impoverished assemblage of low diversity and abundance. Geochemical data suggest an early diagenetic nannofossil dissolution in the black shales of the Kashpir section. This is supported by the occurrence of coccoliths in black shale horizons of the Gorodische section. The assemblages in both sections are dominated by coccoliths of the Watznaueriaceae group (Watznaueria barnesae, Watznaueria fossacincta, Watznaueria britannica, Watznaueria communis), Biscutum constans and Zeugrhabdotus erectus. In Kashpir rare specimens of Crucibiscutum salebrosum occur in the higher part of the section. These taxa indicate boreal affinities. B. constans and Z. erectus are considered to be taxa indicative of a higher productive environment, while C. salebrosum is a cool-water species. From base to top of the Kashpir section, consecutive mass occurrences of different taxa/groups were observed: W. barnesae-W. fossacincta acme, W. britannica-W. communis acme, Z. erectus acme, B. constans acme (including sparse occurrences of C. salebrosum).
   The observed distribution patterns have been interpreted as characterizing a transition from a low productive, oligotrophic setting with high abundances of K-selected cosmopolitan species (Watznaueriaceae) and predominating marlstone sedimentation to a higher productive, mesotrophic setting. Cooler water temperatures marked by r-selection and acmes of opportunistic species (Z. erectus, B. constans) are coincident with the deposition of black shales and phosphorites in the higher part of the section. Interpretation of clay mineral distribution indicates that black shale deposition occurred under semi-arid hinterland climatic conditions concomitant with a sea level rise. This induced dysoxic conditions in the deeper parts of the Volga Basin, favoring the preservation of organic matter. The cause of the nutrient enrichment in the surface water is still unclear, but possible river water input from the continents does not seem to have been the controlling factor under a semi-arid climate. The occurrence of phosphorites in the upper part of both sections presumably indicates that enhanced productivity may be better explained by the upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom water and thereby causing the recycling of nutrients from oxidized phytoplankton back into the photic zone. This recycling effect finally may have led to an intensified phytoplankton growth which seemed to be a sufficient source for the enrichment of organic matter. This is well correlated with the increase in black shale horizons in the upper part of the Kashpir section.

AB  - Aim. To study the influence of weather conditions on the formation of the spring barley crop under prevailing climatic changes.
   Material and Methods. The object of research was varieties and lines of spring barley of the FITZ Nemchinovka selection, which were studied annually in 2001-2020 in a competitive test in the conditions of the Moscow region. According to the meteorological data for the FITZ Nemchinovka, the average monthly indicators of precipitation, air temperature and GTCM were calculated. Mathematical processing of yield data was undertaken on a computer using the Excel programme.
   Results. A significant increase in the average monthly air temperature during the spring-summer season, an increase in the amount of precipitation in May and a decrease in other months of the growing season indicate a change in the climatic conditions of the region. In favorable years, with a GTCM value from 1.32 to 2.34, the average yield of barley was 5.88 t/ha and in dry years with GTCM values from 0.48 to 1.26 - 3.28 t/ha. in the spring-summer period, there was a relatively stable variability in yield from the dynamics of precipitation and GTCM (r= 0.346...0.572). The negative correlation dependence of the yield of varieties on the average monthly air temperature throughout the season had a relatively unstable character and manifested itself as very weak or medium (r=-0.021...-0.372).
   Conclusion. The positive yield trend observed in the conditions of the Moscow region with the annual use of the same agricultural machinery is due to an increase in the adaptive potential of new varieties and breeding lines of FITZ Nemchinovka.

AB  - Microalgae have a substantial potential as a renewable energy resource, but sustainable microalgae-based bioenergy production has to find an inexpensive water and nutrient resource. Wastewater has been considered as such a resource to reduce environmental impacts and economic burdens of microalgae cultivation. Understanding of microalgae growth kinetics in wastewater is necessary to improve microalgae productivity for successful implementation of the integrated microalgae-wastewater system. This study presents an integrated colimitation kinetic model of microalgae growth in anaerobically digested municipal sludge centrate. Nitrogen (N), dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, light intensity (I), and temperature (T) were selected as major growth factors in themodel. The model framework was constructed by combining threshold and multiplicative structures to explain the relationship among these factors. Depending on culture conditions, the integrated model consists of alternative rate expressions for factors selected. These expressions include the Andrews and Monod models for both CO2 and N, and the Chalker and Muller-Fuega models combined with the Arrhenius equation for light intensity and temperature. The model was calibrated and validated using batch studies with anaerobically digested municipal sludge centrate as wastewater source. Criteria to select the rate expressions considering limitation conditions include NH4-N <= 150 mg L-1, aqueous CO2 <= 50 mg L-1, and light intensity <= 90 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). Above these ranges, the rate expressions considering both limitation and inhibition were applied to the model. The model was shown to have a reasonable growth rate prediction of Chlorella sp. under different nutrient levels of the centrate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture accounts for similar to 90% of anthropogenic freshwater consumption, is deployed on 22% of cultivated land, and provides 40% of global food production. Expanding irrigation onto currently underperforming rainfed croplands is crucial to meet future global food demand without further agricultural expansion and associated encroachment of natural ecosystems. Establishing irrigation is also a potential climate adaptation solution to alleviate heat- and water-stress to crops and reduce climate variability and extremes. Despite irrigation being one of the land management practices with the largest environmental and hydroclimatic impacts, the role of irrigation to adapt agriculture to climate change and achieve global sustainability goals has just started to be quantified. This study reviews biophysical opportunities and feedbacks of 'sustainable irrigation'. I describe the concept of sustainable irrigation expansion-where there are opportunities to increase agricultural productivity over currently water-limited rainfed croplands by adopting irrigation practices that do not deplete freshwater stocks and impair aquatic ecosystems. Expanding sustainable irrigation may avert agricultural expansion but create additional externalities that are often neglected. This review highlights major gaps in the analysis and understanding on the role of sustainable irrigation expansion to adapt agriculture to climate change. This study reviews the implications of a potential sustainable irrigation expansion on (a) global food security, (b) hydroclimatic conditions, (c) water quality, (d) soil salinization, (e) water storage infrastructure, and (f) energy use. These implications help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in irrigated agriculture and thus also point toward solutions and future research needs.

AB  - The annual freeze/thaw (FT) cycle determines the potential growing season in boreal landscapes and is a major factor determining ecosystem productivity and associated exchange of trace gases (CO2, H2O) with the atmosphere. Accurate characterization of these processes can improve regional assessment of seasonal carbon dynamics and climate feedbacks. FT process variations are spatially and temporally complex due to topography, snow depth and wetness, land cover, or local climatic conditions. In this paper, we perform a landscape analysis of multifrequency and multitemporal satellite microwave remote sensing measurements at L-band (JERS-1), C-band (ERS), and Ku-band (QuikSCAT) for characterizing FT dynamics. We first analyze backscatter sensitivity of the three frequencies to FT conditions over selected Alaska temperature sites. We then apply an FT classifier over two study areas (wetland complex and moderate topography) and examine differences in FT timing according to vegetation, elevation, and north/south facing slope. Results show that L-, C-, and Ku-band backscatter are sensitive to landscape FT state transitions, with higher backscatter for nonfrozen than frozen conditions at C- and L-bands but the opposite response at Ku-band. We applied a change detection algorithm to the C-band and L-band data over both study areas and analyzed the FT classifications with land cover information. These results resolve characteristic patterns of earlier spring thawing for south facing slopes, lower elevations, and coniferous vegetation. Our results also inform similar FT algorithm development for the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive mission by documenting L-band FT sensitivity and heterogeneity over a boreal landscape.

AB  - The study was designed to investigate the effects of temperature and phosphorus limitation on polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production and storage by activated sludge biomass. The two-stage operation approach, i.e. a growth phase followed by a nutrient limitation phase, was applied to induce PHA accumulation. The pre-selected temperatures of 10, 20 and 30degreesC were investigated under phosphorus limitation conditions using three four-litre fully aerobic SBR systems operated at an SRT of 10 days with cycle time and HRT of 6 and 10 hours. PHA production was greater in the 10degreesC system than in the 20degreesC and 30degreesC systems but there was little difference between the two higher temperatures. The maximum PHA fractions of the sludge were 52, 45 and 47% TSS for the three temperatures from low to high, and the maximum PHA concentrations in the mixed liquors were 1,491, 1,294 and 1,260 mg/l, respectively. However, it was observed that very low values of PHA yield per unit COD consumed were obtained, i.e., 0.05, 0.03 and 0.04 mgPHA/mgCOD(u), for the 10, 20 and 30degreesC reactors, respectively. This was because all three systems required several days to reach maximum PHA accumulation in their mixed liquor biomasses. It is probable the bacteria still had some stored poly-P in their cells upon initiation of the phosphorus limited influent, and PHA accumulation was delayed until the stored phosphorus was depleted. Also, PHA productivity was reduced by the large amounts of biomass lost from the systems because of sludge bulking.

AB  - The genesis of mesothermal Au-quartz vein deposits, which are among the more economically important type of Au deposits, is still under debate. There are two main theories, proposed in the literature, for the subsequent formation of these deposits in suitable structure involved: (1) Au-bearing ore fluid was derived from magmatic intrusions; or (2) Au was extracted from a greenstone belt by metamorphic fluids. In this paper, we report geochemical data from the mesothermal Maevatanana Au deposit in Madagascar, from which we deduce, based on synthesis of these data with field observations and with data from previous studies, that Au-quartz veins and silicified gneisses in the footwall of the granite dike were derived from both greenstone rocks and magmatic intrusions. From this interpretation, we propose a two-stage fertilization model for the mesothermal Maevatanana Au deposit. The first stage involved recycling of metal-fertilized lower crust. The second stage involved emplacement of granitic magma into the greenstone belt, resulting in increase in temperature of the host rock, and subsequent low-degree partial melting of the crust produced volatile-rich high-silica melts. Subsequently, Au-rich fluid was extracted from the granitic magma and convection in the magma reservoir caused by ascent of the less-dense volatile-rich high-silica melt and settlement of crystals (e.g., plagioclase) resulted in the formation of ore-forming fluids at the top of the magma reservoir. Finally, the Au-rich fluids were carried by magmatic dikes and transported from the magma reservoir to shallow host structures to form the mesothermal Maevatanana Au deposit.

AB  - The effect of zirconia phase on the activity and selectivity of Cu/ZrO2, for the hydrogenation of CO was investigated. Relatively pure t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 were prepared with high Surface areas (similar to 145 m(2)/g). Copper was then deposited on the surface of these materials by either incipient-wetness impregnation or deposition-precipitation. For a fixed Cu surface area, Cu/m-ZrO2 was ten time, more active for methanol synthesis than Cu-ZrO2 from a feed of 3:1 H2/CO at 3.0 MPa and temperatures between 473 and 523 K. Cu/m-ZrO2 also exhibited it higher selectivity for methanol. Increasing the Cu surface area on m-ZrO2 resulted in further improvement in activity with minimal change in selectivity. Methanol productivity increased linearly for both Cu/t-ZrO2, and Cu/m-ZrO2, with increasing Cu surface area, The difference in inherent activity of each phase paralleled the stronger and larger CO adsorption capacity of the Cu/m-ZrO2 as quantified by CO-TPD. The higher CO adsorption capacity of Cu/m-ZrO2 is attributed to the presence of a high concentration of anionic vacancies on the surface of m-ZrO2. Such vacancies expose cus-Zr4+ cations, which act as Lewis acid centers and enhance the Bronsted acidity of adjacent Zr-OH groups. The presence of cus-Zr4+ sites and adjacent Bronsted acidic Zr-OH groups contributes to the adsorption of CO as IICOO-Zr groups, which are the initial precursors to methanol. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Climate is one of the main limiting factors for agricultural productivity, where climate change may increase the risk for food production. Based on that, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of climate change on rainfed and irrigated soybean yield in the MATOPIBA region, the new agricultural frontier in Brazil. The DSSAT CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean was used to simulate rainfed and irrigated yield using local soils, sowing dates, and maturity groups. The simulations included the baseline (1980-2010), and two future scenarios (2011-2040 and 2041-2070) for two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). The future climate scenarios were obtained from global climate models (HadGEM2-ES and CSIRO mk3-6-0). The baseline showed a median yield of 3907 kg ha(-1) across the region, a value that increased to 4006 kg ha(-1) in the RCP 8.5 in 2011-2040. For the 2041-2070 period, RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 had a yield reduction to 3686 and 2388 kg ha(-1), respectively. The average yield reduction was higher than 23% under RCP 8.5 (2041-2070), reaching more than 53% in some areas. The yield impact in future climate scenarios was related to rainfall reduction by 300-400 mm cycle(-1), and temperature increased above 3 degrees C. The irrigation showed potential to offset negative climate change impacts, where yield gain was 2400 kg ha(-1) under RCP 8.5. The future climate impact can be reduced by moving soybean crops preferentially to areas of higher altitude, with lower air temperature associated with irrigation. Further studies could explore potential adaptations related with physiological traits and crop management.

AB  - The deficiency of available silicon (Si) incurred by year-round agricultural and horticultural practices highlights the significance of Si fertilization for soil replenishment. This study focuses on a novel and economical route for the synthesis of Si fertilizer via the calcination method using talc and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as starting materials. The molar ratio of talc to CaCO3 of 1:2.0, calcination temperature of 1150 degrees C and calcination time of 120 min were identified as the optimal conditions to maximize the available Si content of the prepared Si fertilizer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterizations elucidate the principles of the calcination temperature-dependent microstructure evolution of Si fertilizers, and the akermanite Ca2Mg(Si2O7) and merwinite Ca3Mg(SiO4)(2) were identified as the primary silicates products. The results of release and solubility experiments suggest the content of available metallic element and slow-release property of the Si fertilizer obtained at the optimum preparation condition (Si-OPC). The surface morphology and properties of Si-OPC were illuminated by the results of scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface area and nitrogen adsorption analysis. The acceleration action of CaCO3 in the decomposition process of talc was demonstrated by the thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) test. The pot experiment corroborates that 5 g kg(-1) soil Si-OPC application sufficed to facilitate the pakchoi growth by providing nutrient elements. This evidence indicates the prepared Si fertilizer as a promising candidate for Si-deficient soil replenishment.

AB  - A 0.33 wt% Pd/BN catalyst has been proved highly active for the liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of maleic anhydride (MA) to succinic anhydride (SA) at room temperature and highly selective to SA within a wide temperature range, far beyond the Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgO catalysts. An SA productivity of 6000 KgSA Kg(Pd)(-1) h(-1) and a high TOF value of 9.0 s(-1) can be achieved at room temperature on the Pd/BN, and the high SA selectivity over 99.7% can be retained at the reaction temperature up to 150 ?. Detailed structural characterizations and reactant-adsorption/desorption tests have demonstrated that the support effect on MA hydrogenation is related not only to the adsorption configurations of MA on Pd, which exhibits the indirect effect of the support via the electronic interaction with Pd, but also to the direct adsorption of MA on the support itself. In particular, for our catalysts with the low Pd loading, the difference of metal centers is largely masked by the adsorption of the support itself. For the Pd/BN, the predominant MA adsorption on Pd through a di-sigma mode, the weak MA adsorption with a small amount on BN, and a high H-spillover ability are responsible for its high activity and selectivity. Moreover, it has been also revealed that the catalyst prereduction temperature can change the catalytic performance of the Pd/BN through an integrated effect including the removal of residual chlorine on Pd and the growth of Pd particles.

AB  - Relevant and appropriate selection of best hybrid material is a challenging task for the recent industries. The mandatory criterion is to deal with the enhanced productivity with minimum cost. Therefore, this paper highlights on the comparative study between the advanced multi-criteria approaches namely ARAS, MABAC, COPRAS and MOOSRA methods for the selection of the best hybrid composite material using aluminum (Al) as base material varying different reinforcement weights and recycling with various industrial wastes by stir casting. Al/WCE gives superior tribomechanical properties at lower cost than any other reinforcements. These advanced MCDM methods are applied, based on the properties and attributes of the hybrid composites, to compare between the computational and experimental results. The results exactly corroborate with the previous research results, which authenticate the expediency of these methods during the solving of complex hybrid material selection problems for sustainable energy recovery. Out of 48 different samples, A30 is obtained to be the best sample by ARAS approach (rank 1) which is Al+Al2O3 at 12.5%wt. addition. A24 is ranked 2 which is heat treated 12.5%wt. WCE. But the same A30 is obtained to be rank 5 and A24 is obtained to be rank 1 by MABAC method, A30 is obtained to be rank 2 and A24 to be rank 1 by COPRAS method, and A30 is calculated to be rank 1 and A24 to be rank 11 by MOOSRA method. A24 is also obtained to be the best hybrid composite as per the experimentation. This paper also aims for proper recovering of environmental friendly renewable energy for the society by fabricating the best hybrid green composite for sustainable development.

AB  - Background: Penicillin G acylase (PGA) is used industrially to catalyze the hydrolysis of penicillin G to obtain 6-aminopenicillanic acid. In Escherichia coli, the most-studied microorganism for PGA production, this enzyme accumulates in the periplasmic cell space, and temperature plays an important role in the correct synthesis of its subunits.
   Results: This work investigates the influence of medium composition, cultivation strategy, and temperature on PGA production by recombinant E. coli cells. Shake flask cultures carried out using induction temperatures ranging from 18 to 28 degrees C revealed that the specific enzyme activity achieved at 20 degrees C (3000 IU gDCW-1) was 6-fold higher than the value obtained at 28 degrees C. Auto-induction and high cell density fed-batch bioreactor cultures were performed using the selected induction temperature, with both defined and complex media, and IPTG and lactose as inducers. Final biomass concentrations of 100 and 120 gDCW L-1, and maximum enzyme productivities of 7800 and 5556 IU L-1 h(-1), were achieved for high cell density cultures using complex and defined media, respectively.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, the volumetric enzyme activity and productivity values achieved using the complex medium are the highest ever reported for PGA production using E. coli. Overall PGA recovery yields of 64 and 72% after purification were achieved for crude extracts obtained from cells cultivated in defined and complex media, respectively. The complex medium was the most cost-effective for PGA production, and could be used in both high cell density and straightforward auto-induction protocols.

AB  - The highly heterogeneous Humboldt Current System (HCS) and the 30 degrees S transition zone on the southeast Pacific coast, represent an ideal scenario to test the influence of the environment on the spatial genomic structure in marine near-shore benthic organisms. In this study, we used seascape genomic tools to evaluate the genetic structure of the commercially important ascidian Pyura chilensis, a species that exhibits a low larval transport potential but high anthropogenic dispersal. A recent study in this species recorded significant genetic differentiation across a transition zone around 30 degrees S in putatively adaptive SNPs, but not in neutral ones, suggesting an important role of environmental heterogeneity in driving genetic structure. Here, we aim to understand genomic-oceanographic associations in P. chilensis along the Southeastern Pacific coast using two combined seascape genomic approaches. Using 149 individuals from five locations along the HCS, a total of 2,902 SNPs were obtained by Genotyping-By-Sequencing, of which 29-585 were putatively adaptive loci, depending on the method used for detection. In adaptive loci, spatial genetic structure was better correlated with environmental differences along the study area (mainly to Sea Surface Temperature, upwelling-associated variables and productivity) than to the geographic distance between sites. Additionally, results consistently showed the presence of two groups, located north and south of 30 degrees S, which suggest that local adaptation processes seem to allow the maintenance of genomic differentiation and the spatial genomic structure of the species across the 30 degrees S biogeographic transition zone of the Humboldt Current System, overriding the homogenizing effects of gene flow.

AB  - Some forecasting techniques have been tested with crop models using various statistical analyses for generating future scenarios of yield (Y). Forecasting, however, can be achieved by simply using regression analysis and carefully selecting independent variables (IVs) with time displacement relative to the dependent variable. The early forecasting of Y is the vanguard of agronomic modeling, promoting improvements in planning, allowing more rational strategic decisions, and increasing food and economic security. Climatic variables are the most important factors controlling the yield and quality of coffee (Coffea arabica L.). We calibrated and tested agrometeorological models to forecast the annual Y of coffee for six traditional producing regions in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We used multiple linear regressions, selecting IVs to maximize the period between the forecast of Y and the harvest for each locality. The IVs were monthly meteorological variables from 1997 to 2014: air temperature, rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, soil water storage, water deficit, and water surplus. The IVs were selected by testing all possible combinations in the domain and avoiding multicollinearity. The agrometeorological models were accurate for all regions, and the earliest forecasts were 6 and 5 mo before harvest for the producing locations of Guaxupe and Coromandel, respectively. The models for yield forecasting for Guaxupe included the water deficit in July and October and July precipitation for the high-yield season and the water deficit in April and September and October precipitation for the low-yield season. The models for yield forecasting for Coromandel included the November water surplus and February and September precipitation for the high-yield season and precipitation for January, April, and October for the low-yield season.

AB  - The main objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of a typical proprietary catalyst for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, in the form of cylindrical pellet on a pilot-scale fixed bed reactor for the production of n-paraffins. The catalyst was identified that the support is mesoporous, showing the active phase (cobalt) a good dispersion. The tests were carried out at a pressure of 20 bar, varying the temperature (210 oC and 230 oC) and the space velocity. The results showed a reduction in the conversion of H-2 and CO with the increase in space velocity and temperature, as evidenced in the literature. In addition, it was observed that selectivity to CH4 increased with the increase in temperature, maintaining the ratio H-2/CO (1.6). Regarding hydrocarbon productivity, it was noticed that there was a significant increase in the yield of heavy oil and water at 230 oC. At this temperature, the selectivity to C19 + was reduced when compared to 210 oC, indicating that in order to produce paraffins of high molecular weight, it is advisable to carry out the reaction at a lower temperature. The results obtained in the laboratory were compared to those obtained in the pilot plant. As a matter of fact, although the catalyst and the operating conditions were the same, different results were observed, indicating mass transfer effects play an important role. The diffusion of H-2 and CO to the active site depends on mass transfer effects, mainly impacting on the selectivity to CH4.

AB  - Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is used to obtain a wide range of materials for various purposes. High demand of PVC is explained by possibility to modify polyvinyl chloride and produce broad range of materials with improved properties as well as to have cost efficient ratio: productivity, available raw materials, saving of natural resources. However, under normal temperature polyvinyl chloride is brittle and inelastic, that limits the fields of PVC application. The production of basic PVC compositions is impossible without plasticizers - low-molecular compounds that allow direct regulating physical and mechanical properties of polymer. Production of plasticizers became one of the most important branch of petrochemical industry. Recently, however, the range and production of plasticizers have drastically decreased due to the increased cost, which reduced the competitiveness of plasticized PVC products. Therefore, the expansion of plasticizer variety for PVC is a strategic task of great practical significance.
   The present work describes synthesis methods of esters on the basis of oxyalkylated alcohols suggested as polyvinyl chloride plasticizers. Physico-chemical properties of synthesized compounds were studied. Conditions for their production with maximum outcome were selected. The results of experiments in which obtained compounds were tested as additives in the plasticization of PVC showed that the obtained samples of cable plastic, adhesive PVC tapes and multi-layered polyvinyl chloride linoleum satisfy all the technical requirements by the main indicators: cable plastic compound - GOST 5960-72 with amendment 1-9; a PVC adhesive tape - Technical Conditions - 2245-001-00203312-2003; multilayered linoleum - GOST 7251-77.
   According to the experimental results, phthalates of oxyalkylated alcohols possess rather high efficiency as plasticizers of polyvinyl chloride and are recommended for use in the above-mentioned industrial PVC recipes.

AB  - Driven by the need for productivity and recovery, rotary veneer peeling for softwood plywood manufacturing has changed from the use of a small 5/8-inch (15.88 mm) diameter roller bar to a big roller bar with diameter ranging from 2.50 to 3.75 inches (63.50 to 95.25 mm). This study focused on the effects of conditioning temperature on veneer quality using a big roller bar. A 4-ft (1.22 m) pilot plant rotary lathe consisting of a 3-inch (76.20 mm) diameter roller bar was used to peel a total of 130 logs. The peeling study was conducted on three commonly used conifers, namely, western white spruce, lodgepole pine and Douglas fir. The laboratory results indicated that increasing log temperature led to increase in veneer surface roughness and thickness variation, but decrease in lathe checks. The optimum log temperatures under the slow-speed laboratory peeling condition were 85-100 degrees F (29-38 degrees C). Considering knife wear, lathe vibration and fast peeling speed, the optimum peeling temperatures for typical softwood plywood mills were found to be 85-95 degrees F (29-35 degrees C) for spruce, 95-100 degrees F (35-38 degrees C) for lodgepole pine, and 110-120 degrees F (43-49 degrees C) for Douglas fir. These temperatures were significantly lower than 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) previously suggested based on a small roller bar. The results of this study have been widely implemented by the Canadian softwood plywood industry with confirmed benefits of energy-saving and veneer quality improvement.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the scope of the adaptation challenge facing world agriculture in the coming decades. Due to rising temperatures throughout the tropics, pressures for adaptation will be greatest in some of the poorest parts of the world where the adaptive capacity is least abundant. We discuss both autonomous (market driven) and planned adaptations, distinguishing: (a) those that can be undertaken with existing technology, (b) those that involve development of new technologies, and (c) those that involve institutional/market and policy reforms. The paper then proceeds to identify which of these adaptations are currently modeled in integrated assessment studies and related analyses at global scale. This, in turn, gives rise to recommendations about how these models should be modified in order to more effectively capture climate change adaptation in the farm and food sector. In general, we find that existing integrated assessment models are better suited to analyzing adaptation by relatively well-endowed producers operating in market-integrated, developed countries. They likely understate climate impacts on agriculture in developing countries, while overstating the potential adaptations. This is troubling, since the need for adaptation will be greatest amongst the lower income producers in the poorest tropical countries. This is also where policies and public investments are likely to have the highest payoff. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for improving the empirical foundations of integrated assessment modeling with an emphasis on the poorest countries. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of climate change on agriculture in Northern Norway. It is based on downscaled climate projections for six different municipalities combined with interviews with farmers, advisors and administrative personnel in these municipalities. The projections document large climatic differences both between and within the different municipalities. The main predicted climatic changes include increasing temperatures and precipitation as well as increased frequency of certain types of extreme weather events. Despite challenges such as unstable winters, increased autumn precipitation and possibly more weeds and diseases, a prolongation of the current short growth season together with higher growth temperatures can give new opportunities for agriculture here. The impacts are expected to differ both within and between municipalities and will require tailored adaptive strategies. Most of these however should pose no difficulty implementing, having an agronomical basis that farmers are accustomed to cope with.

AB  - In the face of ongoing global climate and land use change, organisms have multiple possibilities to cope with the modification of their environment. The two main possibilities are to either adapt locally or disperse to a more suitable habitat. The evolution of both local adaptation and dispersal interacts and can be influenced by the spatial and temporal variation (of e.g. temperature or precipitation). In an individual based model (IBM), we explore evolution of phenotypes in landscapes with varying degree of spatial relative to global temporal variation in order to examine its influence on the evolution of dispersal, niche optimum and niche width. The relationship between temporal and spatial variation did neither influence the evolution of local adaptation in the niche optimum nor of niche widths. Dispersal probability is highly influenced by the spatio-temporal relationship: with increasing spatial variation, dispersal probability decreases. Additionally, the shape of the distribution of the trait values over patch attributes switches from hump- to U-shaped. At low spatial variance more individuals emigrate from average habitats, at high spatial variance more from extreme habitats. The comparatively high dispersal probability in extreme patches of landscapes with a high spatial variation can be explained by evolutionary succession of two kinds of adaptive response. Early in the simulations, extreme patches in landscapes with a high spatial variability act as sink habitats, where population persistence depends on highly dispersive individuals with a wide niche. With ongoing evolution, local adaptation of the remaining individuals takes over, but simultaneously a possible bet-hedging strategy promotes higher dispersal probabilities in those habitats. Here, in generations that experience extreme shifts from the temporal mean of the patch attribute, the expected fitness becomes higher for dispersing individuals than for philopatric individuals. This means that under certain circumstances, both local adaptation and high dispersal probability can be selected for for coping with the projected environmental changes in the future.

AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated that tardigrades in a resting state (tun state) are very resistant to exceptional stress levels in comparison with the resistance observed in multicellular organisms in general. The types of stress include desiccation and radiation, which are also relevant in astrobiological research, and therefore, tardigrades are used as multicellular model organisms. For example, tardigrades have been investigated in the TARSE, TARDIS, RoTaRad, and TARDIKISS projects; their survival has been evaluated according to stressful conditions that prevail in low earth orbit, including the effects of cosmic radiation and microgravity. Despite this interest, the study of tardigrade biology has been severely hampered by the sparsity of appropriate quantitative techniques that inform at the single-organism level. In this study, we present results on mass-specific respiration rates as a function of termination of anhydrobiosis and variations in temperature and salinity, including Mars-analog perchlorate solutions, by using microsensor technology to measure respiration. Based on our results for Richtersius cf coronifer, we estimated the activation energy (50.8 kJ/mole O-2) for its metabolism as well as Q10 for selected temperature intervals. Q10 was constant-similar to 1.5-between 2 degrees C and 33 degrees C, except for the interval 11-16 degrees C, where Q10 was 5.5. The steady-state mass-specific respiration rate of individuals of Richtersius cf coronifer increased with increasing salinity below the lethal limit, likely representing the energy requirements of its osmoregulatory response. We report the first quantitative data of a tardigrade's metabolic dynamics during the termination of anhydrobiosis, revealing significant variation between individuals. However, we observed a general trend, that is, a high initial metabolic rate after exposure to water. Our approach would allow us to carry out quantitative physiological studies of tardigrades on board of the International Space Station, and thus significantly extend the possibility of studying the response of multicellular organisms in space.
   Summary statement
   This article reports on first measurements of mass-specific respiration rates of individual tardigrades of the species Richtersius cf coronifer during termination of anhydrobiosis as well as measurements of the impact of temperature and salinity on oxygen uptake rates.

AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica is a facultative intracellular pathogen which invades to epithelial cells and survives in phagocytes. Since the internal environment of phagocytes should be stressful conditions for the phagocytosed Yersinia, the bacteria should respond to protect themselves from otherwise lethal results. We analyzed the stress-induced proteins which possibly contribute to survival of Yersinia within the phagocytes. Y. enterocolitica was radiolabeled during the growth in macrophage-like J774-1 cells, and the bacterial proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. At least 16 proteins were selectively induced in response to phagocytosis, and several out of 16 proteins were also induced by heat shock at 42 C or oxidative stresses in vitro. Of those, two major stress proteins were identified to be homologues of DnaK and CRPA by immunoblotting analysis. These results have indicated that Y. enterocolitica exhibits a global stress response to the hostile environment in the phagocytosed macrophage.

AB  - Symbiosis is a fascinating and diverse phenomenon. The study of symbiosis is important to understanding ecology, as it helps us understand relationships between organisms and provides insight into co-evolution, mutualism, adaptation, and survival. Ecological studies are challenging to implement in K-12 classrooms because they often require multiple organisms (often very different in size) and complex environments that are difficult to replicate accurately (e.g., soil composition, temperature, pH, and humidity). These factors can make it difficult to study quantitative changes in ecosystems. We developed an inexpensive, quantitative experiment for classrooms that can be used to explore important aspects of microbial symbiosis, pathogenesis, and ecology, and that helps support more investigations in this area of education. The experiment is low-cost, designed for K-12 teachers and students, uses common materials, and teaches students about the exciting relationships among bacteria, worms, and insects.

TI  - METHODOLOGICAL AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EXERCISE-RELATED HORMONE EVALUATIONS
T2  - SPORTS MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Improvements in laboratory techniques have allowed research related to exercise endocrinology to flourish. The emerging literature, however, is often inconsistent and contradictory. The discrepancies in research findings are possibly the result of poor control of confounding variables and/or inappropriate methodologies or analyses.
   Environmental and pretesting behavioural conditions must be standardised to minimise the influence of variables not directly related to the investigation. Environmental temperature and relative humidity, alcohol, caffeine and nicotine intake, prandial state, sleep deprivation and previous exercise can each alter hormonal responses to exercise. Both prescription and over-the-counter medications can also modify normal hormonal secretions thereby confusing exercise-induced findings.
   Specimen collection and analysis procedures must be controlled carefully. Changes in plasma volume related to postural changes or tourniquet-induced stasis can confound attempts to isolate exercise-related endocrine responses. The established circadian and rhythmical variations characteristic of many hormones need to be controlled. The specimen selection (plasma, serum, urine, etc), collection, storage and analysis procedures should be carefully planned and evaluated. The magnitude of haemolysis, analytical and biological variation must also be monitored.
   Isolating the hormonal perturbations resulting from a particular exercise variable can be very difficult. Exercise intensity, duration, mode, frequency and volume may each have specific effects on the endocrine changes seen with exercise and training. Furthermore, hormonal responses to exercise are dependent upon initial training status and fitness level.
   The statistical procedures and data presentation options selected to convey experimental findings can bias experimental results. The descriptive and inferential statistics to be used for data analysis should be preplanned and consistent with the underlying assumptions of the analytical procedure. Careful consideration should be given to the biological relevance of statistically significant findings. In some cases, data transformations (e.g. absolute vs relative changes, logarithmic) should be considered for analysis or presentation. Given the individual nature of hormonal responses to exercise, emphasis should be placed presenting individual data.
   Other considerations, including age, sex, racial origin and disease conditions need to be controlled for when trying to examine exercise-induced hormone changes.

AB  - The accurate prediction of air temperature is important in many areas of decision-making including agricultural management, transportation and energy management. Previous research has focused on the development of artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict air temperature from one to twelve hours in advance. The inputs to these models included a constant duration of prior data with a fixed resolution for all environmental variables for all prediction horizons. The overall goal of this research was to develop more accurate ANN models that could predict air temperature for each prediction horizon. The specific objective was to determine if the ANN model accuracy could be improved by applying a genetic algorithm (GA) for each prediction horizon to determine the preferred duration and resolution of input prior data for each environmental variable. The ANN models created based on this GA based approach provided smaller errors than the models created based on the existing constant duration and fixed data resolution approach for all twelve prediction horizons. Except for a few cases, the GA generally included a longer duration for prior air temperature data and shorter durations for other environmental variables. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) for the evaluation input patterns of the one-, four-, eight-, and twelve-hour prediction models that were based on this GA approach were 0.564 degrees C, 1.264 degrees C, 1.766 degrees C and 2.018 degrees C, respectively. These MAEs were improvements of 3.98%, 4.59%, 2.55% and 1.70% compared to the models that were created based on the existing approach for the same corresponding prediction horizons. Thus, the GA based approach to determine the duration and resolution of prior input data resulted in more accurate ANN models than the existing ones for air temperature prediction. Future work could examine the effects of various GA and fitness evaluation parameters that were part of the approach used in this study. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shewanella baltica is a typical specific spoilage organism causing the deterioration of seafood, but the exact regulation of its adaptive and competitive dominance in diverse environments remains undefined. In this study, the regulatory function of two sigma factors, RpoS and RpoN, in environmental adaptation and spoilage potential were evaluated in S. baltica SB02. Two in-frame deletion mutants, Delta rpoS and Delta rpoN, were constructed to explore the roles in their motility, biofilm formation, stress response and spoilage potential, as well as antibiotics by comparing the phenotypes and transcription with those of wild type (WT) strain. Compared with WT strain, the Delta rpoN showed the slower growth and weaker motility due to loss of flagella, while swimming of the Delta rpoS was increased. Deletion of rpoN significantly decreased biofilm biomass, and production of exopolysaccharide and pellicle, resulting in a thinner biofilm structure, while Delta rpoS formed the looser aggregation in biofilm. Resistance of S. baltica to NaCl, heat, ethanol and three oxidizing disinfectants apparently declined in the two mutants compared to WT strain. The Delta rpoN mutant decreased sensory score, accumulation of trimethylamine, putrescine and TVB-N and protease activity, while a weaker effect was observed in Delta rpoS. The two mutants had significantly higher susceptibility to antibiotics than WT strain, especially Delta rpoN. Deficiency of rpoN and rpoS significantly repressed the activities of two diketopiperazines related to quorum sensing (QS). Furthermore, transcriptome analyses revealed that RpoN was involved in the regulation of the expression of 143 genes, mostly including flagellar assembly, nitrogen and amino acid metabolism, ABC transporters. Transcript changes of seven differentially expressed coding sequences were in agreement with the phenotypes observed in the two mutants. Our findings reveal that RpoN, as a central regulator, controls the fitness and bacterial spoilage in S. baltica, while RpoS is a key regulatory factor of stress response. Characterization of these two sigma regulons in Shewanella has expanded current understanding of a possible co-regulatory mechanism with QS for adaptation and spoilage potential.

AB  - Proteomic analysis was performed to compare the effects of Arsenic (As), seawater acidification (Low pH) and the combination of both stressors (Low pH + As) on Crassostrea angulata and Crassostrea gigas juveniles in the context of global environmental change. This study aimed to elucidate if two closely related Crassostrea species respond similarly to these environmental stressors, considering both single and combined exposures, to infer if the simultaneous exposure to both stressors induced a differentiated response. Identification of the most important differentially expressed proteins between conditions revealed marked differences in the response of each species towards single and combined exposures, evidencing species-related differences towards each experimental condition. Moreover, protein alterations observed in the combined exposure (Low pH + As) were substantially different from those observed in single exposures. Identified proteins and their putative biological functions revealed an array of modes of action in each condition. Among the most important, those involved in cellular structure (Actin, Atlastin, Severin, Gelsolin, Coronin) and extracellular matrix modulation (Ependymin, Tight junction ZO-1, Neprilysin) were strongly regulated, although in different exposure conditions and species. Data also revealed differences regarding metabolic modulation capacity (ATP beta, Enolase, Aconitate hydratase) and oxidative stress response (Aldehyde dehydrogenase, Lactoylglutathione, Retinal dehydrogenase) of each species, which also depended on single or combined exposures, illustrating a different response capacity of both oyster species to the presence of multiple stressors. Interestingly, alterations of piRNA abundance in C. angulata suggested genome reconfiguration in response to multiple stressors, likely an important mode of action related to adaptive evolution mechanisms previously unknown to oyster species, which requires further investigation. The present findings provide a deeper insight into the complexity of C. angulata and C. gigas responses to environmental stress at the proteome level, evidencing different capacities to endure abiotic changes, with relevance regarding the ecophysiological fitness of each species and competitive advantages in a changing environment.

AB  - The rapid development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing approaches in recent years has facilitated large-scale discovery and expression analysis of non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, in traditional and non-traditional animal models. Such an approach has been leveraged to amplify, identify, and quantify miRNAs in several models of cold adaptation. The present study is the first to investigate the status of these small RNAs in an insect species that uses the freeze avoidance strategy of cold hardiness, the gall moth Epiblema scudderiana. To characterize the overall miRNA expression profile and to identify cold-modulated miRNAs in control (5 A degrees C) and cold-exposed (-15 A degrees C) E. scudderiana larvae, a next-generation sequencing-based approach was undertaken. A total of 44 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between the two conditions; 21 up-regulated miRNAs and 23 down-regulated miRNAs in -15 A degrees C-exposed larvae as compared with controls. Among the most significant changes observed in miRNAs with potential relevance to cold adaptation were elevated miR-1-3p, miR-92b-3p, and miR-133-3p levels as well as reduced miR-13a-3p and miR-13b-3p levels in E. scudderiana larvae exposed to cold temperatures. Expression values obtained from next-generation sequencing were also validated by a quantitative PCR approach for five miRNAs; miR-34-5p, miR-274-5p, miR-275-3p, miR-307a-3p, and miR-316-5p. Overall, this work provides the first description of a miRNA signature for subzero survival by a freeze-avoiding insect using a high-throughput approach and positions a new group of miRNAs at the forefront of the molecular changes underlying cold adaptation.

AB  - Climate warming has lead to increased genetic introgression across a narrow hybrid zone separating the eastern and Canadian tiger swallowtails (Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis). This situation has led to the formation of an allochronically separated hybrid population with a delayed emerging phenotype or "late flight''. Here, we assess how the recombination of the parental genomes that lead to this phenotype may have facilitated another major ecological shift, host-use divergence. We first contrast the ovipositional profiles of the late flight population to that of the parental species P. glaucus and P. canadensis. Subsequently we contrast the larval survival and growth of the late flight, a P. canadensis and a P. glaucus population, and a population from the northern edge of the hybrid zone on five hosts. Our results indicate that the ovipositional preference of this hybrid swarm is identical to that of the introgressing parental species, P. glaucus. Due to the absence of the preferred hosts of P. glaucus (Liriodendron tulipifera L. and Ptelea trifoliata L.) where the late flight occurs, this ovipositional pattern implies a functional specialization onto a secondary host of both parental species, Fraxinus americana L. In contrast, the larval host-use abilities represent a mixture of P. glaucus and P. canadensis, indicating divergence in larval host-use abilities has not taken place. However, high genetic variability (genetic coefficient of variation) is present for growth on F. americana in the late flight hybrid swarm and tradeoffs for larval performance on the preferred hosts of the parental species are evident; indicating a strong potential for future specialization in larval host-use abilities. This current scenario represents an instance where a shift in a major ecological trait, host use, is likely occurring as a byproduct of a shift in an unrelated trait (delayed emergence) leading to partial reproductive isolation.

AB  - The effects of climate change on animal populations may be shaped by habitat characteristics at both micro- and macro-habitat level, however, empirical studies integrating these two scales of observation are lacking. As analyses of the effects of climate change commonly rely on data from a much larger scale than the microhabitat level organisms are affected at, this mismatch risks hampering progress in developing understanding of the details of the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms and, ultimately, effective actions to preserve their populations. Cavity nesters, often with a conservation status of concern, are an ideal model because the cavity is a microenvironment potentially different from the macroenvironment but nonetheless inevitably interacting with it. The lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) is a cavity nester which was until recently classified by as Vulnerable species. Since 2004, for nine years, we collected detailed biotic and abiotic data at both micro- and macro-scales of observation in a kestrel population breeding in the Gela Plain (Italy), a Mediterranean area where high temperatures may reach lethal values for the nest content. We show that macro-climatic features needed to be integrated with both abiotic and biotic factors recorded at a microscale before reliably predicting nest temperatures. Among the nest types used by lesser kestrels, we detected a preferential occupation of the cooler nest types, roof tiles, by early breeders whereas, paradoxically, late breeders nesting with hotter temperatures occupied the overheated nest holes. Not consistent with such a suggested nest selection, the coolest nest type did not host a higher reproductive success than the overheated nests. We discussed our findings in the light of cavity temperatures and nest types deployed within conservation actions assessed by integrating selected factors at different observation scales.

AB  - The physiological response of the common clownfish, A. ocellaris, to factors pertinent to air transportation conditions was studied in three stages: (i) determination of temperature effect and exposure process on oxygen consumption rates; (ii) elucidation of excretion trends of selected metabolites in simulated packaging experiments, and (iii) preliminary tolerance studies of some packaging parameters. Temperature significantly affected the metabolic rates of the clownfish. Q(10) values were relatively constant in fish exposed to sudden changes in temperature (from 25 degrees C to either 15, 20, 30 or 35 degrees C). Those treated with gradual changes in temperature showed much greater increases in oxygen consumption at temperatures above 25 degrees C. The temperature selected for subsequent experiments was 25 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen levels of packaging water remained high throughout the 48-h period. Water [H+] and total dissolved and unionized CO2 concentrations changed most significantly during the initial 24 h and then levelled off by 48 h. Similarities in changes of concentrations between these imply close interaction between the measured variables. The total dissolved NH3 continued to increase with no signs of levelling off. The concentrations of unionized NH3 increased four-fold to 1.4 mu M The excretion of CO2 decreased linearly at a rate of 150 nmol/g per h while the excretion of NH3 increased at a rate of 97 nmol/g per h. A temperature range between 24 and 32 degrees C was found to be necessary for survival of the fish with an optimal temperature of 27 degrees C. Clownfish started to die when the pH of the seawater fell to 6.34 or total dissolved NH3 rose above 0.97 mM ([unionized NH3] = 38.35 mu M). At 15 degrees C, the fish started to die at 20 mm Hg which was twice the oxygen level at 20 degrees C or above.

AB  - Climate warming is changing distributions and phenologies of many organisms and may also impact on vectors of disease-causing pathogens. In Europe, the tick Ixodes ricinus is the primary vector of medically important pathogens (e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis). How might climate change affect I.ricinus host-seeking behavior (questing)? We hypothesize that, in order to maximize survival, I.ricinus have adapted their questing in response to temperature in accordance with local climates. We predicted that ticks from cooler climates quest at cooler temperatures than those from warmer climates. This would suggest that I.ricinus can adapt and therefore have the potential to be resilient to climate change. I.ricinus were collected from a cline of climates using a latitudinal gradient (northeast Scotland, North Wales, South England, and central France). Under laboratory conditions, ticks were subjected to temperature increases of 1 degrees C per day, from 6 to 15 degrees C. The proportion of ticks questing was recorded five times per temperature (i.e., per day). The theoretical potential to quest was then estimated for each population over the year for future climate change projections. As predicted, more ticks from cooler climates quested at lower temperatures than did ticks from warmer climates. The proportion of ticks questing was strongly associated with key climate parameters from each location. Our projections, based on temperature alone, suggested that populations could advance their activity season by a month under climate change, which has implications for exposure periods of hosts to tick-borne pathogens. Our findings suggest that I.ricinus have adapted their behavior in response to climate, implying some potential to adapt to climate change. Predictive models of I.ricinus dynamics and disease risk over continental scales would benefit from knowledge of these differences between populations.

Typhimurium is capable of withstanding extended periods of starvation and assault from a number of different stresses that rapidly kill growing cells. These unique properties of the C-starved cell are the direct result of a series of genetic and physiological adaptations referred to as the starvation-stress response (SSR). Previous work established that the SSR of S. Typhimurium is partially regulated by the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor sigma(E). As part of an effort to identify sigma(E)-regulated SSR genes, we investigated surA and fkpA, encoding two different classes of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that function in folding cell envelope proteins. Both surA and fkpA are members of the heat-shock-inducible sigma(E) regulon of Escherichia coli. Although both genes are expressed in C-starved Salmonella cells, evidence indicates that surA and fkpA are not C-starvation-inducible. Furthermore, their expression during C-starvation does not appear to be sigma(E)-dependent. Nonetheless, surA and fkpA proved to be important, to differing degrees, for long-term C-starvation survival and for the cross-resistance of C-starved cells to high temperature, acidic pH, and the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B, but neither were required for cross-resistance to oxidative stress. These results point to fundamental differences between heat-shock-inducible and C-starvation-inducible genes regulated by sigma(E) and suggest that genes other than surA and fkpA are involved in the sigma(E)-regulated branch of the SSR in Salmonella.

AB  - Combinations of organic acids are often used in ready-to-eat foods to control the growth of Listeria monocytogenes during refrigerated storage. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess synergy between two organic acid growth inhibitors under conditions similar to those present in cold-smoked salmon, and to assess the effect of evolutionary lineage on response to those growth inhibitors. Thirteen strains of L. monocytogenes. representing lineages land II, were grown at 7 degrees C in broth at pH 6.1 and 4.65% water-phase NaCl, which was supplemented with 2% potassium lactate, 0.14% sodium diacetate, or the combination of both at the same levels. Our data suggest that lineages adapt similarly to these inhibitors, as the only significant growth parameter difference between lineages was a minor effect (+/-0.16 day, P = 0.0499) on lag phase (lambda). For all strains, lactate significantly extended lambda, from 2.6 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 days (P < 0.001), and lowered the maximum growth rate (mu(max)) from 0.54 +/- 0.06 to 0.49 +/- 0.04 log(CFU/ml)/day (P < 0.001), compared with the control. Diacetate was ineffective alone, but in combination with lactate, synergistically increased lambda to 6.6 +/- 1.6 days (P < 0.001) and decreased mu(max) to 0.34 +/- 0.05 log(CFU/ml)/day (P < 0.001). Monte Carlo simulations provided further evidence for synergy between diacetate and lactate by predicting signficantly slower growth to nominal endpoints for the combination of inhibitors. This study shows potassium lactate and sodium diacetate have significant synergistic effects on both lambda and mu(max) of L. monocytogenes at refrigeration temperature in broth, and justifies combining these inhibitors, at effective levels, in food product formulations.

AB  - Climates are changing worldwide, and populations are under selection to adapt to these changes. Changing temperature, in particular, can directly impact ectotherms and their parasites, with potential consequences for whole ecosystems. The potential of parasite populations to adapt to climate change largely depends on the amount of genetic variation they possess in their responses to environmental fluctuations. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to look at differences among parasite genotypes in response to temperature, with the goal of quantifying the extent of variation among conspecifics in their responses to increasing temperature. Snails infected with single genotypes of the trematode Maritrema novaezealandensis were sequentially acclimatised to two different temperatures, 'current' (15 degrees C) and 'elevated' (20 degrees C), over long periods. These temperatures are based on current average field conditions in the natural habitat and those predicted to occur during the next few decades. The output and activity of cercariae (free-swimming infective stages emerging from snails) were assessed for each genotype at each temperature. The results indicate that, on average, both cercarial output and activity are higher at the elevated acclimation temperature. More importantly, the output and activity of cercariae are strongly influenced by a genotype-by-temperature interaction, such that different genotypes show different responses to increasing temperature. Both the magnitude and direction (increase or decrease) of responses to temperature varied widely among genotypes. Therefore, there is much potential for natural selection to act on this variation, and predicting how the trematode M. novaezealandensis will respond to the climate changes predicted for the next century will prove challenging.

AB  - Temperature is one of the most important abiotic factors influencing the adaptation and diversification of insects. Diverse and complex physiological mechanisms have evolved to help insects adapt to seasonal changes in temperature and prevent cold injury. Although the mechanisms of seasonal adaptation to low temperatures have been studied for insects in different taxa, none of these mechanisms have been investigated in scale insects in the superfamily Coccoidea. The crapemyrtle bark scale, Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae (Kuwana) (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), is a newly introduced scale pest of crapemyrtles, Lagerstroemia spp. (Myrtales: Lythraceae). Our previous study concerning the cold tolerance of this pest suggested that, from summer to winter, A. lagerstroemiae seasonally adapted to lower temperature with a 5 degrees C reduction of supercooling points. In addition, time required to achieve the same levels of mortality at lower temperatures also increased. In this study, we used A. lagerstroemiae as a model system to investigate the physiological mechanisms correlated with changes in cold tolerance in scale insects, by measuring water content, lipid content and fatty acid composition, and cryoprotective polyols and sugars every other month. Results suggested that water content was lower in winter and early spring than in summer and early fall (40.8% vs. 63.3%). The proportions of the fatty acids in PL were similar over seasons, but in TAG, shorter chain fatty acids (from C6:0 to C10:0) increased in winter as longer chain fatty acids (from C14:0 to C18:0) decreased. Among all measured polyols and sugars, including glycerol, D-mannitol, myo-inositol, and D-trehalose, the levels of D-mannitol were the highest in January 2016, which were 19-times of those in March 2016 and 4.5-times of those in September 2016. Results from this study provide a better understanding on how A. lagerstroemiae overwinters, which may give insights into the overwintering strategies of other scale insects.

AB  - This study aimed to improve a sperm cryopreservation protocol for farmed Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), glycerol, ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and methanol were chosen as cryoprotectants (CPAs). Four different equilibration time (5, 10, 30, and 60 min), and two types of equilibration temperature (4 degrees C and 20 degrees C) were selected at the present experiment. Most equilibration temperatures with each CPA showed significant differences among different equilibration time. Post-thaw sperm motility of five CPAs showed no significant difference at two equilibration temperature. Based on these results, 8% Me2SO, 8% EG, 6% PG, 2% glycerol, and 2% methanol were chosen to determine optimal conditions for sperm cryopreservation of H. discus hannai. The highest post-thaw sperm motility (8% Me2SO: 50.6%, 8% EG: 45.6%, 2% glycerol: 44.5%, 6% PG: 28.7%, 2% methanol: 25.4%) was achieved after exposing sperm to liquid nitrogen (LN2) vapor for 10 min at 5 cm above the LN2 surface and then submerging them in LN2 for at least 2 h followed by thawing at 60 degrees C with seawater and recovering them at 20 degrees C with seawater. In this study, 8% Me2SO and 2% glycerol were chosen to check post-thaw sperm quality to estimate percentages of plasma membrane integrity (PMI), mitochondrial potential analysis (MP), and acrosome integrity (AI) using fluorescent techniques. No significant difference in PMI, MP, and AI was found between sperm cryopreserved with 8% Me2SO and those cryopreserved with 2% glycerol. The current study has demonstrated that 8% Me2SO was optimal for sperm cryopreservation for H. discus hannai with 5 min of equilibration time, 5 cm of rack height and 60 degrees C of thawing temperature. The present research provides more effective cryopreservation methods for H. discus hannai sperm than previous studies.

AB  - Pharmaceutical cocrystals have attracted increasing attention over the past decade as an alternative way to modify the physicochemical properties and hence improve the bioavailability of a drug, without sacrificing thermodynamic stability. Our previous work has demonstrated the viability of in situ formation of ibuprofen/isonicotinamide cocrystal suspensions within a matrix carrier via a single-step hot melt extrusion (HME) process. The key aim of the current work is to establish optimized processing conditions to improve cocrystal yield within extruded matrices. The solubility of each individual cocrystal component in the matrix carrier was estimated using two different methods, calculation of Hansen solubility parameters and Flory-Huggins solution theory using a melting point depression measurement method, respectively. The latter was found to be more relevant to extrusion cocrystallization because of the ability to predict miscibility across a range of temperatures. The predictions obtained from the F-H phase diagrams were verified using ternary extrusion processing. Temperatures that promote solubilization of the parent reagents during processing and precipitation of the newly formed cocrystal were found to be the most suitable in generating high cocrystal yields. The incorporation of intensive mixing/kneading elements to the screw configuration was also shown to significantly improve the cocrystal yield when utilizing a matrix platform. This work has shown that intensive mixing, in combination with appropriate temperature selection, can significantly improve the cocrystal yield within a stable and low viscosity carrier during HME processing. Most importantly, this work reports, for the very first time in the literature, the use of the F-H phase diagrams to guide the most appropriate HME processing window to drive higher cocrystal yield.

AB  - Aims: This study aimed to isolate and characterize putative new probiotic with antimicrobial properties against common fish pathogens from the gut of Oreochromis spp. (red tilapia).
   Methodology and results: A total of 28 colonies were isolated from gut of Oreochromis spp. and characterized phenotypically. Eight isolates were selected for probiotic characterization. Temperature, salinity, pH and bile salt tolerance, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial test against selected fish pathogens (Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda and Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus ATCC 25923) were conducted. Characterization studies revealed isolates suited for freshwater environment and exhibited tolerance against wide range of salinity, pH and bile salt. Isolates displayed different antibiotic susceptibility profile, with six exhibited antimicrobial properties against E. tarda. Molecular identification based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed 99.44%, 98.59% and 91.21% sequence similarity with Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides strain 3832(T), Leuconostoc lactis strain KCC202369(T) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides strain 4332(T), respectively as compared to known sequence in the GenBank. When identified Leuconostoc spp. were coated on feed pellets, no major decrease in viability over 21 days of storage at 4 degrees C were observed, with an average of 8 log CFU/mL.
   Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The characterized species allow further application assessment of the probiotic-supplemented tilapia feed. Host-originated Leuconostoc displayed potential antimicrobial properties against fish pathogen E. tarda. The isolates Leuconostoc is expected to provide protective effect for Oreochromis spp. against edwardsiellosis and to exert beneficial effects more efficiently as compared to commercial probiotics which are not specifically target for Oreochromis spp., thereby indirectly helping fish farmers in achieving economic sustainability and increase affordability of fish.

AB  - Plain Language Summary Phytoplankton growth in the seasonally productive Southern Ocean is typically limited by iron (Fe). In the next century, however, Fe inputs and temperature are predicted to increase. Dissolved concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) may also change due to physical and biological drivers, altering the stoichiometric N:P ratio of the water column. Two separate experiments were conducted to study how these predicted changes will impact nutrient utilization by two natural microbial communities from the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The first investigation focused on a Terra Nova Bay community amended with Fe and grown under a wide range of seven different N:P ratios. Building on the results of the first study, a McMurdo Sound community was incubated under a factorial design at high, medium (ambient), and low N:P ratios, with and without Fe addition, and at ambient versus elevated temperature. In both experiments absolute uptake rates of bicarbonate, nitrate, and amino acids by two size fractions (0.7-5.0m and>5.0m) of microorganisms were measured using stable isotopes. For Terra Nova Bay microorganisms, significant differences in nutrient uptake rates occurred when the N:P ratio was elevated, and nitrate uptake rates significantly increased early in the experiment but were not different at the end. For McMurdo Sound microorganisms, changing the N:P supply ratio did not have a clear effect, while temperature elevation and/or Fe addition significantly increased nutrient uptake. Results indicate that changing the dissolved N:P ratio can potentially alter nutrient uptake rates; however, the impact of temperature and Fe are greater.
   The Southern Ocean is one of the most biologically important ecosystems on our planet. Microscopic plants, called phytoplankton, form the base of the food web in the Southern Ocean and play a direct role in regulating how much and how fast elements like nitrogen and carbon are cycled throughout the world ocean. The goal of this research was to determine how predicted changes in the environment will impact how fast phytoplankton use these elements. The conditions that we tested included elevated temperature, addition of iron, and the proportion of nitrogen to phosphorus in the seawater. These parameters were selected because temperatures are increasing in the Southern Ocean, and the relative availability of nutrients can alter what species of phytoplankton are present and how fast they grow. Phytoplankton were collected from two locations in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, and grown for a few weeks under experimental conditions. Our results demonstrate that all three parameters, warmer temperatures, the addition of iron, and changing nitrogen to phosphorus ratios will increase how fast phytoplankton use nitrogen and carbon, but the impact of elevated temperature and the addition of iron had a much larger impact than the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio.

AB  - The evolution of ''fertile'' mantle has been studied by proton microprobe (PIXE) analysis of minerals of a high-temperature sheared xenolith from the Thaba Putsoa kimberlite in Lesotho. southern Africa. Analyzed elements include Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, and Zr. Garnets are homogeneous in Ni and Zn but have rims enriched relative to cores in Zr and Y. Compositions of olivine neoblasts define intergranular gradients of Fe, Zn, and Ni: Fe-rich olivine is relatively Zn-rich but Ni-poor. Although individual clinopyroxene grains are nearly homogeneous, clinopyroxene associated with Fe-rich olivine is relatively Fe- and Zn-rich but Sr- and Cr-poor.
   The trace-element abundances and compositional gradients constrain the processes of peridotite enrichment and the thermal history. Enrichment of Zr, Y, and Fe in garnet rims documents infiltration of a silica-undersaturated melt. The Fe-rich olivine compositions and the Zn and Fe gradients establish that the xenolith was sampled from near a melt conduit. Mechanical mixing of inhomogeneous peridotite' and melt infiltration may have been concurrent. Because garnets appear homogeneous in Ni, mantle temperature changes affecting PHN 1611 occurred before or over a longer period than the melt infiltration.
   Measured and calculated abundances of many incompatible trace elements in the rock are similar to those proposed for primitive mantle. Calculated chondrite-normalized abundances of Sr, Ti, Zr, and Y are like those of appropriate REE. Enrichment processes in PHN 1611 proceeded at unusually high recorded temperature and in the apparent absence of minor phases common in lower-temperature metasomatized rocks, but similar processes may be common. In particular, mechanical mixing near mantle dikes may frequently occur. These enrichment mechanisms may produce xenolith compositions that resemble some proposed for primitive mantle but that have different implications for mantle evolution.

AB  - Animals select their optimal environmental temperature, even when faced with alternatives that differ only slightly. This behavior is critical as small differences in temperature of only several degrees can have a profound effect on the survival and rate of development of poikilothermic animals, such as the fruit fly. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila larvae choose their preferred temperature of 17.5 degrees C over slightly cooler temperatures (14-16 degrees C) through activation of chordotonal neurons. Mutations affecting a transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid channel, Inactive (Iav), which is expressed specifically in chordotonal neurons, eliminated the ability to choose 17.5 degrees C over 14-16 degrees C. The impairment in selecting 17.5 degrees C resulted from absence of an avoidance response, which is normally mediated by an increase in turns at the lower temperatures. We conclude that the decision to select the preferred over slightly cooler temperatures requires iav and is achieved by activating chordotonal neurons, which in turn induces repulsive behaviors, due to an increase in high angle turns.

AB  - Neanderthals inhabited Western Eurasia from approximately 300 to 30 thousand years ago (ka). They are distinguished by a unique combination of anatomical traits, and are commonly associated with Middle Paleolithic lithic industries. Current consensus among paleoanthropologists is that they represented a separate Eurasian human lineage, which evolved in isolation from the rest of the Old World and which shared a common ancestor with modem humans in the Middle Pleistocene. It is thought that some aspects of the distinctive Neanderthal anatomy evolved in response to selection related to the extreme cold of the European glacial cycles. Nevertheless, genetic drift seems to be partially responsible for the evolution of these traits. The last appearance of Neanderthals in the fossil record ca. 30 ka BP dates a few millennia after the first appearance of modern humans in Europe. The retrieval of ancient mitochondrial and, more recently, nuclear DNA from Neanderthal fossil puts us in the unique position to combine fossil with genetic evidence to address questions about their evolution, paleobiology and eventual fate.

AB  - interaction between the quality of the environment and the health of the exposed population determines the survival response of living organisms. The phenomenon of induced tolerance by exposure to threshold levels of stressors to stimulate natural defense mechanisms has potential therapeutic value. The paucity of information on predictability of individual response and information on the operative fundamental mechanisms limit applicability of the adaptive tolerance strategy. A potential biomarker of the stress response includes members of the stress-inducible ubiquitin gene family. Transcript sizes detected with Northern blot analysis identify different classes of ubiquitin gene family members and the intensity of the radioactive signal allows abundance determinations. Using moderate exercise as the stressor, significant increase (p < 0.028) in abundance of inducible polyubiquitin genes was found in human blood. Both the potential of exercise as a model system of a natural stress inducer and polyubiquitin as a biomarker of stress were established in these studies.

AB  - We study the dynamical evolution of short-period planets in the multiple planetary system during the epoch of protostellar disk depletion. Through a detailed case analysis for the triple-planet system around nu Andromedae, we identify the necessary condition for the survival of its short-period planet b. In this study, we calculate the planets' orbit evolution including effects of the post-Newtonian potential of the host star, the potential of an evolving disk, and the potential due to the flattening of the star produced by the stellar rotation and the tide from the planet. At its present-day semimajor axis of 0.059 AU, the negligible eccentricity of planet b is most likely damped by the dissipation of the tidal perturbation induced by the star on the planet. But this process also leads to the heating of the planets' interior and probably the inflation of their sizes. If planet b once had an eccentricity greater than 0.1 at its present location, the tidal dissipation process would induce it to overflow its Roche lobe, lose its mass, and undergo an orbital expansion. Using this constraint, we reconstruct the eccentricity evolution of planet b. We find that even if planet b arrives at its present location on a nearly circular orbit, its eccentricity could have been excited by the sweeping secular resonances of two outer planets, c and d, during the disk depletion. In addition to the contribution from the disk potential, the resonant condition is also modified by the precession of planet b due to the post-Newtonian correction and rotational distortion of nu And's gravitational potential. Today, the former effect offsets the secular resonance, whereas the latter effect is weak. But during the depletion of the disk, precession due to the relativistic correction is outpaced by that due to the disk potential. The passage of the sweeping secular resonance near the surface of nu And cannot be avoided unless it had a sufficiently fast spin to provide a flattened shape with a finite quadrupole moment, which dominates the precession of the planet's orbit. Finally, we show that the survival of planet b requires its eccentricity to be low at all times, which would be possible only if the spin period of nu And was shorter than 2 days during the depletion of the disk.

AB  - We present an analytical method for quantifying exciton hopping in an energetically disordered system with quenching sites. The method is subsequently used to provide a quantitative understanding of exciton hopping in a quantum dot (QD) array. Several statistical quantities that characterize the dynamics (survival probability, average number of distinct sites visited, average hopping distance, and average hopping rate in the initial stage) are obtained experimentally by measuring time-resolved fluorescence intensities at various temperatures. The time evolution of these quantities suggests in a quantitative way that at low temperature an exciton tends to be trapped at a local low-energy site, while at room temperature, exciton hopping occurs repeatedly, leading to a large hopping distance. This method will serve to facilitate highly efficient optoelectronic devices using QDs such as photovoltaic cells and light-emitting diodes, since exciton hopping is considered to strongly influence their operational parameters. The presence of a dark QD (quenching site) that exhibits fast decay is also quantified.

AB  - We examined long-term growth trends of white oak by comparing tree-ring chronologies developed from an old-growth stand, where the average tree age was 222 years, with a second-growth stand where average tree age was 78 years. Evaluation of basal area growth trends suggested that an anomalous decrease in basal area increment trend occurred in both stands during the 1950s. To determine whether climatic factors could explain this decrease we developed conventional and ridge regression models based on step-wise selection of mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation variables for the period 1895 to 1940. The years from 1941 to 1950 were used for verification of developed models; only the ridge regression models produced verifiable models. All models failed to predict actual growth in the period from 1951 to 1980 for both stands. The inability to predict growth response in the more recent period may relate to a non-constant climatic response of white oak or to non-climatic factors such as air pollution or altered atmospheric CO2 concentrations that have affected tree growth-climate relationships.

AB  - The interplay between divergence and phenotypic plasticity is critical to our understanding of a species' adaptive potential under rapid climate changes. We investigated divergence and plasticity in natural populations of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas with a congeneric oyster Crassostrea angulata from southern China used as an outgroup. Genome re-sequencing of 371 oysters revealed unexpected genetic divergence in a small area that coincided with phenotypic divergence in growth, physiology, heat tolerance and gene expression across environmental gradients. These findings suggest that selection and local adaptation are pervasive and, together with limited gene flow, influence population structure. Genes showing sequence differentiation between populations also diverged in transcriptional response to heat stress. Plasticity in gene expression is positively correlated with evolved divergence, indicating that plasticity is adaptive and favoured by organisms under dynamic environments. Divergence in heat tolerance-partly through acetylation-mediated energy depression-implies differentiation in adaptive potential. Trade-offs between growth and survival may play an important role in local adaptation of oysters and other marine invertebrates.

AB  - The fate of viruses in contaminated oysters has received a significant amount of attention in the fields of oyster aquaculture, food quality control, and public health. However, intensive studies through laboratory experiments and in situ observations are often conducted under a narrow range of experimental conditions and for a specific purpose in their respective fields.
   Contamination of oysters with a variety of viruses is one key pathway to trigger outbreaks of massive oyster mortality as well as human illnesses, including gastroenteritis and hepatitis. Much effort has gone into examining the fate of viruses in contaminated oysters, yet the current state of knowledge of nonlinear virus-oyster interactions is not comprehensive because most studies have focused on a limited number of processes under a narrow range of experimental conditions. A framework is needed for describing the complex nonlinear virus-oyster interactions. Here, we introduce a mathematical model that includes key processes for viral dynamics in oysters, such as oyster filtration, viral replication, the antiviral immune response, apoptosis, autophagy, and selective accumulation. We evaluate the model performance for two groups of viruses, those that replicate in oysters (e.g., ostreid herpesvirus) and those that do not (e.g., norovirus), and show that this model simulates well the viral dynamics in oysters for both groups. The model analytically explains experimental findings and predicts how changes in different physiological processes and environmental conditions nonlinearly affect in-host viral dynamics, for example, that oysters at higher temperatures may be more resistant to infection by ostreid herpesvirus. It also provides new insight into food treatment for controlling outbreaks, for example, that depuration for reducing norovirus levels is more effective in environments where oyster filtration rates are higher. This study provides the foundation of a modeling framework to guide future experiments and numerical modeling for better prediction and management of outbreaks. IMPORTANCE The fate of viruses in contaminated oysters has received a significant amount of attention in the fields of oyster aquaculture, food quality control, and public health. However, intensive studies through laboratory experiments and in situ observations are often conducted under a narrow range of experimental conditions and for a specific purpose in their respective fields. Given the complex interactions of various processes and nonlinear viral responses to changes in physiological and environmental conditions, a theoretical framework fully describing the viral dynamics in oysters is warranted to guide future studies from a top-down design. Here, we developed a process-based, in-host modeling framework that builds a bridge for better communications between different disciplines studying virus-oyster interactions.

AB  - This study evaluated the growth and control of Salmonella serotypes in a soft Hispanic type cheese (Queso Fresco). Cheese was made in the laboratory using a commercial procedure and after inoculation it was stored under vacuum at temperatures ranging from 6 to 30-degrees-C. The minimum temperature that allowed growth of Salmonella was 8-degrees-C. Accumulated data from the growth studies were used for the development of models relating the square root of 1/LT (LT = lag time) and specific growth rate to temperature. The effect of selected antimicrobials (potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and sodium lactate) on the growth and survival of Salmonella in milk and in cheese at various storage temperatures was also examined. Addition of sodium benzoate (0.3%) to cheese (pH 6.6) or addition of potassium sorbate (0.3%) to cheese (pH 6.0) made from milk, which was acidified to pH 5.9 with propionic acid, had a significant impact on delaying or preventing growth of the pathogen.

AB  - The pathogenicity of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) was examined by infection trials in the first known host species, the mandarinfish, Siniperca chuatsi, and in 20 other teleosts cultured in China. Mandarinfish and large-mouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, were highly susceptible to infection after intraperitoneal infection of ISKNV in spleen and kidney materials from infected fish. ISKNV did not induce mortality in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), but histopathological studies revealed that they might be infected by both bathing and intraperitoneal infection. No deaths, clinical or histopathological signs were found in the IS other species exposed by immersion or injection. Experimental infection studies showed that ISKNV infection in mandarinfish could be transmitted from infected to healthy fish through contaminated water. ISKN only occurred in mandarinfish cultured at temperature above 20degreesC. The resistance of the virus to treatment with disinfectants, high and low pH and UV irradiation, as well as storage at selected temperatures was assessed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Coral reef resilience depends on the balance between carbonate precipitation, leading to reef growth, and carbonate degradation, for example, through bioerosion. Changes in environmental conditions are likely to affect the two processes differently, thereby shifting the balance between reef growth and degradation. In cold-water corals estimates of accretion-erosion processes in their natural habitat are scarce and solely live coral growth rates were studied with regard to future environmental changes in the laboratory so far, limiting our ability to assess the potential of cold-water coral reef ecosystems to cope with environmental changes. In the present study, growth rates of the two predominant colour morphotypes of live Lophelia pertusa as well as bioerosion rates of dead coral framework were assessed in different environmental settings in Norwegian cold-water coral reefs in a 1-year in situ experiment. Net growth (in weight gain and linear extension) of live L. pertusa was in the lower range of previous estimates and did not significantly differ between inshore (fjord) and offshore (open shelf) habitats. However, slightly higher net growth rates were obtained inshore. Bioerosion rates were significantly higher on-reef in the fjord compared to off-reef deployments in- and offshore. Besides, on-reef coral fragments yielded a broader range of individual growth and bioerosion rates, indicating higher turnover in live reef structures than off-reef with regard to accretion-bioerosion processes. Moreover, if the higher variation in growth rates represents a greater variance in (genetic) adaptations to natural environmental variability in the fjord, inshore reefs could possibly benefit under future ocean change compared to offshore reefs. Although not significantly different due to high variances between replicates, growth rates of orange branches were consistently higher at all sites, while mortality was statistically significantly lower, potentially indicating higher stress-resistance than the less pigmented white phenotype. Comparing the here measured rates of net accretion of live corals (regardless of colour morphotype) with net erosion of dead coral framework gives a first estimate of the dimensions of both processes in natural cold-water coral habitats, indicating that calcium carbonate loss through bioerosion amounts to one fifth to one sixth of the production rates by coral calcification (disregarding accretion processes of other organisms and proportion of live and dead coral framework in a reef). With regard to likely accelerating bioerosion and diminishing growth rates of corals under ocean acidification, the balance of reef accretion and degradation may be shifted towards higher biogenic dissolution in the future.

AB  - Background The Arthrobacter group is a known set of bacteria from cold regions, the species of which are highly likely to play diverse roles at low temperatures. However, their survival mechanisms in cold regions such as Antarctica are not yet fully understood. In this study, we compared the genomes of 16 strains within the Arthrobacter group, including strain PAMC25564, to identify genomic features that help it to survive in the cold environment. Results Using 16 S rRNA sequence analysis, we found and identified a species of Arthrobacter isolated from cryoconite. We designated it as strain PAMC25564 and elucidated its complete genome sequence. The genome of PAMC25564 is composed of a circular chromosome of 4,170,970 bp with a GC content of 66.74 % and is predicted to include 3,829 genes of which 3,613 are protein coding, 147 are pseudogenes, 15 are rRNA coding, and 51 are tRNA coding. In addition, we provide insight into the redundancy of the genes using comparative genomics and suggest that PAMC25564 has glycogen and trehalose metabolism pathways (biosynthesis and degradation) associated with carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZymes). We also explain how the PAMC26654 produces energy in an extreme environment, wherein it utilizes polysaccharide or carbohydrate degradation as a source of energy. The genetic pattern analysis of CAZymes in cold-adapted bacteria can help to determine how they adapt and survive in such environments. Conclusions We have characterized the complete Arthrobacter sp. PAMC25564 genome and used comparative analysis to provide insight into the redundancy of its CAZymes for potential cold adaptation. This provides a foundation to understanding how the Arthrobacter strain produces energy in an extreme environment, which is by way of CAZymes, consistent with reports on the use of these specialized enzymes in cold environments. Knowledge of glycogen metabolism and cold adaptation mechanisms in Arthrobacter species may promote in-depth research and subsequent application in low-temperature biotechnology.

AB  - The leaves of sessile oak (Quercuspetraea Liebl.) and pedunculate oak (Quercusrobur L.) were subjected to heat shock at various high temperatures. The damage caused by the heat shock to the cellular structures of the leaves was determined using the electrolyte leakage technique. In the investigated species, a sigmoidal increase of electrolyte leakage from leaf tissues, depending of the applied temperatures, was observed. Pedunculate oak leaves, as compared with sessile oak ones, have shown increased resistance to high temperatures, suggesting that heat tolerance in pedunculate oak is higher than in sessile oak. Experiments with fractionation of heat shock doses allowed the estimation of the influence of the first dose value on induction of the lives adaptive capacity of the sessile oak leaves during different periods of time after their application. If the first fraction of dose was moderate, the thermotolerance of leaves grew rapidly. So, the functional status of leaves depended on three components that characterized the fractionation of dose: the value of the first part of dose (1), the value of the second part of dose two (2), the duration of the period that has passed between two fractions of dose (3). Summary effect of fractionated dose of heat shock is the result of balance between processes of degradation, recovery of damages, and adaptation. After application of moderate fractions of heat shock dose. the processes of the induction of adaptation dominated. Because of this the thermotolerance of leaves after application of the first dose of heat shock increased. After the application of higher fractions of dose, the processes of degradation prevailed under those of the recovery and adaptation. In combination they lead to the reduction leaves thermotolerance. The obtained results suggest that the method of fractional heat shock doses make possible determination of the initial thermotolerance and the adaptive capacity of leaves. Pooling of the processes that determine the initial leaves thermotolerance and their adaptive potential under variation of seasonal temperatures is important for plants survival in arid conditions.

AB  - 1. Understanding of the winter ecology of stream salmonids is biased by research conducted in northern temperate and boreal regions dominated by hard rock geology. Such systems are driven by highly dynamic surface-flow regimes and tend to be physically diverse, nutrient poor and influenced by ice. This study investigated how the behaviour of brown trout, Salmo trutta, inhabiting a stable groundwater-fed, productive and comparatively warm southern English chalk stream differs from that described for other systems, and how this is translated to performance, measured as growth.
   2. Physical characteristics were mapped, and high-resolution temperature data collected using a spatial array of data loggers installed throughout the study reach during the winter. A combination of passive integrated transponder and radio telemetry was used to monitor distribution, density, and movement of trout. Micro-archival data storage tags inserted in some individuals provided information on temperature regimes experienced. Growth performance was calculated for recaptured fish.
   3. Trout density was positively related to depth and there was no evidence that temperature influenced microhabitat selection. Three patterns of movement were observed. Over three-quarters of tracked fish exhibited high site fidelity and tended to remain in a single focal position throughout the study. Fourteen per cent of trout exploited more than one distinct location, while the remainder were detected at multiple locations and showed no preference for any one.
   4. Trout exhibited regular daily activity patterns and highly periodic local movements at dusk and dawn and tended to experience positive growth performance during periods that included winter.
   5. This study challenges the conventional view of salmonid winter ecology, which is biased towards populations that inhabit hard rock surface-flow dominated rivers that experience the influence of ice. Despite inhabiting a distinctly different winter habitat template than more commonly studied populations, trout occupying a hydrologically stable and productive chalk stream exhibited behaviours similar to those described for elsewhere, yet performed considerably better.

AB  - The question of what determines divergence both between and within species has been the central topic in evolutionary biology. Neutral drift and environmentally dependent divergence are predicted to play roles in driving population and lineage divergence. However, neutral drift may preclude adaptation if the rate of gene flow between populations is high. Here, we sampled populations of three Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides) lineages occurring in Taiwan, the mainland of China (Yunnan-Myanmar border), and northern Vietnam, and tested the relative strength of neutral drift and divergent selection in shaping divergence of those populations and lineages. We quantified genetic and epigenetic variation, respectively, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). Analysis of 1413 AFLP and 462 MSAP loci using frequency-based genome scan methods and generalized linear models (GLMs) found no potential selective outliers when only Taiwanese populations were examined, suggesting that neutral drift was the predominant evolutionary process driving differentiation between those populations. However, environmentally associated divergence was found when lineages were compared. Thirty-two potential selective outliers were identified based on genome scans and their associations with environmental variables were tested with GLMs, generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs), and model selection with a model averaging approach. Ten loci (six AFLP and four MSAP) were found to be strongly associated with environmental variables, particularly monthly temperature variation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using model selection and a model averaging approach. Because only a small portion of genetic and epigenetic loci were found to be potential selective outliers, neutral evolutionary process might also have played crucial roles in driving lineage divergence, particularly between geographically and genetically isolated island and mainland Asia lineages. Nevertheless, the vast amount of neutral drift causing genetic and epigenetic variations might have the potential for adaptation to future climate changes. These could be important for the survival of Taiwania in different geographic areas.

AB  - Aim Gymnosperms do not follow a latitudinal diversity gradient across the Northern Hemisphere but are influenced by geography at continental scales. Tolerance to physiological aridity is thought to be the main driver of this distribution, yet through evolutionary time conifers have also faced conditions of frost, shade and fire. We tested four predictions to evaluate how environmental stressors and geographical and evolutionary patterns of traits influence conifer distributions: (1) environmental variables related to aridity are most important in explaining geographical patterns of traits; (2) traits responsible for survival in stressful conditions have evolved under a niche conservatism constraint; (3) phylogenetic correlations among traits as the result of complex evolutionary responses to multiple abiotic stressors are widespread; (4) there are parallelisms between spatial trait associations and correlated trait evolution.
   Location The conterminous United States.
   Methods We combined conifer occurrences with 10 traits related to drought, freezing, shade and fire. The spatial distribution of traits was mapped and the relationship between environment and the geographical patterns of traits was explored. Niche conservatism was assessed comparing patterns of trait evolution against Brownian motion. We computed geographical and phylogenetic correlations among traits to determine the correspondence between spatial and evolutionary trade-offs.
   Results (1) Maximum temperature followed by precipitation were the environmental variables that best described the geographical distributions of traits. (2) Most traits contain a phylogenetic signal consistent with niche conservatism: major exceptions being fire-related traits and frost tolerance. (3) Drought and shade tolerances show one of the strongest negative phylogenetic correlations. (4) The drought-shade tolerance trade-off is mirrored at the biogeographical scale.
   Main conclusions Unlike in angiosperms, cold does not seem to have been a major driver in the evolutionary history of temperate conifers. A strong tradeoff between drought and shade tolerance is the simplest explanation for understanding the current distribution of conifers in North America.

AB  - Topic modeling methods have usually been applied in the past to identify the research interests of researchers. Observing the scientific growth, the trending topics can be identified as Stable, Hot, or Cold. Finding rising stars (junior researchers, who are at the start of their career) from a bibliometric network is a challenging task, specifically if the researchers have an interest in multiple sub-domains or are working on diverse topics. Existing methods for finding rising stars explore the co-author networks or citation networks, and ignore the textual content, which may help in finding rising stars through hot topics detection over time. A publication contributing to a hot topic can be an indication that the author of that publication may be a rising star and can become an expert in that domain in the future. This study proposes the Hot Topics Rising Star Rank (HTRS-Rank) method for finding rising stars by detecting hot topics. HTRS-Rank finds the junior scholars, who contribute to hot topics at the start of their career and ranks them based on the presence of hot topics in their publications. AMiner five years dataset ranging from 2005-2009 is selected for experimentation. Top 10 researchers are considered to measure the association strength using rank correlation among HTRS-Rank and baseline methods. Experimental results show the efficiency of HTRS-Rank in comparison to the baseline methods. The proposed HTRS Rank (TF-IDF) provides low standard deviation for productivity, citations and sociality as compared to baseline methods for more social and highly cited authors. It is identified that HTRS-Rank (WordNet) emphasizes the semantic similarity of two sentences, whereas HTRS-Rank (TF-IDF) scheme emphasizes the uniqueness or importance of each term, therefore TF-IDF approach performs better than WordNet approach due to having higher correlation with StarRank and WMIRank.

AB  - Background: The optimisation and scale-up of process conditions leading to high yields of recombinant proteins is an enduring bottleneck in the post-genomic sciences. Typical experiments rely on varying selected parameters through repeated rounds of trial-and-error optimisation. To rationalise this, several groups have recently adopted the 'design of experiments' (DoE) approach frequently used in industry. Studies have focused on parameters such as medium composition, nutrient feed rates and induction of expression in shake flasks or bioreactors, as well as oxygen transfer rates in micro-well plates. In this study we wanted to generate a predictive model that described small-scale screens and to test its scalability to bioreactors.
   Results: Here we demonstrate how the use of a DoE approach in a multi-well mini-bioreactor permitted the rapid establishment of high yielding production phase conditions that could be transferred to a 7 L bioreactor. Using green fluorescent protein secreted from Pichia pastoris, we derived a predictive model of protein yield as a function of the three most commonly-varied process parameters: temperature, pH and the percentage of dissolved oxygen in the culture medium. Importantly, when yield was normalised to culture volume and density, the model was scalable from mL to L working volumes. By increasing pre-induction biomass accumulation, model-predicted yields were further improved. Yield improvement was most significant, however, on varying the fed-batch induction regime to minimise methanol accumulation so that the productivity of the culture increased throughout the whole induction period. These findings suggest the importance of matching the rate of protein production with the host metabolism.
   Conclusion: We demonstrate how a rational, stepwise approach to recombinant protein production screens can reduce process development time.

AB  - Climate change is causing drastic landscape changes in the Arctic, but how these changes modify stream biogeochemistry is not clear yet. We examined how catchment properties influence stream nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC) in a high-Arctic environment. We sampled two contrasting headwater streams (10-15 stations over 4.8 and 6.8 km, respectively) in Northeast Greenland (74 degrees N). We characterized the geomorphology (i.e., bedrock, solifluction and alluvial types) and the vegetation (i.e., barren, fell field, grassland and tundra types) cover of each subcatchment area draining into each sampling station and collected water samples for hydrochemistry characterization. The two sampled streams differed in geomorphology and vegetation cover in the catchment. Aucellaelv catchment was mostly covered by a 'bedrock' geomorphology (71%) and 'fellfield' vegetation (51%), whereas K AE erelv was mostly covered by 'alluvial' geomorphology (65%) and 'grassland' and 'tundra' vegetation (42% and 41% respectively). Hydrochemistry also differed between the two study streams, with higher concentrations of inorganic N forms in Aucellaelv and lower DOC concentrations, compared to K AE relv. The results from the linear mixed model selection showed that vegetation and geomorphology had contrasting effects on stream hydrochemistry. Subcatchments with higher solifluction sheets and limited vegetation had higher nitrate concentrations but lower DOC concentrations. Interestingly, we also found high variability on the production and removal of nitrate across subcatchments. These results indicate landscape controls to nutrient and organic matter exports via flow paths, soil organic matter stocks and nutrient retention via terrestrial vegetation. Moreover, the results suggest that climate change induced alterations to vegetation cover and soil physical disturbance in high-Arctic catchments will affect stream hydrochemistry, with potential effects in stream productivity, trophic relations as well as change of solute export to downstream coastal areas.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to review research studies on process optimisation and machine development that lead to the enhancement of final products in various aspects of the fused deposition modelling (FDM) process.
   Design/methodology/approach
   An overview of the literature, focussing on process parameters, machine developments and material characterisations. This study investigates recent research studies that studied FDM capabilities in printing a vast range of materials from thermoplastics to metal alloys.
   Findings
   FDM is one of the most common techniques in additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Many parameters in this technology have effects on three-dimensional printed products. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the optimum elements, for example, build orientation, layer thickness, nozzle diameter, infill pattern and bed temperature. By selecting a proper variable range of parameters, the layers adhere strongly and building end-use products of high quality are achievable. A vast range of materials and their properties from polymers to composite-based polymers are presented. Novel techniques to print metal alloys and composites are examined to increase the productivity of the FDM process. Additionally, defects such as shrinkage and warpage are discussed to eliminate the system's limitations and improve the quality of final products. Multi-axis and mobile machines brought enhancements throughout the process to eliminate obstacles such as staircase defects in the conventional FDM process. In brief, recent developments were identified and a summary of major improvements was discussed in this study for future research.
   Originality/value
   This paper is an overview that provides information about research and developments in FDM. This review focusses on process optimisation and obstacles in printing polymers, composites, geopolymers and novel materials. Therefore, machine characteristics were examined to find out the accessibility of printing novel materials for different applications.

AB  - Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) disturbance and patchiness intensify the spatial heterogeneous distribution of vegetation productivity and soil physicochemical properties, which may alter the ecosystem carbon emission process. Nevertheless, previous research has mostly focused on the homogeneous vegetation patches rather than heterogeneous land surface. Thus, this study aims to improve our understanding of the difference in ecosystem respiration (Re) over heterogeneous land surface in an alpine meadow grassland. Six different land surface types, namely large bald patches, medium bald patches, small bald patches, intact grassland, above pika tunnel and pika pile, were selected to analyze the response of Re to pika disturbance and patchiness and the key controlling factors. The results showed that (1) Re in intact grassland was 0.22-1.07 times higher than pika pile and bald patches, (2) soil moisture (SM) of intact grassland was 2 %-11% higher than that of pika pile and bald patches, despite the fact that pika disturbance increased the water infiltration rate while soil temperature (ST) in intact grassland was 1-3 degrees less than pika pile and bald patches, (3) soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in intact grassland were approximately 50% and 60% less than above pika tunnel, whereas they were 10 %-30% and 22 %-110% higher than pika pile and bald patches, and (4) Re was significantly correlated with SM, TN and vegetation biomass (P < 0 : 05). Our results suggested that pika disturbance and patchiness altered the ecosystem carbon emission pattern, which was mainly attributed to the reduction in soil water and supply of substrates. Given the wide distribution of pikas and the large area of bald patches, the varied Re in heterogeneous land surfaces should not be neglected in the estimation of ecosystem carbon emissions at the plot or regional scale.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of lighter materials for transportation purposes is still a challenge; especially in the aeronautical and aerospace sectors. The use of certain materials, such as magnesium alloys which have exceptional mechanical properties relative to density as structural materials, allows a remarkable reduction of weight. These alloys have significant challenges in machining. On the one hand, their use with water-based lubricants can produce flammable hydrogen atmospheres and, on the other hand, the operational parameters can produce tiny chips which, at high temperature, could burn. Regarding the tools, drills are the most used ones in drilling operations; manufacturers do not always take in consideration magnesium alloys. This is why, sometimes, the data from other types of similar alloys need to be extrapolated. This work shows an experimental study about the drilling of magnesium pieces based on surface roughness. The main goal is to determine the tools that best suit the requirement of surface roughness for this type of operations, which, for the aeronautical sector, is from 0.8 to 1.6 mu m. The tests have been conducted under different cutting conditions, using several types of tools and two sustainable lubrication systems. In particular, dry machining and minimum quantity of lubrication (MQL) system have been used. A design of experiments (DOE) has been used to optimize the resources. The average roughness, Ra, has been selected as a response variable. The roughness values obtained are lower than 0.9 mu m (namely, from 0.13 mu m to 0.87 mu m); so, it is possible to increase some of the parameter values, in order to improve the productivity, without they go outside the established limits. The results have been analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. A model for estimating the expected surface roughness in terms of the Rae, has been developed. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Cost and performance efficient integrations of biological treatments with membrane processes are very worthy for water and resource recovery among of which osmotic anaerobic digestion suffers from exactly elucidating desirable techno-economic features of key operating factors. Cost-performance effective draw solutions (DSs) were ascertained for forward osmosis (FO) and its anaerobic bioreactor (AnBR) configurations, anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor (AnOMBR) and [FO/AnBR]. In case study comprising literature data pre-screening, selected DS experiments, and preferability analysis, dual modeling was executed for prioritizing DSs eligible to osmotic AnBRs by analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Through AHP screening of 29 DSs' FO data, NaNO3, NaCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, NH4H2PO4, HCOONa and CH3COONa were established between the best 10% worth researching for osmotic AnBRs. Experiments showed that isothermally varied temperatures hardly affected DS performances in submerged, but DS concentration raises led to those distinguished by reverse solute fluxes. Reverse solute flux selectivity was differed significantly by DS kinds and FO configurations because of varying interactions among predominant inorganic ion and soluble organics. Submerged FO fed by distilled water provided better performance than sidestream but not by wastewater. Anaerobic bioactivities showed longer acclimation times increased by alkalinity unlike seawater (SW) and better CH4 productivity of organics enhanced by DS concentration. Upon AHP analyses, CaCl2, MgCl2, both organics, and SW were more techno-economically favorable DS kinds. Irrespective of technological alternatives, CaCl2 and MgCl2 were found as top two except just SW was the best for AnOMBR by low-cost supply. It was finally proved that eligible DSs should be designated technology dependently due to their distinctive performances and replenishment costs, and topmost priority to SW should be attributed in sustainable wastewater reclamations by AnOMBR in coastal countries.

AB  - The classical DICE model is a widely accepted integrated assessment model for the joint modeling of economic and climate systems, where all model state variables evolve over time deterministically. We reformulate and solve the DICE model as an optimal control dynamic programming problem with six state variables (related to the carbon concentration, temperature, and economic capital) evolving over time deterministically and affected by two controls (carbon emission mitigation rate and consumption). We then extend the model by adding a discrete stochastic shock variable to model the economy in the stressed and normal regimes as a jump process caused by events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These shocks reduce the world gross output leading to a reduction in both the world net output and carbon emission. The extended model is solved under several scenarios as an optimal stochastic control problem, assuming that the shock events occur randomly on average once every 100 years and last for 5 years. The results show that, if the world gross output recovers in full after each event, the impact of the COVID-19 events on the temperature and carbon concentration will be immaterial even in the case of a conservative 10% drop in the annual gross output over a 5-year period. The impact becomes noticeable, although still extremely small (long-term temperature drops by 0.1 degrees C), in a presence of persistent shocks of a 5% output drop propagating to the subsequent time periods through the recursively reduced productivity. If the deterministic DICE model policy is applied in a presence of stochastic shocks (i.e., when this policy is suboptimal), then the drop in temperature is larger (approximately 0.25 degrees C), that is, the lower economic activities owing to shocks imply that more ambitious mitigation targets are now feasible at lower costs.

AB  - Five facultative anaerobic bacterial isolates were recovered from domestic wastewater. These isolates were identified based on the 16S rRNA as Enterobacter aerogenes (one isolate), Enterobacter cloacae (two isolates), and Cronobacter sakazakii (three isolates). These isolates were examined for their potential to evolve hydrogen on a glucose medium. The most potent hydrogen-producing isolates, E aerogenes (KY549389) and E cloacae (KY524293), were examined for their capacity to generate hydrogen, acetone, butanol, and ethanol using orange peel (OP) hydrolysate. OP powder was pretreated with n-hexane to remove the toxicity of d-limonene. Different concentrations (4%, 6%, and 8% w/v) of limonene-free OP were subjected to the boiling water (temperature of 100 degrees C) or acid (HCl) treatments. The maximum fermentative H-2 production of 1700 and 1620 mL/L was obtained from 6% OP hydrolysate extracted with boiling water using facultative anaerobic E aerogenes (KY549389) and E cloacae (KY524293), respectively. Hydrogen production efficiency was 0.99 and 1.19 mol H-2/mol glucose for E aerogenes and E cloacae, respectively. The total fermentative acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) generated by E aerogenes and E cloacae were 0.78 and 0.38 g/L including acetone (0.05 and 0.04 g/L), butanol (0.011 and 0.013 g/L), and ethanol (0.71 and 0.32 g/L), respectively. The maximum ABE productivity was 0.01 and 0.005 g/L/h generated at 60 g/L OP hydrolysate by E aerogenes and E cloacae, respectively. These strains were positive for nitrogen fixation (nitrogenase) capability estimated by the acetylene reduction assay. Application of OP hydrolysate without the addition of any nutritional components or reducing agent is considered an eco-friendly, economical, and commercial substrate for desired biofuel production.

AB  - Under predicted climate change, native silver fir (Abies alba) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) are the most likely replacement species for the Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures planted across large parts of continental Europe. Our current understanding of the adaptation potential of fir-beech mixed forests to climate change is limited because long-term responses of the two species to environmental changes have not yet been comprehensively quantified. We compiled and analysed tree-ring width (TRW) series from 2855 dominant, co-dominant, sub-dominant and suppressed fir and beech trees sampled in 17 managed and unmanaged mixed beech-fir forest sites across Continental Europe, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Italy, Romania and Slovakia. Dendroecological techniques that combine various detrending methods were used to investigate variation in radial growth of co-occurring fir and beech trees. Coincidental with peak SO2 emissions, the growth of silver fir declined between 1950 and 1980 at most sites, whereas beech growth increased during this period. Correspondent to a significant warming trend from 1990-2010, average beech growth declined, but silver fir growth increased. Long-term growth patterns and growth-climate sensitivity of fir and beech trees did not significantly differ between managed and unmanaged forests. Multi-decadal changes in the growth rate of all vertical tree classes were similar. In contrast to previous indications of limited drought susceptibility of beech mixed stands, this study suggests that the mixture of tree species in forest stands does not necessarily prevent growth depressions induced by long-termenvironmental change. Our results further imply that forest management does not necessarily alter their sensitivity to environmental changes. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - New nano stationary phase (NSP) capillary columns were evaluated for the analysis of 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). To meet the regulatory requirements, the analytical procedures must provide adequate separation and identification of the 16 individual priority PAH. A 12 m conventional diameter NSP column provides fast separation of 16 priority PAH, meeting the USEPA regulatory requirements specified in method 610. The new NSP columns are selective and highly stable with a maximum operating temperature limit of 370 degrees C. The columns have extremely low bleed at the standard working temperature of 325 degrees C normally used for PAH analyses. Due to low bleed, these columns provide higher sensitivity for PAH in GC/FID and GC/MS analysis. Microbore columns with the NSP provide even faster analysis and ultra low bleed. In addition to the 16 priority PAH, the separation of benzo(e)pyrene and perylene from benzo(a)pyrene, and complete separation of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, which are mandated for monitoring and analysis in food products by the European Food Safety Authority, is achieved on NSP columns. The fast analysis of 16 PAH in less than 6 minutes, repeatability over 200 runs, high temperature stability, and extremely low bleed illustrates the robust performance of NSP columns. Due to high selectivity, complete separation of 16 priority PAH was achieved on a very short (5 m) microbore NSP GC column. Fast analysis of 16 priority PAH on short NSP GC columns increases laboratory productivity and decreases laboratory operational costs. This is the first report on the application of selective, high temperature, extremely low bleed, NSP GC columns for PAH analysis.

AB  - Diamonds and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have extraordinary properties with the potential for vast technological and scientific advancements. However, the syntheses of these super materials have required extreme conditions. Recent synthetic developments surrounding catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) have contributed to more suitable, practical and economical preparations, but more progress is needed for better selectivity, purity, and mass production of CNTs and diamonds. Such synthetic advancements require a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of formation on the atomic scale. A recent comprehensive mechanism of Little suggests the importance of high-spin electronic states and the rehybridization mechanics of carbon atoms and metal atoms (for catalytic synthesis) during the nucleation and growth of CNTs and diamonds. The significance of these predictions is demonstrated in this work by using an intense, static magnetic field of several teslas to influence carbon fixation events during carbon CCVD. Single crystalline diamonds are discovered to nucleate and grow under the influence of the static magnetic field (19.3 T) under catalytic CVD conditions that normally result in carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, this technique results in a bottom-up approach for creating diamond nucleation sites on the basis of a so-called chemical preabrasion of the silicon substrate with the potential advantage of the control of seeding nucleation-site density and nonrandom patterning for larger single crystal diamond syntheses. This technique also provides a basis for diamond-CNT composite super materials. Moreover, the observed influence of high magnetic field on diamond formation provides implications concerning natural diamond genesis in the earth's mantle and core in comparison to celestial diamond formation. Furthermore, these findings suggest uses of polarized and nonpolarized neutron irradiation for static and dynamic magnetic interactions, leading to diamond and CNT productivity, respectively.

AB  - Population genetic studies reveal biodiversity patterns and inform about drivers of evolutionary differentiation and adaptation, including gene flow, drift and selection. This can advance our understanding and aid decision making regarding management and conservation efforts. Microsatellites have long been used in population genetic studies. Thanks to the development of newer techniques, sequencing approaches such as restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) are on their way to replace microsatellites for some applications. However, the performance of these two marker types in population genetics have rarely been systematically compared. We utilized three neutrally and adaptively differentiated populations of anadromous pike (Esox lucius) to assess the relative performance of microsatellites and RADseq with respect to resolution and conclusiveness of estimates of population differentiation and genetic structure. To this end, the same set of individuals (N = 64) were genotyped with both RADseq and microsatellite markers. To assess effects of sample size, the same subset of 10 randomly chosen individuals from each population (N = 30 in total) were also genotyped with both methods. Comparisons of estimated genetic diversity and structure showed that both markers were able to uncover genetic structuring. The full RADseq dataset provided the clearest detection of the finer scaled genetic structuring, and the other three datasets (full and subset microsatellite, and subset RADseq) provided comparable results. A search for outlier loci performed on the full SNP dataset pointed to signs of selection potentially associated with salinity and temperature, exemplifying the utility of RADseq to inform about the importance of different environmental factors. To evaluate whether performance differences between the markers are general or context specific, the results of previous studies that have investigated population structure using both marker types were synthesized. The synthesis revealed that RADseq performed as well as, or better than microsatellites in detecting genetic structuring in the included studies. The differences in the ability to detect population structure, both in the present and the previous studies, are likely explained by the higher number of loci typically utilized in RADseq compared to microsatellite analysis, as increasing the number of markers will (regardless of the marker type) increase power and allow for clearer detection and higher resolution of genetic structure.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are highly important not only for the synchronization of animals and humans with their periodic environment but also for their fitness. Accordingly, the disruption of the circadian system may have adverse consequences. A certain number of animals in our breeding stock of Djungarian hamsters are episodically active throughout the day. Also body temperature and melatonin lack 24-h rhythms. Obviously in these animals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) as the central pacemaker do not generate a circadian signal. Moreover, these so-called arrhythmic (AR) hamsters have cognitive deficits. Since motor activity is believed to stabilize circadian rhythms, we investigated the effect of voluntary wheel running. Hamsters were bred and kept under standardized housing conditions with food and water ad libitum and a 14 L/10 D lighting regimen. AR animals were selected according to their activity pattern obtained by means of passive infrared motion detectors. In a first step, the daily activity behavior was investigated for 3 weeks each without and with running wheels. To estimate putative photic masking effects, hamsters were exposed to light (LPs) and DPs and also released into constant darkness for a minimum of 3 weeks. A novel object recognition (NOR) test was performed to evaluate cognitive abilities both before and after 3 weeks of wheel availability. The activity patterns of hamsters with low wheel activity were still AR. With more intense running, daily patterns with higher values in the dark time were obtained. Obviously, this was due to masking as LPs did suppress and DPs induced motor activity. When transferred to constant darkness, in some animals the daily rhythm disappeared. In other hamsters, namely those which used the wheels most actively, the rhythm was preserved and free-ran, what can be taken as indication of a reconstitution of circadian rhythmicity. Also, animals showing a 24-h activity pattern after 3 weeks of extensive wheel running were able to recognize the novel object in the NOR test but not so before. The results show that voluntary exercise may reestablish circadian rhythmicity and improve cognitive performance.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions has led to adaptive genetic differentiation and the development of home-site fitness advantage (local adaptation) among populations of many widespread plant species such as forest trees. Although its overall patterns have been well characterised, earlier studies on adaptation have predominantly used long-term averages of environmental variables to describe local climates. Subsequently, only little is currently known about more complex patterns of variation in potential selective forces and how they affect adaptive processes. Furthermore, we also lack a good understanding of why adaptive traits often vary within populations despite clear evidence of local selection. Because the capacity of a population to respond to changes in its home environment depends on the amount of genetic variation that it contains, an understanding of these patterns is fundamental to predicting how extant populations will cope with climate change. In this paper, I call attention to these two issues and discuss adaptation in heterogeneous environments using studies mainly on Finnish populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) as an example. In this geographic area, population means in growth cessation are closely related to the latitude at the population's home site, indicating adaptation to local environments. Yet the trait varies considerably also within populations, with the highest levels of phenotypic variation found in the central part of the latitudinal gradient. Increased variation further north may have a significant genetic component. In stable local environments this would indicate that populations with less variation are more optimally adapted to their home site environments. On the other hand, climate data show that growing season temperature conditions within Finland become temporally more variable towards the north which might contribute to different levels of trait variation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the weaknesses of focusing only on long-term averages of environmental variables or trait means when examining adaptation in natural populations. Moreover, better integrated analyses of both genetic and environmental variation might help in disentangling the mechanisms that maintain adaptive genetic diversity and adaptive capacity in natural populations of perennial species under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that the adaptation of Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) chikungunya virus (CHIKV) strains for Aedes albopictus transmission was mediated by an E1-A226V substitution, followed by either a single substitution in E2 or synergistic substitutions in the E2 and E3 envelope glycoproteins. Here, we examined whether Asian lineage strains, including those that descended from the 2014 Caribbean introduction, are likely to acquire these A albopictus-adaptive E2 substitutions. Because Asian lineage strains cannot adapt through the E1-A226V substitution due to an epistatic constraint, we first determined that the beneficial effect of these E2 mutations in IOL strains is independent of E1-A226V. We then introduced each of these E2 adaptive mutations into the Asian lineage backbone to determine if they improve infectivity for A albopictus. Surprisingly, our results indicated that in the Asian lineage backbone, these E2 mutations significantly decreased CHOW fitness in A. aibopictus. Furthermore, we tested the effects of these mutations in Aedes aegypti and observed different results from those in A. aibopictus, suggesting that mosquito species-specific factors that interact with the envelope proteins are involved in vector infection efficiency. Overall, our results indicate that the divergence between Asian lineage and IOL CHIKVs has led them onto different adaptive landscapes with differing potentials to expand their vector host range.
   IMPORTANCE Since its introduction into the Caribbean in October 2013, CHIKV has rapidly spread to almost the entire neotropical region. However, its potential to further spread globally, including into more temperate climates, depends in part on its ability to be transmitted efficiently by Aedes albopictus, which can survive colder winters than A. aegypti. We examined in an Asian lineage backbone A. aibopictus-adaptive mutations that arose from 2005 to 2009 in Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) strains. Our results predict that the Asian CHIKV lineage now in the Americas will not readily adapt for enhanced A. aibopictus transmission via the same mechanisms or adaptive mutations used previously by IOL strains. The vector species- and CHIKV lineage-specific effects caused by adaptive CHIKV envelope glycoprotein substitutions may elucidate our understanding of the mechanisms of mosquito infection and spread.

AB  - Liver metastases are a major cause of death from colorectal cancer. Intraarterial therapy options for colorectal liver metastases include chemoinfusion via a hepatic arterial pump or port, irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads, and radioembolization using Y-90 microspheres. Intraarterial therapy allows the delivery of a high dose of chemotherapy or radiation into liver tumors while minimizing the impact on liver parenchyma and avoiding systemic effects. Specificity in intra-arterial therapy can be achieved both through preferential arterial flow to the tumor and through selective catheter positioning. In this review, we discuss indications, contraindications, preprocedure evaluation, activity prescription, follow-up, outcomes, and complications of radioembolization of colorectal liver metastases. Methods for preventing off-target embolization, increasing the specificity of microsphere delivery, and reducing the lung-shunt fraction are discussed. There are 2 types of Y-90 microspheres: resin and glass. Because glass microspheres have a higher activity per particle, they can deliver a particular radiation dose with fewer particles, likely reducing embolic effects. Glass microspheres thus may be more suitable when early stasis or reflux is a concern, in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion, and for radiation segmentectomy. Because resin microspheres have a lower activity per particle, more particles are needed to deliver a particular radiation dose. Resin microspheres thus may be preferable for larger tumors and those with high arterial flow. In addition, resin microspheres have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for colorectal liver metastases, whereas institutional review board approval is required before glass microspheres can be used under a compassionate-use or research protocol. Finally, radiation segmentectomy involves delivering a calculated lobar activity of Y-90 microspheres selectively to treat a tumor involving 1 or 2 liver segments. This technique administers a very high radiation dose and effectively causes the ablation of tumors that are too large or are in a location considered unsafe for thermal ablation. The selective delivery spares surrounding normal liver, reducing the risk of liver failure.

AB  - Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) is a significant threat to global aquaculture. True to its name, BCWD tends to occur at temperatures between 8 and 12 degrees C and presents as a systemic disease with characteristic skin ulcerations. Juvenile rainbow trout are particularly susceptible and in these fish the condition is referred to as rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS). Resistance to F. psychrophilum is heritable and is not adversely correlated with the growth of fish, thus selective breeding appears to be an achievable approach to its control. The current study explores the connection between resistance to BCWD and several immunological markers. After determining resistance/susceptibility to F. psychrophilum following experimental infection in 40 full-sibling families of rainbow trout, selected families were experimentally infected with F. psychrophilum and differences in antibody production, major histocompatibility (MH) class II beta genotype and respiratory burst activity (RBA) throughout infection were compared. Serum IgM production increased over time but significant differences between resistant and susceptible families were not observed at either 28 days or 120 days. Of the six families that were genotyped for MH class II beta, there did not appear to be specific genotypes that conferred resistance or susceptibility to F. psychrophilum. Further, the RBA of both head kidney leukocytes and whole blood was not significantly different between the resistant and susceptible rainbow trout families. Although the selected immune markers did not differ based on resistance status, the RBA of head kidney leukocytes in all families studied dramatically decreased seven days after infection while total blood RBA remained constant. Day seven was also when severe symptoms and/or mortality due to BCWD was first observed, thus these results may reveal information regarding the pathogenesis of the organism. A better understanding of appropriate immune defenses could provide the basis for breeding programs to effectively combat this costly pathogen, but further study of functional immune markers particularly during the fry stage of development is required.

AB  - The terrestrial biosphere is exposed to land-use and climate change, which not only affects vegetation dynamics but also changes land-atmosphere feedbacks. Specifically, changes in land cover affect biophysical feedbacks of water and energy, thereby contributing to climate change. In this study, we couple the well-established and comprehensively validated dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL5 (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) to the coupled climate model CM2Mc, the latter of which is based on the atmosphere model AM2 and the ocean model MOMS (Modular Ocean Model 5), and name it CM2Mc-LPJmL. In CM2Mc, we replace the simple land-surface model LaD (Land Dynamics; where vegetation is static and prescribed) with LPJmL5, and we fully couple the water and energy cycles using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Flexible Modeling System (FMS). Several improvements to LPJmL5 were implemented to allow a fully functional biophysical coupling. These include a sub-daily cycle for calculating energy and water fluxes, conductance of the soil evaporation and plant interception, canopy-layer humidity, and the surface energy balance in order to calculate the surface and canopy-layer temperature within LPJmL5. Exchanging LaD with LPJmL5 and, therefore, switching from a static and prescribed vegetation to a dynamic vegetation allows us to model important biospheric processes, including fire, mortality, permafrost, hydrological cycling and the impacts of managed land (crop growth and irrigation). Our results show that CM2Mc-LPJmL has similar temperature and precipitation biases to the original CM2Mc model with LaD. The performance of LPJmL5 in the coupled system compared to Earth observation data and to LPJmL offline simulation results is within acceptable error margins. The historical global mean temperature evolution of our model setup is within the range of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) models. The comparison of model runs with and without land-use change shows a partially warmer and drier climate state across the global land surface. CM2Mc-LPJmL opens new opportunities to investigate important biophysical vegetation-climate feedbacks with a state-of-the-art and process-based dynamic vegetation model.

AB  - Crop management practices impact soil productivity by altering the soil environment, which in turn affects microbial growth and decomposition processes that transform plant-produced C to soil organic matter (SOM) or CO2.  Reduced tillage increases SOM in the long term, but there is limited information on the in situ seasonal changes in soil physical and biological properties that affect SOM dynamics.  Our objectives were to:  (i) determine the effect of tillage (conventionally disked (CT) and no tillage (NT) in a sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.)- wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/ soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) 2-year rotation sequence and a wheat/soybean double-cropping sequence on the seasonal dynamics and soil depth distribution of gravimetric soil water content (SWC), soil temperature, bulk density (BD) and water-filled pore space (WFPS); and (ii) relate soil CO2 evolution to changes in these physical properties.  Treatments had been in place for 9 years at the beginning of sampling.  The soil was a Weswood silty clay loam (fine, mixed, thermic Fluventic Ustochrept) located in southcentral Texas.  Soil CO2 evolution, using the static chamber method with alkali absorption, and physical properties were measured 57 times during a 2-year period.  Soil water content with NT was greater than with CT at the 0-50 mm depth during the fallow period of sorghum-wheat/soybean.  In contrast to the surface, SWC at the 50-125 mm depth with CT was greater than or equal to that with NT in all crop sequences.  Tillage reduced soil BD, especially at the 50-125 mm depth in all crop sequences, but exhibited large seasonal dynamics at the 0-50 mm depth.  Greater temporal variation in SWC and BD occurred due to tillage effects.  Soil temperature at 50 mm depth at sunrise averaged 1.2-degrees-C greater with NT than with CT during May, September and November, perhaps due to reduced heat loss with residue cover.  The mean rate of soil CO2 evolution with CT was 1.55, 1.95 and 2.45 g CO2-C m-2 d-1 in sorghum-wheat/soybean, sorghum-wheat/soybean and wheat/soybean, respectively.  The corresponding soil CO2 evolution with NT was 9% greater, 12% greater, and not different compared with CT, respectively.  Large seasonal differences in soil CO2 evolution occurred with respect to tillage regime.  Soil CO2 evolution was highly related to soil temperature, moisture and temperature-moisture interactions.  Regression models of soil CO2 evolution on soil temperature, moisture and day of the season explained from 65 to 98% of the temporal variation, depending upon crop sequence, tillage regime and season.  Day of the season was related to non-linear residue decomposition and a polynomial function that expressed crop root respiration and microbial respiration due to rhizodeposition.  There were significant tillage and crop sequence interactions with soil temperature and moisture, suggesting that C budgets of agroecosystems derived from climatic data alone could be misleading.  Conversion from CT to NT increased C sequestration in soil, but soil under NT released the same or more C as CO2, depending upon crop sequence, suggesting that the dynamics of C sequestration/mineralization had changed during the 10-year period.

AB  - Crop management practices impact soil productivity by altering the soil environment, which in turn affects microbial growth and decomposition processes that transform plant-produced C to soil organic matter (SOM) or CO2. Long-term reduced tillage increases SOM, but little is known about the seasonal dynamics of soil CO2 evolution as affected by tillage and crop. The objectives were as follows: (1) To determine the effect of tillage (conventionally disked (CT) and no tillage (NT)) in monoculture sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench,), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) on the seasonal dynamics and soil depth distribution of, gravimetric soil water content (SWC), soil temperature, bulk density (ED), and water-filled pore space (WFPS). (2) To relate soil CO2 evolution to changes in these parameters. The soil was a Weswood silty clay loam (fine, mixed, thermic Fluventic Ustochrept) located in southcentral Texas. Soil CO2 evolution, using the static chamber method with alkali absorption, and physical parameters were measured 57 times during 2 years. Soil water content was greater under NT than under CT during the fallow period in all crops, but not always during the growing season. Soil ED was reduced shortly after tillage, but increased to levels observed under NT during wet and cold intervals in the fallow period and during the growing season in all crops. Soil temperature at sunrise was 0.7-1.6 degrees C greater under NT than under CT during spring and autumn months in all crops. Mean soil CO2 evolution was greater during the growing season than during fallow in all crops. Mean soil CO2 evolution during the fallow period was not different between tillage regimes in sorghum (1.25 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)), but was greater under NT compared with CT in wheat (1.88 vs. 1.65 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)) and in soybean (1.04 vs. 0.86 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)). During the growing season, soil CO2 evolution was greater under NT compared with CT in sorghum (2.04 vs. 1.84 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)) and in soybean (2.08 vs. 1.58 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)), but was lower under NT compared with CT in wheat (2.09 vs. 2.52 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)). Mean soil CO2 evolution during both periods was related to soil organic C (SOC) under CT, but not under NT. The combined effects of soil temperature, SWC (or WFPS), temperature-water interactions, days after harvest during the fallow period, and days after planting during the growing season explained 73 to 92% of the seasonal variation in soil CO2 evolution depending upon tillage regime and crop. In situ soil CO2 evolution responded to soil temperature and SWC differently depending upon tillage and crop management, suggesting that C budgets of agroecosystems derived from climatic data alone could be misleading. Conversion from CT to NT increased C sequestration in soil, but soil under NT released the same or more C as CO2 depending on crop during Year 9 and Year 10 after initiation, suggesting that the dynamics of C sequestration/mineralization had changed during the 10 year period.

AB  - The pumiceous pyroclastic deposits known as the Sandy Bay Tuff on Macauley Island in the Kermadec Group represent a medium-scale silicic eruption in an oceanic subduction setting. The Sandy Bay eruption occurred about 6310 yr BP, forming a large submarine caldera in the summit of the mainly submarine and essentially basaltic Macauley Volcano. The Sandy Bay magma contained < 1 vol% phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite, hypersthene and accessory oxides together with crystals and fragments of basaltic origin and lithic fragments representing an earlier silicic eruptive episode. Although prolonged fractionation of basaltic magma to produce silicic daughter is a generic paradigm, it fails in detail to completely explain the observed compositions of the silicic rocks, the variety of compositions, the distribution of rock types, their aphyric nature. or their volumes. It also encounters difficulties as a general explanation for silicic magmatism in the Kermadec Arc. An alternative, that silicic magmas represent anatexis of underplated basaltic arc crust, explains more of these details and can be modelled as the logical consequence of the thermal evolution of an oceanic arc. In addition, this model can provide an explanation for the onset of silicic magmatism at the current stage in the evolution of the arc. A precondition for anatectic melting in an oceanic arc is the development of a suitable source at the base of the arc crust; this takes of the order of 10(6) years. The onset of silicic magmatism creates an infertile residue and complementary silicic magmas. Separation of silicic magma from its source and its rise into the upper crust removes heat from the system. Continuation of silicic magmatism depends on replenishment of fertile arc material. An alternative is that generation of silicic magmas is limited to a window of opportunity at an adolescent stage in the evolution of an oceanic arc. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Starting with the Laramide orogeny and continuing through the Cenozoic, the U.S. Cordilleran orogen is unusual for its width, nature of uplift, and style of tectonic and magmatic activity. We present teleseismic tomography evidence for a thickness of modified North America lithosphere greater than or equal to200 km beneath Colorado and >100 km beneath New Mexico. Existing explanations for uplift or magmatism cannot accommodate lithosphere this thick. Imaged mantle structure is low in seismic velocity roughly beneath the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico, and high in velocity to the east and west, beneath the tectonically intact Great Plains and Colorado Plateau. Structure internal to the low-velocity volume has a NE grain suggestive of influence by inherited Precambrian sutures. We conclude that the high-velocity upper mantle is Precambrian lithosphere, and the low-velocity volume is partially molten Precambrian North America mantle.
   We suggest, as others have, that the Farallon stab was in contact with the lithosphere beneath most of the western U.S. during the Laramide orogeny. We further suggest that slab de-watering under the increasingly cool conditions of slab contact with North America hydrated the base of the continental lithosphere, causing a steady regional uplift of the western U.S. during the Laramide orogeny. Imaged low-velocity upper mantle is attributed to hydration-induced lithospheric melting beneath much of the southern Rocky Mountains. Laramide-age magmatic ascent heated and weakened the lithosphere, which in turn allowed horizontal shortening to occur in the mantle beneath the region of Laramide thrusting in the southern Rocky Mountains. Subsequent Farallon slab removal resulted in additional uplift through unloading. It also triggered vigorous magmatism, especially where asthenosphere made contact with the hydrated and relatively thin and fertile lithosphere of what now is the Basin and Range. This mantle now is dry, depleted of basaltic components, hot, buoyant, and weak.

AB  - As an important metal three-dimensional printing technology, electron beam melting (EBM) is gaining increasing attention due to its huge potential applications in aerospace and biomedical fields. EBM processing of Ti-6Al-4V as well as its microstructure and mechanical properties were extensively investigated. However, it is still lack of quantitative studies regarding its microstructural evolution, indicative of EBM thermal process. Here, we report alpha' martensitic transformation and alpha/beta interface evolution in varied printing thicknesses of EBM-printed Ti-6Al-4V block samples by means of atom probe tomography. Quantitative chemical composition analysis suggests a general phase transformation sequence. By increasing in-fill hatched thickness, elemental partitioning ratios arise and beta volume fraction is increased. Furthermore, we observe kinetic vanadium segregation and aluminum depletion at interface front and the resultant alpha/beta interface widening phenomenon. It may give rise to an increased alpha/beta lattice mismatch and weakened alpha/beta interfaces, which could account for the degraded strength as printing thickness increases.

AB  - Climate change creates new challenges for preventing and protecting human health against different diseases that could appear and propagate. The Aedes albopictus mosquito species is an important vector for different diseases like dengue fever or zika. Although this species is not "indigenous" in Europe, its presence is noticed in many countries on the continent. The Ae. albopictus establishment is conditioned by the species' characteristics and environmental factors. To assess the possible spread of Ae. albopictus in the Dobrogea region (situated in the Southeast of Romania), we conducted the following analysis: (1) Investigation of the current distribution and climatic factors favoring Ae. albopictus' establishment in Europe; (2) Analysis of climate dynamics in Dobrogea in terms of the parameters identified at stage (1); (3) Testing the hypothesis that the climate from Dobrogea favors Ae. albopictus' establishment in the region; (4) Building a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based model of the potential geographic distribution of Ae. albopictus in Dobrogea. Results show that the climate of Dobrogea favors the apparition of the investigated species and its proliferation.

AB  - The nucleosynthesis of Ta-180 has remained an unsolved problem and as its origin many nucleosynthesis mechanisms have been proposed. This isotope has the unique feature that the naturally occurring abundance of Ta-180 is actually a meta-stable isomer (half-life of >= 10(15) yr), while the ground state is a 1(+) unstable state which beta-decays with a half-life of only 8.15 hr. We have made a new time-dependent calculation of Ta-180 meta-stable isomer residual ratio after supernova neutrino-induced reactions. This residual isomer ratio is crucial for understanding the production and survival of this naturally occurring rare isotope. We have constructed a new model under temperature evolution after type II supernova explosion. We include the explicit linking between the isomer and all known excited states and found that the residual ratio is insensitive to astrophysical parameters such as neutrino energy spectrum, explosion energy, decay time constant. We find that the explicit time evolution of the synthesis of Ta-180 avoids the overproduction relative to La-138 for a neutrino process neutrino temperature of 4 MeV.

AB  - We present well-ordered Pt nanocluster arrays supported on the h-BN/Rh(111) Moire as a model system for an ethylene dehydrogenation catalyst. Thereby, the h-BN nanomesh serves as a chemically inert eggbox-like template for clusters with a narrow size distribution. The thermal evolution of ethylene is investigated by synchrotron-based high-resolution in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the Pt nanoclusters. We compare our results with data on Pt(111) and Pt(355). Interestingly, the Pt nanoclusters and Pt(355) behave very similarly. Both open a new reaction pathway via vinylidene in addition to the route via ethylidyne known for Pt(111). Due to the importance of coking in ethylene dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts, we also studied C2H4 adsorption and decomposition on carbon precovered Pt nanoclusters. While the amount of adsorbed ethylene decreases linearly with the carbon coverage, we found that edge sites are more affected than facet sites and that the vinylidene reaction pathway is effectively suppressed by carbon residues.

TI  - DNA word design strategy for creating sets of non-interacting oligonucleotides for DNA microarrays

AB  - A template-map design strategy for generating sets of non-interacting DNA oligonucleotides for applications in DNA arrays and biosensors is demonstrated. This strategy is used to create a set of oligonucleotides of size s with length l that possess at least n base mismatches with the complements of all the other members in the set. These "DNA word" sets are denoted as nbml-mers or l:n sets. To regularize the thermodynamic stability of the perfectly matched hybridized DNA duplexes, the l-mers chosen for all the sets are required to have an approximately 50% G/C content. To achieve good discrimination between each DNA word in each set generated using the template-map strategy, it is required that n should be approximately equal to l/2 or higher. The template-map strategy can be used in a straightforward manner to create DNA word sets for cases when l = 4k and n = 2k, where k is an integer. Specific examples of 4k:2k sets are designed: an 8:4 set (s = 224), a 12:6 set (s = 528), a 16:8 set (s = 960), and a 20:10 set (s = 1520). These sets are further optimized to achieve the narrowest possible distribution of melting temperatures by selecting the best set after permutation of the templates and maps over all possible configurations. To demonstrate the viability of this methodology, a non-interacting set of four specific 6bm 12mers have been chosen, synthesized, and used in an SPR imaging measurement of the hybridization adsorption onto a DNA array, The template-map strategy is also applied to generate DNA word sets for cases where l not equal 4k. In these cases, the creation of the maps and templates is more complicated, but possible. The templates and maps for three additional types of sets are created: (4k - 1):(2k - 1), (4k + 1):2k, and (4k - 2):(2k - 1). Specific examples are given for l = 7, 9, and 10: DNA word sets of 7:3 (s = 224), 9:4 (s = 360), and 10:5 (s = 132).

AB  - Background. Problem of influenza is sadly underappreciated, and this can be proved by the data concerning the incidence, hospitalization and influenza-related mortality.
   Objectives. To investigate the level of general knowledge among the selected group or people on influenza and their behaviour that they display on the appearance of symptoms of the flu/influenza-like illness.
   Material and methods. Studies used results of author surveys performed in February-March 2012. The test group was 100 randomly selected people. The questionnaire consisted of 10 one-choice questions.
   Results. 82% of the respondents believe that the flu is caused by a virus, 10%, a bacterium. 86% respondents asked what symptoms clearly point to the flu responded that the high fever, pain in the joints, muscles, throat and lack of appetite. On the question whether the cold and flu was the same disease as much as 87% replied negatively. Most people (53%) treat flu symptoms/influenza-like illness with OTC drugs. 70% respondents asked to select influenza complications in 70% gave an incomplete answer.
   Conclusions. The respondents have only general knowledge and awareness of influenza, Therefore they do not take the proper preventive and curative measures in the event of an influenza infection. Broad education about the flu is a milestone in this topic.

AB  - Human erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum have markedly increased permeability to diverse solutes, many of which may be mediated by an unusual small conductance ion channel, the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC). Because these increases may be essential for parasite survival in the bloodstream, an important question is whether other intraerythrocytic parasites induce similar ion channels. Here, we examined this question using human erythrocytes infected with Babesia divergens, a distantly related apicomplexan parasite that can cause severe disease in immunocompromised humans. Osmotic lysis experiments after enrichment of infected erythrocytes with a new method revealed that these parasites also increase host permeability to various organic solutes. These permeability changes differed significantly from those induced by P. falciparum in transport rates, selectivity profiles and temperature dependence. Cell-attached and whole-cell patch-clamp experiments confirmed and extended these differences because neither PSAC-like channels nor significant increases in whole-cell anion conductance were seen after B. divergens infection. While both babesia and plasmodia increase host erythrocyte permeability to a diverse collection of organic solutes, they utilize fundamentally different mechanisms.

AB  - A variety of organisms have independently evolved proteins exhibiting antifreeze activity that allows survival at subfreezing temperatures. The antifreeze proteins (AFPs) bind ice nuclei and depress the freezing point by a noncolligative absorption-inhibition mechanism. Many organisms have a heterogeneous suite of AFPs with variation in primary sequence between paralogous loci. Here, we demonstrate that the diversification of the AFP paralogues is promoted by positive Darwinian selection in two independently evolved AFPs from fish and beetle. First, we demonstrate an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions compared to synonymous substitutions in the mature protein coding region. Second, we perform phylogeny-based tests of selection to demonstrate a subset of codons is subjected to positive selection. When mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the fish antifreeze type III antifreeze structure, these codons correspond to amino acid positions that surround but do not interrupt the putative ice-binding surface. The selective agent may be related to efficient binding to diverse ice surfaces or some other aspect of AFP function.

AB  - Drought intensity and frequency are increasing under global warming, with soil water availability now being a major factor limiting tree growth in circumboreal forests. Still, the adaptive capacity of trees in the face of future climatic regimes remains poorly documented.
   Using 1481 annually resolved tree-ring series from 29-yr-old trees, we evaluated the drought sensitivity of 43 white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) populations established in a common garden experiment.
   We show that genetic variation among populations in response to drought plays a significant role in growth resilience. Local genetic adaptation allowed populations from drier geographical origins to grow better, as indicated by higher resilience to extreme drought events, compared with populations from more humid geographical origins. The substantial genetic variation found for growth resilience highlights the possibility of selecting for drought resilience in boreal conifers.
   As a major research outcome, we showed that adaptive genetic variation in response to changing local conditions can shape drought vulnerability at the intraspecific level. Our findings have wide implications for forest ecosystem management and conservation.

AB  - Since the growing interest in the manufacture and environmental applications of nanocomposites consisting of CuO and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), related toxicological effect and interaction with cellular structures for these newly developed materials are still unknown. Recent literature reveals that nanosized CuO and TiO2 particles have cytotoxicity risks and ability to cause oxidative stress on health. This work considers the CuO doped TiO2 nanocomposite particles were synthesized via a coprecipitation method with aqueous solutions as precursors of copper nitrate and titanium dioxide. Moreover, the nanocomposite particles were characterized using TGA-DTA, UV-Vis and TEM measurements. The calcination temperature was selected at 873 K. The nanocomposite particles were characterized by TEM, as the primary particles, aggregates ranged from 30 to 100 nm and have a good dispersion character. Cell cytotoxicity assessment and the percentage cell survival was determined by using 3 - (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) - 5 (3-carboxymethoxyphenol) -2 - (4-sulfophenyl) - 2H - tetrazoli um (MTS) assay on human fetal lung tissue cell (MRC-5). The experimental results show that the CuO doped TiO2 nanocomposite particles cause potential cytotoxicity effect in cultured human cells.

AB  - PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 mass concentrations have been measured at Delhi (28 degrees 35'N; 77 degrees 12'E) during the August to December 2007. The running mean of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 data shows large variations. The PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were ranged from 20 to 180 mu g/m(3) during the monsoon and from 100 to 500 mu g/m(3) during the winter (up to 1200 mu g/m(3) in November due to Deepavali fireworks). For the same running mean cycles, higher mass concentrations in the PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were corresponded with peaks in the relative humidity and lower levels linked to peaks in the ambient temperature. The evolutions of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations after the elapsed times are simulated with mean mass scavenging coefficients. These evolution patterns clearly show the difference in washout of PM10 with impaction scavenging relative to those for PM2.5 and PM1 particles over different rainfall durations. Air-mass pathways traced with HYSPLIT model over the study area illustrates the nature of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 levels with monsoon and winter air-mass circulations over Delhi.

AB  - Many intertidal teleosts exhibit amphibious behavior and facultatively breathe air. We examined the intertidal teleost Fundulus heteroclitus, the mummichog for the ability to take up O-2 and release CO2 aerially over a range of temperatures. Additionally, we measured aquatic oxygen consumption before and after aerial emergence. Fundulus heteroclitus exchanged O-2 and CO2 effectively during an emergence of 1.5 h. Respiratory exchange ratios (RER, CO2 release:O-2 uptake) were between 0.74 and 1.0, sufficient to keep pace with metabolic CO2 production. Oxygen consumption was significantly lower in air than in water. Upon return to water after an hour of aerial emergence, aquatic O-2 consumption was no higher than prior to emergence, an indication that anaerobic metabolism is not used during air emergence. We conclude that F. heteroclitus can withstand air emergence in the salt marsh by breathing air. Emergence and aerial respiration might appear to be a specific adaptations to survival in intertidal habitats in F. heteroclitus, but phylogenetic evidence suggests that these traits may also be ancestral characters. Additional physicological testing in closely related species will aid in elucidating the evolution and adaptive characteristics of aerial respiration in this clade.

AB  - Bacteria spend their lives buffeted by changing environmental conditions. To adapt to and survive these stresses, bacteria have global response systems that result in sweeping changes in gene expression and cellular metabolism. These responses are controlled by master regulators, which include: alternative sigma factors, such as RpoS and RpoH; small molecule effectors, such as ppGpp; gene repressors such as LexA; and, inorganic molecules, such as polyphosphate. The response pathways extensively overlap and are induced to various extents by the same environmental stresses. These stresses include nutritional deprivation, DNA damage, temperature shift, and exposure to antibiotics. All of these global stress responses include functions that can increase genetic variability. In particular, up-regulation and activation of errorprone DNA polymerases, down-regulation of error-correcting enzymes, and movement of mobile genetic elements are common features of several stress responses. The result is that under a variety of stressful conditions, bacteria are induced for genetic change. This transient mutator state may be important for adaptive evolution.

AB  - Background The study of the mechanisms by which larvae of the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito survive exposure to the entomopathogen Lysinibacillus sphaericus has benefited substantially from the generation of laboratory-selected colonies resistant to this bacterium. One such colony, RIAB59, was selected after regular long-term exposure of larvae to the L. sphaericus IAB59 strain. This strain is characterized by its ability to produce the well known Binary (Bin) toxin, and the recently characterized Cry48Aa/Cry49Aa toxin, able to kill Bin-resistant larvae. Resistance to Bin is associated with the depletion of its receptor, Cqm1 alpha-glucosidase, from the larvae midgut. This study aimed to identify novel molecules and pathways associated with survival of the RIAB59 larvae and the resistance phenotype. Methods A transcriptomic approach and bioinformatic tools were used to compare the profiles derived from the midguts of larvae resistant and susceptible to L. sphaericus IAB59. Results The RNA-seq profiles identified 1355 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 673 down- and 682 upregulated transcripts. One of the most downregulated DEGs was cqm1, which validates the approach. Other strongly downregulated mRNAs encode the enzyme pantetheinase, apolipoprotein D, lipases, heat-shock proteins and a number of lesser known and hypothetical polypeptides. Among the upregulated DEGs, the top most encodes a peroxisomal enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, while others encode enzymes associated with juvenile hormone synthesis, ion channels, DNA binding proteins and defense polypeptides. Further analyses confirmed a strong downregulation of several enzymes involved in lipid catabolism while the assignment of DEGs into metabolic pathways highlighted the upregulation of those related to DNA synthesis and maintenance, confirmed by their clustering into related protein networks. Several other pathways were also identified with mixed profiles of down- and upregulated transcripts. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the changes in levels seen for selected mRNAs. Conclusions Our transcriptome-wide dataset revealed that the RIAB59 colony, found to be substantially more resistant to Bin than to the Cry48Aa/Cry49Aa toxin, developed a differential expression profile as well as metabolic features co-selected during the long-term adaptation to IAB59 and that are most likely linked to Bin resistance.

AB  - We investigated the use of aquatic and terrestrial floodplain habitats by lentic and lotic turtles inhabiting the Missouri River, a contemporary, regulated large river. Specifically, we tested whether habitats were used differentially by turtle species, sexes, and life stages over biologically determined spatial and temporal scales. We monitored female and male false map turtles (Graptemys pseudogeographica) and slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) for 14 months, using radiotelemetry. In addition, over a 3-year period we trapped G. pseudogeographica (n=591) and T. scripta (n=129) to supplement data on habitat use. Movements based on radiotelemetry and recaptures were summarized for each individual. Both species of turtles displayed dynamic annual activity patterns and used diverse habitats including those typically considered terrestrial. Although G. pseudogeographica and T.: scripta spent a substantial portion of the year in the Missouri River (primarily in the cool months), newly created scour habitats also appeared to attract turtles during the cool season. However, in the warm months, habitat use became much more diverse, with turtles occupying all identified habitats including flooded agriculture and forest. Relative to their proportions, slough and scour habitats appeared to be highly favored while forests older than 4 years and agricultural habitats were proportionally less favored. We found few differences between species. However, males of both species were consistently more sedentary, used half as many habitats, and moved half as far from the river as did females, especially during May through July. Juveniles of both species were captured on average farther from the river than were adults, perhaps reflecting the close proximity of both nesting areas and shallow, productive habitats free of aquatic predators. We estimate a riparian zone of 449 m that encompasses 95% of the population movements away from the river and discuss the quality of habitats important to reproduction and survival of lentic and lotic floodplain turtles. These spatial and temporal movement patterns, in light of their potential adaptive costs and benefits to G. pseudogeographica and T. scripta, are critical to understanding the ecology of long-lived vertebrates that depend on contemporary large rivers.

AB  - This is the first study to look at future temporal urban heath island (UHI) trends of Athens (Greece) under different UHI intensity regimes. Historical changes in the Athens UHI, spanning 1971-2016, were assessed by contrasting two air temperature records from stable meteorological stations in contrasting urban and rural settings. Subsequently, we used a five-member regional climate model (RCM) sub-ensemble from EURO-CORDEX with a horizontal resolution of 0.11 degrees (similar to 12 x 12 km) to simulate air temperature data, spanning the period 1976-2100, for the two station sites. Three future emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) were implanted in the simulations after 2005 covering the period 2006-2100. Two 20-year historical reference periods (1976-1995 and 1996-2015) were selected with contrasting UHI regimes; the second period had a stronger intensity. The daily maximum and minimum air temperature data (T(max)and T-min) for the two reference periods were perturbed to two future periods, 2046-2065 and 2076-2095, under the three RCPs, by applying the empirical quantile mapping (eqm) bias-adjusting method. This novel approach allows us to assess future temperature developments in Athens under two UHI intensity regimes that are mainly forced by differences in air pollution and heat input. We found that the future frequency of days with T-max> 37 degrees C in Athens was only different from rural background values under the intense UHI regime. Thus, the impact of heatwaves on the urban environment of Athens is dependent on UHI intensity. There is a large increase in the future frequency of nights with T-min> 26 degrees C in Athens under all UHI regimes and climate scenarios; these events remain comparatively rare at the rural site. This large urban amplification of the frequency of extremely hot nights is likely caused by air pollution. Consequently, local mitigation policies aimed at decreasing urban atmospheric pollution are expected to be highly effective in reducing urban temperatures and extreme heat events in Athens under future climate change scenarios. Such policies directly have multiple benefits, including reduced electricity (energy) needs, improved living quality and strong health advantages (heat- and pollution-related illness/deaths).

AB  - RNA viruses are capable of rapid host shifting, typically due to a point mutation that confers expanded host range. As additional point mutations are necessary for further expansions, epistasis among host range mutations can potentially affect the mutational neighborhood and frequency of niche expansion. We mapped the mutational neighborhood of host range expansion using three genotypes of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) bacteriophage phi 6 (wild type and two isogenic host range mutants) on the novel host Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens. Both Sanger sequencing of 50 P. syringae pv. atrofaciens mutant clones for each genotype and population Illumina sequencing revealed the same high-frequency mutations allowing infection of P. syringae pv. atrofaciens. Wild-type phi 6 had at least nine different ways of mutating to enter the novel host, eight of which are in p3 (host attachment protein gene), and 13/50 clones had unchanged p3 genes. However, the two isogenic mutants had dramatically restricted neighborhoods: only one or two mutations, all in p3. Deep sequencing revealed that wild-type clones without mutations in p3 likely had changes in p12 (morphogenic protein), a region that was not polymorphic for the two isogenic host range mutants. Sanger sequencing confirmed that 10/13 of the wild-type phi 6 clones had nonsynonymous mutations in p12, and 2 others had point mutations in p9 and p5. None of these genes had previously been associated with host range expansion in phi 6. We demonstrate, for the first time, epistatic constraint in an RNA virus due to host range mutations themselves, which has implications for models of serial host range expansion.
   IMPORTANCE RNA viruses mutate rapidly and frequently expand their host ranges to infect novel hosts, leading to serial host shifts. Using an RNA bacteriophage model system (Pseudomonas phage phi 6), we studied the impact of preexisting host range mutations on another host range expansion. Results from both clonal Sanger and Illumina sequencing show that extant host range mutations dramatically narrow the neighborhood of potential host range mutations compared to that of wild-type phi 6. This research suggests that serial host-shifting viruses may follow a small number of molecular paths to enter additional novel hosts. We also identified new genes involved in phi 6 host range expansion, expanding our knowledge of this important model system in experimental evolution.

AB  - Copoly(ether imide)s formed by the reaction of an aromatic dianhydride (BPDA), an aromatic diamine (ODA or BNZ), and alpha,omega-bis(2-aminopropyl polypropylene oxide)s with molecular weights of 2000 and 4000 g/mol were obtained, characterized, and studied as gas separation membranes. All of the copoly(ether imide)s studied showed a low imidization temperature, well below 200 degrees C. They also underwent a phase segregation process, as confirmed by SAXS, when they were thermally treated. The segregation was found to increase permeability without any significant decrease of selectivity for almost all of the gas pairs studied (O-2/N-2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N-2). For the CH4/N-2 pair, a strong increase in selectivity was obtained upon segregation, along with a rising permeability. This excellent gas productivity for the mixture CH4/N-2 is probably due to a combined effect of a specific interaction and an increase in solubility of CH4 in the soft segregated domains of the copolymer. Methane permeabilities over 20 barrer and CH4/N-2 selectivities close to 4.2 for an applied pressure of 1 bar were attained. The changes in permselectivity with permeation temperature were observed to follow an Arrhenius correlation, which adds a certain tunable permeability versus selectivity to these materials. Thus, it is possible to attain high selectivities (for relatively low temperatures) or high permeabilities (for comparatively high temperatures). The proportion of PPO in the final polymer has a significant influence on the segregation extent and domains, so that both the selectivity and permeability improved when the proportion of polyether in the final polymer was high. The mechanical properties were good for all of the proportions and/or densities tested. All of the copolymers studied showed a high resistance to plasticization and to the action of solvents and aggressive media. The high permselectivities and resistance to plasticization and solvents suggest that the membranes obtained could be advantageously used in natural gas extraction and purification.

AB  - Mixed culture-based syngas biomethanation is a robust bioconversion process with high versatility in terms of exploitable feedstocks and potential applications, as it could be operated independently, or coupled to anaerobic digestion systems and in-situ biogas upgrading processes. Typically, the syngas biomethanation consists in the stepwise conversion of syngas into methane through a number of catabolic routes, which may vary considerably depending on the operating conditions. In this study, two enrichments were performed at 37 degrees C and 60 degrees C to investigate the effect of the incubation temperature on the microbial selection process and the dominant catabolic routes followed. This was carried out through the characterization of the catabolic routes and the microbial composition of the enriched cultures, and a thermodynamic feasibility study on their metabolic networks. The enrichments resulted in two stable microbial consortia with different patterns of activity. The mesophilic enriched consortium presented a more intricate metabolic network composed by four microbial trophic groups, where aceticlastic methanogenesis contributed to 64.9 +/- 8.3% of the CH4 production. The metabolic network of the thermophilic enriched consortium was much simpler, consisting in the syntrophic association of carboxydotrophic hydrogenogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. This led to significant differences in methane productivity, corresponding to 1.83 +/- 0.27 and 33.48 +/- 0.90 mmol CH4/g VSS/h for the mesophilic and the thermophilic enriched consortium, respectively, which would potentially make the thermophilic consortium more suited for industrial applications. 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis indicated the presence of strains with similarity to Acetobacterium sp., Methanospirillum hungateii, Methanospirillum stamsii and Methanothrix sp. at mesophilic conditions, and Thermincola carboxydiphila and Methanothermobacter sp. at thermophilic conditions, implying a role in the conversion of syngas. The thermodynamic feasibility study demonstrated that the microbial selection was not driven solely by kinetic competition, since thermodynamic limitations also played a significant role defining the dominant catabolic routes.

AB  - This study discusses importance of assessing environmental sustainability of fruits and vegetable (F&V) production sector in future climate change (CC) scenarios. For the current production scenario, life cycle environmental footprints of F&V supply chain are discussed considering the influences of: agro-climates, production systems, raw material inputs, post-harvest managements to the products' yield and quality. Potential risks of CC to the sector are discussed in the context of elevated global temperature and carbon dioxide level, ozone depletion and changes in precipitation patterns. Potential risks due to CC are on the productivity and the quality of F&V products, such as texture, color, maturity and nutrients. Increased risk of failure of the current crop protection strategies, e.g. due to pest infestations and different crop-water and nutrient stresses are among the short and long-term risks. It also discusses potential adaptation and mitigation measures to CC, and therefrom argues on the related environmental consequences in the supply chain. From the LCA studies, it was revealed that environmental impacts of F&V supply chain varied as per agro-ecological characteristics and farming systems, e.g. greenhouse vs open-field, organic vs conventional, and grown in different agro-climatic conditions. The nexus among the climatic stresses, potential adaptation and mitigation measures, hence were in the form of potential changes in the raw material inputs and resource flows depending on the preferred future agro-management strategies and farming practices. Adaptation and other management options, included are, changes in: crop calendar, nutrient and pest management strategies, post-harvest handling and improved preservation of F&V products. These are argued eventually being determining factors leading to different environmental footprints compared to the existing management scenarios. Prospective life cycle environmental evaluation of F&V supply chain considering the relationship among product yield and qualities, CC stresses and potential adaptation and mitigation measures is thus a new thrust and direction.

AB  - The gas-phase oxidation of glycerol over MFI-type iron zeolite catalysts comprises an attractive technology to prepare dihydroxyacetone with a high productivity, in contrast with the currently practiced biocatalytic system. Herein, we address two crucial aspects in view of a prospective industrial application, i.e., the development of the technical iron zeolite-based catalysts and the environmental and economic assessment of the process by life cycle analysis. Regarding the first task, we show that iron silicalite with the desired structural, acidic and catalytic properties can be prepared by hydrothermal synthesis at the kg-scale and using reagents meeting industrial safety, ecological and cost criteria. The design of suitable mm-sized bodies encompassed the use of shaping methods which minimise the introduction of additional acidity as well as iron clustering and migration from the zeolite to the binder phase. In this respect, silica outperforms kaolin as the binder, pelletisation and polyether-assisted extrusion are superior to water-based extrusion and the calcination and steam activation of the as-crystallised zeolite are preferably done after the forming step. The optimal technical catalyst displays equivalent activity, selectivity and stability to lab-scale pure iron silicalite powder in a 72 h test. From a life cycle perspective, all environmental indicators are drastically improved and the operating cost is halved using a chemocatalytic zeolite-based process for the preparation of high-purity dihydroxyacetone compared to the conventional enzymatic route. This is justified by the high atom economy of the transformation which reduces waste and by the minimisation of the energy input via heat integration and the use of less energy-intensive separation units to purify the substantially more concentrated outlet stream. Since the purity demand for the dihydroxyacetone feedstock to produce lactic acid is lower than that required in the cosmetic and polymer industries, a potential glycerol oxidation process for the former application has an even greater advantage in terms of greenness and cost.

AB  - Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are responsible for nearly 50% of all common cold infections. Ordinarily, HRV infections are mild and self-limiting; nonetheless, every year they result in significant loss of economic productivity and substantial inappropriate antibiotic use. Development of effective vaccine and antiviral prophylaxis against HRV has been hampered by the extensive antigenic diversity present among the nearly 100 serotypes. To gain new insights into the evolutionary processes that create the genetic diversity present among HRVs, we tested for recombination and selection for individual genes and the coding genome for 45 HRV serotypes using estimated phylogenetic relationships. Although the structural capsid genes and nonstructural genes recovered incongruent tree topologies, no recombination was detected using substitution methods. Therefore, the coding genome was determined to be appropriate for phylogenetic tests. Results of the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test support the hypothesis that the capsid genes recover a different evolutionary history than the nonstructural genes. Our best phylogenetic estimate based on the coding genome suggests that HRV-B is more closely related to enterovirus than to HRV-A; however, several alternative phylogenetic hypotheses were not rejected by the SH test. Positive selection was examined by using two different approaches; d(N)/d(S) rate ratio and the physicochemical phenotypes for 31 amino acid properties. Analyses using d(N)/d(S) failed to detect positive selection. However, protein phenotypic expression appears to be a more sensitive approach. There was extensive stabilizing and destabilizing positive selection in HRV-A major and HRV-B serotypes for all proteins, except in 3A in HRV-B, which overlapped with functional, structural, and to a greater extent in uncharacterized genomic regions. In contrast, the evolution of HRV-A minor serotypes appears to be driven primarily by destabilizing selection. Our results demonstrate that HRV-A major, HRV-A minor, and HRV-B serotypes have not been similarly influenced by purifying selection.

AB  - The operation of an indirectly cooled semibatch reactor in which an exothermic reaction occurs is usually considered safe if the characteristic time of the coreactant dosing is much higher than the characteristic times of all the other phenomena involved (chemical reaction and mass transfer), so that the conversion rate is controlled by the coreactant supply itself. Such operating conditions imply a small accumulation of the coreactant in the system and are characterized by a temperature evolution which quickly approaches a target temperature and remains close to it throughout the dosing period, at the end of which the conversion is almost complete.
   The so-called boundary diagrams are useful tools for identifying safe operating conditions without solving the mathematical model of the reactor. However, avoiding accumulation phenomena can be not sufficient for classifying a set of operating conditions as thermally safe when the maximum temperature reached by the system under normal operation exceeds a maximum allowable temperature (which can be related either to safety problems, when dangerous decomposition reactions can be triggered, or to productivity problems, when side reactions can significantly lower the product yield above a given threshold temperature).
   In this work the boundary diagrams for the prevention of excessive accumulation conditions in liquid-liquid semibatch reactors are coupled with new diagrams, called temperature diagrams. These new diagrams, involving the same dimensionless parameters used for the representation of the boundary diagrams, allow determining-for a given set of operating conditions-the maximum temperature increase with respect to the initial reactor temperature which can be expected to occur during normal operation. This information can be compared with the maximum allowable temperature for the reacting mixture. Then the operating conditions can be verified through the boundary diagrams in order to reject conditions of excessive coreactant accumulation.
   Several temperature diagrams are provided for various kinetically or diffusion controlled reactions with different reaction orders and their use together with a general procedure for calculating them is presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Connectivity of marine populations is shaped by complex interactions between biological and physical processes across the seascape. The influence of environmental features on the genetic structure of populations has key implications for the dynamics and persistence of populations, and an understanding of spatial scales and patterns of connectivity is crucial for management and conservation. This study employed a seascape genomics approach combining larval dispersal modeling and population genomic analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from RADseq to examine environmental factors influencing patterns of genetic structure and connectivity for a highly dispersive mud crab Scylla olivacea (Herbst, 1796) in the Sulu Sea. Dispersal simulations reveal widespread but asymmetric larval dispersal influenced by persistent southward and westward surface circulation features in the Sulu Sea. Despite potential for widespread dispersal across the Sulu Sea, significant genetic differentiation was detected among eight populations based on 1,655 SNPs (F-ST = 0.0057, p < .001) and a subset of 1,643 putatively neutral SNP markers (F-ST = 0.0042, p < .001). Oceanography influences genetic structure, with redundancy analysis (RDA) indicating significant contribution of asymmetric ocean currents to neutral genetic variation (Radj2 = 0.133, p = .035). Genetic structure may also reflect demographic factors, with divergent populations characterized by low effective population sizes (N-e < 50). Pronounced latitudinal genetic structure was recovered for loci putatively under selection (F-ST = 0.2390, p < .001), significantly correlated with sea surface temperature variabilities during peak spawning months for S. olivacea (Radj2 = 0.692-0.763; p < .050), suggesting putative signatures of selection and local adaptation to thermal clines. While oceanography and dispersal ability likely shape patterns of gene flow and genetic structure of S. olivacea across the Sulu Sea, the impacts of genetic drift and natural selection influenced by sea surface temperature also appear as likely drivers of population genetic structure. This study contributes to the growing body of literature documenting population genetic structure and local adaptation for highly dispersive marine species, and provides information useful for spatial management of the fishery resource.

AB  - Organisms that are distributed across spatial climate gradients often exhibit adaptive local variations in morphological and physiological traits, but to what extent such gradients shape evolutionary responses is still unclear. Given the strong natural contrast in latitudinal temperature gradients between the North-American Pacific and Atlantic coast, we asked how increases in vertebral number (VN, known as Jordan's Rule) with latitude would differ between Pacific (Atherinops affinis) and Atlantic Silversides (Menidia menidia), two ecologically equivalent and taxonomically similar fishes with similar latitudinal distributions. VN was determined from radiographs of wild-caught adults (genetic + environmental differences) and its genetic basis confirmed by rearing offspring in common garden experiments. Compared to published data on VN variation in M. menidia (a mean increase of 7.0 vertebrae from 32 to 46 degrees N, VN slope = 0.42 lat(-1)), the latitudinal VN increase in Pacific Silversides was approximately half as strong (a mean increase of 3.3 vertebrae from 28 to 43 degrees N, VN slope = 0.23 lat(-1)). This mimicked the strong Atlantic (1.11 degrees C lat(-1)) versus weak Pacific latitudinal gradient (0.40 degrees C lat(-1)) in median annual sea surface temperature (SST). Importantly, the relationship of VN to SST was not significantly different between the two species (average slope = -0.39 vertebrae degrees C-1), thus suggesting a common thermal dependency of VN in silverside fishes. Our findings provide novel support for the hypothesis that temperature gradients are the ultimate cause of Jordan's Rule, even though its exact adaptive significance remains speculative. A second investigated trait, the mode of sex determination in Atlantic versus Pacific Silversides, revealed patterns that were inconsistent with our expectation: M. menidia displays temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) at low latitudes, where growing seasons are long or unconstrained, but also a gradual shift to genetic sex determination (GSD) with increasing latitude due to more and more curtailed growing seasons. Sex ratios in A. affinis, on the other hand, were independent of latitude and rearing temperature (indicating GSD), even though growing seasons are thermally unconstrained across most of the geographical distribution of A. affinis. This suggests that additional factors (e.g., longevity) play an important role in shaping the mode of sex determination in silverside fishes.

AB  - In this review we detail the impact of climate change on marine productivity, on marine environmental stochasticity and cyclicity, and on the spatio-temporal match-mismatch of seabirds and their prey. We thereby show that global warming has a profound bottom-up impact upon marine top-predators, but that such effects have to be studied in conjunction with the (top-down) impact of human fisheries upon seabird food resources. Further, we propose seabird ecological features, such as memory effects and social constraints, that make them particularly sensitive to rapid environmental change. We provide examples of how seabirds may nonetheless adapt when facing the consequences of climate change. We conclude that our understanding of the spatial ecology of seabirds facing environmental change is still rudimentary, despite its relevance for the conservation of these vulnerable organisms and for the management of marine ecosystems. We define the following research priorities. (1) Determine the factors affecting seabird distribution and movements at sea using biotelemetry, as well as colony dynamics on land. (2) Link seabird distribution patterns to those of their prey, (3) Determine further the role of historical and metapopulation processes in contributing to the dynamics of the spatial distribution of seabirds. (4) Assess phenotypic plasticity and the potential for microevolution within seabird spatial responses to climate change, since both will greatly affect the quality of modelling studies. (5) Adapt existing models to define and predict the impact of climate change onto seabird spatial dynamics. (6) Synthesize all gathered information to define marine protected areas and further conservation schemes, such as capacity reduction of fisheries. This research effort will require maintaining existing long-term monitoring programmes for seabirds, as well as developing new approaches to permit the integration of processes occurring at various scales, in order to be able to fully track the population responses of these long-lived vertebrates to environmental changes.

AB  - Distinct equilibration temperatures, deformation and trace element characteristics are observed in amphibole-bearing and amphibole-free peridolite xenoliths from Nushan, Sino-Korean Craton, eastern China. Amphibole-free peridotites are predominantly deformed, fine-grained (similar to1 mm) and equilibrated at 990-1110degreesC. Their cpx are characterized by either light rare earth element (LREE)-depleted or relatively flat REE patterns with only a slight depletion in high field strength elements (HFSE). LREE enrichment is generally associated with Fe-rich samples.. consistent with 'wall-rock' metasomatism adjacent to basaltic veins. In contrast, amphibole-bearing peridotites are less deformed, coarse-grained (>3 mm) and display chemical zonation in the pyroxenes suggesting cooling from 1050 to 850degreesC. Their cpx show a large variation in LREE (Ce-n = 1.7-68) and almost constant heavy rare earth element (HREE) contents (Yb-n = 9(.)8-11(.)6). The highest LREE contents occur in cpx from amphibole-rich samples, coupled with Fe enrichment, strong enrichment in Th and U, and marked depletion in the HFSE. These characteristics may be accounted for by combined 'wall-rock' and 'diffuse' metasomatism involving an agent rich in volatiles and incompatible elements. As such the Nushan xenoliths could represent samples from two spatially separate metasomatic aureoles. Conversely, the cryptic and modal metasomatism could be genetically related, because the amphibole-peridotites and Fe-rich amphibole-free samples show similar Sr-Nd isotopic ranges that are indistinguishable from those of the Cenozoic basalts from eastern China. The different metasomatic assemblage and the trace element composition can be accounted for in terms of P-T control on amphibole stability and progressive chemical evolution of asthenosphere-derived melts during upward migration. Trace element signatures and metasomatic assemblages, together with the fertile composition of the Nushan peridotites, suggest an origin as newly accreted lithosphere rather than as relic cratonic mantle. Metasomatism may have occurred after late Mesozoic lithospheric thinning, which marked a dramatic change in lithospheric architecture beneath the Sino-Korean Craton.

AB  - Air pollution can cause the human health, plants growth and daily mortality in numerous studies over the past decade. Therefore, forecasting and analysis of air quality are important topics of research today. The causes of poor air quality are global warming, greenhouse effects, acid rain, etc. Air pollution problems are related to the emissions of sulfur dioxides (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), suspended particulates (PM10), ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and so on. O-3 adverse effects on human health has received intensively concern in recent years, It has been recognized as one of the principal pollutants that degrades air quality, thus we uses O-3 attribute to evaluate air quality.
   This study proposed a frequency moving average - order weight average (MA-OWA) model to forecast air quality by daily O-3 concentration. Due to O-3 data is belong to time series pattern, MA can simple calculation and OWA operator can aggregate multiple lag periods into single aggregated value by different situation parameters alpha. Frequency MA-OWA based time series model can efficiently and accurately forecast O-3. To demonstrate of the proposed, air quality monitoring the urban sites of Hsinchu (Taiwan), is selected for the numerical experiment from 2007 was utilized. From the results, the proposed methods outperform the listing methods in RMSE and MAPE.

AB  - The intertidal zone is one of the most stressful environments, with extreme shifts in temperature, salinity, pH and oxygen concentration. Marine molluscs, particularly chitons that belong to the category of ecologically significant organisms, survive in this extreme environment, and are ideal systems for studying stress adaptation. Mitochondria are known to be critical for energy homeostasis, and changes in environmental factors result in their dysfunction and consequent injury to the organism. Intertidal organisms are exception in this respect because they are capable of maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Here, we used mitochondrial genetic components from seven chitons of the intertidal zone to infer phylogenetic relationships. Selection analyses on individual protein-coding genes (PCGs) were performed to identify and map potentially adaptive residues in the modelled structures of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. The results showed significant amino acid changes in sites under diversifying selection for all the PCGs, indicating that the mitochondrial genome in chitons is undergoing adaptive evolution. Such sites were observed in the proton pump as well as in the translocation channel of the transmembrane helices and the surrounding loop regions, thus implying functional modification of the mitochondrial proteins essential for survival in the dynamic environment of the intertidal zone.

AB  - The total amount of melt produced in Mars during its evolution is estimated by means of a parameterized, one-dimensional, analytic mantle convection model that assumes a stagnant lid and whole mantle convection. The fertility of the mantle-defined as the potential to create basalt-and its variation with time are taken into account. The model is composed of core, mantle, and lithosphere, with two boundary layers separating them. The contributions to volcanism by pressure release melting (PRM), and by plumes from the core-mantle boundary layer, are compared and discussed. We show that such models tend to produce considerable melting during the early evolution of the planet, and that the amount of melting depends strongly on the abundances of radioactive elements. Although the model's assumptions may not be valid for the early evolution of the planet, the model is relevant to the later history, which is insensitive to initial conditions. We find that PRM volcanism should have ceased between 1 and 2.5 Byr ago and any recent volcanic activity must have originated in plumes. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - The Earth's 24-h planetary rotation, with predictable light and heat cycles, has driven profound evolutionary adaptation, with prominent impacts on physiological mechanisms important for surviving critical illness. Pathways of interest include inflammation, mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, hypoxic signaling, apoptosis, and defenses against reactive oxygen species. Regulation of these by the cellular circadian clock (BMAL-1 and its network) has an important influence on pulmonary inflammation; ventilator-associated lung injury; septic shock; brain injury, including vasospasm; and overall mortality in both animals and humans. Whether it is cytokines, the inflammasome, or mitochondrial biogenesis, circadian medicine represents exciting opportunities for translational therapy in intensive care, which is currently lacking. Circadian medicine also represents a link to metabolic determinants of outcome, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. More than ever, we are appreciating the problem of circadian desynchrony in intensive care. This review explores the rationale and evidence for the importance of the circadian clock in surviving critical illness.

AB  - Life on earth adapted to the daily reoccurring changes in environment by evolving an endogenous circadian clock. Although the circadian clock has a crucial impact on survival and behavior of solitary bees, many aspects of solitary bee clock mechanisms remain unknown. Our study is the first to show that the circadian clock governs emergence in Osmia bicornis, a bee species which overwinters as adult inside its cocoon. Therefore, its eclosion from the pupal case is separated by an interjacent diapause from its emergence in spring. We show that this bee species synchronizes its emergence to the morning. The daily rhythms of emergence are triggered by temperature cycles but not by light cycles. In contrast to this, the bee's daily rhythms in locomotion are synchronized by light cycles. Thus, we show that the circadian clock of O. bicornis is set by either temperature or light, depending on what activity is timed. Light is a valuable cue for setting the circadian clock when bees have left the nest. However, for pre-emerged bees, temperature is the most important cue, which may represent an evolutionary adaptation of the circadian system to the cavity-nesting life style of O. bicornis.

AB  - Hybrid zones are natural laboratories offering insights into speciation processes. Narrow hybrid zones are less common in the sea than on land consistent with higher dispersal among marine populations. Acanthochromis polyacanthus is an unusual bony marine fish with philopatric dispersal that exists as allopatric stocks of white, bicoloured and black fish on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). At two latitudes, different morphs coexist and hybridize at narrow contact zones. Sequence data from mitochondrial Hypervariable Region 1 revealed contrasting patterns of introgression across these zones. At the northern hybrid zone, a single clade of mitochondrial haplotypes was found in all white fish, hybrids and tens of kilometres into pure bicoloured stock. At the southern hybrid zone, there was no introgression of mitochondrial genes into black fish and hybrids shared the bicoloured haplotypes. Based on this asymmetry, we postulate that black fish from the southern GBR have experienced a selective sweep of their mitochondrial genome, which has resulted in almost total reproductive isolation.

AB  - We used laboratory experiments and field observations to explore overwintering in the northern cricket frog, Acris crepitans, in southern Ohio and Indiana. Cricket frogs died within 24 h when submerged in simulated pond water that was anoxic or hypoxic, but lived 8-10 days when the water was oxygenated initially. Habitat selection experiments indicated that cricket frogs prefer a soil substrate to water as temperature decreases from 8 to 2C. These data suggested that cricket frogs hibernate terrestrially. However, unlike sympatric hylids, this species does not tolerate extensive freezing: only 2 of 15 individuals survived freezing in the -0.8 to -2.6C range (duration 24-96 h). Cricket frogs supercooled when dry (mean supercooling point -5.5C; range from -4.3 to -6.8C), but were easily inoculated by external ice at temperatures between -0.5 and -0.8C. Our data suggested that cricket frogs hibernate terrestrially but are notfreeze tolerant, are not fossorial, and are incapable of supercooling in the presence of external ice. Thus we hypothesized that cricket frogs must hibernate in terrestrial sites that adequately protect against freezing. Indeed, midwinter surveys revealed cricket frogs hibernating in crayfish burrows and cracksof the pond bank, where wet soils buffered against extensive freezing of the soil.

AB  - Understanding the genetic basis underpinning local adaptation is one of the fundamental issues in ecological and evolutionary biology. In this study, we investigated the genomic basis underlying local adaptation of the Chinese wingnut (Pterocarya stenoptera C. DC). Our population genomic analyses revealed nine spatial genetic clusters across the current distribution range of this species. Based on the assessment of genetic-environment association, we found that adaptive divergence of the P. stenoptera populations were mainly shaped by solar radiation during fruit development, temperature seasonality, annual temperature, precipitation, and air humidity. In particular, our genome-wide scanning identified a total of 801 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are highly correlated with diverse environmental factors. Further functional annotation of the SNPs identified some candidate genes that are involved into temperature, water, and light adaptation. Taken together, our results suggest that natural selection during local adaptation has contributed to the success of survival to diverse heterogenous environmental conditions.

AB  - [1] Toward understanding of the subduction mass balance in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) convergent margin, we present an inventory of N and C concentrations and isotopic compositions in sediments obtained on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 129 and 185. Samples from Sites 1149, 800, 801, and 802 contain 5 to 661 ppm total N ( organic, inorganic combined) with delta(15)N(Air) of - 0.2 to + 8.2parts per thousand (all delta(15)N values <+ 2.5 parts per thousand from Site 800). At Site 1149, N content is higher in clay-rich layers and lower in chert and carbonate layers, and delta N-15 shows a distinct down-section decrease from 0 to 120 mbsf ( near + 8.0 at shallow levels to near + 4.0 parts per thousand). Reduced-C concentration ranges from 0.02 to 0.5 wt.%, with delta C-13(VPDB) of - 28.1 to - 21.7 parts per thousand. The down-section decreases in delta N-15 and N concentration ( and variations in concentrations and delta C-13 of reduced C, and C-reduced/N) at Site 1149 could help reconcile differences between delta N-15 values of modern deep-sea sediments from near the sediment-water interface and values for forearc metasedimentary rocks. At Site 1149, negative shifts in delta N-15, from marine organic values (up to similar to+ 8 parts per thousand) toward lower values approaching those for the metasedimentary rocks (+ 1 to + 3 parts per thousand), are most likely caused by complex diagenetic processes, conceivably with minor effects of changes in productivity and differing proportions of marine and terrestrial organic matter. However, the forearc metamorphic suites (e.g., Franciscan Complex) are known to have been deposited nearer continents, and their lower delta N-15 at least partly reflects larger proportions of lower-delta N-15 terrestrial organic matter. Subduction at the Izu-Bonin (IB) margin, of a sediment section like that at Site 1149, would deliver an approximate annual subduction flux of 2.5 x 10(6) g of N and 1.4 x 10(7) g of reduced C per linear kilometer of trench, with average delta N-15 of + 5.0 parts per thousand and delta C-13 of - 24 parts per thousand. Incorporating the larger C flux of 9.2 x 10(8) g/ yr/ linear-km in carbonate-rich layers of 1149B ( average delta C-13 = + 2.3 parts per thousand) provides a total C flux of 9.3 x 10(8) g/yr/linear-km (delta C-13 = + 1.9 parts per thousand). Once subducted, sediments are shifted to higher delta N-15 by N loss during devolatilization, with magnitudes of the shifts depending on the thermal evolution of the margin.

AB  - The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to adapt the changing ambient conditions, and protect themselves from stress-induced injuries. In the present study, the expression profiles of mRNA transcripts in the haemocytes of oysters under heat stress were examined to reveal the possible mechanism of heat stress response. There were 23,315, 23,904, 23,123 and 23,672 transcripts identified in the haemocytes of oysters cultured at 25 degrees C for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h (designed as B, H6, H12, H24), respectively. And 22,330 differentially expressed transcripts (DTs) were yielded in the pairwise comparisons between the above four samples, which corresponded to 8074 genes. There were 9,12 and 22 Gene Ontology (GO) terms identified in the DT pairwise comparison groups of H6_B, H12_H6 and H24_H12, respectively, and the richest GO terms in biological process category were cellular catabolic process, translational initiation and apoptotic process, respectively. There were 108, 102 and 102 KEGG pathways successfully retrieved from DTs comparison groups DTH6_B, DTH12_H6 and DTH24_H12, respectively, among which 93 pathways were shared by all three comparison groups, and most of them were related to metabolism of protein, carbohydrate and fat. The expression patterns of 12 representative heat stress response-relevant genes detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were similar to those obtained from transcriptome analysis. By flow cytometric analysis, the apoptosis rate of haemocytes increased significantly after oysters were treated at 25 degrees C for 24 h and recovered at 4 degrees C for 12 h (p < 0.05) and 36 h (p < 0.01), and it also increased significantly when the heat treatment lasted to 60 h (p < 0.01). The present results indicated that, when oysters encountered short term heat stress, the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, as well as unfolded protein response (UPR) and anti-apoptotic system, were firstly regulated to maintain basic life activities, and then a large number of genes involved in stabilizing protein conformation and facilitating further protein refolding were activated to repair the stress injury. However, the stress injury gradually became irreparable with the stress persisting, and apoptosis was activated when the heat treatment prolonged to 24 h. The information was useful to better understand the molecular mechanism of heat stress response and develop strategies for the improvement of oyster survival rate during summer high-temperature period.

AB  - Background: There are still a large variety of microorganisms among aquatic animals, especially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in cold water fishes at high latitudes have not been fully developed. Hence, the present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of cold-adapted Lactobacillus strains isolated from the intestinal tract of cold water fishes (Xinjiang) and select candidates to be used as new food preservative agents and/or probiotic additives in feeding of aquaculture.
   Results: A total of 43 Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from 16 kinds of intestinal tract of cold-water fishes. They were characterized by phenotypic methods, identified using Rep-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing as four species: Lactobacillus sakei (22 isolates), Lactobacillus plantarum (16 isolates), Lactobacillus casei (4 isolates) and Lactobacillus paracasei (1 isolate). The in vitro tests included survival in low pH and bile, antimicrobial activity (against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Listeria innocua), resistance to 15 antibiotics and hemolytic tests. Among all 43 lactobacilli isolates, the 22 isolates showed a wide range of antimicrobial activity against 6 different pathogenic strains. There were twenty isolates growing at optimal temperature ranging 16 similar to 20 degrees C, which were initially considered to be cold-adapted strains. Two (2) Lb. sakei strains and 2 Lb. plantarum strains demonstrated the highest survivability after 4 h of exposure at pH 2.0. Most of the tested strains cannot be cultured after exposed into 0.5% bile solution for 4 h, while 2 Lb. plantarum strains (E-HLM-3, CQ-CGC-2) and 1 Lb. sakei strain M-DGM-2 survived even at 2% bile concentration. In addition, the safety assessment showed that 22 strains without any detectable hemolytic activity and resistant to glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin), levofloxacin, aztreonam, amikacin and oxacillin, while all the studied lactobacilli showed sensitivity to or semi-tolerant to other antibiotics.
   Conclusions: Based on all the experiments, 3 strains, including E-HLM-3, CQ-CGC-2, and M-DGM-2 might be a candidate of choice for using in the food preservative agents and/or probiotic additives in feeding of aquaculture.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are associated with various plant, animal, and human niches and are also present in many fermented foods and beverages. Thus, they are subjected to several stress conditions and have developed advanced response mechanisms to resist, adapt, and grow. This work aimed to identify the genes involved in some stress adaptation mechanisms in LAB. For this purpose, global reverse genetics was applied by screening a library of 1287 Lactobacillus paracasei transposon mutants for mild monofactorial stresses. This library was submitted independently to heat (52 degrees C, 30 min), ethanol (170 g.L-1, 30 min), salt (NaCl 0.8 M, 24 h), acid (pH 4.5, 24 h), and oxidative (2 mM H2O2, 24 h) perturbations which trigger mild monofactorial stresses compatible with bacterial adaptation. Stress sensitivity of mutants was determined either by evaluating viability using propidium iodide (PI) staining, or by following growth inhibition through turbidity measurement. The screening for heat and ethanol stresses lead respectively to the identification of 63 and 27 genes/putative promoters whose disruption lead to an increased sensitivity. Among them, 14 genes or putative promoters were common for both stresses. For salt, acid and oxidative stresses, respectively 8, 6, and 9 genes or putative promoters were identified as essential for adaptation to these unfavorable conditions, with only three genes common to at least two stresses. Then, RT-qPCR was performed on selected stress response genes identified by mutant screenings in order to evaluate if their expression was modified in response to stresses in the parental strain. Eleven genes (membrane, transposase, chaperone, nucleotide and carbohydrate metabolism, and hypothetical protein genes) were upregulated during stress adaptation for at least two stresses. Seven genes, encoding membrane functions, were upregulated in response to a specific stress and thus could represent potential transcriptomic biomarkers. The results highlights that most of the genes identified by global reverse genetics are specifically required in response to one stress and that they are not differentially transcribed during stress in the parental strain. Most of these genes have not been characterized as stress response genes and provide new insights into the adaptation of lactic acid bacteria to their environment.

AB  - There are few biological indicators for freshwater systems subjected to high chloride levels. Freshwater systems receive many forms of chloride such as road salts (e.g., NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2), fertilizers (e.g., KCl), and year-round water softener pollution. The goal our study was to investigate Halomonadaceae populations as prospective biological indicators of chloride-impacted freshwaters. The bacterial family Halomonadaceae are halophiles that generally require the presence of salt to survive, which make them an attractive candidate in determining chloride impaired areas. Field sediment surveys assessed how salt tolerant and halophilic bacteria abundance corresponded to chloride and conductivity measuremen ts. Colony forming unit (CFU) counts on modified M9 6% NaCl plates (w/v) at urbanized sites compared to the rural sites had highest counts during winter and spring when chloride concentrations were also highest. Select isolates identified as Halomonadaceae through 16S rRNA sequencing were kept as active cultures to determine the NaCl concentration and temperature preference that resulted in the isolates optimal growth. Isolates tested under 5 'C (cold) grew optimally in 2 % NaCl (w/v), whereas under 18 degrees C (warm), isolates showed optimal growth at 6 % NaCl. The majority of isolates had maximum growth in the warmer temperature, however, select isolates grew better in the cold temperature. Culture-independent methods were used and identified Halomonadaceae were widespread and permeant members of the microbial community in a lake Michigan drainage basin. Quantitative polymerasc chain reaction (qPCR) targeting Halomonadaceae genera demonstrated that abundance varied by site, but overall were present throughout the year. I lowever, community sequencing revealed there were a large relative proportion of specific Halomonadaceae populations present in winter versus summer. Methods targeting salt tolerant bacteria and specific members of Halomonadaceae appears to be a promising approach to assess chloride-impacted areas to better understand the long-term ecological impacts as we continue to salinize freshwater resources.

AB  - Climate change and overfishing have led to the degradation of the quality and stock of Pampus echinogaster. Exploring the genetic structure and local adaptive evolutionary mechanisms of P. echinogaster is crucial for the management of this species. This population genomic study of nine geographical populations of P. echinogaster in China was conducted by specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). A total of 935,215 SLAF tags were obtained, and the average sequencing depth of the SLAF tags was 20.80x. After filtering, a total of 46,187 high-consistency genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected. Based on all SNPs, the population size of the nine P. echinogaster geographical populations was large. The Shantou population had the lowest genetic diversity, and the Tianjin population had the highest. Moreover, the population genetic structure based on all SNPs revealed significant gene exchange and no significant genetic differentiation among the nine P. echinogaster geographical populations, probably because of the population expansion after the last glacial period, the lack of balance between migration and genetic drift, and the long-distance diffusion of eggs and larvae. We suspect that variation of material metabolism, ion transfer, breeding, stress response, and inflammatory reactions-related genes were critical for adaptation to spatially heterogeneous temperature selection in natural P. echinogaster populations.

AB  - The release of captive-bred plants and animals has increased worldwide to augment declining species. However, insufficient attention has been given to understanding how neutral and adaptive genetic variation are partitioned within and among proximal natural populations, and the patterns and drivers of gene flow over small spatial scales, which can be important for restoration success. A seascape genomics approach was used to investigate population structure, local adaptation, and the extent to which environmental gradients influence genetic variation among natural and restored populations of Chesapeake Bay eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. We also investigated the impact of hatchery practices on neutral genetic diversity of restored reefs and quantified the broader genetic impacts of large-scale hatchery-based bivalve restoration. Restored reefs showed similar levels of diversity as natural reefs, and striking relationships were found between planting frequency and broodstock numbers and genetic diversity metrics (effective population size and relatedness), suggesting that hatchery practices can have a major impact on diversity. Despite long-term restoration activities, haphazard historical translocations, and high dispersal potential of larvae that could homogenize allele frequencies among populations, moderate neutral population genetic structure was uncovered. Moreover, environmental factors, namely salinity, pH, and temperature, play a major role in the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation. For marine invertebrates in heterogeneous seascapes, collecting broodstock from large populations experiencing similar environments to candidate sites may provide the most appropriate sources for restoration and ensure population resilience in the face of rapid environmental change. This is one of a few studies to demonstrate empirically that hatchery practices have a major impact on the retention of genetic diversity. Overall, these results contribute to the growing body of evidence for fine-scale genetic structure and local adaptation in broadcast-spawning marine species and provide novel information for the management of an important fisheries resource.

AB  - Climate change is rapidly altering the environment and many species will need to genetically adapt their seasonal timing to keep up with these changes. Insect development rate is largely influenced by temperature, but we know little about the mechanisms underlying the temperature sensitivity of development. Here, we investigate seasonal timing of egg hatching in the winter moth, one of the few species which has been found to genetically adapt to climate change, likely through selection on temperature sensitivity of egg development rate. To study when during development winter moth embryos are most sensitive to changes in ambient temperature, we gave eggs an increase or decrease in temperature at different moments during their development. We measured their developmental progression and time of egg hatching, and used fluorescence microscopy to construct a timeline of embryonic development for the winter moth. We found that egg development rate responded more strongly to temperature once embryos were in the fully extended germband stage. This is the phylotypic stage at which all insect embryos have developed a rudimentary nervous system. Furthermore, at this stage, timing of ecdysone signaling determines developmental progression, which could act as an environment dependent gateway. Intriguingly, this may suggest that, from the phylotypic stage onward, insect embryos can start to integrate internal and environmental stimuli to actively regulate important developmental processes. As we found evidence that there is genetic variation for temperature sensitivity of egg development rate in our study population, such regulation could be a target of selection imposed by climate change.

AB  - Rapidly changing environments may weaken sexual selection and lead to indiscriminate mating by interfering with the reception of mating signals or by increasing the costs associated with mate choice. If temperature alters sexual selection, it may impact population response and adaptation to climate change. Here, we examine how differences in temperature of the mating environment influence reproductive investment in the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis). Mate preference in this species is known to be related to pheromone usage, with assortative mating occurring between genetically distinct E and Z strains that differ in the composition of female and male pheromones. We compared egg production within and between corn borer lines derived from four different populations that vary in pheromone composition and other traits. Pairs of adults were placed in a mating environment that matched the pupal environment (ambient temperature) or at elevated temperature (5 degrees C above the pupal environment). At ambient temperature, we found that within-line pairs produced eggs sooner and produced more egg clusters than between-line pairs. However, at elevated temperature, between-line pairs produced the same number of egg clusters as within-line pairs. These results suggest that elevated temperature increased investment in matings with typically less preferred, between-line mates. This increased investment could result in changes in gene flow among corn borer populations in warming environments.

AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) is a highly invasive species widely distributed on the Spanish Mediterranean coast and the Balearic archipelago. Most studies involving this species in Spain have been focused on surveillance and control methods. However, micro-evolutionary studies for Ae. albopictus in Spain have been traditionally neglected. Morphological diversity could be the result of long-term evolutionary diversification in responses to selective pressures such as temperature, precipitation, food availability, predation, or competition that may influence flight activity, host-seeking, and blood-feeding behavior. Wing geometric morphometric have been used not only to study micro- and macro-evolution in mosquitoes but also in studies of population structuring and sexual dimorphism. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to investigate the wing shape patterns of Ae. albopictus populations to unveil sexual dimorphism that could provide information about their ecology and behavior. Mosquito eggs were collected using oviposition traps at the main campus of the University of the Balearic Islands (Palma de Mallorca, Spain) and reared under laboratory conditions. In order to study wing shape variation patterns in Ae. albopictus males and females, the left wing of each adult mosquito was removed and analyzed based on 18 landmarks. Our results indicated strong levels of sexual dimorphism between Ae. albopictus males and females. Furthermore, according to the cross-validated reclassification test, males were correctly distinguished from females with an accuracy of 84% and females from males 75%. We observed a significant sexual dimorphism in the wing shape patterns of Ae. albopictus when considering different seasonal patterns (spring vs. autumn). Our results suggested that selective pressures may affect males differently to females. Host-seeking, blood-feeding, and oviposition behavior of females may act as a major driver for wing shape sexual dimorphism. These results should be considered for the development of more effective and targeted mosquito control strategies.

AB  - Semielacher petiolatus (Girault) (Hymenoptera Eulophidae) is an ectoparasitoid of the citrus leaf miner Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) that has been widely released in several Mediterranean countries. In an attempt to evaluate the insects temperature adaptations that play a significant role in its establishment potential, life table parameters and the effect of temperature on its fecundity, longevity, host-instar choice, superparasitism and host feeding were studied. Tests were conducted at 20, 25 and 30 +/- 0.5 degrees C with 60 +/- 10% RH and a 14L:10D photoperiod. S. petiolatus oviposition period was 21.05 +/- 2.54 days at 30 degrees C but as short as 2.25 +/- 0.23 days at 20 degrees C. Fecundity had a maximum value (173.3 +/- 27.09) at 30 degrees C followed by 143.57 +/- 22.67 and 5.13 +/- 0.81 at 25 and 20 degrees C, respectively while, 28.57% of the females failed to oviposit at 20 degrees C. Female longevity averaged between 25.20 and 20.57 days at 30 and 25 degrees C, respectively but dropped to just 5.77 days at 20 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0) was highest (50.8) at 30 degrees C, and highly reduced (1.1) at 20 degrees C. Following the above pattern, mean generation time (T: 15.45 - 23.39), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m): 0.006 - 0.216) and finite rate of increase (lambda: 1.006 - 1.24) were maximum at 30 degrees C and minimum at 20 degrees C. Population-doubling time (DT) peaked to 106.94 days at 20 degrees C and was reduced to only 3.21 days at 30 degrees C. The host-choice tests showed that second and third instar larvae of P. citrella were equally selected at all temperatures. Superparasitism occurred at a rate of 5.79, 15.39 and 14.52% at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively and up to 6 eggs had been oviposited per host. Daily host feeding rates averaged 0.24, 0.41 and 0.31 hosts at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The above results indicate that S. petiolatus is much better adapted at higher temperatures typical for the Mediterranean climatic conditions during summer while its population increase is expected to be marginal at temperatures close to 20 degrees C. Overall, conservation tactics by maintaining a rich biodiversity in citrus groves for providing alternative food and shelter to the parasitoid, especially during spring before populations of P. citrella increase, should enhance its activity against early summer population of P. citrella in citrus orchards in Mediterranean countries.

AB  - Background Egg hatching in Meloidogyne incognita is a highly regulated developmental event and is strictly correlated with temperature. It has been demonstrated that exposure of M. incognita eggs to low temperature seriously affects their embryonic development. On the other hand, clear evidence has shown that M. incognita is able to overwinter at subzero soil temperatures in certain open fields. Therefore, subtle physiological and genetic adaptations may occur in M. incognita to minimize freezing injuries. Objective A growing body of evidence indicates that cold acclimation plays a large role in an individual organism's ability to cope with freezing-induced cellular damage. Given the decreasing temperatures in late autumn or early winter, we hypothesize that natural cold acclimation occurring during these periods may assist M. incognita in overwintering. Methods Transcriptomic analysis and functional enrichment analyses were used to identify and annotate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in acclimated eggs. The expression of DEGs involved in signal transduction and protein assembly was subsequently validated by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results Relatively long-term preacclimation at 4 degrees C significantly accelerated the hatching of M. incognita eggs that were subjected to freezing at - 1 degrees C. Using a transcriptomic approach, we further identified 686 and 460 up- and downregulated transcripts, respectively, in pre-cold-acclimated eggs. Additionally, we used Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology annotations for functional enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Conclusion The phenomenon in which M. incognita safely overwinters at subzero soil temperatures in certain areas may be attributed to the natural cold acclimation occurring in late autumn. Here, the identification of DEGs between acclimated and nonacclimated eggs will provide us with promising directions for future studies on the mechanisms of M. incognita freezing tolerance.
